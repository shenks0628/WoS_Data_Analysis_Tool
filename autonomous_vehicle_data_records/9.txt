AB Path planning is one of the most important problems in the development of autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs). In some common AUV missions, e.g., wreckage search for rescue, an AUV is often required to traverse multiple targets in a complex environment with dense obstacles. In such case, the AUV path planning problem becomes even more challenging. In order to address the problem, this paper develops a two-layer algorithm, namely ACO-A*, by combining the ant colony optimization (ACO) with the A* search. Once a mission with a set of arbitrary targets is assigned, ACO is responsible to determine the traveling order of targets. But, prior to ACO, a cost graph indicating the necessary traveling costs among targets must be quickly established to facilitate traveling order evaluation. For this purpose, a coarse-grained modeling with a representative-based estimation (RBE) strategy is proposed. Following the order obtained by ACO, targets will be traversed one by one and the pairwise path planning to reach each target can be performed during vehicle driving. To deal with the dense obstacles, A* is adopted to plan paths based on a fine-grained modeling and an admissible heuristic function is designed for A* to guarantee its optimality. Experiments on both synthetic and realistic scenarios have been designed to validate the efficiency of the proposed ACO-A*, as well as the effectiveness of RBE and the necessity of A*.

AB Sensor nodes in underwater sensor networks may acquire data at a higher rate than their ability to communicate over underwater acoustic channels. Autonomous underwater vehicles may mitigate this mismatch by offloading high volumes of data from the sensor nodes and ferrying them to the sink. Such a mode of data transfer results in high latency. Occasionally, these networks need to report high priority events such as catastrophes or intrusions. In such a scenario the expectation is to have a minimal end-to-end delay for event reporting. Considering this, underwater vehicles should schedule their visits to the sensor nodes in a manner that aids efficient reporting of high-priority events. We propose the use of the Value of Information metric in order to improve the reporting of events in an underwater sensor network. The proposed approach classifies the recorded data in terms of its value and priority. The classified data is transmitted using a combination of acoustic and optical channels. We perform experiments with a binary event model, i.e., we classify the events into high-priority and low-priority events. We explore a couple of different path planning strategies for the autonomous underwater vehicle. Our results show that scheduling visits to sensor nodes, based on algorithms that address the value of information, improves the timely reporting of high priority data and enables the accumulation of larger value of information.

AB Normally, autonomous vehicles (AVs) are limited to be widely used in market not only for technical factors, but also psychological reasons. Considering the psychological feelings of drivers during switching manned to unmanned operation modes, an algorithm for avoiding obstacles is designed for AVs by considering driver psychological feelings. A so-called confidence-limit-distance (denoted as CLD) for driver to avoid obstacle is experimentally obtained by a number of real track tests with 100 volunteer test drivers as required to approach the obstacle in a certain way. Based on Artificial Potential Field (APF) method, a road potential field is established accordingly to characterize the information on the real road. To express the different influences of obstacles on the driver's psychological feeling in both longitudinal and lateral directions, a confidence potential field also is established based on a two-dimensional normal distribution combining von Mises distribution. Hence, the second-order Taylor expansions of the road potential field and the confidence potential field are firstly introduced into the cost functions for model predictive control (MPC). The corresponding MPC algorithm used here selects front-wheel steering angle as the control variable to be solved. The CLD and range of sensed vehicle motion state variables are taken as the constraints of the MPC. Co-simulations and Hardware-in-the-Loop (HIL) tests are carried out, showing the effectiveness of designed algorithm, which can be useful in the development and design for Advanced Driving Assistant System (ADAS) and AVs.

AB Many driver assistance systems require knowledge of the vehicle environment. As these systems are increasing in complexity and performance, this knowledge of the environment needs to be more complete and reliable, so sensor fusion combining long, medium and short range sensors is now being used. This paper analyzes the feasibility of using ultrasonic sensors for low cost vehicle-positioning and tracking in the lane adjacent to the host vehicle in order to identify free areas around the vehicle and provide information to an automatic avoidance collision system that can perform autonomous braking and lane change manoeuvres. A laser scanner is used for the early detection of obstacles in the direction of travel while two ultrasonic sensors monitor the blind spot of the host vehicle. The results of tests on a test track demonstrate the ability of these sensors to accurately determine the kinematic variables of the obstacles encountered, despite a clear limitation in range.

AB With the development of artificial intelligence, the position of intelligent car in social life has become particularly important. The autonomous path of the smart car is divided into long distance and short distance. In order to improve the autonomous path planning ability of the smart car, we use WIFI to control the mobile end of the smart car, carry out autonomous tracking and autonomous obstacle avoidance in the short distance, and realize the optimization of the shortest path algorithm based on Dijkstra algorithm in the long distance. Based on the Raspberry Pi development board, the environment is installed and configured, the infrared sensor is used as the ranging device, and the optical code plate is used as the directional sensor of the car body bearing reckoning, and the motion control model of the smart car is established. The artificial potential field path planning method is used to realize the autonomous obstacle avoidance, optimal path searching and mobile terminal control of the intelligent car. The experimental results show that our design is efficient. And it has practical application value for fire truck path planning, remote control system, etc.

AB The trend of increasing traffic demand is causing congestion on existing urban roads, including urban motorways, resulting in a decrease in Level of Service (LoS) and safety, and an increase in fuel consumption. Lack of space and non-compliance with cities' sustainable urban plans prevent the expansion of new transport infrastructure in some urban areas. To alleviate the aforementioned problems, appropriate solutions come from the domain of Intelligent Transportation Systems by implementing traffic control services. Those services include Variable Speed Limit (VSL) and Ramp Metering (RM) for urban motorways. VSL reduces the speed of incoming vehicles to a bottleneck area, and RM limits the inflow through on-ramps. In addition, with the increasing development of Autonomous Vehicles (AVs) and Connected AVs (CAVs), new opportunities for traffic control are emerging. VSL and RM can reduce traffic congestion on urban motorways, especially so in the case of mixed traffic flows where AVs and CAVs can fully comply with the control system output. Currently, there is no existing overview of control algorithms and applications for VSL and RM in mixed traffic flows. Therefore, we present a comprehensive survey of VSL and RM control algorithms including the most recent reinforcement learning-based approaches. Best practices for mixed traffic flow control are summarized and new viewpoints and future research directions are presented, including an overview of the currently open research questions.

AB Drivers who assign the driving task to a self-driving car switch to a passive role to work or enjoy leisure time like a traditional passenger. Consequently, the risk of developing motion sickness (MS) symptoms increases significantly. Adapting one's own driving behavior, e.g. by choosing an alternative route or decreasing the velocity, offers future intelligent vehicles a way to independently prevent MS. Accurate predictions help to improve journey's planning of the vehicle and make correct decisions so as to minimize disruption to the traffic flow. In the present study our contribution is as follow: We conduct two studies by focusing on real-world driving under self-driving conditions and induced MS symptoms in passengers. We simulated driving parameters of the conducted studies to extract simulated driving dynamics and contrasted them with recorded driving dynamics. A well-known model of MS, namely the six-degrees-of-freedom subjective vertical conflict model (6DOF-SVC model) was utilized to predict motion sickness incidence (MSI) for both studies. In order to do so, we implemented a customized Human-Vehicle-Model to map the car's dynamics to the head, which is crucial to apply the 6DOF-SVC model. We evaluated different Human-Vehicle-Model conditions and optimized the parameters of the 6DOF-SVC model to increase prediction accuracy in the case of our experiments. Note that our modeling approach enabled capture effects of missing visual anticipation and cognitive distraction that we present in our experiment. It is concluded that the 6DOF-SVC model is applicable in realistic driving scenarios as the ones used in our study.

AB In real-world driving environments, a platoon of connected and autonomous vehicles (CAVs) will be subject to many disturbances (e.g., aerodynamic drag, dynamic road gradients) that can prevent them from achieving desired control accurately. These disturbances can cause uncertainties in the vehicle dynamics, reducing platoon safety and mobility. To address this problem, this study proposes a robust cooperative control (RCC) strategy, developed as a minimax problem, to ensure the safe and efficient maneuvering of a CAV platoon in the worst-case situation due to uncertainties in the vehicle dynamics. The maximization subproblem of the minimax problem determines the inputs of the uncertainties to maximize the cost function (i.e., the platoon performance indicator), while the minimization subproblem seeks to optimize the control decisions for all following vehicles in the platoon to minimize the cost function using inputs of the uncertainties from the maximization subproblem. A novel partition-based method of feasible direction is proposed to solve the minimax problem. It is globally convergent and computationally efficient, enabling the RCC strategy to be deployed in real time. The conditions for robust stability of the CAV platoon are also analyzed. Results from numerical studies show that compared to a control strategy that ignores uncertainties in vehicle dynamics, the RCC strategy can substantially improve the platoon performance under disturbances. Hence, it can be used to enable the safe and efficient maneuvering of CAV platoons in a real-world driving environment.

ID LOCALIZATION; SYSTEM
AB Autonomous Underwater Vehicles (AUVs) employed for inspection and monitoring applications require a reliable estimate of their navigation status to successfully accomplish the scheduled mission. Considering that they are typically endowed with vision systems to collect images of the surveyed environment, approaches based on Visual Odometry (VO) allow to utilise the optical payload also to perform robot navigation. Despite a large body of prior research, the topic of navigation based on stereo vision is still an open problem in the marine domain. Within this context, this paper proposes an underwater navigation framework utilising a stereo camera as a linear velocity sensor. The purpose is to assess the potentiality of a stereo vision system to indirectly measure the linear velocity of an AUV, and provide this information to the navigation framework of the vehicle. The proposed strategy consists in a visual inertial odometry solution fusing linear velocity estimates, derived from optical information, with attitude and depth measurements to retrieve the robot navigation status. Such linear velocity estimates are computed exploiting a stereo VO algorithm, relying on a 3D-to-2D approach, whose source code is made available online. The developed strategy is evaluated on real underwater datasets acquired during monitoring surveys performed by an AUV equipped with Doppler Velocity Log (DVL), bottom-looking stereo camera, inertial unit, and depth sensor. The results, obtained through a comparison with the DVL taken as benchmark, confirm the approach as feasible and exploitable in underwater inspection and monitoring contexts.

AB In this study, we aim to solve the shared autonomous vehicle (SAV) routing problem under the effects of congestion in the road network. The SAV routing problem is the problem of finding an optimal SAV-traveler assignment as well as the SAV route choice. Since widespread use of SAVs would cause significant congestion of road networks, it is essential to consider the effects of traffic congestion on SAV route choice. We develop a tabu search (TS) heuristic to solve for SAV routing problem. The heuristic aims to minimize the total person travel time experienced by travelers by exploring the solution space using a swap procedure. The total person travel time is defined as the total time spent by all travelers entering the network in an SAV trip. A Nearest Traveler Neighborhood is defined to choose candidate travelers to consider for the swap procedure. An agent based simulation of the traffic network is used to determine the experienced travel times for each solution from the TS heuristic. The Sioux Falls network is used to test the performance of TS for various demand and fleet sizes. A series of experiments are performed to understand the sensitivity of the heuristic to its parameters and the congestion in the road network. The heuristic is found to produce encouraging results in reducing the total person travel time for differing fleet sizes and demand levels.

AB The principal objective of this research is to provide a framework that captures the main software architecture elements for developing highly customised simulation tools that support the effective integration of Intelligent Autonomous Vehicles (IAVs) in sustainable supply networks, as an emerging field in the operations management agenda. To that end, the study's contribution is fourfold including: (i) a review of software simulation tools and platforms used in assessing the performance of IAVs interlinked with sustainability ramifications in supply chain (SC) ecosystems, (ii) an integrated software framework for monitoring and assessing the sustainability performance of SCs defined by the utilisation of innovative IAVs in operations, (iii) a translation of the proposed SC framework into a corresponding software application through a robust five-stage stepwise process, and (iv) a demonstration of the developed software tool through its application on the case of an IAV system operating in a customisable warehouse model. Our analysis highlights the flexibility resulting from a decentralised software management architecture, thus enabling the dynamic reconfiguration of a SC network. In addition, the developed pilot simulation tool can assist operations managers in capturing the operational needs of facilities and assessing the performance of IAV systems while considering sustainability parameters.

AB This article addresses the fault detection and isolation problem of uncertain systems using the bond graph model-based approach. The latter provides through its causal and structural properties an automatic analytical redundancy relations generation. The numerical evaluation of analytical redundancy relations yields residuals, which are used to verify the coherence between the real system and reference behaviors describing the nominal operation. In fact, the residual is compared to its thresholds to detect the fault. In addition, the comparison between all fault signatures allows making a decision on fault isolation. Moreover, to isolate the faults that activate the same set of residuals, an additional residual must be calculated for each fault. This additional residual is the comparison between two estimations of the considered fault obtained using the sensitivity relations. However, due to the presence of uncertainties, errors can occur in the fault estimation allowing false decisions on fault isolation. The novelties and innovative interests in the present work are (1) to improve the fault estimation procedure based on the uncertainties modeling and bicausality notion, in order to overcome the problem related to errors in the estimated fault and (2) to suitably generate the isolation thresholds in a systematic way using the uncertain fault estimation procedure proposed in this article so that fault can be isolated successfully. The proposed methodology is studied under various scenarios via simulations over an electromechanical traction system corresponding to a quarter of intelligent autonomous vehicle, named RobuCar.

AB In this paper, we investigate new implementable cooperative adaptive backstepping controllers for a group of underactuated autonomous vehicles that are communicating with their local neighbours to track a time-varying virtual leader of which the relative position may only be available to a portion of the team members. At the kinematic cooperative control level of the autonomous underwater vehicle, the virtual cooperative controller is basically designed on a proportional and derivative consensus algorithm presented in Ren (2010), which involves velocity information from local neighbours. In this paper, we propose a new design algorithm based on singular perturbation theory that precludes the use of the neighbours' velocity information in the cooperative design. At the dynamic cooperative control level, calculation of the partial derivatives of some stabilising functions which in turn will contain velocity information from the local neighbours is required. To facilitate the implementation of the cooperative controllers, we propose a command filter approach technique to avoid analytic differentiation of the virtual cooperative control laws. We show how Lyapunov-based techniques and graph theory can be combined together to yield a robust cooperative controller where the uncertain dynamics of the cooperating vehicles and the constraints on the communication topology which contains a directed spanning tree are explicitly taken into account. Simulation results with a dynamic model of underactuated autonomous underwater vehicles moving on the horizontal plane are presented and discussed.

AB Connected and automated vehicles (CAV) are marketed for their increased safety, driving comfort, and time saving potential. With much easier access to information, increased processing power, and precision control, they also offer unprecedented opportunities for energy efficient driving. This paper is an attempt to highlight the energy saving potential of connected and automated vehicles based on first principles of motion, optimal control theory, and a review of the vast but scattered eco-driving literature. We explain that connectivity to other vehicles and infrastructure allows better anticipation of upcoming events, such as hills, curves, slow traffic, state of traffic signals, and movement of neighboring vehicles. Automation allows vehicles to adjust their motion more precisely in anticipation of upcoming events, and save energy. Opportunities for cooperative driving could further increase energy efficiency of a group of vehicles by allowing them to move in a coordinated manner. Energy efficient motion of connected and automated vehicles could have a harmonizing effect on mixed traffic, leading to additional energy savings for neighboring vehicles.

AB Autonomous and unmanned shipping are currently trending research topics within the maritime sector, with the promise of a reduction in operating costs and an increase in safety. Although they bring higher investment costs, due to the long lifetime of ships, autonomous ships are expected to bring savings during ship exploitation. This paper aims to analyze capital and operating costs of five different sizes and route length container ships (conventional ships), and under a set of assumptions analyze the same costs for equivalent autonomous ships. A ship cost model is formed, where the typical cost scheme (investment and exploitation costs) is extended by the potential carbon pricing. Carbon pricing is taken into account due to the fact that the design procedure for autonomous and unmanned ships requires the employment of a next-generation regulatory framework. All results indicate the significant economic benefit of autonomous ships over conventional ones. Sensitivity analysis reveals that fuel and emission costs have a great influence on the overall profitability of autonomous vehicles. Although the literature review indicates that reduced operating costs due to crew removal will bring savings for autonomous shipping, results show that savings due reduced operating costs is minor.

AB A lightweight, small size walking robot currently being developed at the Universite Libre de Bruxelles as a conceptual vehicle for planetary exploration is described. The robot consists of three articulated bodies connected by universal joints. Each body has two legs with two degrees of freedom each. Each universal joint is provided with two actuators and torque sensors; a compliant behaviour is achieved by force feedback. This particular device improves considerably the agility of the walking vehicle by allowing the central body to follow the ground profile. Furthermore, the vehicle can walk on both sides and can recover from roll-over thanks to the actuated universal joints which allow an autonomous transfer from back to belly.

AB Detecting and recognizing different kinds of urban objects is an important problem, in particular, in autonomous driving. In this context, we studied the potential of Mueller matrix polarimetry for classifying a set of relevant real-world objects: vehicles, pedestrians, traffic signs, pavements, vegetation and tree trunks. We created a database with their experimental Mueller matrices measured at 1550 nm and trained two machine learning classifiers, support vector machine and artificial neural network, to classify new samples. The overall accuracy of over 95% achieved with this approach, with either models, reveals the potential of polarimetry, specially combined with other remote sensing techniques, to enhance object recognition.

AB This paper reports a real-time approach for backing-up car control, in which an image sensor and a fuzzy logic controller are utilized. In the system, a CCD camera is employed as an image sensor for detecting motions of a backing-up car. The fuzzy logic controller receives the motion information from the image sensor, and then generates the steering signal of the car to complete a closed-loop control system of backing-up an autonomous vehicle. The MATLAB/Simulink are installed in a PC to execute the control action through a model car, driven by two electric motors. Both simulations and experimental results are presented to verify the feasibility of the proposed method.

AB Due to the gap between calculation-intensive and latency-sensitive features of self-driving tasks and the vehicle's limited computation and storage resources, the development of autonomous vehicles is situated in a bottleneck. Fortunately, multi-access edge computing (MEC) architecture offers a promising measure to bridge this gap. It brings resources proximity to mobile devices at the network edge to support task offloading. Nonetheless, it introduces the problem of insecure wireless communication. Beyond that, the autonomous vehicle also has strict requirements on latency and energy consumption of task offloading technique owing to its safety-related and electricity-driven characteristics. Many scholars have studied the related problems widely. Nevertheless, few papers combine these three significant factors, namely information security, task latency and energy consumption. Thus, we put forward a mobility-ware task offloading scheme in cellular vehicle-to-everything system, which carefully considers these three requirements together. In this scheme, a time approximation algorithm is proposed to tackle the channel condition variations caused by the vehicle movement. Small-cell base station proactively sends artificial noise to debase wiretapper decoding capability and further prevent data exchanged between vehicles and MEC from being eavesdropped at the physical layer. Moreover, the optimal offloading proportion is found to minimize the weighted sum of latency and energy consumption. Experimental performances validate the effectiveness and feasibility of the proposed task offloading scheme.

AB Autonomous vehicles require high-level semantic maps, which contain the activities of pedestrians and cars, to ensure safe navigation. High-level semantics can be obtained from mobile probe sensor data. Analyzing pedestrian trajectories obtained from mobile probe data is an effective approach to avoid collisions between autonomous vehicles and pedestrians. Such analyses of pedestrian trajectories can generate new information such as pedestrian behaviors in violation of traffic regulations. However, pedestrian trajectories obtained from mobile probe data significantly sparse and noisy, making it challenging to analyze pedestrian activity. To address this issue, we propose multiple daily data and graph-based approaches to treat sparse and noisy data for estimating the flow of pedestrians based on mobile probe data. To improve the sparseness of the data, multiple daily data are fused. After that, a pedestrian graph is created to enhance the region's coverage by connecting the sparse data indicating the flow of pedestrians. This proposed approach successfully obtained pedestrian trajectory data from the sparse and noisy data. Moreover, it was possible to identify the potential locations where pedestrians tend to cross the street by analyzing the pedestrian flow. The results indicate that 83% of well-known regions where pedestrians tend to cross the street corresponded with those extracted using the proposed approach. Furthermore, a high-level semantic map of the regions where pedestrians tend to cross the street along a 1-km road is presented. The trajectory information obtained using the proposed approach is expected to be essential for understanding different scenarios of the interactions between individuals and autonomous vehicles.

AB We present an algorithm for risk prediction of road surface grip where skidding and sliding occur as main road surface problems. Prediction is done by defining a fine texture classification of the properties of road aggregate. In an experimental setup, data acquisition is performed with a supervised mobile vehicle scanning system, using a vehicle equipped with a camera and temperature sensor during movement along an arterial road. Image processing is performed by testing four texture feature extraction methods: Gabor filters, wavelet transform, gray level co-occurence matrix, and edge histogram descriptor, among which the Gabor transform shows the best results. The extraction of texture feature vectors follows by statistical algorithms for measuring feature vector similarity and reference vector selection, leading to image texture classification. The algorithm itself is upgraded by incorporating simultaneous surface temperature measurements in order to create and validate the final fine surface texture classification. The roads are classified and segmented into high-, medium-, and low-risk roads according to skid danger, enabling the creation of a map of high- risk zones. We validate our risk prediction algorithm by referring to crash rate data from the Road Traffic Safety Agency of Serbia database. This algorithm enables the location and mapping of high- risk zones and can be used as a support for autonomous driving and navigation. (C) The Authors.

AB This paper describes an on-board vision sensor system that is developed specifically for small unmanned vehicle applications. For small vehicles, vision sensors have many advantages, including size, weight, and power consumption, over other sensors such as radar, sonar, and laser range finder, etc. A vision sensor is also uniquely suited for tasks such as target tracking and recognition that require visual information processing. However, it is difficult to meet the computing needs of real-time vision processing on a small robot. In this paper, we present the development of a field programmable gate array-based vision sensor and use a small ground vehicle to demonstrate that this vision sensor is able to detect and track features on a user-selected target from frame to frame and steer the small autonomous vehicle towards it. The sensor system utilizes hardware implementations of the rank transform for filtering, a Harris corner detector for feature detection, and a correlation algorithm for feature matching and tracking. With additional capabilities supported in software, the operational system communicates wirelessly with a base station, receiving commands, providing visual feedback to the user and allowing user input such as specifying targets to track. Since this vision sensor system uses reconfigurable hardware, other vision algorithms such as stereo vision and motion analysis can be implemented to reconfigure the system for other real-time vision applications.

AB In this article, the hydrodynamic characteristics of Autonomous Underwater Vehicles (AUVs) are investigated and analyzed under the influence of rotating flow fields, which were generated in a recirculating water tank via a rotating propeller. Initially, experiments were carried out to measure flow field variables and quantities of Interest across the AUV in the presence of the rotating propeller while varying the rotational speed and the extent of rotational flow strength. The flow field across the AUV was measured using an Acoustic Doppler Velocimeter (ADV). These measured turbulent flow statistics were used to validate the Reynolds Stress Model (RSM) based numerical predictions in a commercial CFD solver. After preliminary validation of the turbulent flow statistics with the numerical predictions, a series of numerical simulations were performed to investigate the effect of the rotational flow field of the propeller on the drag, skin friction, and pressure coefficients of the AUV. The operating speed and location of the propeller were also varied to check their effects on the hydrodynamic performance of the AUV. The results provided in this article will be useful for the design optimization of AUVs cruising in shallow water where the flow is highly rotational because of wave-current interactions. Additionally, the results and analysis are relevant to study the design and operation of AUVs that have to operate in a group of unmanned underwater vehicles or near submarines and ships where the flow field is highly complex and such rotational effects are present.

AB Transportation in controlled industrial sites provides a conducive environment for technologies of Connected Automated Vehicles (CAV). Recent studies show that safe and efficient road sharing between CAVs and pedestrians is challenging. Besides safety issues, a significant loss of time occurs when pedestrians cross a stream of CAVs. Currently, many techniques have been employed to improve the coordination between CAVs and pedestrians. They focus on pedestrian detection, display of the intention of CAVs, and cooperative collision avoidance. However, one of the most significant sources of information that the pedestrian uses for her/his decision-making is the speed profile of CAVs. This paper aims to provide a safe and efficient pedestrian crossing at industrial sites through communicative crossing behavior. To this end, a suitable speed profile of the CAV is designed by assuming that pedestrians and CAV play a cooperative game to move as close as possible to their desired speed. First, a system analysis is proposed to derive the optimal decision and trajectory for each agent. Then, Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) is used to control the longitudinal speed of the CAVs. Compared with Model Predictive Control approach, DRL allows coping with unforeseeable pedestrian behaviors (e.g. long reaction time, varying ideal speed, stop in the middle, etc.). Simulations and experiments with real human testers based on immersive hamlet are performed. Results show that the proposed speed profile outperforms significantly the collision avoidance approach.

AB Collision risk modeling with multiple surrounding target vehicles (TVs) is essential for host vehicle (HV) trajectory planning, especially considering challenging TV lateral behaviors. Existing motion-compensated spatial methods ignore TV lateral motion states such as lateral velocity and yaw rate, so that TV lateral behavior cannot be described accurately. Aiming at high-accuracy collision risk modeling, a twisted Gaussian risk model using both longitudinal and lateral motion states for TV behavior description is proposed. Firstly, the HV-TVs system is treated as the superposition of multiple HV-TV units, and a Gaussian risk model is adopted for the collision risk description of the HV-TV unit. Then, by expanding the variances, TV longitudinal and lateral velocities are considered. At last, a twisted Gaussian risk model considering TV yaw rate is constructed based on the projection of the Gaussian risk model. With this twisted Gaussian risk model, TV longitudinal-lateral motion states are considered simultaneously, and TV behaviors can be described for HV-TVs collision risk modeling. For HV trajectory planning, trajectory candidates generated by the maneuver-inspired method are evaluated via the proposed risk model, and the safe and efficient trajectory is selected. Simulation and hardware-in-the-loop experimental results show that the proposed method considering TV longitudinal-lateral motion states allows HV to operate more safely and efficiently than the conventional method.

AB This paper presents novel computer algorithms, a system architecture, and the prototype implementation of a vision-based automatic vehicle location system. The objective of the vehicle location system is to keep track of the vehicle location for a human driver, and perhaps to provide the driver with real-time audio directions to his destination. The techniques developed here are equally applicable to autonomous robot navigation. The prototype system uses odometer readings and a skeleton map to perform dead reckoning, and uses low-bandwidth visual information and neural networks to recognize places for correcting cumulative dead reckoning errors. The visual information is also used to detect turns, for dead reckoning at intersections. The system is self-contained in the sense that it requires no infrastructure outside the vehicle, such as external beacons installed on roadways or satellites used by Global Positioning Systems (GPS). The system maintains a large number of location hypotheses and searches for a large number of landmarks stored in a database in real time. Hence the system is robustly able to recover the vehicle location after being lost for various reasons. The system has been tested, with success, in both day and night time, in all four seasons, and on roads in New York City, a regional highway, and on suburban streets. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science B.V.

AB The potential effects of autonomous vehicles (AVs) on greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions are uncertain, although numerous studies have been conducted to evaluate the impact. This paper aims to synthesize and review all the literature regarding the topic in a systematic manner to eliminate the bias and provide an overall insight, while incorporating some statistical analysis to provide an interval estimate of these studies. This paper addressed the effect of the positive and negative impacts reported in the literature in two categories of AVs: partial automation and full automation. The positive impacts represented in AVs' possibility to reduce GHG emission can be attributed to some factors, including eco-driving, eco traffic signal, platooning, and less hunting for parking. The increase in vehicle mile travel (VMT) due to (i) modal shift to AVs by captive passengers, including elderly and disabled people and (ii) easier travel compared to other modes will contribute to raising the GHG emissions. The result shows that eco-driving and platooning have the most significant contribution to reducing GHG emissions by 35%. On the other side, easier travel and faster travel significantly contribute to the increase of GHG emissions by 41.24%. Study findings reveal that the positive emission changes may not be realized at a lower AV penetration rate, where the maximum emission reduction might take place within 60-80% of AV penetration into the network.

AB Limited sensing capability is one of features of onboard vision sensors. This paper addresses the formation tracking control problem for multiple nonholonomic autonomous vehicles with modeling uncertainties under limited sensing capabilities. Within the leader-follower formation control framework, the desired formation geometry of the vehicular team can be achieved by controlling the relative distance and angle between each pair of leader-follower vehicles. Each vehicle in the group is equipped with limited field-of-view onboard vision sensors to measure only the relative distance and angle with respect to its leader. For this scenario, each vehicle must remain within the visibility region relative to the leader in order to maintain the connectivity of the multi-vehicle system over time, while avoiding the possible collision with its leader. By incorporating the prescribed performance control methodology into the formation control design, the boundedness of the closed-loop system signals as well as the predefined performance indexes are achieved, where the neural networks (NNs) are employed to compensate for the uncertain dynamics. Visibility maintenance and collision avoidance between the leaders and followers are also proven mathematically. The proposed control strategy is decentralized in the sense that each vehicle uses only local relative information with respect to its leader to calculate its own control signals, as well as robust with respect to modeling uncertainties. Simulations and experiments on Pioneer-3AT robots are conducted to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed control strategy. (C) 2021 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Existing autonomous driving systems of intelligent vehicles such as advanced driver assistant systems (ADAS) assess and quantify the level of potential safety threats. However, they may not be able to plan the best response to unexpected dangerous situations and do not have the ability to cope with uncertainties since not all vehicles can always keep a safe gap from preceding vehicles and drive at a desired velocity. Previous research has not taken such uncertainties into account, it is, therefore, necessary to develop models which are not restricted by the predefined movement patterns of a vehicle. Existing systems are based on a model that estimates the threat level based only on one factor Time-To-Collision (TTC). This approach is limited since it cannot handle all scenarios and ignores all uncertainties. To overcome these limitations, this paper utilised deep learning to develop a range of models that rely on a group of factors to reliably estimate the threat level and predict conflicts under uncertainty using the concept of looming '. Comparative analyses were undertaken by incorporating new varying input factors to each model (e.g., surrogate safety measures, vehicle kinematics, macroscopic traffic data). Real-world experiments demonstrated that adding new factors increases the reliability and sensitivity of the models. Results also indicated that the models that consider looming provide low false alarm rate extending their applications for a wider spectrum of traffic scenarios. This is paramount for ADAS as uncertainties are inherent in the deployment of connected and autonomous vehicles in a mixed traffic stream.

ID CAR-FOLLOWING MODEL; NEURAL-NETWORK
AB The advent of connected and autonomous vehicles (CAVs) will change driving behavior and travel environment, and provide opportunities for safer, smoother, and smarter road transportation. During the transition from the current human-driven vehicles (HDVs) to a fully CAV traffic environment, the road traffic will consist of a "mixed" traffic flow of HDVs and CAVs. Equipped with multiple sensors and vehicle-to-vehicle communications, a CAV can track surrounding HDVs and receive trajectory data of other CAVs in communication range. These trajectory data can be leveraged with recent advances in deep learning methods to potentially predict the trajectories of a target HDV. Based on these predictions, CAVs can react to circumvent or mitigate traffic flow oscillations and accidents. This study develops attention-based long short-term memory (LSTM) models for HDV longitudinal trajectory prediction in a mixed flow environment. The model and a few other LSTM variants are tested on the Next Generation Simulation US 101 dataset with different CAV market penetration rates (MPRs). Results illustrate that LSTM models that utilize historical trajectories from surrounding CAVs perform much better than those that ignore information even when the MPR is as low as 0.2. The attention-based LSTM models can provide more accurate multi-step longitudinal trajectory predictions. Further, grid-level average attention weight analysis is conducted and the CAVs with higher impact on the target HDV's future trajectories are identified.

AB This paper presents a new pathway towards the public health resilience, through the develop-ment of a principled understating on the post-hazard emergency transfer of the injured popula-tion across densely-populated urban communities, considering the deployment of connected and autonomous vehicles (CAVs). Given the influence on the system resilience of several parameters such as the number and distribution of CAVs, the initial geographic distribution of the injured and the spatiotemporal evolution of the functionality of the integrated hospital-road networks, a multi agent-based modelling (ABM) framework has been established to identify relevant patterns and bottlenecks in injured transfers across hazard-impacted urban communities. In such an ABM framework, each individual vehicle, transferring an injured inhabitant, is modelled as an inde-pendent agent, whose traveling is shaped by pre-defined behavioral attributes, while the inter-play among those agents is also considered, throughout the entire transfer campaign. Based on a hypothetically catastrophic earthquake scenario, such an ABM framework is employed to model the city-scale, post-shock transfer across Tangshan city, located in one of the most earthquake -prone regions of China. The simulation outcome reveals that the information sharing with regard to the real-time functionality of the local hospital system plays a strategically crucial role, to the avoidance of uncoordinated and prolonged transfers. Furthermore, owing to their capability of intelligent route planning, the participation of CAVs can substantially bolster the rapidity and ef-fectiveness of post-shock transfer campaigns.

AB Multi-modal sensor fusion techniques have promoted the development of autonomous driving, while perception in the complex environment remains a challenging problem. In order to tackle the problem, we propose the Open Multi-modal Perception dataset (OpenMPD), a multi-modal perception benchmark objected at difficult examples. Compared with existing datasets, OpenMPD focuses more on those complex traffic scenes in urban areas with overexposure or darkness, crowded environment, unstructured roads and intersections. It acquires the multi-modal data through a vehicle with six cameras and four LiDAR for a 360-degree field of view and collected 180 clips of 20-second synchronized images at 20 Hz and point clouds at 10 Hz. Particularly, we applied a 128-beam LiDAR to provide Hi-Res point clouds to better understand the 3D environment and sensor fusion. We sampled 15 K keyframes at equal intervals from clips for annotations, including 2D/3D object detections, 3D object tracking, and 2D semantic segmentation. Moreover, we provide four benchmarks for all tasks to evaluate algorithms and conduct extensive experiments of 2D/3D detection and segmentation on OpenMPD. Data and further information are available at http://www.openmpd.com/.

AB We in this paper investigate navigation strategies of two cross-moving connected and autonomous vehicles (CAVs) at an unsignalised intersection. As highly intelligent and automated entities, CAVs could make decisions independently or behave in a cooperative manner. A Nash game with discrete decision strategy is formulated to characterize the non-cooperative behaviour and a cooperative game is formulated to model the cooperative control mechanism. Results show that (i) pure-strategy Nash equilibria (NEs) for the non-cooperative game always exist and NEs hold if and only if at least one CAV takes its dominant strategy; (ii) more than two pure-strategy NE solutions may exist, but at most two different payoffs could arrive for each player at pure-strategy NEs; (iii) the optimal solution to the cooperative game must be in the NE solution set. These interesting findings provide useful managerial insights to CAV operators and transport authorities, and also enable us to tailor a branch & bound (B&B) algorithm to efficiently solve the models. We also extend the proposed methodology to the n-player case ( n >= 3 ) and give some more generalized insights. Numerical experiments are demonstrated in the end to test the computational accuracy and efficiency of the B&B method and show that our models and algorithm can be readily incorporated into future real-time CAV decision system to help navigate through unsignalised intersections.

AB Considering that human-driven vehicles and autonomous vehicles (AVs) will coexist on roads in the future for a long time, how to merge AVs into human drivers' traffic ecology and minimize the effect of AVs and their misfit with human drivers, are issues worthy of consideration. Moreover, different passengers have different needs for AVs, thus, how to provide personalized choices for different passengers is another issue for AVs. Therefore, a human-like decision making framework is designed for AVs in this paper. Different driving styles and social interaction characteristics are formulated for AVs regarding driving safety, ride comfort and travel efficiency, which are considered in the modeling process of decision making. Then, Nash equilibrium and Stackelberg game theory are applied to the noncooperative decision making. In addition, potential field method and model predictive control (MPC) are combined to deal with the motion prediction and planning for AVs, which provides predicted motion information for the decision-making module. Finally, two typical testing scenarios of lane change, i.e., merging and overtaking, are carried out to evaluate the feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed decision-making framework considering different human-like behaviors. Testing results indicate that both the two game theoretic approaches can provide reasonable human-like decision making for AVs. Compared with the Nash equilibrium approach, under the normal driving style, the cost value of decision making using the Stackelberg game theoretic approach is reduced by over 20%.

AB The aim of this research is to investigate whether visual feedback alone can affect a driver's trust in an autonomous vehicle, and in particular, what level of feedback (no feedback vs. moderate feedback vs. high feedback) will evoke the appropriate level of trust. Before conducting the experiment, the Human Machine Interfaces (HMI) were piloted with two sets of six participants (before and after iterations), to ensure the meaning of the displays can be understood by all. A static driving simulator experiment was conducted with a sample of 30 participants (between 18 and 55). Participants completed two pre-study questionnaires to evaluate previous driving experience, and attitude to trust in automation. During the study, participants completed a trust questionnaire after each simulated scenario to assess their trust level in the autonomous vehicle and HMI displays, and on intention to use and acceptance. The participants were shown 10 different driving scenarios that lasted approximately 2 minutes each. Results indicated that the 'high visual feedback' group recorded the highest trust ratings, with this difference significantly higher than for the `no visual feedback' group (U = .000; p = <0.001 < alpha) and the `moderate visual feedback' group (U = .000; p = <0.001 < alpha). There is an upward inclination of trust in all groups due to familiarity to both the interfaces and driving simulator over time. Participants' trust level was also influenced by the driving scenario, with trust reducing in all displays during safety verses non-safety-critical situations.

AB As the technology matures, fully autonomous vehicles (AVs) are on the corner. This calls for exploring the factors that might influence potential users' perception and acceptance of AVs. Limited existing studies related to acceptance modeling investigated the effects of media and human on fully AVs' beliefs. Hence, a media-based perception and adoption model (MPAM) is developed to investigate how information and opinion (from mass media and social media) affect human self-perception (including self-efficacy and subjective norms) and product value perception (including perceived usefulness and risks), which in turn drive users' adoption intention to private AVs and public AVs as well. Through a questionnaire survey, 355 samples from two universities were collected in Beijing. The structural equation model results confirm that media channels have salient effects on consumer and product with different emphases. Mass media enhances potential users' self-efficacy of fully AVs, while social media strengthens subjective norms. Both usefulness and risks of AVs are perceived simultaneously via mass media, whereas risks perception can be significantly eliminated by social media. All constructs of user's self-perception and product perception are verified to drive users' intention to using AVs and public AVs. Besides the theoretical and modeling contributions, practical implications are provided for the marketers and stakeholders in the early stages of AVs launch. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd.

AB The Internet of Vehicles (IoV) is an active area for innovation and an essential tool in achieving smart cities through the integration of vehicles with the Internet of Things (IoT). IoV is a distributed network that aids in handling the data generated by vehicular sensors and vehicle-to-everything communication (V2X), thus enabling novel applications such as autonomous driving and platooning while increasing safety and energy efficiency. In IoV, the sensors and the interdependent devices relay critical information for the efficient implementation of real-time applications in the ecosystem. Despite all these advancements, a vital challenge is establishing smooth communication among interconnected devices, concretely, interoperability in the IoV-a deceptively simple notion that is not yet fully addressed to achieve a fully integrated ecosystem. This is mainly because the networked domains, such as home, grid, and health care, are developed in silos, operating independently with diverse processes and protocols. Hence, seamless exchange of information is yet to be achieved across the ecosystem, hindering the maximization of the full promise of IoV. In this paper, we provide an in-depth analysis of the present state of interoperability and comprehensively survey the challenges in IoV. We present a taxonomy of interoperability approaches, review solutions that prior work have proposed, and provide insights on how to address the current challenges. Finally, we identify open problems that persist and future directions for research.

AB Due to global climate change, various countries have agreed upon the use of conventions. In this study, the eco-friendly vehicular policy on carbon neutrality implemented in Seoul, Korea, was examined. To this end, various policy-based scenarios were set, and the changes in automotive exhaust gas emissions were evaluated and compared. The evaluation method combined macroscopic and microscopic emission models as its analysis framework. Micro-traffic data available in Korea were used for analyses, and the results for all autonomous districts were derived to cover the entire area of Seoul. The findings confirmed that the most effective measure is the initial replacement of old, mid-size, or large diesel passenger cars with eco-friendly vehicles (Middle-sized: Scenario 2-1 5.52%, Scenario 2-2 6.86%, Scenario 3-1 80.93%, and Scenario 3-2 83.98%). The replacement of old vehicles exhibited the highest effect in all tested scenarios, while the initial replacement of diesel vehicles was more effective than the replacement of gasoline and liquified petroleum gas vehicles (Diesel: Scenario2-1 6.64%, Scenario 2-2 8.21%, Scenario3-1 86.23%, and Scenario 3-2 90.51%). Among the autonomous districts of Seoul, the Gangnam-gu area exhibited the largest emission-reduced effect among all the tested scenarios (Gangnam-gu: Scenario 2-1 5.80%, Scenario 2-2 6.74%, Scenario 3-1 80.44%, and Scenario 3-2 82.62%). Overall, it was demonstrated that the findings of this study may have significant policy implications in terms of urban emission changes pertaining to transportation.

   transformation; global-local consistency loss
AB Context prediction plays a crucial role in implementing autonomous driving applications. As one of important context-prediction tasks, crowd-and-vehicle counting is critical for achieving real-time traffic and crowd analysis, consequently facilitating decision-making processes for autonomous vehicles. However, the completion of crowd-and-vehicle counting also faces challenges, such as large-scale variations, imbalanced data distribution, and insufficient local patterns. To tackle these challenges, we put forth a novel frequency feature pyramid network (FFPNet) in this paper. Our proposed FFPNet extracts the multi-scale information by frequency feature pyramid module, which can tackle the issue of large-scale variations. Meanwhile, the frequency feature pyramid module uses different frequency branches to obtain different scale information. We also adopt the attention mechanism to strength the extraction of different scale information. Moreover, we devise a novel loss function, namely global-local consistency loss, to address the existing problems of imbalanced data distribution and insufficient local patterns. Furthermore, we conduct extensive experiments on six datasets to evaluate our proposed FFPNet. It is worth mentioning that we also construct a novel crowd-and-vehicle dataset (CROVEH), which is the only dataset that contains both crowd-and-vehicle annotations. The experimental results show that FFPNet achieves the best performance on different backbones, e.g., 52.69 mean absolute error (MAE) on P2PNet with FFP module. The codes are available at: https://github.com/MUST-AI-Lab/FFPNet.

ID UNDERWATER; ALGORITHM
AB Modern autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) are currently involved in complex tasks and scenarios, and require accurate and robust navigation systems to estimate their position. However, since the Global Positioning System cannot be exploited underwater, the AUV position is not directly measurable in real time (unless using dedicated acoustic-based sensors), making the availability of a reliable navigation system even more crucial. In this context, the main role is played by the filter used to estimate the AUV motion, usually relying on simple kinematic vehicle models and equations linearization. A navigation strategy specifically thought for AUVs and based on an unscented Kalman filter is proposed and experimentally validated by the authors. Preliminary tests of the developed strategy have been carried out by running the navigation filter on experimental data acquired during the FP7 European ARROWS project. This initial validation has been performed totally offline. The AUVs navigated in dead reckoning without using navigation filters, whereas the proposed strategy has been compared to standard extended Kalman filter based ones, highlighting encouraging performances. To further validate the proposed navigation system, suitable sea tests have been performed. The navigation filter has been implemented online on an AUV and the vehicle controller relied only on it to navigate. The new validation procedure, whose results are reported in this paper, showed again the good performance of the chosen strategy, yielding satisfying results in terms of accuracy of vehicle position estimation.

AB In this paper, we develop a novel decentralized resource allocation mechanism for vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) communications based on deep reinforcement learning, which can be applied to both unicast and broadcast scenarios. According to the decentralized resource allocation mechanism, an autonomous "agent," a V2V link or a vehicle, makes its decisions to find the optimal sub-band and power level for transmission without requiring or having to wait for global information. Since the proposed method is decentralized, it incurs only limited transmission overhead. From the simulation results, each agent can effectively learn to satisfy the stringent latency constraints on V2V links while minimizing the interference to vehicle-to-infrastructure communications.

   STRATEGIES
AB Connected autonomous vehicles (CAVs) may be able to operate with less longitudinal and lateral spacing than traditional human-driven vehicles (HVs) due to fast and precise control technologies and cooperative maneuvers. With this appealing feature, it is possible to allocate specific narrower highway lanes to CAVs to increase traffic throughput. This paper proposes an analytical lane management framework that determines the optimal number of CAV lanes needed for a highway segment to maximize its throughput considering the narrowed width of CAV lanes. The proposed optimization model investigates three types of vehicles, including CAVs and human-driven light-duty and human-driven heavy-duty vehicles. It takes into account varying mixed-traffic demand levels, CAV market penetration rates, platooning intensities, and CAV technology scenarios. The results from the numerical experiments reveal that the proposed lane management framework with the narrowed CAV lane width increases highway throughput for various parameter settings in different CAV technology scenarios. In order to bring the developed lane management model to the implementation stage, this paper proposes an analytical methodology on how to estimate model parameters (e.g., CAV market penetration rate, platooning intensity, and average headway) with mixed-traffic trajectories when they become available in the near future. We illustrate the application of the developed calibration method with synthetic mixed-traffic data adapted from a data set.

AB The advancement of wireless connectivity in smart cities will enhance connections between their various key elements. Federated intelligent health monitoring systems inside autonomous vehicles will achieve smart cities' goal of improving the quality of life. This paper proposes a novel cooperative health emergency response system within Cooperative Intelligent Transportation Environment, namely, C-HealthIER. C-HealthIER is a cooperative health intelligent emergency response system that aims to reduce the time of receiving the first emergency treatment for passengers with abnormal health conditions. C-HealthIER continuously monitors passengers' health and conducts cooperative behavior in response to health emergencies by vehicle-to-vehicle and vehicle-to-infrastructure information sharing to find the nearest treatment provider. A conducted simulation that integrates three different tools (Veins, SUMO, and OMNET++) to simulate the proposed system showed that C-HealthIER reduces the total time to receive the emergency treatment by at least 92.5% and the time to receive the first emergency treatment by at least 73.2% compared to the time taken by AutoPilot mode in self-driving cars. C-HealthIER also reduces the travel distance to the first emergency treatment place by 40.9% and thus reduces the travel time by 43.8% compared to receiving the treatment at the same hospital in the AutoPilot mode.

AB Smooth handling of pedestrian interactions is a key requirement for Autonomous Vehicles (AV) and Advanced Driver Assistance Systems (ADAS). Such systems call for early and accurate prediction of a pedestrian's crossing/not-crossing behaviour in front of the vehicle. Existing approaches to pedestrian behaviour prediction make use of pedestrian motion, his/her location in a scene and static context variables such as traffic lights, zebra crossings etc. We stress on the necessity of early prediction for smooth operation of such systems. We introduce the influence of vehicle interactions on pedestrian intention for this purpose. In this paper, we show a discernible advance in prediction time aided by the inclusion of such vehicle interaction context. We apply our methods to two different datasets, one in-house collected - NTU dataset and another public real-life benchmark - JAAD dataset. We also propose a generalization of the Latent-Dynamic Conditional Random Fields (LDCRF), called Factored LDCRF (FLDCRF), for improved sequence prediction performance. FLDCRF outperforms Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks across the datasets over identical time-series features. While the existing best system predicts pedestrian stopping behaviour with 70% accuracy 0.38 seconds before the actual events, our system achieves such accuracy at least 0.9 seconds on an average before the actual events across datasets.

AB Vehicular Ad-hoc Network (VANET) is a technology of importance for the Intelligent Transportation System, which provides safe and comfortable driving, infotainment, traffic management, route optimization, accident prevention, etc. Imparting suitable Quality of Service (QoS), high reliability, and low latency in VANET is a task that is challenging due to the presence of various constraints such as dynamic topology, an imperfection in hardware, congestion in the channel, fluctuation in vehicle density, etc. It is essential to allocate and utilize the resources effectively to maximize the benefit and enhance network performance. It is vital to use the available bandwidth, power, computing, and storage resources efficiently. Along with resource allocation, security and privacy challenges are of equal importance for VANET. One of the major concerns is to make the communication channel secure and prevent the network from attacks by malicious agents. Also, preserving the privacy of vehicles by hiding real identities to circumvent tracking is a challenging task. The authorized agents are allowed to know the actual identity of vehicles. This paper exhibits an in-depth survey of resource allocation schemes in different aspects of VANET. It analyzes the security and privacy of messages, vehicles, and the overall network. Also, the paper presents and discusses the open issues and future research areas in resource allocation, security, and privacy of VANET.

AB With the increase of vehicles and the diversification of road conditions, people pay more attention to the safety of driving. In recent years, autonomous driving technology by Franke et al. (IEEE Intell Syst Their Appl 13(6):40-48, 1998) and unmanned driving technology by Zhang et al. (CAAI Trans Intell Technol 1(1):4-13, 2016) have entered our field of vision. Both automatic driving by Levinson et al. (Towards fully autonomous driving: Systems and algorithms, 2011) and unmanned driving by Im et al. (Unmanned driving of intelligent robotic vehicle, 2009) use a variety of sensors to collect the environment around the vehicle, and use a variety of decision control algorithms to control the vehicle in motion. The visual driving assistance system by Watanabe, et al. (Driving assistance system for appropriately making the driver recognize another vehicle behind or next to present vehicle, 2010), used in conjunction with the target recognition algorithm by Pantofaru et al. (Object recognition by integrating multiple image segmentations, 2008)), will provide drivers with real-time environment around the vehicle. In recent years, few-shot learning by Li et al. (Comput Electron Agric 2:2, 2020) has become a new direction of target recognition algorithm, which reduces the difficulty of collecting training samples. In this paper, on one hand, several low-light cameras with fish-eye lenses are used to collect and reconstruct the environment around the vehicle. On the other hand, we use infrared camera and lidar to collect the environment in front of the vehicle. Then, we use the method of few-shot learning to identify vehicles and pedestrians in the forward-view image. In addition, we develop the system on embedded devices according to miniaturization requirements. In conclusion, the system will adapt to the needs of most drivers at this stage, and will effectively cooperate with the development of automatic driving and unmanned driving.

AB The Remotely Operated Vehicles-Unmanned Autonomous Underwater Vehicles (ROV-UAUV) are playing an important role in the exploration and surveillance of the underwater environment, where communications are difficult and restrictive. This kind of subsea vehicles have no crew on board, can be autonomous or remotely controlled and are designed to provide an efficient underwater supervision having complex tasks related to the environmental monitoring, emergency response, geological research, preventing or combating the consequences of natural disasters etc.
   This study presents the hydrodynamic experimental model tests performed in the Towing Tank of the Faculty of Naval Architecture, from "Dunarea de Jos" University of Galati, in order to determine the hull resistance of an underwater vehicle, used for operations survey, both in maritime and inland navigation, at a maximum working depth of 50 meters. In principle, the ROV-UAUV 1: 2 scale model is attached to the carriage by means of a hydrodynamic profile support. By applying the superposition assumption, the hull resistance of the underwater vehicle is determined based on the difference registered between the resistance of the entire system composed of the ROV-UAUV and the support and the resistance of the hydrodynamic profile. In order to evaluate the influence exerted by the free-surface on the hull resistance, two immersion cases are analyzed. The experimental model tests results validates the following main conclusions: the hull resistance increases with speed at all immersions and the negative effect of the free surface on the hull resistance decreases when the immersion of the system increases.

DE Cooperative patrol; Multi-vehicle autonomous exploration; 3D occupancy
   grid mapping
AB Mobile robots are frequently faced with mapping and exploring uncertain environments in surveillance, military, and convenience tasks. Often times, human teleoperation is either inconvenient or infeasible for these kinds missions. Furthermore, these tasks can be improved by cooperative multi-agent systems, where coordinating robotic efforts can be complicated and computationally-expensive. This paper presents a stochastic framework for autonomous exploration and patrol with multiple cooperating robots. The first contribution extends the authors' prior work in single-robot exact occupancy grid mapping and autonomous exploration in a 2D environment to mapping and exploring in a 3D environment. The proposed 3D occupancy grid map is computed efficiently using an inverse sensor model that accounts for the sensor uncertainty, where we propose how several measurement sources may be fused together by considering depth readings individually. This approach is scalable to larger and more complex scenarios for real-time mapping. Furthermore, this paper shows how important aspects of a 3D map representing a structured environment are projected onto a 2D occupancy grid map, where an autonomous exploration algorithm is designed to select robotic motions that maximize map information gain. The mapping and exploration algorithms are demonstrated with an experiment where a quadrotor autonomously maps and explores an initially-uncertain environment. The second contribution is a novel approach to multi-vehicle cooperative patrol of environments based on map uncertainty. We propose a cooperative autonomous exploration algorithm, which applies a bidding-based framework to coordinate robotic efforts for improving occupancy grid map information gain. Since these exploration approaches are based on probabilistic knowledge about the map, the 3D occupancy grid map is systematically degraded over time to encourage the robots to revisit regions as time passes, thereby patrolling the environment. Furthermore, using a Bayesian framework and receding horizons, the algorithm is robust to dynamic obstacles within the mapping space. The efficacy of the proposed multi-vehicle cooperative patrol is illustrated with a simulation involving three robots patrolling a large floor plan with a non-cooperative person walking around the space.

AB Autonomous vehicles (AVs) have emerged as a transformative technology with the potential to both fundamentally improve lives in cities but also to exacerbate suburban sprawl, vehicle miles traveled and the associated greenhouse gas emissions. Are communities willing to adopt best practices that can lead to early adoption of more sustainable outcomes? This paper presents innovative means to analyze social preferences, demand for AVs, and the potential to resolve community concerns with integrated solutions. We discuss our comprehensive analysis of unstructured and structured data from a survey on AVs that was conducted by the Atlanta Regional Commission in 2015. We used topic modeling to synthesize the "topics" from 1540 comments. The topics captured Atlanta residents' concerns and suggestions about implementing AVs. Further, sentiment analysis revealed people's attitudes on the topics. Accordingly, we proposed an integration of AVs and transit-oriented development (TOD: the development of compact and mixed-use communities around high quality mass transit services within a 10-min walking distance). The second type of data is people's responses to multiple-choice questions about AVs and TOD, which we call structured data. Using latent-class analysis, we identified heterogeneity in preferences for AVs and TOD. More Atlanta residents are willing to live in transit-oriented communities than traditional automobile-dependent ones if AVs save time and improve productivity. This finding portends the future success of combining AVs with TOD and reaping the sustainable benefits of this transformative technology. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The steady-state error problem of autonomous vehicle MPC-based motion control has not been effectively solved for a long time. This problem is more serious for lateral and longitudinal coupling control problems of vehicles with over-actuated configurations. Based on our newly designed general offset free MPC (OF-MPC) solver and the TMeasy tire model, a steady-state error free control strategy for simultaneous stability and path following control of four-wheel steering and four-wheel drive vehicles is proposed. OF-MPC uses the disturbances term to describe the model mismatch and external disturbances, then uses the Kalman filter to observe the disturbances, and finally considers the disturbances in the optimization stage to realize the control without steady-state error. Realtime simulation results show that OF-MPC can solve model mismatch and external disturbances problems, and the steady-state error free control is realized. The simulation results of the double lane change maneuver show that the OF-MPC dynamic control performance is also better than the traditional MPC (TRA-MPC), which is more obvious when the vehicle is at the stability boundary and under various constant or time-varying disturbances. Regardless of the dimensions and complex constraints of this problem, real-time performance is still guaranteed, thanks to the proposed OF-MPC. When the horizon length is 100, the average time consumption is only about 15 milliseconds.

AB Accurate prediction of lane-changing (LC) trajectories can improve traffic efficiency and reduce the probability of accidents, as well as provide driving strategies for intelligent connected vehicles (ICVs) and connected autonomous vehicles (CAVs). Aiming at solving the problems of low prediction accuracy, difficulty in long-term prediction, and an inability of a fine-grained level description of conventional models, a prediction model based on an attention-aided encoder decoder structure and deep neural network (DNN) is proposed. This study analyzes the LC process and proposes an LC segmentation and sampling method for dividing LC into four stages. The optimal attention-aided encoder-decoder model is tested by trajectory data in the four LC stages and then a heuristic network model is designed. In addition, the proposed heuristic network is connected with the DNN for predicting vehicle kinematics data while predicting the vehicle trajectory. Finally, the heuristic network and DNN are tested in cascade to form a joint cascade prediction model that can perform a fine-grained LC description based on the prediction results. The experimental results show that the proposed cascade prediction model has high accuracy and long-term prediction capability of a vehicle's trajectory, velocity, acceleration, and steering angle and is also capable of fine-grained LC description. The proposed prediction model can provide a useful theoretical basis for further research on ICVs and CAVs.

TI Autonomous Vehicle Safe Operating Speeds on the Automated Skyway Express
   in Jacksonville, Florida
SO TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH RECORD
LA English
DT Article
AB Autonomous vehicles (AV) differ significantly from traditional passenger vehicles in both their behavior and physical characteristics. As such, the validity of the guidance provided in the Manual for Assessing Safety Hardware, Second Edition (MASH 2016) is questionable in AV applications. Impact angles, speeds, and vehicle weights specified in MASH 2016 are inextricably linked to the traditional vehicles underlying the estimates. For AV applications, these parameters must be estimated from the ground up, stepping outside the guidance of MASH 2016. In this paper, a conservative method for evaluating existing infrastructure to support AV traffic is proposed. The method integrates traditional structural analyses with unconventional methods of estimating impact conditions. This methodology was developed for the Jacksonville Transportation Authority, who, when faced with unique challenges in maintaining and expanding their Automated Skyway Express, opted to convert the system from monorail to AV traffic. Leading AV developers were surveyed to develop a portfolio of potential candidates for the conversion. Estimated impact conditions were then compared against the capacity of the system's existing concrete parapets. Ultimately, safe operating speeds for each AV candidate were recommended on the bases of structural capacity and vehicle stability. All but one AV candidate were deemed capable of safely operating at the desired speed of 25 mph without any modifications to the barrier. Although the methodology was developed for a particular case, it is applicable to future implementations of AVs on existing infrastructure, provided the roadway is confined similarly to the Skyway deck.

TI Development and testing of bio-inspired microelectromechanical pressure
   sensor arrays for increased situational awareness for marine vehicles
SO SMART MATERIALS AND STRUCTURES
LA English
DT Article
AB The lateral line found on most species of fish is a sensory organ without analog in humans. Using sensory feedback from the lateral line, fish are able to track prey, school, avoid obstacles, and detect vortical flow structures. Composed of both a superficial component, and a component contained within canals beneath the fish's skin, the lateral line acts in a similar fashion to an array of differential pressure sensors. In an effort to enhance the situational and environmental awareness of marine vehicles, lateral-line-inspired pressure sensor arrays were developed to mimic the enhanced sensory capabilities observed in fish.
   Three flexible and waterproof pressure sensor arrays were fabricated for use as a surface-mounted 'smart skin' on marine vehicles. Two of the sensor arrays were based around the use of commercially available piezoresistive sensor dies, with innovative packaging schemes to allow for flexibility and underwater operation. The sensor arrays employed liquid crystal polymer and flexible printed circuit board substrates with metallic circuits and silicone encapsulation. The third sensor array employed a novel nanocomposite material set that allowed for the fabrication of a completely flexible sensor array. All three sensors were surface mounted on the curved hull of an autonomous kayak vehicle, and tested in both pool and reservoir environments. Results demonstrated that all three sensors were operational while deployed on the autonomous vehicle, and provided an accurate means for monitoring the vehicle dynamics.

AB The present paper investigates a new paradigm to control a swarm of moving individual vehicles, based on the introduction of a few random long-range communications in a queue dominated by short-range car-following dynamics. The theoretical approach adapts the small-world theory, originally proposed in social sciences, to the investigation of these networks. It is shown that the controlled system exhibits properties of higher synchronization and robustness with respect to communication failures. The considered application to a vehicle swarm shows how safety and security of the related traffic dynamics are strongly increased, diminishing the collision probability even in the presence of a hacker attack to some connectivity channels.

AB Pure electric vehicles (PEVs) offer a solution for achieving a zero-emission transport system. This study presents the work towards the development of a bi-directional multiport solar-assisted switched reluctance motor (SRM) drive for PEV applications having battery-to-vehicle (B2V), photovoltaic (PV)-to-vehicle (PV2V), PV assisted B2V, grid-to-vehicle battery charging and PV2V battery charging functions. The power circuit is formed by the combination of a front-end circuit and a modified-Miller SRM converter. Battery, PV panel, grid and SRM form the four ports of this multiport drive, which with proper control, provide motoring, braking and charging functions. The dc-link voltage is fully controllable which improves the machine performance both at higher and lower speeds. During stand-still conditions, the battery is charged either from the grid at unity power factor or through the PV panel by incorporating the drive components to form an on-board battery charger, thereby reducing the reliance on charging stations. A fault-tolerant control is developed to operate the system with desired performance under single and double phase open-circuit faults. An 8/6 SRM is used for proof of concept and the experimental results confirm the effectiveness of the proposed drive and control strategy.

AB PurposeThis research aims to present a novel cooperative control architecture designed specifically for roads with variations in height and curvature. The primary objective is to enhance the longitudinal and lateral tracking accuracy of the vehicle.Design/methodology/approachIn addressing the challenges posed by time-varying road information and vehicle dynamics parameters, a combination of model predictive control (MPC) and active disturbance rejection control (ADRC) is employed in this study. A coupled controller based on the authors' model was developed by utilizing the capabilities of MPC and ADRC. Emphasis is placed on the ramifications of road undulations and changes in curvature concerning control effectiveness. Recognizing these factors as disturbances, measures are taken to offset their influences within the system. Load transfer due to variations in road parameters has been considered and integrated into the design of the authors' synergistic architecture.FindingsThe framework's efficacy is validated through hardware-in-the-loop simulation. Experimental results show that the integrated controller is more robust than conventional MPC and PID controllers. Consequently, the integrated controller improves the vehicle's driving stability and safety.Originality/valueThe proposed coupled control strategy notably enhances vehicle stability and reduces slip concerns. A tailored model is introduced integrating a control strategy based on MPC and ADRC which takes into account vertical and longitudinal force variations and allowing it to effectively cope with complex scenarios and multifaceted constraints problems.

AB High-definition (HD) maps offer precise positioning and dependable navigation capabilities, which are essential to guarantee the safety of autonomous vehicles. Lane-level road network, as a crucial component of HD maps, can provide perception, positioning, local planning, and vehicle control services. In urban scenarios, the effectiveness of using sensor-equipped mapping vehicles to construct HD maps on a large scale is hindered by complex road conditions, heavy traffic flow, and limited sensor measurement range. In this letter, we propose a method for generating a lane-level road network from unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) LiDAR data, which is flexible, maneuverable, and not limited by the constraints of road traffic conditions. The proposed method employs a SegFormer model to acquire road areas and eliminates pavement interferential objects through a density-based spatial clustering of applications with noise (DBSCAN) clustering and random sample consensus (RANSAC) plane fitting algorithm. Subsequently, the PP-LiteSeg model is utilized to extract road symbols from a relatively clean pavement point clouds, and the lane-level road network is generated. We tested our method on the inner ring elevated road section of Yangpu District, Shanghai. The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness and robustness of our method for generating lane-level road network in high-density urban scene.

AB The Internet of Things (IoT) is shaping the future of the automotive industry. Grounded on the advances in everything from sensors, electronic controllers, artificial intelligence, data analytics, to network connectivity, intelligent connected autonomous vehicles (CAVs) have become the essence in IoT applications. The software in CAVs lies at the core of this digital transformation. Faulty software remains the main reason behind the vast number of safety recalls and reputation damage witnessed recently in the automotive industry. The uniqueness of CAVs originates challenges for vehicle software engineering (VSE) that render traditional models and practical solutions for software development ineffective and inapplicable. Despite the raised necessity to adopt a software engineering model that can handle these challenges, there is a lack of studies recognizing the importance of VSE. This article presents an in-depth and comprehensive analysis to perceive the existing software engineering processes detailing their strengths and limitations in the context of CAVs. It also reviews current practical software solutions, including standards, tools, languages, and research efforts to understand the evolution, trends, and current practice in this article area. This article will enable automakers and software providers to better assess and differentiate among the existing software engineering processes and current practical solutions for vehicle software system development. Hence, they would be able to adopt a VSE model and follow best practices that can better meet their challenging needs.

AB Pedestrians will increasingly have to share their space with autonomous vehicles (AVs), at pedestrian crossings, and in urban shared spaces where segregation between pedestrians and vehicles is minimized. This article proposes an integrative framework to analyze pedestrian behavior in shared spaces with AVs. Following the "perception-cognition-action" cycle, the proposed framework breaks down pedestrian behavior into 3 parts: 1. Sensation and Perception; 2. Emotion and Cognition; 3. Action and Communication. The framework is used to review and synthesize current knowledge on pedestrian behavior in urban shared spaces. Studies involving pedestrians in shared environments with AVs are limited. Since an AV can be seen as a hybrid of a conventional car and a mobile robot, this review includes studies on pedestrian behavior with conventional cars and with mobile robots as well as with AVs. Examining pedestrian behavior in these three situations of interaction allows us to make assumptions about how humans will behave in sharing their urban spaces with AVs. The reviewed interactions reveal that pedestrians have diverse and imperfect behaviors. AVs must consider this variety of behaviors and follow socially compliant rules in order to be understood and accepted by pedestrians. Perspectives for AVs in shared spaces and research directions are also identified.

AB Underwater vehicles are employed in the exploration of dynamic environments where tuning of a specific controller for each task would be time-consuming and unreliable as the controller depends on calculated mathematical coefficients in idealised conditions. For such a case, learning task from experience can be a useful alternative. This paper explores the capability of probabilistic inference learning to control autonomous underwater vehicles that can be used for different tasks without re-programming the controller. Probabilistic inference learning uses a Gaussian process model of the real vehicle to learn the correct policy with a small number of real field experiments. The use of probabilistic reinforcement learning looks for a simple implementation of controllers without the burden of coefficients calculation, controller tuning or system identification. A series of computational simulations were employed to test the applicability of model-based reinforcement learning in underwater vehicles. Three simulation scenarios were evaluated: waypoint tracking, depth control and 3D path tracking control. The 3D path tracking is done by coupling together a line-of-sight law with probabilistic inference for learning control. As a comparison study LOS-PILCO algorithm can perform better than a robust LOS-PID. The results show that probabilistic model-based reinforcement learning can be a deployable solution to motion control of underactuated AUVs as it can generate capable policies with minimum quantity of episodes.

AB In oceanographic mapping, underwater exploration, and military reconnaissance scenarios, it is necessary to deploy multiple autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) to cooperatively fulfill some operational tasks. In the presence of uncertain dynamics, time-varying ocean environmental disturbances, input saturations, and communication delays, this article innovatively solves the 3-D time-varying formation problem of underactuated AUVs by creating a data-driven motion state predictor (DDMSP), a modified super-twisting algorithm (STA), and a new auxiliary dynamic system (ADS). In lieu of the indirect way of handling the communication delays in most of the existing works, a novel way of directly handling them is proposed in this article with help of the created DDMSP. Based on the modified STA, a super-twisting extended state observer is constructed to accurately estimate the total disturbances lumped by the uncertain dynamics and disturbances. The ADS contributes to mitigating the adverse effect of input saturations. By virtue of the above, a novel distributed robust prescribed performance 3-D time-varying formation control law is developed, which ensures that the AUVs maintain the desired 3-D time-varying formation pattern, while presetting the time desired for the formation errors to reach and stay within the prescribed error tolerance band. Simulation studies on a group of AUVs demonstrate the remarkable performance of our developed formation control law.

AB This paper addresses the onboard prediction of a motor vehicle's path to help enable a variety of emerging functions in autonomous vehicle control and active safety systems. It is shown in simulation that good accuracy of path prediction is achieved using numerical integration of a linearized two degree of freedom vehicle handling model. To improve performance, a steady-state Kalman filter is developed to estimate the vehicle's lateral velocity and the magnitudes of external disturbances acting on the vehicle, specifically the lateral force and the yaw moment disturbances. A comparison is made between three models of external disturbance time variation; a piecewise-constant-in-time model is found to be sufficient. Finally, an algorithm is proposed to characterize path prediction uncertainty using a statistical characterization of the measurement and modeling errors. Simulation suggests that these algorithms may provide a useful suite of path prediction tools for a variety of applications.

AB To date, three major hurdles have hindered widespread adoption of electric vehicles (EVs): the high cost of batteries, insufficient public charging infrastructure, and the limited driving range of EVs. This study overcomes these three hurdles by introducing a new concept of vehicle-to-vehicle wireless power transfer (V2V WPT) between EVs to facilitate frequent, real-time, and on-demand charging. V2V WPT is enabled by the connected and automated vehicle technology and the sharing economy, and facilitates transfer of power between peer EVs. We formulate the problem of routing, scheduling, and matching vehicles in a V2V WPT platform on a energy-time expanded network, and devise a dynamic programming solution methodology to find the solution efficiently. We quantify the impact of adopting this technology in terms of system-wide energy savings, charging infrastructure requirements, and travel times, and investigate the possibility of reducing battery capacity in EVs as a result of this technology.

AB Conventional large agricultural machinery or implements are unsafe and unsuitable to operate on slopes >6(circle) or 10%. Tractor rollovers are frequent on slopes, precluding farming on arable hills, uneven or highly sloped land. Therefore, a fleet of autonomous ground vehicles (AGV) is proposed to cultivate highly sloped land (>6(circle)). The fleet aims to expand agricultural land to the slopes and to strengths the human-robot collaboration in an unsafe sloped environment. However, the fleet's success largely depends on vehicle behavior models regarding traction, mobility, and energy consumption on varying slopes. The vehicle intelligent behavior models are essential and would solve multiple objectives ranging from simulations to path planning & navigation. Therefore, this study aimed to build a deep learning-based vehicle behavior models on sloping terrain. A standard drawbar test was performed on a single AGV operating on an actual sloped field at varying speeds and load conditions. The drawbar test quantified the AGV's behavior on slopes in metrics related to traction (traction efficiency), mobility (travel reduction), and energy consumption (power number). Deep learning-based models were developed from the experimental data to predict the AGV's behavior on slopes as a function of vehicle velocity, drawbar, and slope. A special model called the proposed model, which combined multiple deep neural networks with a mixture of Gaussians, was developed and trained with a hybrid training method. The proposed model consistently outperformed the other well-known machine learning models. This study explored the capabilities of machine learning algorithms to simulate the behavior of small-track vehicle or AGV on sloping terrain. The fleet aims to provide safer agriculture keeping human safety in focus, and the developed predictive vehicle behavior models would empower the fleet's operation on currently unsafe sloped terrain by assisting in vehicle path planning, route optimization, and decision making.

AB Recently, in the researches on vehicular Internet-of-Things (IoT), platooning have received lots of attentions due to its potential to improve the fuel efficiency and driving experience. Platoon is a group of vehicles that act as smart agents, they travel collaboratively by following the leading human-driven vehicle. A vehicle in the platoon utilizes radar and wireless communication to share important information to other vehicles in the same platoon such as speed and acceleration, to realize the safe and efficient driving. The quality of wireless communication is of great importance to manage and maintain the platoons. However, in a scenario that a large number of vehicles exist, communication delay and packet loss caused by channel congestion may endanger the safe inter-vehicle distance. In this paper, we introduce inter-vehicle communication with directional antenna into platooning. By extensive simulations, we evaluate the packet delay and inter-vehicle distance in both normal driving and braking scenarios, and verify the usefulness of directional antenna in platooning for vehicular IoT.

AB Due to the rising cost of human resources in road maintenance and the pursuit of efficiency, autonomous road inspection vehicles are developed for intelligent detection of road disease to prevent severe traffic disasters in the early stages. Nevertheless, as a prevalent road disease, road cracks are diverse and susceptible to shadows, weather changes, and noise in data acquisition. Moreover, they usually appear with thin shapes that are hard to detect correctly by existing methods. To handle this problem, more details of the road cracks need to be better analyzed. In this article, we propose a refined road crack detection method named locally enhanced cross-shaped windows transformer (LECSFormer), which adopts a delicate design of the encoder-decoder structure. The encoder employs window-based transformer blocks to model long-range dependencies. Each transformer block ensembles the locally enhanced module to enrich the local contextual information, and token shuffle operation is applied to build cross-windows connections. The decoder uses dense connections to fuse multi-scale information, and the feature fusion module fuses hierarchical features and reweights them by the channel attention mechanism. The proposed method outperforms other state-of-the-art methods with ODS of 0.963, 0.917, 0.952, and 0.953 on four challenging datasets, CrackTree260, CrackLS315, Stone331, and CRKWH100. It can accurately detect cracks in road surfaces and support intelligent preventive maintenance of roads.

In this work a reconfigurable propulsion layout for an inspection vehicle is presented. Performances of the proposed solution are evaluated and compared respect to the conventional one which is currently installed on benchmark test vehicle (the MARTA AUV from University of Florence). Proposed layout exhibit superior maneuvering performances that should be useful for the inspection of offshore plants and more generally for harsh operational conditions.

AB The growing number of underwater activities is giving momentum to the development of new technologies, such as buoys, remotely operated vehicles, and autonomous underwater vehicles. The data collected by these vehicles need to be transmitted to a high-speed central unit. Clearly, wired solutions are not suitable, since they strongly impact the mobility. In this scenario, a promising solution is offered by underwater optical wireless communication (UOWC) technology, which can achieve both high-speed and wireless operation. Here, we provide a comprehensive survey on the challenges, the experimental realizations, and the state of the art in UOWC researches.

AB The agreement problem is studied whereby a group of mobile agents achieves convergence to a common point. A hierarchical cyclic pursuit scheme is introduced, and it is shown that this scheme yields a very significant increase in the rate of convergence to a common point when compared to traditional cyclic pursuit. A second scheme is introduced in which there are more communication links between vehicles. It is shown that this scheme produces a rate of convergence greater than the traditional scheme but significantly less than the hierarchical scheme. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Rapid growth in the popularity of smart vehicles and increasing demand for vehicle autonomy brings new opportunities for vehicular edge computing (VEC). VEC aims at offloading the time-sensitive computational load of connected vehicles to edge devices, e.g., roadside units. However, VEC offloading raises complex resource management challenges and, thus, remains largely inaccessible to automotive companies. Recently, serverless computing emerged as a convenient approach to the execution of functions without the hassle of infrastructure management. In this work, we propose the idea of serverless VEC as the execution paradigm for Internet of Vehicles applications. Further, we analyze its benefits and drawbacks as well as identify technology gaps. We also propose emulation as a design, evaluation, and experimentation methodology for serverless VEC solutions. Using our emulation toolkit, we validate the feasibility of serverless VEC for real-world traffic scenarios.

TI AutoRally AN OPEN PLATFORM FOR AGGRESSIVE AUTONOMOUS DRIVING
SO IEEE CONTROL SYSTEMS MAGAZINE
LA English
DT Article
AB AutoRally is an open-source, 1:5-scale autonomous vehicle testbed for students, researchers, and engineers who are interested in autonomous vehicle technologies. It is designed with robustness and ease of use in mind. At 1 m in length, weighing 22 kg, and with a top speed of 90 km/h, the platform is large enough to host powerful on-board computing and sensing and run state-of-the-art algorithms. At the same time, it is simple and small enough to be maintained and operated by two people, all while providing the capability of exploring driving scenarios including drifting, jumping, high-speed driving, and multivehicle interactions.
   Build instructions are publicly available, along with a parts list, computer-aided design models for fabricating custom components, and operating procedures. The platform uses the Robot Operating System (ROS) and can be programmed in Python or C++. Tutorials, reference algorithms, a Gazebo-based simulation environment, and a data set structured as ROS bag files are available from the AutoRally website. The fleet of six AutoRally platforms at Georgia Tech have been used to demonstrate control, perception, and estimation research in a high-speed, off-road driving domain. To date, the fleet has driven hundreds of kilometers autonomously at the Georgia Tech Autonomous Racing Facility.

TI A Fast VANET-Assisted Scheme for Event Data Recorders
SO SECURITY AND COMMUNICATION NETWORKS
LA English
DT Article
AB An event data recorder (EDR) is a device installed in a vehicle to record information. Similar to a black box in an airplane, an EDR is used in the study of automobile accidents. Many schemes have been proposed that use vehicle network technology to help record EDR data, including schemes involving storing data on roadside units or nearby vehicles and schemes leveraging blockchain technology. However, these schemes do not take into account the vehicle company's server; with the increased use of autonomous vehicles, the data related to these vehicles are always uploaded to the vehicle company's server. In this scenario, we classify the situation into different cases, according to whether or not it is an emergency and whether the vehicle and the server are connected. For these cases, we propose a scheme whereby a vehicle uploads the EDR data to a cloud server and sends the evidence of storage to the nearby vehicle through a vehicular ad hoc network. Our scheme offers a fast response due to the use of symmetric cryptography algorithms while also considering security requirements.

AB The development of autonomous vehicles provides effective solutions and opportunities for reducing the probability of traffic accidents. However, because of technical limitations and economic and social challenges, achieving fully autonomous driving is a long-term endeavor. One principal research question is how to choose the suitable driving mode of an intelligent vehicle during stressful traffic events. For this purpose, an on-road experiment with 22 drivers was conducted in Wuhan, China; multisensor data were collected from the driver, the vehicle, the road, and the environment. Driving modes were classified into three categories on the basis of the driver's self-reported records, and two physiological indexes that use the k-means cluster method were adopted to calibrate the self-reported driving modes. A feature-ranking algorithm based on the information gained was adopted to identify significant factors, and a driving mode decision-making model was established with the multiclass support vector machine algorithm. The results indicated that the SD of the front wheel angle, driver experience, vehicle speed, headway time, and acceleration had significant effects on the driving mode decision making. The driving mode decision-making model demonstrated a high predictive power with a prediction accuracy of 0.888 and area under the curve values of 0.918, 0.91, and 0.929 for the receiver operating characteristic curves. The conclusions provide theoretical support for decision making by the controller of a semiautomated vehicle.

AB This paper proposes a mathematical model to regulate the acceleration (deceleration) applied by self-driving vehicles in car-following situations. A virtual environment is designed to test the model in different circumstances: (1) the followers decelerate in time if the leader decelerates, considering a time delay of up to 5 s to refresh data (vehicles position coordinates) required by the model, (2) with the intention of optimizing space, the vehicles are grouped in platoons, where 3 s of time delay (to update data) is supported if the vehicles have a centre-to-centre spacing of 20 m and a time delay of 1 s is supported at a spacing of 6 m (considering a maximum speed of 20 m/s in both cases), and (3) an algorithm is presented to manage the vehicles' priority at a traffic intersection, where the model regulates the vehicles' acceleration (deceleration) and a balance in the number of vehicles passing from each side is achieved.

AB The strategy for the control of vehicle platooning is proposed and tested on different mobile robot platforms. The decentralized platooning is considered, i.e. a virtual train of vehicles where each vehicle is autonomous and decides on its motion based on its own perceptions. The following vehicle only has information about its distance and azimuth to the leading vehicle. Its position is determined using odometry. The reference position and the orientation of the following vehicle are determined by the estimated path of the leading vehicle in a parametric polynomial form. The parameters of the polynomials are determined using the least-squares method. This parametric reference path is also used to determine the feed-forward part and to suppress tracking errors by a feed-back part of the applied globally stable nonlinear control law. The results of the experiment and simulations demonstrate the applicability of the proposed algorithm for vehicle platoons. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Payload transportation via connected modular unmanned aerial vehicles is an emerging new area that offers unique advantages over other forms of aerial logistics. When considering rigidly attached, modular, vertical lift, unmanned aerial vehicles, differing payloads and vehicle attachment geometries have a significant effect on the composite aircraft's dynamic response during takeoff and stabilization. With no prior knowledge of payload parameters or vehicle attachment geometry, there is no inherent flightworthiness guarantee for a specific connected configuration. Onground flightworthiness determination can be used to ensure acceptable performance during vehicle takeoff or to prescribe changes to the vehicle attachment geometry if necessary. This paper introduces an algorithm to determine flightworthiness while in partial ground contact by estimating the vehicle attachment positions and payload weight. The algorithm uses a probabilistic estimate of vehicle placement about the payload derived through a Bayesian learning technique to generate the necessary data to deterministically estimate the attached vehicles' positions. Following a description of the algorithm, simulation results are presented to illustrate the performance of the algorithm for a variety of modular aircraft configurations.

AB The problem associated with line formation (convoy) control among a team of aerial and ground vehicles is addressed by considering the fact that the vehicles share information with each other via communication channels that can be corrupted because of time delay. Among other results, we present rules for designing a decentralized control law that provides convoy stability, ensuring null formation error at steady state under the condition of constant speed, for the leader, compensating time-delay effects on the communication flow among the following vehicles. The results have been verified for convoy designs based on "look-ahead" topologies, in which each agent knows only the states of the preceding vehicles in the formation. The effectiveness of the proposed rules is finally illustrated by a simulation experiment involving a team of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) and Un-manned Ground Vehicles (UGVs), executing a scouting mission.

ID OPTIMIZATION; CAVITATOR; DYNAMICS
AB Due to the complexity of the cavity/vehicle and oscillation characteristics, streamlined shape integrated design of conventional fully wetted vehicles is not suitable for supercavitating vehicles. In this paper, a set of design criteria is highlighted to optimize the length and streamlined shape of a conical section subjected to realistic design constraints, which integrate the complex characteristics of the cavity/vehicle system under the condition of auto-oscillation of supercavitating vehicles. The auto-oscillation and its time-domain characteristics are determined. By deriving the equation describing the cavity/vehicle relationship and identifying the maximum amplitude of the Euler angle, the cavity/vehicle tangent point criterion is proposed to determine the theoretical optimum value of the length of the conical section. A method of equal cross-sectional area for gas flow is proposed to design the streamlined shape of the conical section. Water tunnel and autonomous flight experiments were carried out to validate the feasibility of the design methodology developed in this work.

AB This paper presents an evolutionary approach able to process a digital image and detect tracks left by preceding vehicles on ice and snow in Antarctica. Biologically inspired by a colony of ants able to interact and cooperate to determine the shortest path to the food, this approach is based on autonomous agents moving along the image pixels and iteratively improving an initial coarse solution.
   The unfriendly Antarctic environment makes this image analysis problem extremely challenging, since light reflections, abruptly varying brightness conditions, and different terrain slopes must be considered as well.
   The ant-based approach is compared to a more traditional Hough-based solution and the results are discussed.

AB Autonomous vehicles are continually increasing their presence on public roads. However, before any new autonomous driving software can be approved, it must first undergo a rigorous assessment of driving quality. These quality evaluations typically focus on estimating the frequency of (undesirable) behavioral events. While rate estimation would be straight-forward with complete data, in the autonomous driving setting this estimation is greatly complicated by the fact that detecting these events within large driving logs is a non-trivial task that often involves human reviewers. In this article, we outline a streaming partial tiered event review configuration that ensures both high recall and high precision on the events of interest. In addition, the framework allows for valid streaming estimates at any phase of the data collection process, even when labels are incomplete, for which we develop the maximum likelihood estimate and show it is unbiased. Constructing honest and effective confidence intervals (CI) for these rate estimates, particularly for rare safety-critical events, is a novel and challenging statistical problem due to the complexity of the data likelihood. We develop and compare several CI approximations, including a novel gamma CI method that approximates the exact but intractable distribution with a weighted sum of independent Poisson random variables. There is a clear trade-off between statistical coverage and interval width across the different CI methods, and the extent of this trade-off varies depending on the specific application settings (e.g., rare vs. common events). In particular, we argue that our proposed CI method is the best-suited when estimating the rate of safety-critical events where guaranteed coverage of the true parameter value is a prerequisite to safely launching a new ADS on public roads.

AB The rapid development of automated vehicle technology requires reasonable test scenarios and comprehensive evaluation methods. This paper proposes an evaluation method for automated vehicles combining subjective and objective factors. First, we propose a method for automatically generating test scenarios and for batch testing autonomous vehicles. Then, the use of the target layer, total index layer, and index layer of automated vehicles is proposed to establish a more comprehensive evaluation system for automated vehicles. Specifically, the analytic hierarchy process (AHP, subjective) and improved criteria importance though intercriteria correlation (CRITIC, objective) methods are used to determine the weight of the indicators, and a two-level fuzzy comprehensive (subjective and objective) evaluation method is adopted to comprehensively evaluate the performance of the automated vehicles. Finally, the effectiveness of the proposed evaluation method combining subjective and objective factors is verified through virtual simulations and real-world experiments. Through a combination of subjective and objective methods, improved results can be obtained for safety, efficiency, economy, intelligence, and comfort tests.

AB Vehicle classification has evolved into a significant subject of study due to its importance in autonomous navigation, traffic analysis, surveillance and security systems, and transportation management. While numerous approaches have been introduced for this purpose, no specific study has been conducted to provide a robust and complete video-based vehicle classification system based on the rear-side view where the camera's field of view is directly behind the vehicle. In this paper, we present a stochastic multiclass vehicle classification system which classifies a vehicle (given its direct rear-side view) into one of four classes: sedan, pickup truck, SUV/minivan, and unknown. A feature set of tail light and vehicle dimensions is extracted which feeds a feature selection algorithm to define a low-dimensional feature vector. The feature vector is then processed by a hybrid dynamic Bayesian network to classify each vehicle. Results are shown on a database of 169 videos for four classes.

AB Travel behavior responses to automated vehicles (AVs) could undermine broader transportation policy objectives. This study presents focus group findings on Greater Toronto and Hamilton Area (GTHA) residents' interest and expected behavioral responses to AVs. Five key consumer response themes are identified: safety and ethics concerns; lack of trust; diverse AV use intentions; agreement on a role for public sector involvement; and disagreement over regulation strategies. Findings indicate that utilitarian behavioral models resonate but that psychosocial explanations, such as "control," "trust," and "compatibility" play a stronger role-underscoring the importance for policymakers considering the social processes of new technology adoption.

AB This paper addresses the stability and tracking control problem of a quadrotor unmanned flying robot vehicle in the presence of modeling error and disturbance uncertainty. The input algorithms are designed for autonomous flight control with the help of an energy function. Adaptation laws are designed to learn and compensate the modeling error and external disturbance uncertainties. Lyapunov theorem shows that the proposed algorithms can guarantee asymptotic stability and tracking of the linear and angular motion of a quadrotor vehicle. Compared with the existing results, the proposed adaptive algorithm does not require an a priori known bound of the modeling errors and disturbance uncertainty. To illustrate the theoretical argument, experimental results on a commercial quadrotor vehicle are presented.

AB This paper studies a task execution and routing problem in the autonomous transportation system that maps to the famous orienteering problem (OP) in operations research. By extending the classical OP to stochastic and dynamic OP with stochastic travel time and service time, an investigation is conducted that aims to optimize the selection of travel routes with the objective of maximizing the total collected rewards in accordance with the time availability of self-adaptive agent (e.g., unmanned aircraft vehicles and unmanned ground vehicle). Three self-adaptive multi-stage heuristics-based adjustment strategies (i.e., Insertion-and-Removal Heuristics, Hybrid Simulated Annealing-Tabu Search-based Re-Optimization, and Threshold-based Re-Optimization) are proposed to equip the autonomous agent with the ability of real-time routing adjustment in the context of the dynamic and stochastic orienteering problem. Finally, benchmark simulation experiments are used to test the effectiveness of all the three proposed adjustment strategies. The experimental results show that, compared with a priori solutions acquired by a static meta-heuristic algorithm (Hybrid Simulated Annealing-Tabu Search algorithm), the three strategies can improve the solution qualities at different levels.

AB Autonomous driving in public roads requires precise localization within the range of few centimeters. Even the best localization systems based on GNSS cannot always reach this level of precision, especially in an urban environment, where the signal is disturbed by surrounding buildings and artifacts. Recent works have shown the advantage of using maps as a precise, robust, and reliable way of localization. Typical approaches use the set of current readings from the vehicle sensors to estimate its position on the map. The approach presented in this paper exploits a short-range visual lane marking detector and a dead reckoning system to construct a registry of the detected back lane markings corresponding to the last 240 m driven. This information is used to search in the map the most similar section, to determine the vehicle localization in the map reference. Additional filtering is used to obtain a more robust estimation for the localization. The accuracy obtained is sufficiently high to allow autonomous driving in a narrow road. The system uses a low-cost architecture of sensors and the algorithm is light enough to run on low-power embedded architecture.

AB On account of the limitations of single sensor in obstacle detection, the paper investigates an obstacle detection method based on the fusion of 3D LiDAR and monocular visual. The spatial data fusion of the two sensors is realized according to their calibration results, and the time data fusion is realized by using double buffer technology. Considering the aspect ratio of vehicles, the image region of interest is determined based on the obstacle clustering of 3D LiDAR data. By using Haar-like features as effective characteristic of the front vehicle, integral figure is applied to extract Haar-like features of vehicle samples and non-vehicle samples. AdaBoost algorithm is used to choose weak classifiers to constitute strong classifiers, which combine into the cascade classifier. The cascade classifier has been trained to identify the vehicle target in the image region of interest. The relevant experimental results verify the effectiveness and real-time performance of the detection method.

AB This research is conducted on machine dynamics and steering control of an articulated surface mining large wheel loader (LWL) navigating a predefined path. Modelling a LWL based on computational multibody dynamics is achieved by modelling each system of the articulated vehicle separately then merging them to form an overall system of an articulated vehicle navigating a predefined path. This model includes the front and rear frames, articulated hinge, steering actuators, tyre model, steering controller and a predefined path. Fuzzy and PID steering controllers are developed and simulated. Results show that it is possible to model large articulated vehicles as a multibody mechanical system. Both of the developed controllers are able to control the lateral and longitudinal motion of the vehicle and drive the machine over the desired path accurately. The fuzzy logic controller has longer rising time but shorter settling time when compared with the PID controller.

AB Dynamic shared autonomous taxi (SAT) systems are regarded as a promising means of improving travel flexibility. With no human drivers, SATs urgently require precise traffic information in order to plan accurate paths independently; in addition, on-time arrival is an essential service quality in SAT systems. In this study, taxis are assumed to be replaced with ride-sharing autonomous vehicles. To improve the probability of on-time arrival, the reliable path concept and collected travel time information are used to facilitate path finding for SATs, and the potential benefits are examined. Two simulation scenarios-one based on historical traffic information and the other based on real-time traffic information-are executed to evaluate the information's usefulness in reliable path finding. In simulation results, reliable path scenarios showed a higher on-time arrival ratio than shortest path scenarios, in which the shortest path algorithm is used in path finding for SATs, and the historical information-based scenarios showed a higher on-time arrival ratio than the real-time information-based scenarios. A system-beneficial path finding method is proposed and is verified to be effective for mitigating road network congestion.

TI Laboratory experimentation of autonomous spacecraft approach and docking
   to a collaborative target
SO JOURNAL OF SPACECRAFT AND ROCKETS
LA English
DT Article
AB A new laboratory test bed is introduced that enables the hardware-in-the-loop simulation of the autonomous approach and docking of a chaser spacecraft to a target spacecraft of similar mass. The test bed consists of a chaser spacecraft and a target spacecraft simulator floating via air pads on a flat floor. The prototype docking interface mechanism of the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency's Orbital Express mission is integrated on the spacecraft simulators. Relative navigation of the chaser spacecraft is obtained by fusing the measurements from a single-camera vision sensor and an inertial measurement unit, through Kalman filters. The target is collaborative in the sense that a pattern of three infrared light emitting diodes is mounted on it as reference for the relative navigation. Eight cold-gas on-off thrusters are used for the translation of the chaser vehicle. They are commanded using a nonlinear control algorithm based on Schmitt triggers. Furthermore, a reaction wheel is used for the vehicle rotation With a proportional derivative linear control. Experimental results are presented of both an autonomous proximity maneuver and an autonomous docking of the chaser simulator to the nonfloating target. The presented results validate the proposed estimation and control methods and demonstrate the capability of the test bed.

AB This project aims to study the performance of two reinforcement machine learning algorithms, namely the Proximal Policy Optimization and Soft Actor Critic, in the simulation of autonomous sailboats and their response to different wind directions while avoiding obstacles detected by image analysis and following defined target check-points. Also, the effect of the imitation learning algorithms Behavioral Cloning and Generative Adversarial Imitation Learning combined with the first mentioned algorithms is studied. The proposed scenarios consist of areas filled with random static or moving obstacles and with the presence of favorable or crosswinds. The motivation for the project comes from the lack of studies of the mentioned algorithms in autonomous sailboats, issue which the current study tries to address. The Unity platform and ML-Agents machine learning toolkit are used for development and the methodology that guides the project can be similarly applied to other reinforcement learning problems. Through agent training, it is possible to compare the results and observe that the Proximal Policy Optimization obtains better performance within the proposed scenarios, both with and without the support of imitation learning algorithms.

ID DELIBERATE PRACTICE; MOTOR; PERFORMANCE
AB Motorsports have become an excellent playground for testing the limits of technology, machines, and human drivers. This paper presents a study that used a professional racing simulator to compare the behavior of human and autonomous drivers under an aggressive driving scenario. A professional simulator offers a close-to-real emulation of underlying physics and vehicle dynamics, as well as a wealth of clean telemetry data. In the first study, the participants' task was to achieve the fastest lap while keeping the car on the track. We grouped the resulting laps according to the performance (lap-time), defining driving behaviors at various performance levels. An extensive analysis of vehicle control features obtained from telemetry data was performed with the goal of predicting the driving performance and informing an autonomous system. In the second part of the study, a state-of-the-art reinforcement learning (RL) algorithm was trained to control the brake, throttle and steering of the simulated racing car. We investigated how the features used to predict driving performance in humans can be used in autonomous driving. Our study investigates human driving patterns with the goal of finding traces that could improve the performance of RL approaches. Conversely, they can also be applied to training (professional) drivers to improve their racing line.

AB We present a conceptually simple framework for 6DoF object pose estimation, especially for autonomous driving scenarios. Our approach can efficiently detect the traffic participants from a monocular RGB image while simultaneously regressing their 3D translation and rotation vectors. The proposed method 6D-VNet, extends the Mask R-CNN by adding customised heads for predicting vehicle's finer class, rotation and translation. It is trained end-to-end compared to previous methods. Furthermore, we show that the inclusion of translational regression in the joint losses is crucial for the 6DoF pose estimation task, where object translation distance along longitudinal axis varies significantly, e.g., in autonomous driving scenarios. Additionally, we incorporate the mutual information between traffic participants via a modified non-local block to capture the spatial dependencies among the detected objects. As opposed to the original non-local block implementation, the proposed weighting modification takes the spatial neighbouring information into consideration whilst counteracting the effect of extreme gradient values. We evaluate our method on the challenging real-world Pascal3D+ dataset and our 6D-VNet reaches the 1st place in ApolloScape challenge 3D Car Instance task (Apolloscape, 2018), (Huang et al., 2018).

AB A singularity-free non-linear controller is proposed for trajectory tracking of a model-scaled autonomous helicopter. The helicopter model is firstly decomposed into a nominal one with unmodelled dynamics. Based on the decomposed model, the controller is designed with the hierarchical inner-outer loop strategy. The outer position loop controller is designed with hyperbolic tangent functions, and criteria for controller parameter selections are developed to realise the position tracking and to obviate singularity in deriving the command attitude from the position loop controller. The inner attitude loop controller is designed based on barrier Lyapunov function and backstepping technique to achieve the attitude tracking without singularity during the tracking process. In addition, in order to improve the tracking performance, observers are employed to compensate the unmodelled dynamics. Simulation of two manoeuvres verify the proposed theoretical results.

AB Safety-critical control is crucial but difficult in the applications of autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs). This article proposes a novel hierarchical safety-critical framework for the control of AUVs consisting of waypoint-based optimal trajectory generation and tracking. The objective is to generate a smooth and feasible trajectory to conform to the dynamics of the AUV and then control the AUV to operate in a safe region. To this end, the offline trajectory generator and the online controller are designed. In the offline step, an improved minimum snap polynomial trajectory is generated as the tracking reference. Specifically, the trajectory is optimized by explicitly considering the practical constraints of the AUV's actuator, which alleviates the complexity of the controller design and computational burden compared with the real-time nonlinear optimization. In the online step, the time- and state-dependent high-order control barrier functions are incorporated into optimization through quadratic programming (QP) that modifies the backstepping-based nominal controller in a minimally invasive way. As a supplement and adjustment to the offline planning, the online step ensures that the system states are maintained in the safety set, thus ensuring obstacle avoidance. The online computational efficient QP structure guarantees convenience and scalability in practical implementation. Both the online static and dynamic obstacle avoidance simulations demonstrate the adherence to the safety constraints. Experimental results validate the effectiveness of the proposed method.

AB This article addresses the safety-critical containment maneuvering of multiple underactuated autonomous surface vehicles (ASVs) in the presence of multiple stationary/moving obstacles. In a complex marine environment, every ASV suffers from model uncertainties, external disturbances, and input constraints. A safety-critical control method is proposed for achieving a collision-free containment formation. Specifically, a fixed-time extended state observer is employed for estimating the model uncertainties and external disturbances. By estimating lumped disturbances in fixed time, nominal containment maneuvering control laws are designed in an Earth-fixed reference frame. Input-to-state safe control barrier functions (ISSf-CBFs) are constructed for mapping safety constraints on states to constraints on control inputs. A distributed quadratic optimization problem with the norm of control inputs as the objective function and ISSf-CBFs as constraints is formulated. A recurrent neural network-based neurodynamic optimization approach is adopted to solve the quadratic optimization problem for computing the forces and moments within the safety and input constraints in real time. It is proven that the error signals in the closed-loop control system are uniformly ultimately bounded and the multi-ASVs system is guaranteed for input-to-state safety. Simulation results are elaborated to substantiate the effectiveness of the proposed safety-critical control method for ASVs based on neurodynamic optimization with control barrier functions.

AB This paper aims to investigate the characteristics of discretionary lane change (LC) duration on freeways based on an enriched dataset that contains the LC vehicle trajectories of 2905 passenger cars and 433 heavy vehicles. The LC duration is comprehensively analysed, and four stochastic LC duration models are established according to vehicle type and LC direction. LC duration varies with vehicle type and LC direction. Considering driver heterogeneity, accelerated failure time (AFT) models with fixed parameters, latent classes, and random parameters were established in this paper. The results show that drivers of heavy vehicles display greater heterogeneity and that vehicle types and LC directions have significant influence on the LC duration. The results of this study are helpful for understanding the mechanism of the LC process and the influence of LC on traffic flow and improving the safety of lane-changing behaviours of connected and autonomous vehicles.

ID PERFORMANCE
AB Recently, vehicle teleoperation (remote driving) has been gaining momentum in the industry and is playing an important role in helping self-driving cars navigate through tricky situations they cannot handle on their own. Today, vehicle teleoperation relies fully on human teleoperators. Future teleoperation systems, powered by artificial intelligence and advanced networks, such as 5G, can potentially allow a subset of the automated driving intelligence to be off-loaded from the vehicle into the cloud. Over time, the growing level of remote driving automation can enable new automated driving solutions that are not feasible today. This article presents a vision of such intelligent teleoperation and discusses its benefits and challenges.

AB As more and more autonomous vehicles (AVs) are being deployed on public roads, designing socially compatible behaviors for them is becoming increasingly important. In order to generate safe and efficient actions, AVs need to not only predict the future behaviors of other traffic participants, but also be aware of the uncertainties associated with such behavior prediction. In this letter, we propose an uncertain-aware integrated prediction and planning (UAPP) framework. It allows the AVs to infer the characteristics of other road users online and generate behaviors optimizing not only their own rewards, but also their courtesy to others, and their confidence regarding the prediction uncertainties. We first propose the definitions for courtesy and confidence. Based on that, their influences on the behaviors of AVs in interactive driving scenarios are explored. Moreover, we evaluate the proposed algorithm on naturalistic human driving data by comparing the generated behavior against ground truth. Results show that the online inference can significantly improve the human-likeness of the generated behaviors. Furthermore, we find that human drivers show great courtesy to others, even for those without right-of-way. We also find that such driving preferences vary significantly in different cultures.

AB LiDAR-based place recognition (LPR) is one of the most crucial components of autonomous vehicles to identify previously visited places in GPS-denied environments. Most existing LPR methods use mundane representations of the input point cloud without considering different views, which may not fully exploit the information from LiDAR sensors. In this article, we propose a cross-view transformer-based network, dubbed CVTNet, to fuse the range image views and bird's eye views generated from the LiDAR data. It extracts correlations within the views using intratransformers and between the two different views using intertransformers. Based on that, our proposed CVTNet generates a yaw-angle-invariant global descriptor for each laser scan end-to-end online and retrieves previously seen places by descriptor matching between the current query scan and the prebuilt database. We evaluate our approach on three datasets collected with different sensor setups and environmental conditions. The experimental results show that our method outperforms the state-of-the-art LPR methods with strong robustness to viewpoint changes and long-time spans. Furthermore, our approach has better real-time performance that can run faster than the typical LiDAR frame rate does.

AB Users are often the last barrier in the detection and correction of abnormal behavior in autonomous systems, so understanding what can be expected from users in various contexts is crucial to the performance of such systems. This letter presents the first study characterizing a user ability to timely report and correct autonomous system failures in the context of small Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (sUAVs). The study aims to explore the complex tradespace which designers will encounter when developing effective transitions of control in sUAVs. We have analyzed these tradeoffs in terms of accuracy and response time while manipulating several key contextual elements including subtlety of failure, transitions of control, introduction of noise in autonomous paths, and amount of user training. Results indicate that: 1) increased accuracy is achieved under longer deadlines without large delays in responses, 2) increased noise, user training, and user responsibility for correction lead to increased reporting times, but only increased user responsibility increased accuracy, 3) users, particularly those with additional training, wanted to remain engaged in failure correction even when such interactions were not requested, 4) asking users to fix failures that they did not report resulted in increased response times and reduced accuracy.

AB To fulfill autonomous navigation of unmanned surface vehicle, it is pivotal to resolve unmanned surface vehicle path following issue. However, the problem that we are concerned with is hindered by unmanned surface vehicle's nonlinearity and the disturbance uncertainties brought by the navigation environment. In this paper, we focus on path following problem for a jet driven underactuated unmanned surface vehicle. The stressed followed paths in practical application are broken lines connected by continuous straight lines rather than smooth lines. By calculating the virtual target on each straight line in following the unmanned surface vehicle dynamically, we propose a broken lines path following algorithm for the unmanned surface vehicle in an uncertain environment. By employing our unmanned surface vehicle experiment platform that we developed a series of numerical simulations and physical tests have been carried out. Results verify the superiority and effectiveness of our broken lines path following algorithm for unmanned surface vehicle especially in continuous broken lines following scenarios.

AB The success of research using convolutional neural network (CNN)-based camera sensor processing for autonomous driving has accelerated the development of autonomous driving vehicles. Since autonomous driving algorithms require high-performance computing for fast and accurate perception, a heterogeneous embedded platform consisting of a graphics processing unit (GPU) and a power-efficient dedicated deep learning accelerator (DLA) has been developed to efficiently implement deep learning algorithms in limited hardware environments. However, because the hardware utilization of these platforms remains low, performance differences such as processing speed and power efficiency between the heterogeneous platform and an embedded platform with only GPUs remain insignificant. To address this problem, this paper proposes an optimization technique that fully utilizes the available hardware resources in heterogeneous embedded platforms using parallel processing on DLA and GPU. Our proposed power-efficient network inference method improves processing speed without losing accuracy based on analyzing the problems encountered when dividing the networks between DLA and GPU for parallel processing. Moreover, the high compatibility of the proposed method is demonstrated by applying the proposed method to various CNN-based object detectors. The experimental results show that the proposed method increases the processing speed by 77.8%, 75.6%, and 55.2% and improves the power efficiency by 84%, 75.9%, and 62.3% on YOLOv3, SSD, and YOLOv5 networks, respectively, without an accuracy penalty.

AB This paper presents two acoustic-based techniques for Autonomous Underwater Vehicle (AUV) navigation within an underwater network of fixed sensors. The proposed algorithms exploit the positioning measurements provided by an Ultra-Short Base Line (USBL) transducer on-board the vehicle to aid the navigation task. In the considered framework the acoustic measurements are embedded in the communication network scheme, causing time-varying delays in ranging with the fixed nodes. The results presented are obtained with post-processing elaborations of the raw experimental data collected during the CommsNet13 campaign, organized and scientifically led by the NATO Science and Technology Organization Centre for Maritime Research and Experimentation (CMRE). The experiment involved several research institutions and included among its objectives the evaluation of on-board acoustic USBL systems for navigation and localization of AUVs. The ISME groups of the Universities of Florence and Pisa jointly participated to the experiment with one Typhoon class vehicle. This is a 300 m depth rated AUV with acoustic communication capabilities originally developed by the two groups for archaeological search in the framework of the THESAURUS project. The CommsNet13 Typhoon, equipped with an acoustic modem/USBL head, navigated within the fixed nodes acoustic network deployed by CMRE. This allows the comparison between inertial navigation, acoustic self-localization and ground truth represented by GPS signals (when the vehicle was at the surface).

AB We report the first successful use of chemical sensors integrated on to an underwater vehicle to locate, map and estimate flux from a controlled sub-seabed CO2 release, analogous to a leak from a Carbon Capture and Storage (CCS) reservoir. This has global implications for the efficacy and cost of monitoring of offshore CCS sites and hence public and regulatory confidence as this tool for addressing climate change is considered and rolled out. A remotely operated vehicle (ROV) equipped with three different pH sensors was deployed to determine the spatial extent of the controlled release. The sensors each operated on a different principle (spectrophotometric, fluorescence, and electrochemical) and the strengths and weaknesses of each sensor are discussed. The sensor data demonstrated that evidence of the plume was limited to within 3 m of the seafloor, as predicted by previous modelling work. The data were then utilised to develop a model of the plume, to extend the spatial coverage of the data. This comparison of the three sensors and the insight into plume dynamics provided by the model would assist in the planning of future plume surveys to ensure the sensor and vehicle combination can resolve the plume of interest.

AB This paper presents a new solution for inspecting and repairing defects in live gas pipelines. The proposed approach is the development of a modular and semi-autonomous vehicle system. The robotic system has a drive mechanism, capable of navigating and adjusting its orientation in various configurations of pipelines. Other features of the system are cable-free communications, semiautonomous motion control as well as integration of sensory devices. The robotic system is designed to traverse in 150-300 mm diameter pipes through straight and curved sections, junctions and reducers. The vehicle control and navigation technique is implemented using a two-mode controller consisting of a proportional-integral-derivative (PID) and fuzzy logic control. Unlike other available systems, the vehicle employs proprioceptive sensors to monitor its own states. The fuzzy logic controller is used to evaluate the sensor outputs such as speed, climbing angle and rate of change of climbing angle. This control technique allows the vehicle to drive and adapt in a partially observable gas pipe system. Laboratory experiment results are presented. The paper also describes a cable-free communication method for the system. A brief account of typical pipe environments and currently available inspection tools is presented as background information.

AB This paper presents a hierarchical path following control framework for a two-axle autonomous bus, under which the active safety controller, the adaptive preview regulator as well as the predictive trajectory tracker are integrated as a whole system with highly effective performance. The framework is developed with two layers. The upper layer is designed to prevent the vehicle from sideslip and rollover by restricting the speed with an active safety controller. As the high computational load of optimal algorithm poses a great challenge for the real-time application in vehicle system, an adaptive preview regulator is, therefore, developed with an active combination of the PSO and SVM aiming for a more practical implementation. Back to the lower layer, the predictive trajectory controller and PI controller are proposed to acquire the steering angle with stability constrains to follow the reference path. The whole system with the proposed method is verified with both the simulation and experiments. A combined comparison simulation with four cases was carried out based on TruckMaker-Simulink joint platform using a highly-fidelity and full-car model in different scenarios. Compared with the case without preview and that with fixed preview, the tracking accuracy of the proposed control is improved by 44.97% and 36.12% respectively. The proposed method is tested in a real autonomous bus with acceptable errors compared with the simulation. In addition, the effectiveness of the proposed layered control framework and its real-time control capability is proved in real autonomous bus with satisfying performance under parameter uncertainties and external disturbances.

ID ALGORITHM
AB Path planning and collision avoidance during autonomous navigation in unknown environments is a crucial issue for unmanned surface vehicles (USVs). This paper improves the traditional D* Lite algorithm and achieves multi-goal path planning and collision avoidance for USVs in unknown and complex environments. By expanding the adjacent search range and setting a safe distance for USVs, we solve the issue of limited steering maneuverability in USVs with fewer DOF during autonomous navigation. We propose an approach to optimize the planned path during navigation by comparing the estimated distance with the actual distance between the current waypoint and the goal waypoint. A minimum binary heap is used to optimize the priority queue of the D* Lite and significantly reduce the path search time. Simulation results show that the improved D * Lite can significantly reduce the path planning time, optimize the planned path and solve the issue of limited steering maneuverability in USVs. We apply the algorithm to a real USV for further tests. Experimental results show that the USV can plan an optimized path while avoiding both static and dynamic obstacles in complex environments with a safe distance during autonomous navigation.

AB This article provides an analysis of the autonomous navigation of marine objects, such as ships, offshore vessels and unmanned vehicles, and an analysis of the accuracy of safe control in game conditions for the cooperation of objects during maneuvering decisions. A method for determining safe object strategies based on a cooperative multi-person positional modeling game is presented. The method was used to formulate a measure of the sensitivity of safe control in the form of a relative change in the payment of the final game; to determine the final deviation of the safe trajectory from the set trajectory of the autonomous vehicle movement; and to calculate the accuracy of information in terms of evaluating the state of the control process. The sensitivity of safe control was considered in terms of both the degree of the inaccuracy of radar information and changes in the kinematics and dynamics of the object itself. As a result of the simulation studies of the positional game algorithm, which used an example of a real situation at sea of passing one's own object with nine other encountered objects, the sensitivity characteristics of safe trajectories under conditions of both good and restricted visibility at sea are presented.

AB An authorized traffic controller (ATC) has the highest priority for direct road traffic. In some irregular situations, the ATC supersedes other traffic control. Human drivers indigenously understand such situations and tend to follow the ATC; however, an autonomous vehicle (AV) can become confused in such circumstances. Therefore, autonomous driving (AD) crucially requires a human-level understanding of situation-aware traffic gesture recognition. In AVs, vision-based recognition is particularly desirable because of its suitability; however, such recognition systems have various bottlenecks, such as failing to recognize other humans on the road, identifying a variety of ATCs, and gloves in the hands of ATCs. We propose a situation-aware traffic control hand-gesture recognition system, which includes ATC detection and gesture recognition. Three-dimensional (3D) hand model-based gesture recognition is used to mitigate the problem associated with gloves. Our database contains separate training and test videos of approximately 60 min length, captured at a frame rate of 24 frames per second. It has 35,291 different frames that belong to traffic control hand gestures. Our approach correctly recognized traffic control hand gestures; therefore, the proposed system can be considered as an extension of the operational domain of the AV.

TI The rational behavior software architecture for intelligent ships
SO NAVAL ENGINEERS JOURNAL
LA English
DT Article
AB The solutions to the power projection, transportation, and operational needs of the Navy as it faces the 21st century must account for reduced manning levels. This leads naturally to increased use of computers, automation, and intelligent systems in the concept and design of the next generation of ships. In addition to the acknowledged hardware needs, the problem of autonomic and autonomous control of shipboard systems and missions are amenable to and will, in fact, require software solutions. Despite current technology, large, reliable software systems are difficult to achieve because correctness in requirements analysis, design, implementation, testing, modification, and maintenance of software are difficult. Software is also difficult to quantize and display; hence, the effort and costs involved in its development are easily underestimated. This paper describes an approach to the problem of providing structure, in the form of a software architecture, to the software performing autonomous control of missions and their related tasks. In concert with the need to reduce complexity, the architecture must support simple, rapid reconfiguration of code should vehicle capabilities or mission requirements change. Building upon recent efforts with control of Autonomous Underwater Vehicles (AUVs), we propose a tri-level control system architecture called the Rational Behavior Model (RBM) as an approach to autonomous and autonomic control of surface ship missions and systems.

AB Autonomous and connected vehicles mainly rely on global navigation satellite systems (GNSS) for positioning and navigation, which is a key component for path planning and guidance. It is therefore crucial to ensure the reliability and robustness of the GNSS signals. Jamming has recently become one of the major concerns for GNSS receivers, especially with the widespread of in-car jammers that broadcast jamming signals. Therefore, future vehicle manufacturers must deploy advanced anti-jamming techniques that have to be extensively tested before being deployed in future self-driving vehicles. This motivates us to develop a robust anti-jamming technique based on wavelet packet transform to efficiently suppress jamming signals and enhance the performance of the acquisition, tracking, and navigation stages within a software-defined receiver. The developed technique is computationally efficient, thus, more suitable for real-time processing. Several experiments for different driving scenarios are performed to verify the effectiveness of the proposed method for mitigating various types of jamming signals. Experiments are conducted on global positioning system (GPS) L1 C/A signals obtained from Spirent system for a fully controlled environment. Moreover, a unique experimental setup was developed to assess the performance of the proposed technique in the presence of a jamming signal from a real jammer.

ID COOPERATIVE LOCALIZATION; VEHICULAR NETWORKS; ACCURACY; NODES
AB In order to realize intelligent vehicular transport networks and self driving cars, connected autonomous vehicles (CAVs) are required to be able to estimate their position to the nearest centimeter. Traditional positioning in CAVs is realized by using a global navigation satellite system (GNSS) such as global positioning system (GPS) or by fusing weighted location parameters from a GNSS with an inertial navigation systems (INSs). In urban environments where Wi-Fi coverage is ubiquitous and GNSS signals experience signal blockage, multipath or non line-of-sight (NLOS) propagation, enterprise or carrier-grade Wi-Fi networks can be opportunistically used for localization or "fused" with GNSS to improve the localization accuracy and precision. While GNSS-free localization systems are in the literature, a survey of vehicle localization from the perspective of a Wi-Fi anchor/infrastructure is limited. Consequently, this review seeks to investigate recent technological advances relating to positioning techniques between an ego vehicle and a vehicular network infrastructure. Also discussed in this paper is an analysis of the location accuracy, complexity and applicability of surveyed literature with respect to intelligent transportation system requirements for CAVs. It is envisaged that hybrid vehicular localization systems will enable pervasive localization services for CAVs as they travel through urban canyons, dense foliage or multi-storycar parks.

AB In this article, a morphable unmanned aerial/underwater vehicle with eight propellers named Puffin platform is investigated. To improve the efficiency of rotor utilization underwater, a tilting mechanism is designed, where the direction of rotors can be changed. As tilting the rotors causes severe underactuation of the vehicle, an attitude control method is proposed. In addition, an adaptive controller is designed for trajectory tracking, and the stability analysis is analyzed by the Lyapunov-like lemma. Simulations are then used to verify the performance of the control strategy. Finally, we assemble the Puffin platform and conduct preliminary experiments to demonstrate its performance in the air, underwater, and during transition.

AB Fully automated vehicles (AVs) are set to become a reality in future decades and changes are to be expected in user perceptions and behavior. While AV acceptability has been widely studied, changes in human drivers' behavior and in passengers' reactions have received less attention. It is not yet possible to ascertain the risk of driver behavioral changes such as overreaction, and the corresponding safety problems, in mixed traffic with partially AVs. Nor has there been proper investigation of the potential unease of car occupants trained for human control, when exposed to automatic maneuvers. The conjecture proposed in this paper is that automation Level 2 vehicles do not induce potentially adverse effects in traditional vehicle drivers' behavior or in occupants' reactions, provided that they are indistinguishable from human-driven vehicles. To this end, the paper proposes a Turing approach to test the "humanity" of automation Level 2 vehicles. The proposed test was applied to the results of an experimental campaign carried out in Italy: 546 car passengers were interviewed on board Level 2 cars in which they could not see the driver. They were asked whether a specific driving action (braking, accelerating, lane keeping) had been performed by the human driver or by the automatic on-board software under different traffic conditions (congestion and speed). Estimation results show that in most cases the interviewees were unable to distinguish the Artificial Intelligence (AI) from the human driver by observing random responses with a 95% significance level (proportion of success statistically equal to 50%). However, in the case of moderate braking and lane keeping at >100 km/h and in high traffic congestion, respondents recognized AI control from the human driver above pure chance, with 62-69% correct response rates. These findings, if confirmed in other case studies, could significantly impact on AVs acceptability, also contributing to their design as well as to long-debated ethical questions. AI driving software could be designed and tested for "humanity", as long as safety is guaranteed, and autonomous cars could be allowed to circulate as long as they cannot be distinguished from human-driven vehicles in recurrent driving conditions.

AB Personal assistant robots provide novel technological solutions in order to monitor people's activities, helping them in their daily lives. In this sense, unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) can also bring forward a present and future model of assistant robots. To develop aerial assistants, it is necessary to address the issue of autonomous navigation based on visual cues. Indeed, navigating autonomously is still a challenge in which computer vision technologies tend to play an outstanding role. Thus, the design of vision systems and algorithms for autonomous UAV navigation and flight control has become a prominent research field in the last few years. In this paper, a systematic mapping study is carried out in order to obtain a general view of this subject. The study provides an extensive analysis of papers that address computer vision as regards the following autonomous UAV vision-based tasks: (1) navigation, (2) control, (3) tracking or guidance, and (4) sense-and-avoid. The works considered in the mapping study-a total of 144 papers from an initial set of 2081-have been classified under the four categories above. Moreover, type of UAV, features of the vision systems employed and validation procedures are also analyzed. The results obtained make it possible to draw conclusions about the research focuses, which UAV platforms are mostly used in each category, which vision systems are most frequently employed, and which types of tests are usually performed to validate the proposed solutions. The results of this systematic mapping study demonstrate the scientific community's growing interest in the development of vision-based solutions for autonomous UAVs. Moreover, they will make it possible to study the feasibility and characteristics of future UAVs taking the role of personal assistants.

DE Autonomous aerobatics; Nonlinear path-following guidance; Specific force
   based control; Unmanned aerial vehicle
AB A guidance and control scheme for a fixed-wing aircraft that enables autonomous aerobatics on commanded path is presented. The proposed method utilizes the nonlinear path-following guidance law in the outer-loop, which creates an acceleration command for a given desired path, current position and velocity of the vehicle. The scheme considers the gravity outside the inner-loop, in that gravitational acceleration is subtracted from the acceleration command to form the specific force acceleration command. With the gravity term removed, the specific force acceleration is more easily controlled in the inner-loop compared to the total acceleration. For an aircraft with sufficient side-force authority a roll attitude is not constrained but can be selected. As a result a roll-to-inverted flight and active sideslip maneuvers such as knife-edge and slow roll are accomplished. Applications to a series of standard aerobatic maneuvers are demonstrated through flight tests to show the performance of the proposed method. (C) 2011 Elsevier Masson SAS. All rights reserved.

AB This paper investigates the model-free trajectory tracking control problem for an autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) subject to the ocean currents, external disturbances, measurement noise, model parameter uncertainty, initial tracking errors, and thruster malfunction. A novel control architecture based on model-free control principles is presented to guarantee stable and precise trajectory tracking performance in the complex underwater environment for AUVs. In the proposed hybrid controller, intelligent-PID (i-PID) and PD feedforward controllers are combined to achieve better disturbance rejections and initial tracking error compensations while keeping the trajectory tracking precision. A mathematical model of an AUV is derived, and ocean current dynamics are included to obtain better fidelity when examining ocean current effects. In order to evaluate the trajectory tracking control performance of the proposed controller, computer simulations are conducted on the LIVA AUV with a compelling trajectory under various disturbances. The results are compared with the two degrees-of-freedom (DOF) i-PID, i-PID, and PID controllers to examine control performance improvements with the guaranteed trajectory tracking stability. The comparative results revealed that the i-PID with PD feedforward controller provides an effective trajectory tracking control performance and excellent disturbance rejections for the entire trajectory of the AUV.

AB Perceiving the information about ambient traffic lights is an inevitable task for autonomous vehicles. To deal with the issue, this work develops an accurate and fast traffic light recognition strategy for autonomous vehicles by an onboard camera. In this paper, deep learning based detection and object tracking is synthesized to determine the position and color of traffic lights. First, the mechanism of simultaneous detection and tracking is founded, wherein the video reading module, convolutional neural network (CNN) module, integrated channel feature tracking (ICFT) module are run simultaneously. Then, the respective modules of detection and tracking are introduced. CNN model is designed and trained to obtain the position of traffic lights utilized as initial information for tracking. ICFT is applied to continually track the traffic light targets and determine the light color. Finally, the effectiveness of the presented method is validated via comparing with the state of art. Experiments results indicate that the proposed technique can improve the accuracy and speed of recognition. Our contributions are: (1) Establish a mechanism for simultaneous detection and tracking of traffic lights; (2) Carefully design the CNN architecture and ICFT features; (3)The precision and recall rates on traffic lights recognition reached 0.962 and 0.909, respectively, and the recognition speed reached 21.4FPS (GPU: Nvidia Titan Xp).

AB In this paper, a hybrid realization model is proposed for the controllers of autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs). This model is based on the model-based systems engineering (MBSE) methodology, in combination with the model-driven architecture (MDA), the real-time unified modeling language (UML)/systems modeling language (SysML), the extended/unscented Kalman filter (EKF/UKF) algorithms, and hybrid automata, and it can be reused for designing controllers of various AUV types. The dynamic model and control structure of AUVs were combined with the specialization of MDA concepts as follows. The computation-independent model (CIM) was specified by the use-case model combined with the EKF/UKF algorithms and hybrid automata to intensively gather the control requirements. Then, the platform-independent model (PIM) was specialized using the real-time UML/SysML to design the capsule collaboration of control and its connections. The detailed PIM was subsequently converted into the platform-specific model (PSM) using open-source platforms to promptly realize the AUV controller. On the basis of the proposed hybrid model, a planar trajectory-tracking controller, which allows a miniature torpedo-shaped AUV to autonomously track the desired planar trajectory, was implemented and evaluated, and shown to have good feasibility.

AB A stereo vision system for deep-sea operations is presented. The system consists of cameras in pressure bottles, which are daisy-chained to a computer bottle. The system has substantial computation power for on-board stereo processing as well as for further computer vision methods to support autonomous intelligent functions, e.g., object recognition, navigation, mapping, inspection, and intervention. The model based design presented here includes two main aspects. First, a formalized approach to the component selection for the stereo set-up is introduced, i.e., given especially accuracy and baseline constraints as well as lens and imager options, an algorithmic analysis is provided. This approach is also of interest for the design of stereo systems in general. Second, the specific aspects of deep sea operations are addressed. This includes especially the validation and optimization of the pressure bottles for the cameras with a Finite Element Method (FEM). Experiments and results are presented, which include a validation of the stereo performance in air, robustness tests of the bottles in pressure tanks, and field trials of the complete system off the shore of Marseille on a commercial Remotely Operated Vehicle (ROV).

AB An autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV), Autosub6000, has been shown to operate safely at altitudes as low as 3m above rugged and complex sea floor environments. This capability is essential for future AUV missions in such environments, e. g. high-resolution surveys using colour photography or multi-beam sonar bathymetry. This was achieved through the development of an obstacle avoidance system for the AUV, incorporating relatively low-cost off-the-shelf components and simple algorithms. This paper details the specification, design, and testing at sea of Autosub6000's obstacle avoidance system. It describes how the specification of the system was influenced by the need to retrofit it into the existing control architecture, together with the pragmatic need to minimize overall complexity. The sensor used in the obstacle avoidance system is a mechanically scanned forward-looking sonar, and the control algorithm is based upon the detection of the range and elevation of the horizon relative to the AUV. The avoidance behaviour is by default to fly over obstacles but, if this is not possible, a turn-around and retry collision avoidance algorithm is invoked. Results are presented of the system's performance during recent deep-water trials of the AUV over the Casablanca Seamount region of the Atlantic Ocean.

AB Nano size drones hold enormous potential to explore unknown and complex environments. Their small size makes the magile and safe for operation close to humans and allows them to navigate through narrow spaces. However, their tiny size and pay-load restrict the possibilities for onboard computation and sensing, making fully autonomous flight extremely challenging. The first step toward full autonomy is reliable obstacle avoidance, which has proven to be challenging by itself in a generic indoor environment. Current approaches utilize vision-based or 1-D sensors to support nano drone perception algorithms. This article presents a light weight obstacle avoidance system based on a novel millimeter form factor 64 pixels multizone time-of-flight (ToF) sensor and a generalized model-free control policy. In-field tests are based on the Crazy flie 2.1, extended by a custom multizone ToF deck, featuring a total flight mass of 35 g. The algorithm only uses 0.3% of theon board processing power (210 mu sexecution time) with a framerate of 15 f/s. The presented autonomous nano size drone reaches100% reliability at 0.5 m/s in a generic and previously unexploredin door environment.

AB Throughout all oceans, aggregations of zooplankton and ichthyoplankton appear as horizontal sound scattering layers (SSLs) when detected with active acoustic techniques. Quantifying the composition and density of these layers is prone to sampling biases. We conducted a net and trawl survey of the epipelagic fauna in northern Norway (70 degrees N) in June 2018 while an au-tonomous surface vehicle equipped with a broadband echosounder (283-383 kHz) surveyed the same region. Densities from the autonomous hydroacoustic survey were calculated using forward estimates from the relative density from the net and trawl, and inversion estimates with statistical data-fitting. All four methods (net, trawl, acoustic forward and inverse methods) identified that copepods dominated the epipelagic SSL, while pteropods, amphipods and fish larvae were present in low densi-ties. The density estimates calculated with the inverse method were higher for mobile zooplankton, such as euphausiid larvae, than with the other methods. We concluded that the inverse method applied to broadband autonomous acoustic surveys can improve density estimates of epipelagic organisms by diminishing avoidance biases and increasing the spatio-temporal reso-lution of ship-based surveys.

AB In this paper, we investigate consensus and disturbance attenuation in a chain of mobile agents, which include non-autonomous agents, semi-autonomous agents and autonomous agents. In particular, the nonlinear dynamics of non-autonomous agents is given and cannot be designed, while the dynamics of semi-autonomous and autonomous agents can be partially and fully designed, respectively. To improve the robustness of multi-agent chains against disturbances, we propose a nonlinear control framework for semi-autonomous and autonomous agents such that they mimic the behavior of non-autonomous agents for compatibility while also exploiting long-range connections with distant agents. This framework ensures the existence of a unique consensus equilibrium, which is independent of the network size, connectivity topologies, control gains and information delays. Robustness of multi-agent chains against disturbances is investigated by evaluating the frequency response at the nonlinear level. For infinitely long multi-agent chains with recurrent patterns, we also derive a condition that ensures the disturbance attenuation but only requires the analysis of the linearized model. A case study is conducted for a connected vehicle system where numerical simulations are used to validate the analytical results. Copyright (c) 2016 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

TI Estimation of vehicle position based on projective function using the
   sequence of a 2D image
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF SYSTEMS SCIENCE
LA English
DT Article
AB The paper proposes a method to estimate the position of an autonomous land vehicle based on the projective function. Usually, there is the fact that obtaining the yaw angle as the motion parameters of the vehicle leads to estimating the lateral variation obtained from the information of a 2D image. From this, an effective method to estimate the lateral variation is shown. In the estimation processing, a projective function from a 2D image into 1D data is considered, and a cross-correlation function for the 1D data, play important roles to reduce the computational effort and the noise effect on a 2D image. Setting up the method in the test vehicle, the experimental result in the case that the vehicle moves in a real passageway is shown.

AB Small unmanned aerial vehicles are widely used in urban space because of its flexibility and maneuverability. However, there are full of dynamic obstacles and immobile obstacles which will affect safe flying in urban space. In this paper, a novel integrated path planning approach for unmanned aerial vehicles is presented, which is consisted of three steps. First, a time-environment dynamic map is constructed to represent obstacles by introducing time axis. Second, unmanned aerial vehicles' flyable paths are explored based on breadth-first algorithm. Third, a path planning method using A* algorithm and local trace-back model is designed in order to discover sub-optimal feasible path rapidly in unmanned aerial vehicles' field of view. Finally, the simulation results have illustrated that the proposed method can ensure unmanned aerial vehicles' autonomous path planning safely and effectively in urban space crowded with obstacles.

Even though unmanned, should these seagoing drones be treated as 'vessels' under the Law of the Sea Convention articles on navigation rights and duties? Are they 'vessels' under the International Regulations for Preventing Collisions at Sea (COLREGs, 1972)? If so, should they be accorded a manoeuvring priority vis-a-vis other vessels? Are the differences between autonomous UMVs and the increasingly automated manned vessels all that great, such that classification should turn on whether the vessel is manned rather than on how navigation and collision avoidance decisions are made and executed?

AB Worldwide, many companies are working towards safe and innovative control systems for Autonomous Vehicles (AVs). A key component is Autonomous Intersection Management (AIM) systems, which operate at the level of traffic intersections and manage the right-of-way for AVs, thereby improving flow and safety. AIM traditionally uses control policies based on simple rules. However, Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) can provide advanced control policies with the advantage of proactively reacting and forecasting hazardous situations. The main drawback of DRL is the training time, which is fast in simple tasks but not negligible when addressing real-world problems with multiple agents. Learning from Demonstrations (LfD) emerged to solve this problem, significantly speeding up training, and reducing the exploration problem. The challenge is that LfD requires an expert to extract new demonstrations. Therefore, in this paper, we propose the use of an agent, previously trained by imitation learning, to act as an expert to leverage LfD. We named this new agent Oracle, and our new approach was called Learning from Oracle Demonstrations (LfOD). We implemented this novel method over the DRL TD3 algorithm, incorporating significant changes to TD3 that allowed the use of Oracle demonstrations. The complete version was called TD3fOD. The results obtained in the AIM training scenario showed that TD3fOD notably improves the learning process compared with TD3 and DDPGfD, speeding up learning to 5-6 times, while the policy found offered both significantly lower variance and better learning ability. The testing scenario also showed a significant improvement in multiple key performance metrics compared with other vehicle control techniques on AIM, such as reducing waiting time by more than 90% and significantly decreasing fuel or electricity consumption and emissions, highlighting the benefits of LfOD.

DE underwater vehicles; preliminary designing method
AB This paper describes a method for preliminary designing the autonomous underwater vehicles (AUV), especially useful in the case when requirements concerning kinematic and dynamic parameters of vehicle motion are given in design assumptions. Concept of the method is based on dynamic equations which describe vehicle planar motion in vertical and horizontal directions, resulting from action of screw propellers or water ballast, respectively. The motion equations were determined by applying simplifications concerning both geometrical description of vehicle's form and flow phenomena. Their solutions were obtained in the form of closed analytical expressions which are both of cognitive and practical merits as they can serve to assess influence of vehicle's design parameters on its motion characteristics and simultaneously are convenient to formulate design optimization problems. Application of the method was illustrated by the attached examples dealing with determination of kinematic and dynamic characteristics of motion of the vehicle "Scylla" of set geometrical configuration and propulsion parameters.

ID IN-VEHICLE
AB Connected and autonomous vehicles (CAVs) present exciting opportunities for the improvement of both the mobility of people and the efficiency of transportation systems. The small computers in autonomous vehicles (CAVs) are referred to as electronic control units (ECUs) and are often perceived as being a component of a broader cyber-physical system. Subsystems of ECUs are often networked together via a variety of in-vehicle networks (IVNs) so that data may be exchanged, and the vehicle can operate more efficiently. The purpose of this work is to explore the use of machine learning and deep learning methods in defence against cyber threats to autonomous cars. Our primary emphasis is on identifying erroneous information implanted in the data buses of various automobiles. In order to categorise this type of erroneous data, the gradient boosting method is used, providing a productive illustration of machine learning. To examine the performance of the proposed model, two real datasets, namely the Car-Hacking and UNSE-NB15 datasets, were used. Real automated vehicle network datasets were used in the verification process of the proposed security solution. These datasets included spoofing, flooding and replay attacks, as well as benign packets. The categorical data were transformed into numerical form via pre-processing. Machine learning and deep learning algorithms, namely k-nearest neighbour (KNN) and decision trees, long short-term memory (LSTM), and deep autoencoders, were employed to detect CAN attacks. According to the findings of the experiments, using the decision tree and KNN algorithms as machine learning approaches resulted in accuracy levels of 98.80% and 99%, respectively. On the other hand, the use of LSTM and deep autoencoder algorithms as deep learning approaches resulted in accuracy levels of 96% and 99.98%, respectively. The maximum accuracy was achieved when using the decision tree and deep autoencoder algorithms. Statistical analysis methods were used to analyse the results of the classification algorithms, and the determination coefficient measurement for the deep autoencoder was found to reach a value of R-2 = 95%. The performance of all of the models that were built in this way surpassed that of those already in use, with almost perfect levels of accuracy being achieved. The system developed is able to overcome security issues in IVNs.

AB Autonomous terrain traversal of articulated tracked robots can reduce operator cognitive load to enhance task efficiency and facilitate extensive deployment. We present a novel hybrid trajectory optimization method aimed at generating efficient, stable, and smooth traversal motions. To achieve this, we develop a planar robot-terrain contact model and divide the robot's motion into hybrid modes of driving and traversing. By using a generalized coordinate description, the configuration space dimension is reduced, which facilitates real-time planning. The hybrid trajectory optimization is transcribed into a nonlinear programming problem and divided into subproblems to be solved in a receding-horizon planning fashion. Mode switching is facilitated by associating optimized motion durations with a predefined traversal sequence. A multi-objective cost function is formulated to further improve the traversal performance. Additionally, map sampling, terrain simplification, and tracking controller modules are integrated into the autonomous terrain traversal system. Our approach is validated in simulation and real-world scenarios with the Searcher robotic platform. Comparative experiments with expert operator control and state-of-the-art methods show advantages in terms of time and energy efficiency, stability, and smoothness of motion.

AB Multiple object tracking (MOT) remains an open and challenging problem for autonomous vehicles. Existing methods mainly ignore prior information from real traffic scenes. Here, the authors propose a novel MOT algorithm that considers traffic safety for vulnerable road users. The proposed method integrates two attention modules with a novel detection refinement strategy. Since skilled drivers pay more attention to pedestrians and cyclists, the authors employ a saliency detection method to extract scene attention region. Then, a detection refinement strategy achieved a good trade-off between parallel single object trackers and detection results. Channel attention can mine the most useful feature channel for traffic road users. In the end, the authors operate their method on the popular MOT 17 benchmark in comparison with other high-level MOT algorithms.

AB Robust and efficient vehicle detection is an important task of environment perception of intelligent vehicles, which directly affects the behavior decision-making and motion planning of intelligent vehicles. Due to the rapid development of sensor and computer technology, the algorithm and technology of vehicle detection have been updated rapidly. But, there are few reviews on vehicle detection of intelligent vehicles, especially covering all kinds of sensors and algorithms in recent years. This article presents a comprehensive review of vehicle detection approaches and their applications in intelligent vehicle systems to analyze the development of vehicle detection, with a specific focus on sensor types and algorithm classification. First, more than 300 research contributions are summarized in this review, including all kinds of vehicle detection sensors (machine vision, millimeter-wave radar, lidar, and multisensor fusion), and the performance of the classic and latest algorithms was compared in detail. Then, the application scenarios of vehicle detection with different sensors and algorithms were analyzed according to their performance and applicability. Moreover, we also systematically summarized the methods of vehicle detection in adverse weather. Finally, the remaining challenges and future research trends were analyzed according to the development of intelligent vehicle sensors and algorithms.

AB Complete autonomous systems such as self-driving cars to ensure the high reliability and safety of humans need the most efficient combination of four-dimensional (4D) detection, exact localization, and artificial intelligent (AI) networking to establish a fully automated smart transportation system. At present, multiple integrated sensors such as light detection and ranging (LiDAR), radio detection and ranging (RADAR), and car cameras are frequently used for object detection and localization in the conventional autonomous transportation system. Moreover, the global positioning system (GPS) is used for the positioning of autonomous vehicles (AV). These individual systems' detection, localization, and positioning efficiency are insufficient for AV systems. In addition, they do not have any reliable networking system for self-driving cars carrying us and goods on the road. Although the sensor fusion technology of car sensors came up with good efficiency for detection and location, the proposed convolutional neural networking approach will assist to achieve a higher accuracy of 4D detection, precise localization, and real-time positioning. Moreover, this work will establish a strong AI network for AV far monitoring and data transmission systems. The proposed networking system efficiency remains the same on under-sky highways as well in various tunnel roads where GPS does not work properly. For the first time, modified traffic surveillance cameras have been exploited in this conceptual paper as an external image source for AV and anchor sensing nodes to complete AI networking transportation systems. This work approaches a model that solves AVs' fundamental detection, localization, positioning, and networking challenges with advanced image processing, sensor fusion, feathers matching, and AI networking technology. This paper also provides an experienced AI driver concept for a smart transportation system with deep learning technology.

AB This paper presents autonomous guidance strategies for both solo and group of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), to be used when emergency conditions are encountered during mission. Fixed-wing UAVs equipped with batteries that serve as on-board power source are considered. They are also equipped with inertial and supervisory satellite-based navigation system. An emergency condition where limited available on-board power along with nonavailability of both ground command link and satellite-based navigation information is considered. We proposed two guidance strategies, look-lock-land and inject-contribute-exit for single- and multiple-UAV missions. An optimization model is developed to arrive at the maximum area that can be covered by spiral trajectory without violating on-board power constraints. In addition, we also proved that spiral trajectory acts like a circular highway for multiple-UAV missions. Algorithms to achieve look-lock-land, inject-contribute-exit and to compute Inertial Navigation Systems (INS) error correction factor are discussed. The performance of the proposed autonomous emergency guidance strategies is demonstrated on a sea-based oil-well-monitoring mission.

AB When operating autonomous surface vessels in uncertain environments with dynamic obstacles, planning safe trajectories and evaluating collision risk is key to navigating safely. In order to perform these tasks, it is important to have a computationally efficient and adaptable obstacle representation to allow for quick and robust predictions of the obstacle trajectory. This paper presents a novel space-time obstacle representation, which is able to predict the reachable set for a dynamic obstacle under uncertainty. This is done by projecting the area occupied by the obstacle forward in time, using a set of velocities representing the possible maneuvers that the obstacle may take. Under some mild assumptions, we show how the space-time obstacle can be implemented in a computationally efficient way, using both convex polytopes and ellipsoids. Additionally, we show how the space-time obstacle representation can be used for risk assessment, collision avoidance and trajectory planning for autonomous surface vessels.

AB The use of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) has become ubiquitous in a broadening range of applications, including many civilian uses. UAVs are typically categorized into two categories: conventional fixed-wing aircraft, which are associated with efficient flight over long distances, and rotor-craft, which are associated with short flights requiring maneuverability. An emerging class of UAVs, agile fixed-wing UAVs, are bridging the gap between fixed-wing and rotor-craft with efficient and maneuverable flight capabilities. This article presents a single physics-based controller capable of aerobatic maneuvering of agile fixed-wing UAVs. We first demonstrate autonomous flight in a conventional high-fidelity in-house simulation with this controller, and then implement the algorithm on a Pixhawk micro-controller. A hardware-in-the-loop (HIL) environment is developed and used to further develop autonomous aerobatic flight, followed by outdoor flight tests in windy conditions. Our control system successfully tracks position and orientation times histories to achieve autonomous extreme aerobatic maneuvers including knife-edge, rolling Harrier, hover, and aggressive turnaround.

AB Perception algorithms are essential for autonomous or semi-autonomous vehicles to perceive the semantics of their surroundings, including object detection, panoptic segmentation, and tracking. Decision-making in case of safety-critical situations, like autonomous emergency braking and collision avoidance, relies on the outputs of these algorithms. This makes it essential to correctly assess such perception systems before their deployment and to monitor their performance when in use. It is difficult to test and validate these systems, particularly at runtime, due to the high-level and complex representations of their outputs. This paper presents an overview of different existing metrics used for the evaluation of LiDAR-based perception systems, emphasizing particularly object detection and tracking algorithms due to their importance in the final perception outcome. Along with generally used metrics, we also discuss the impact of Planning KL-Divergence (PKL), Timed Quality Temporal Logic (TQTL), and Spatio-temporal Quality Logic (STQL) metrics on object detection algorithms. In the case of panoptic segmentation, Panoptic Quality (PQ) and Parsing Covering (PC) metrics are analysed resorting to some pretrained models. Finally, it addresses the application of diverse metrics to evaluate different pretrained models with the respective perception algorithms on publicly available datasets. Besides the identification of the various metrics being proposed, their performance and influence on models are also assessed after conducting new tests or reproducing the experimental results of the reference under consideration.

AB Multitarget tracking is an important task for autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs). Due to the limited space on AUVs, the aperture of the sonar array mounted on an AUV is small. The finite resolution of AUV sonar systems results in weak targets being masked by strong targets when they are close in angular space, leading to the trajectory fracture problem of weak targets in the azimuth crossing scenario. To address this problem, an augmented state Gaussian mixture probability hypothesis density (GM-PHD) filter is proposed. Since the acoustic signals radiated by targets contain some narrowband discrete components (known simply as tonals or lines), we focus on leveraging the tonals to enhance tracking performance. First, we model the augmented state dynamics, which contain both direction-of-arrival (DOA) and tonal components, and DOA tracks can be generated by the augmented state GM-PHD filter. Second, track segments are clustered by the modified density-based spatial clustering of applications with noise (DBSCAN) algorithm according to the estimated tonals. Finally, track segments with the same clustering results are associated with the same target, and the track stitching method is applied to overcome the trajectory fracture problem. The effectiveness of the algorithm is verified by simulation experiments in different scenarios.

AB Previous studies have highlighted inequalities and gender differences in the transport system. Some factors or fairness characteristics (FCs) strongly influence gender fairness in the transport system. The difference with previous studies, which focus on general concepts, is the incorporation of level 3 FCs, which are more detailed aspects or measures that can be implemented by companies or infrastructure managers and operators in order to increase fairness and inclusion in each use case. The aim of this paper is to find computational solutions, Bayesian networks, and analytic hierarchy processes capable of hierarchizing level 3 FCs and to predict by simulation their values in the case of applying some improvements. This methodology was applied to data from women in four use cases: railway transport, autonomous vehicles, bicycle sharing stations, and transport employment. The results showed that fairer railway transport requires increased personal space, hospitality rooms, help points, and helpline numbers. For autonomous vehicles, the perception of safety, security, and sustainability should be increased. The priorities for bicycle sharing stations are safer cycling paths avoiding hilly terrains and introducing electric bicycles, child seats, or trailers to carry cargo. In transport employment, the priorities are fair recruitment and promotion processes and the development of family-friendly policies.

ID PARKING LOTS
AB At public parking facility, electric vehicles (EVs) restore their depleted batteries at dedicated parking lots with charging points. An EV that has been charged may continue to occupy the parking lot and thus, blocking other EVs from using the limited number of charging points. We propose to decouple the parking need from charging need through the use of an autonomous robot-like mobile charger, which can roam freely in the parking area to reach each EV location for charging. Such mobile charger has an energy storage to temporarily hold energy from power grid before using it to charge EVs. The energy storage lifetime can be affected by frequent charging and discharging cycles. This paper proposes a scheme called demand dependent mobile charger configuration (DDMCC) to dynamically control the mobile charger operation parameters to extend the energy storage lifetime. Specifically, DDMCC determines the depth of discharge (DOD) for each service cycle and the charging rate for each EV, depending on the instantaneous charging demand. By using the smallest DOD and the lowest charging rate, we show that DDMCC can achieve a significantly longer storage lifetime compared to a baseline greedy scheme. Specifically, for a 50& x0025; EV penetration level, DDMCC can extend the storage lifetime to more than 7 years.

AB Low-level control of autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) has been extensively addressed by classical control techniques. However, the variable operating conditions and hostile environments faced by AUVs have driven researchers towards the formulation of adaptive control approaches. The reinforcement learning (RL) paradigm is a powerful framework which has been applied in different formulations of adaptive control strategies for AUVs. However, the limitations of RL approaches have lead towards the emergence of deep reinforcement learning which has become an attractive and promising framework for developing real adaptive control strategies to solve complex control problems for autonomous systems. However, most of the existing applications of deep RL use video images to train the decision making artificial agent but obtaining camera images only for an AUV control purpose could be costly in terms of energy consumption. Moreover, the rewards are not easily obtained directly from the video frames. In this work we develop a deep RL framework for adaptive control applications of AUVs based on an actor-critic goal-oriented deep RL architecture, which takes the available raw sensory information as input and as output the continuous control actions which are the low-level commands for the AUV's thrusters. Experiments on a real AUV demonstrate the applicability of the stated deep RL approach for an autonomous robot control problem. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

DE extremum seeking; autonomous agents; underwater vehicles
AB We consider the problem of seeking the source of a scalar signal using an autonomous vehicle modeled as the non-holonomic unicycle and equipped with a sensor of that scalar signal but not possessing the capability to sense either the position of the source nor its own position. We assume that the signal field is the strongest at the source and decays away from it. The functional form of the field is not available to our vehicle. We employ extremunt seeking to estimate the gradient of the field in real time and steer the vehicle towards the point where the gradient is zero (the maximum of the field, i.e., the location of the source). We employ periodic forward-backward movement of the unicycle (implementable with mobile robots and some underwater vehicles but not with aircraft), where the forward velocity has a tunable bias term, which is appropriately combined with extremum seeking to produce a net effect of "drifting" towards the source. In addition to simulation results we present a local convergence proof via averaging, which exhibits a delicate periodic structure with two sinusoids of different frequencies-one related to the angular velocity of the unicycle and the other related to the probing frequency of extremum seeking.

DT Article
DE Faster R-CNN algorithm; preceding vehicle detection; vehicle speed;
   random anchors; penalty coefficient
AB At present, preceding vehicle detection remains a challenging problem for autonomous vehicle technologies. In recent years, deep learning has been shown to be successful for vehicle detection, such as the faster region with a convolutional neural network (Faster R-CNN). However, when the host vehicle speed increases or there is an occlusion in front, the performance of the Faster R-CNN algorithm usually degrades. To obtain better performance on preceding vehicle detection when the speed of the host vehicle changes, a speed classification random anchor (SCRA) method is proposed. The reasons for degraded detection accuracy when the host vehicle speed increases are analyzed, and the factor of vehicle speed is introduced to redesign the anchors. Redesigned anchors can adapt to changes of the preceding vehicle size rule when the host vehicle speed increases. Furthermore, to achieve better performance on occluded vehicles, a Q-square penalty coefficient (Q-SPC) method is proposed to optimize the Faster R-CNN algorithm. The experimental validation results show that compared with the Faster R-CNN algorithm, the SCRA and Q-SPC methods have certain significance for improving preceding vehicle detection accuracy.

AB In this paper, we designed from scratch, realized, and characterized a six-channel EEG wearable headband for the measurement of stress-related brain activity during driving. The headband transmits data over WiFi to a laptop, and the rechargeable battery life is 10 h of continuous transmission. The characterization manifested a measurement error of 6 mu V in reading EEG channels, and the bandwidth was in the range [0.8, 44] Hz, while the resolution was 50 nV exploiting the oversampling technique. Thanks to the full metrological characterization presented in this paper, we provide important information regarding the accuracy of the sensor because, in the literature, commercial EEG sensors are used even if their accuracy is not provided in the manuals. We set up an experiment using the driving simulator available in our laboratory at the University of Udine; the experiment involved ten volunteers who had to drive in three scenarios: manual, autonomous vehicle with a "gentle " approach, and autonomous vehicle with an "aggressive " approach. The aim of the experiment was to assess how autonomous driving algorithms impact EEG brain activity. To our knowledge, this is the first study to compare different autonomous driving algorithms in terms of drivers' acceptability by means of EEG signals. The obtained results demonstrated that the estimated power of beta waves (related to stress) is higher in the manual with respect to autonomous driving algorithms, either "gentle " or "aggressive ".

AB Camera and GPS technologies are often used in aerial vehicles for autonomous tracking and landing on ground moving vehicles. However, these technologies limit the accuracy of an aerial vehicle especially in critical landing situations. As a result, additional sensors may require to achieve higher precision specially while landing on slightly maneuvering target. This paper presents a novel approach for tracking and then smooth and accurate landing of a quadcopter on slow or non-maneuvering ground moving target. In the present approach, the quadcopter does not use camera or any other vision sensor which required heavy processing. The quadcopter is equipped with a rotating ultrasonic sensor which continuously senses the ground moving target in an open and obstacle free environment. The Euclidean distance between the initial positions of the quadcopter and the target were kept less than the range of the used ultrasonic sensor. The maximum velocity of the quadcopter is assumed faster than the target to ensure the target in the quadcopter's sensing range during the operation. The performance of the quadcopter is observed in terms of the time taken and the distance travelled in tracking phase and landing phase. The simulation results are further verified by the hardware results in real-time environment.

AB A field experiment was conducted aiming to shed light on how drivers negotiate an ambiguous traffic situation when encountering an autonomous vehicle (AV) in the presence of a yielding intention signal (AV with eHMI) or not (AV without eHMI). A traffic conflict scenario was created with two opposing vehicles instructed to perform a left turn at a four-way junction, at the same point in time. Forty participants were assigned to two groups encountering either an AV with eHMI or an AV without eHMI. To check for equivalence across the two groups, both groups also encountered a conventional vehicle (CV). Results showed that the two groups performed similarly during encounters with a CV. During encounters with AV, however, participants provided with the eHMI maintained higher speed before the AV and finished their maneuver quicker than when they were not provided with eHMI. Additionally participants provided with eHMI rated higher their ability to infer the AV intention before coming to a full-stop than those provided without eHMI. The above findings indicate that the presence of eHMI on AV can accelerate drivers' inferences about yielding intention of an AV, and have the potential to optimize AV-driver interaction in ambiguous traffic situations.

AB China has very long coastline, but special surface conditions make it very difficult to conduct ground magnetic and marine geomagnetic surveys over beach-shallow sea transition areas such as mariculture areas, harbours, and wharfs; as a result, marine survey data cannot be linked to continental survey data, giving rise to missing data. To address this issue, an aeromagnetic survey technology based on an unmanned autonomous helicopter is proposed. Not only is an unmanned autonomous helicopter capable of aeromagnetic surveying the beach-shallowsea transition area inaccessible to vehicles and vessels but its high efficiency and low cost also enable it to be deployed on a vessel, thus making it suitable for aeromagnetic surveying oceanic islands, too. The setup of the aeromagnetic survey system based on an unmanned aerial vehicle ( UAV) is introduced, and its trial flight information and processed and analysed magnetic survey data obtained in trial flights are discussed. The measurement accuracy of UAV aeromagnetic data is shown to be comparable to that of marine geomagnetic survey data, and the system effectively compensates for missing magnetic data from inshore and continentocean transition zones.

AB In a typical operation mode, a wheel loader frequently accelerates and decelerates, and the curvature of the driving path is inconsistent. In the past, autonomous vehicle trajectory planning has not considered the related changes in the velocity of the vehicle. Therefore, the trajectory tracking control process has seldom considered the impact of curving paths on the trajectory tracking performance. To address these problems, this study evaluated an autonomous wheel loader based on the trajectory of its non-uniform driving motion and constructed an adaptive model predictive control (AMPC) trajectory tracking system that considers disturbances in the path curvature. The trajectory of the autonomous wheel loader was then tracked using the proposed AMPC system with a planned non-uniform motion trajectory as the target. Its performance was then compared with that of a conventional model predictive control (MPC) trajectory tracking system that does not consider any path curvature disturbances. The maximum displacement error and heading error obtained by the proposed AMPC system were found to be 65.7% and 60%, respectively, smaller than those obtained by the MPC system. The desired trajectory can also be tracked well under different curvature amplitudes using the AMPC trajectory tracking system, ensuring active safety performance of an autonomous wheel loader in the process of trajectory tracking.

AB Autonomous Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAV) for planetary exploration missions require increased onboard mission-planning and decision-making capabilities to access full operational potential in remote environments (e.g., Antarctica, Mars or Titan). However, the uncertainty introduced by the environment and the limitation of available sensors has presented challenges for planning such missions. Partially Observable Markov Decision Processes (POMDPs) are commonly used to enable decision-making and mission-planning processes that account for environmental, perceptional (extrinsic) and actuation (intrinsics) uncertainty. Here, we propose the UAV4PE framework, a testing framework for autonomous UAV missions using POMDP formulations. This framework integrates modular components for simulation, emulation, UAV guidance, navigation and mission planning. State-of-the-art tools such as python, C++, ROS, PX4 and JuliaPOMDP are employed by the framework, and we used python data-science libraries for the analysis of the experimental results. The source code and the experiment data are included in the UAV4PE framework. The POMDP formulation proposed here was able to plan and command a UAV-based planetary exploration mission in simulation, emulation and real-world experiments. The experiments evaluated key indicators such as the mission success rate, the surface area explored and the number of commands (actions) executed. We also discuss future work aimed at improving the UAV4PE framework, and the autonomous UAV mission planning formulation for planetary exploration.

   preference choice experiment; State of Qatar
AB Autonomous mobility is gaining increasing attraction in the international setting that results in a growing body of literature on various aspects. Preferences regarding the use of autonomous vehicles as an alternative transport mode are investigated in western and advanced countries as it provides the notion about what fraction of population will more inclined towards such technology and under what circumstances. This study focused on investigating travel preferences regarding autonomous mobility (in the form of privately owned AV (PAV) and shared AV (SAV) (such as on-demand taxi service). As a case study, the State of Qatar is studied and analyzed. A stated preference survey was designed and executed in a web-based questionnaire platform. Overall, data from n = 315 respondents were analyzed, and travel mode choice behavior was modeled using a logit model for the examination of travelers' preferences. The results indicate that there exists a reluctance to prefer PAV and SAV, over a regular car (NC) while public transport (PT) is the least preferred mode. The comfort level that a vehicle can offer is found to be one of the most important factors for Qatari residents. Students and unemployed individuals have shown an inclination towards SAV while full-time employed individuals have shown a higher preference for PAVs. These results are helpful for government agencies and AVs marketing companies to develop plans and policies in line with travelers' preferences.

AB Among the key technologies of Autonomous Underwater Vehicle (AUV) leader-follower formations control, formation reconfiguration technology is one of the main technologies to ensure that multiple AUVs successfully complete their tasks in a complex operating environment. The biggest drawback of the leader-follower formations technology is the failure of the leader and the excessive communication pressure of the leader. Aiming at the problem of leader failure in multi- AUV leader-follower formations, the Hungarian algorithm is used to reconstruct the failed formation with a minimum cost, and the improvement of the Hungarian algorithm can solve the problem of a non-standard assignment. In order to solve the problem of an increased leader communication task after formation reconfiguration, the application of an event-triggered mechanism (ETM) can reduce unnecessary and useless communication, while the efficiency of the ETM can be improved through increasing the event-triggered conditions of the sampling error threshold. The simulation results of multi-AUV formation control show that the Hungarian algorithm proposed in this paper can deal with the leader failure in the multi-AUV leader-follower formation, and the ETM designed in this paper can reduce about 90% of the communication traffic of the formation which also proves the highly efficient performance of the improved ETM in the paper.

AB In this work, a study was carried out to estimate a look-up table (LUT) that converts a camera image plane to a birds eye view (BEV) plane using a single camera. The traditional camera pose estimation fields require high costs in researching and manufacturing autonomous vehicles for the future and may require pre-configured infra. This paper proposes an autonomous vehicle driving camera calibration system that is low cost and utilizes low infra. A network that outputs an image in the form of an LUT that converts the image into a BEV by estimating the camera pose under urban road driving conditions using a single camera was studied. We propose a network that predicts human-like poses from a single image. We collected synthetic data using a simulator, made BEV and LUT as ground truth, and utilized the proposed network and ground truth to train pose estimation function. In the progress, it predicts the pose by deciphering the semantic segmentation feature and increases its performance by attaching a layer that handles the overall direction of the network. The network outputs camera angle (roll/pitch/yaw) on the 3D coordinate system so that the user can monitor learning. Since the network's output is a LUT, there is no need for additional calculation, and real-time performance is improved.

DE Autonomous vehicle; combinatorial double auction; public transportation

AB The autonomous vehicle (AV) is expected to be an important "building block" of the future smart city. Recently, an AV-based public transportation system has been successfully developed to provide precise, effective, and intelligent public transportation services. For better quality of service, the system encourages market competition by accommodating multiple AV operators. To facilitate the pricing process, a pricing mechanism was developed but it can only process one service request each time. This can significantly impair the overall passenger admissibility, especially when there are many outstanding requests to be processed. In this paper, we redesign the pricing mechanism for handling multiple requests simultaneously. To do this, we formulate the key component of the mechanism, i.e., request-AV allocation, as a double combinatorial auction-based process. We construct a new winner determination problem that can accommodate requests of different AVservice types. We also investigate its duality to devise an efficient service charge determination rule. We evaluate the performance of the proposed mechanism and charging rule with extensive simulations. The results show that the mechanism can result in better social welfare than the original scheme. Moreover, we examine the computational time required and the percentage of successfully served passengers. The simulations demonstrate that the mechanism can make theAVpublic transportation system more practical.

AB A nonlinear inertial-aided image-based visual servo control approach for the stabilization of (almost) fully actuated autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) is proposed. It makes use of the homography matrix between two images of a planar scene as feedback information while the system dynamics are exploited in a cascade manner in a control design: An outer-loop control defines a reference setpoint based on the homography matrix and an inner-loop control ensures the stabilization of the setpoint by assigning the thrust and torque controls. Unlike conventional solutions that only consider the system kinematics, the proposed control scheme is novel in considering the full system dynamics (incorporating all degrees of freedom, nonlinearities, and couplings, as well as interactions with the surrounding fluid) and in not requiring information of the relative depth and normal vector of the observed scene. Augmented with integral corrections, the proposed controller is robust with respect to model uncertainties and disturbances. The almost global asymptotic stability of the closed-loop system is demonstrated, which is the largest domain of attraction one can achieve by means of continuous feedback control. Simulation results illustrating these properties on a realistic AUV model subjected to a sea current are presented and finally experimental results on a real AUV are reported.

AB Automatic steering system of self-driving vehicles has significant influence on vehicle safety. The performance of automatic steering system is affected by external disturbance, parameter perturbation, and real-time ability of control algorithm. First, to develop a high-performance automatic steering control strategy, a vehicle-road system model based on vehicle dynamics and kinematics is established. Then, the system state equation with direction-angle and lateral-position deviations is derived to describe the tracking accuracy. Finally, based on the sliding mode variable structure control method, an automatic steering control algorithm is proposed and verified. The results show that the dynamic quality of the system is improved with the optimization of the sliding mode. Furthermore, good robustness against vehicular velocity, real-time performance, and tracking accuracy is achieved.

TI Vehicle-to-Vehicle Collaborative Graph-Based Proprioceptive Localization
SO IEEE ROBOTICS AND AUTOMATION LETTERS
LA English
DT Article
DE Localization; autonomous vehicle navigation; multi-robot systems
AB Proprioceptive localization (PL) refers to robot or vehicle egocentric localization methods that do not rely on the perception and recognition of external landmarks. These methods depend on a prior map and proprioceptive sensors such as inertial measurement units and/or wheel encoders. PL is intended to be a low-cost and fallback solution when everything else fails due to bad weather or poor environmental conditions. With the development of communication technology, vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) communication enables information exchange between vehicles. It becomes possible to leverage V2V communication to develop a multiple vehicle/robot collaborative localization scheme. Named as collaborative graph-based proprioceptive localization (C-GBPL), we extract heading-length sequence from the trajectory as features. When rendezvousing with other vehicles, the ego vehicle aggregates the features from others and forms a merged query graph. We match the query graph with a pre-processed heading-length graph (HLG) abstracted from a prior map to localize the vehicle under a graph-to-graph matching approach. We have implemented our algorithm and tested it in both simulated and physical experiments. The C-GBPL algorithm significantly outperforms its single-vehicle counterpart in localization speed and robustness to trajectory and map degeneracy.

AB Collision avoidance planning has always been a hot and important issue in the field of unmanned aircraft research. In this article, we describe an online collision avoidance planning algorithm for autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) autonomous navigation, which relies on its own active sonar sensor to detect obstacles. The improved particle swarm optimization (I-PSO) algorithm is used to complete the path planning of the AUV under the known environment, and we use it as a benchmark to improve the fitness function and inertia weight of the algorithm. Traditional path-planning algorithms rely on accurate environment maps, where re-adapting the generated path can be highly demanding in terms of computational cost. We propose a deep reinforcement learning (DRL) algorithm based on collision avoidance tasks. The algorithm discussed in this paper takes into account the relative position of the target point and the rate of heading change from the previous timestep. Its reward function considers the target point, running time and turning angle at the same time. Compared with the LSTM structure, the Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) network has fewer parameters, which helps to save training time. A series of simulation results show that the proposed deep deterministic policy gradient (DDPG) algorithm can obtain excellent results in simple and complex environments.

AB Critical issues with current detection systems are their susceptibility to adverse weather conditions and constraint on the vertical field view of the radars limiting the ability of such systems to accurately detect the height of the targets. In this paper, a novel multi-range radar (MRR) arrangement (i.e. triple: long-range, medium-range, and short-range radars) based on the sensor fusion technique is investigated that can detect objects of different sizes in a level 2 advanced driver-assistance system. To improve the accuracy of the detection system, the resilience of the MRR approach is investigated using the Monte Carlo (MC) method for the first time. By adopting MC framework, this study shows that only a handful of fine-scaled computations are required to accurately predict statistics of the radar detection failure, compared to many expensive trials. The results presented huge computational gains for such a complex problem. The MRR approach improved the detection reliability with an increased mean detection distance (4.9% over medium range and 13% over long range radar) and reduced standard deviation over existing methods (30% over medium range and 15% over long-range radar). This will help establishing a new path toward faster and cheaper development of modern vehicle detection systems.

AB Aiming to address the trajectory tracking problem of vector propulsion autonomous underwater vehicles (vector AUVs) under complex sea conditions, this paper proposes a dynamic control system based on vector propulsion (DS-Vector). The vector AUV has the vector characteristics of four tilt thrusters and is highly maneuverable. Based on the approximate kinematics and dynamics equations of the vector AUV under the action of current disturbance obtained through analysis, the proposed DS-Vector has a motion control module and force distri-bution control module. The motion control module adopts the control method by combining the nonsingular fast terminal sliding mode control based on an adaptive disturbance observer (NTSMC-ADO) and PID control law, while the force distribution control module selects the least square (LS) method. The effectiveness and robustness of the proposed DS-Vector are verified in an underwater visual simulation environment. To verify the superiority of the NTSMC-ADO designed in this paper, three other advanced control laws are used in DS-Vector for com-parison. The results show that NTSMC-ADO has better anticurrent interference and better position tracking control response and is more robust than the other three advanced control laws.

AB We present results from a coordinated frontal survey in Fram Strait in summer 2016 using an autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) combined with shipboard and zodiac-based hydrographic measurements. Based on satellite information, we identified a front between warm Atlantic Water and cold Polar Water. The AUV, equipped with oceanographic and biogeochemical sensors, profiled the upper 50 m along a 10 km-long cross-front oriented transect resulting in a high-resolution snapshot of the upper ocean. The transect was dominated by a 6 km-wide, 10 m-thick subsurface patch of high chlorophyll, located near the euphotic depth within a band of cold water. Nitrate was depleted in the surface, but abundant below the pycnocline. Potential vorticity and Richardson number estimates indicate conditions favorable for vertical mixing, which indicates that the high chlorophyll patch may have been sustained by upward nitrate fluxes. Our observations underline the complex hydrographic and biogeochemical structure in a region featuring fronts and meanders, and further underline the patchy and small-scale nature of subsurface phytoplankton blooms potentially fueled by submesoscale dynamics, which are easily missed by traditional surveys and satellite missions.</p>

AB Public opinion on autonomous vehicles (AVs) is an important topic as AVs are expected to change the transportation system dramatically. Although the topic has been discussed extensively by many researchers and experts, it is beneficial to complement current studies by explaining the AVrelated sentiment variations leveraging the unique social media features. Different from traditional survey-based studies, this study relies on tweets to understand the sentiments on AVs. A comprehensive model framework is proposed to categorize sentiments, recognize critical dates with sentiment changes, and explain sentiment variations. The results indicate that the general sentiment is positive towards AVs, but social media users have sentiment biases towards different AV terms. Significant sentiment changes are often linked with major social events related to AVs, and the general public is more sensitive to social events than the most active users. A wide range of policy insights are discussed based on the results of the analyses, including policies related to safety, pricing, unemployment, and AV adoption rate. Possible challenges and the corresponding strategies are also discussed. These insights will be helpful for the public agencies, automobile manufacturers, and technology companies in gaining a better understanding of AV adoption, and in preparing for the future of transportation systems.

AB Trust is a major determinant of acceptance of an autonomous vehicle (AV), and a lack of appropriate trust could prevent drivers and society in general from taking advantage of such technology. This paper makes a new attempt to explore the effects of personalised AVs as a novel approach to the cognitive underpinnings of drivers' trust in AVs. The personalised AV system is able to identify the driving behaviours of users and thus adapt the driving style of the AV accordingly. A prototype of a personalised AV was designed and evaluated in a lab-based experimental study of 36 human drivers, which investigated the impact of the personalised AV on user trust when compared with manual human driving and non-personalised AVs. The findings show that a personalised AV appears to be significantly more reliable through accepting and understanding each driver's behaviour, which could thereby increase a user's willingness to trust the system. Furthermore, a personalised AV brings a sense of familiarity by making the system more recognisable and easier for users to estimate the quality of the automated system. Personalisation parameters were also explored and discussed to support the design of AV systems to be more socially acceptable and trustworthy.

In this article, we first examine AVs and different categories of the technological risks associated with them. We then explore strategies that can be adopted to address these risks, and explore emerging responses by governments for addressing AV risks. Our analyses reveal that, thus far, governments have in most instances avoided stringent measures in order to promote AV developments and the majority of responses are non-binding and focus on creating councils or working groups to better explore AV implications. The US has been active in introducing legislations to address issues related to privacy and cybersecurity. The UK and Germany, in particular, have enacted laws to address liability issues; other countries mostly acknowledge these issues, but have yet to implement specific strategies. To address privacy and cybersecurity risks strategies ranging from introduction or amendment of non-AV specific legislation to creating working groups have been adopted. Much less attention has been paid to issues such as environmental and employment risks, although a few governments have begun programmes to retrain workers who might be negatively affected.

TI Policy Efforts to Promote the Adoption of Autonomous Vehicles: Subsidy

SO JOURNAL OF ADVANCED TRANSPORTATION

AB Autonomous vehicles (AVs) have the potential to improve safety, traffic capacity, and energy efficiency, but these advantages can only be realized when the AV market penetration is sufficiently high. To promote the adoption of AVs, it would be crucial for the government to take policy measures. This paper develops a two-stage model to explore the effects of subsidy and AV lanes' policies on AV adoption. In the first stage, given the subsidy policy, the vehicle manufacturer sets AV price to pursue maximum profit while anticipating the choice of consumers for AVs or conventional vehicles (CVs), from which the AV market penetration can be accessed. Subsequently, based on the AV market penetration acquired from the first stage model, an optimization model integrating the mixed traffic assignment is developed in the second stage to determine the time-dependent progressive AV lanes' deployment plan. The first and second stage models are solved using the simulation-optimization and genetic-algorithm-based approaches, respectively. Due to the mutual influence of the two models, an iterative optimization approach is applied to solve the whole model. Two numerical experiments are conducted, and the results demonstrate the positive effects of subsidy and AV lane policies on increasing AV market penetration. The analysis provides significant managerial insights for policymakers to promote the development of AVs.

AB Safety-critical systems such as Advanced Driving Assistance Systems and Autonomous Vehicles require redundancy to satisfy their safety requirements and to be classified as fail-operational. Introducing redundancy in a system with high data rates and processing requirements also has a great impact on architectural design decisions. The current self-driving vehicle prototypes do not use a standardized system architecture but base their design on existing vehicles and the available components. In this work, we provide a novel analysis framework that allows us to qualitatively and quantitatively evaluate an in-vehicle architecture topology and compare it with others. With this framework, we evaluate different variants of two common topologies: domain and zone-based architectures. Each topology is evaluated in terms of total cost, failure probability, total communication cable length, communication load distribution, and functional load distribution. We introduce redundancy in selected parts of the systems using our automated process provided in the framework, in a safety-oriented design process that enables the ISO26262 Automotive Safety Integrity Level decomposition technique. After every design step, the architecture is re-evaluated. The advantages and disadvantages of the different architecture variants are evaluated to guide the designer towards the choice of correct architecture, with a focus on the introduction of redundancy.

AB This article investigates the cooperative estimation problem to recover the parametric flow field through sensor measurements from an autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) team. We establish the parametric flow model that incorporates the concept of incompressibility to provide a physical property. Then, considering the influence of unknown flow field on AUVs' trajectories while submerged, we define: 1) the deviation between actual and predicted relative positions between each vehicle and its neighbors as an relative motion-integration error, which is available using local measurement and 2) the deviation between the actual and predicted position of each vehicle as an absolute motion-integration error, which is available from global positioning system (GPS) when the AUVs are on the sea surface. Based on relative and absolute motion-integration errors, we formulate a set of nonlinear equations to present the deterministic and continuous relationship between the above errors and the parametric flow model. To reconstruct the flow field, an iterative algorithm is proposed to estimate the model parameters by solving an inverse problem for these nonlinear equations. Moreover, a detailed convergence analysis of the proposed algorithm is given. Finally, simulations are conducted to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm in a simulated and real dataset of the flow field.

DE quadrotor unmanned aerial vehicle; deep reinforcement learning;
   autonomous tracking and landing
AB Unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) autonomous tracking and landing is playing an increasingly important role in military and civil applications. In particular, machine learning has been successfully introduced to robotics-related tasks. A novel UAV autonomous tracking and landing approach based on a deep reinforcement learning strategy is presented in this paper, with the aim of dealing with the UAV motion control problem in an unpredictable and harsh environment. Instead of building a prior model and inferring the landing actions based on heuristic rules, a model-free method based on a partially observable Markov decision process (POMDP) is proposed. In the POMDP model, the UAV automatically learns the landing maneuver by an end-to-end neural network, which combines the Deep Deterministic Policy Gradients (DDPG) algorithm and heuristic rules. A Modular Open Robots Simulation Engine (MORSE)-based reinforcement learning framework is designed and validated with a continuous UAV tracking and landing task on a randomly moving platform in high sensor noise and intermittent measurements. The simulation results show that when the moving platform is moving in different trajectories, the average landing success rate of the proposed algorithm is about 10% higher than that of the Proportional-Integral-Derivative (PID) method. As an indirect result, a state-of-the-art deep reinforcement learning-based UAV control method is validated, where the UAV can learn the optimal strategy of a continuously autonomous landing and perform properly in a simulation environment.

AB Future autonomous transportation is one of the most demanding application areas in terms of connectivity, as it has to simultaneously meet stringent criteria that do not typically go hand in hand, such as high throughput, low latency, high coverage/availability, high positioning and sensing accuracies, high security and robustness to interferences, etc. In order to meet the future demands of challenging applications, such as applications relying on autonomous vehicles, terrestrial networks are no longer sufficient and are to be augmented in the future with satellite-based networks. Among the emerging satellite networks, Low Earth Orbit (LEO) networks are able to provide advantages over traditional Medium Earth Orbit (MEO) and Geo-Stationary Earth Orbit (GEO) networks in terms of signal latency, cost, and performance. Nevertheless, several challenges exist in LEO system design, which have not been fully addressed in the existing literature. In particular, the problem of LEO-system optimization of design parameters is a multi-dimensional problem with many aspects to be considered. This paper offers a comprehensive survey of the LEO-system design parameters, of the challenges in LEO system design process, and of the optimization methods for satellite communication, positioning, and sensing applications, as well as a summarizing discussion on the design considerations for LEO-based networks to support future autonomous transportation.

AB Adaptive cruise control (ACC) vehicles are the first step toward comprehensive vehicle automation. However, the impacts of such vehicles on the underlying traffic flow are not yet clear. Therefore, it is of interest to accurately model vehicle-level dynamics of commercially available ACC vehicles so that they may be used in further modeling efforts to quantify the impact of commercially available ACC vehicles on traffic flow. Importantly, not only model selection but also the calibration approach and error metric used for calibration are critical to accurately model ACC vehicle behavior. In this work, we explore the question of how to calibrate car-following models to describe ACC vehicle dynamics. Specifically, we apply a multiobjective calibration approach to understand the trade-off between calibrating model parameters to minimize speed error versus spacing error. Three different car-following models are calibrated for data from seven vehicles. The results are in line with recent literature and verify that targeting a low spacing error does not compromise the speed accuracy whether the opposite is not true for modeling ACC vehicle dynamics.

AB Smart cities are becoming an essential part in most of the countries. Safety also becomes important when such transformations occur. Safety can be achieved with the help of autonomous vehicles. Adoption of AI has provided practical solutions to most of the autonomous driving problems. Extended Traffic sign recognition is important for advanced driver assistance systems, autonomous vehicles, and mobile robots to inform the driver about the potential hazard ahead. Several research on traffic sign recognition has been carried out in the past, and most existing works were focused on traffic signs. Although research works have been done for detecting traffic signs, still there is a need for detection of small construction zone traffic signs and road barriers with better accuracy. This paper aims to showcase the results obtained using state of art deep networks, namely DSOD, a variant of SSD, YOLOV3, YOLOv4 for detection of construction zone traffic signs from the video sequences captured by a camera mounted on a car. Further, the classification of signs is carried out using CNN, which uses the detector feature as input. In addition to that, tracking is performed to include the missed detections and exclude the false positives arrived during detection. The proposed approach can achieve a maximum of 90% accuracy with 0.5 IOU for the detection of construction zone signs and road barriers.

AB The proposed paper presents the design and development of the combined guidance and control strategies for the autonomous navigation of unmanned vessels characterised by azimuth-based thrust architecture. Autonomous marine vehicles (AMVs) are consolidated technological tools commonly employed for different tasks such as exploration, sampling and intervention. With the final aim of autonomous shipping, the AMVs capabilities have to be migrated and adapted towards the reliable and safe control of commercial-like unmanned vessels. These last are spreading thanks to a number of technological research projects. The employment of unconventional hull shapes combined with propulsive layout based on azimuth thrusters requires robust guidance techniques to provide precise and reliable motion control during navigation. The paper introduces a dual-loop guidance and control scheme able to provide advanced navigation capabilities. An inner control loop, devoted to the actuation of the azimuth thrusters, allows the tracking of reference course angle (namely the autopilot). Such a control loop is characterised by a modified PD regulation scheme, where a novel adaptive derivative component is inserted in order to improve the convergence curve towards the required course reference. The outer guidance loop, based on Lyapunov and virtual-target approach, allows the vessel to track generic desired paths, thus enhancing the autonomous navigation capabilities. The paper will provide a deep design and analysis approach for the developed techniques, as well as simulation results of the combined guidance and control scheme, proving the reliability of the proposed approach in different operative conditions.

AB Autonomous mission control, unlike automatic mission control which is generally pre-programmed to execute an intended mission, is guided by the philosophy of carrying out a complete mission on its own through online sensing, information processing, and control reconfiguration. A crucial cornerstone of this philosophy is the capability of intelligence and of information sharing between unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) or with a central controller through secured communication links. Though several mission control algorithms, for single and multiple UAVs, have been discussed in the literature, they lack a clear definition of the various autonomous mission control levels. In the conventional system, the ground pilot issues the flight and mission control command to a UAV through a command data link and the UAV transmits intelligence information, back to the ground pilot through a communication link. Thus, the success of the mission depends entirely on the information flow through a secured communication link between ground pilot and the UAV In the past, mission success depended on the continuous interaction of ground pilot with a single UAV, while present day applications are attempting to define mission success through efficient interaction of ground pilot with multiple UAVs. However, the current trend in UAV applications is expected to lead to a futuristic scenario where mission success would depend only on interaction among UAV groups with no interaction with any ground entity. However, to reach this capability level, it is necessary to first understand the various levels of autonomy and the crucial role that information and communication plays in making these autonomy levels possible. This article presents a detailed framework of UAV autonomous mission control levels in the context of information flow and communication between UAVs and UAV groups for each level of autonomy.

AB In this paper, we propose a platoon access authentication system for initial access process in autonomous vehicle platoons (AVPs) in which post-quantum encryption and signal processing techniques are employed to protect against both active and passive cyber-physical attacks. To avoid passive quantum cyber attacks, a quasi-cyclic moderate-density parity-check code is used to encode and decode AVP messages. Moreover, an independent component analysis-based signal separation technique is employed to eliminate the effect of high-power active cyber attacks on AVP messages. To measure the reliability of the system, we derive an analytical expression for the system failure probability, taking into account the influence of both the cyber and physical planes. The simulations show that the proposed system is effective against attacks and can help reduce system failures caused by intentional and unintentional adverse cyber-physical effects. The proposed system offers a potential solution to the challenge of protecting initial access while maintaining ultra-reliable low-latency communications between AVPs and the infrastructure.

AB Pedestrians and drivers are expected to safely navigate complex urban environments along with several non cooperating agents. Autonomous vehicles will soon replicate this capability. Each agent acquires a representation of the world from an egocentric perspective and must make decisions ensuring safety for itself and others. This requires to predict motion patterns of observed agents for a far enough future. In this paper we propose MANTRA, a model that exploits memory augmented networks to effectively predict multiple trajectories of other agents, observed from an egocentric perspective. Our model stores observations in memory and uses trained controllers to write meaningful pattern encodings and read trajectories that are most likely to occur in future. We show that our method is able to natively perform multi-modal trajectory prediction obtaining state-of-the art results on four datasets. Moreover, thanks to the non-parametric nature of the memory module, we show how once trained our system can continuously improve by ingesting novel patterns.

AB This paper presents a self-supervised learning-based terrain traversal cost prediction method that addresses different orientations and velocities to aid autonomous navigation in off-road environments. First, a cost prediction network is proposed to implement a mapping of the local terrain information around a vehicle to the traversal cost. Second, we propose an automatic data collection and self-labelling algorithm to achieve self-supervised learning for this network. Third, we proposed a map-free navigation strategy aimed at the terrain obstacles. This strategy incorporates the traversal cost prediction into a sampling-based trajectory planner, enabling the consideration of traversal orientation and velocity when estimating the traversal cost. Finally, both the proposed prediction method and the navigation strategy are extensively compared. The results show that our proposed traversability estimation method outperforms existing methods using convolutional neural networks (CNNs). Simultaneously, in both simulation and real-world experiments, our approach exhibits effective and safe autonomous navigation capabilities in off-road environments.

AB ABSRACT An autonomous emergency braking (AEB) algorithm for snow-asphalt joint pavement is proposed. Based on machine vision and kinetic analysis, we realize the identification of road information, including the road type, slope, and road section lengths. A new safety model, the reference velocity model, is proposed to solve the problem of determining the braking time on the joint pavement to achieve collision avoidance. In the asphalt section, we design the desired deceleration considering the comfort and safety, while in the snow section, we use the estimated maximum deceleration that the pavement can provide. To meet the desired deceleration requirement, we choose a single-neuron proportion integration differentiation (PID) controller with a Kalman filter. The joint simulation with CarSim and Simulink shows that the host vehicle successfully realizes collision avoidance in various working conditions and verifies the proposed AEB algorithm. Benefitting by the recognition of the forefront road conditions, our proposed model performs better than the traditional AEB model.

ID STATE ESTIMATION
AB Velocity estimation plays a central role in driverless vehicles, but standard, and affordable methods struggle to cope with extreme scenarios like aggressive maneuvers due to the presence of high sideslip. To solve this, autonomous race cars are usually equipped with expensive external velocity sensors. In this letter, we present an end-to-end recurrent neural network that takes available raw sensors as input (IMU, wheel odometry, and motor currents), and outputs velocity estimates. The results are compared to two state-of-the-art Kalman filters, which respectively include, and exclude expensive velocity sensors. All methods have been extensively tested on a formula student driverless race car with very high sideslip (10 degrees at the rear axle), and slip ratio (approximate to 20%), operating close to the limits of handling. The proposed network is able to estimate lateral velocity up to 15x better than the Kalman filter with the equivalent sensor input, and matches (0.06 m/s RMSE) the Kalman filter with the expensive velocity sensor setup.

AB The issue of controlling a swarm of autonomous unmanned surface vehicles (USVs) in a practical maritime environment is studied in this paper. A hierarchical control framework associated with control algorithms for the USV swarm is proposed. In order to implement the distributed control of the autonomous swarm, the control framework is divided into three task layers. The first layer is the tele-operated task layer, which delivers the human operator's command to the remote USV swarm. The second layer deals with autonomous tasks (i.e. swarm dispersion, or avoidance of obstacles and/or inner-USV collisions), which are defined by specific mathematical functions. The third layer is the control allocation layer, in which the control inputs are designed by applying the sliding mode control method. The motion controller is proved asymptotically stable by using the Lyapunov method. Numerical simulation of USV swarm motion is used to verify the effectiveness of the control framework.

AB This paper presents a new tracking system for autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) navigating in a close formation, based on computer vision and the use of active light markers. While acoustic localization can be very effective from medium to long distances, it is not so advantageous in short distances when the safety of the vehicles requires higher accuracy and update rates. The proposed system allows the estimation of the pose of a target vehicle at short ranges, with high accuracy and execution speed. To extend the field of view, an omnidirectional camera is used. This camera provides a full coverage of the lower hemisphere and enables the concurrent tracking of multiple vehicles in different positions. The system was evaluated in real sea conditions by tracking vehicles in mapping missions, where it demonstrated robust operation during extended periods of time.

AB Active degrees of freedom provide a robotic vehicle the ability to enhance its performance in all terrain conditions. While active suspension systems are now commonplace in on-road vehicles, their application to off-road terrains has been little investigated. A fundamental component of such an application is a need to translate desired body motion commands into actuator values through the use of proprioceptive algorithms. The diverse nature of the terrains that might be encountered places variable demands upon the operation of the vehicle. This entails the potential use of a diverse set of algorithms designed to optimize mobility and performance. This paper presents a cohesive control scheme designed for the operation of an autonomous vehicle under all conditions. The ideas presented have been tested in simulation, and some have been used extensivly in the field.

AB Technological advances revolutionize industrial processes, science, communications, and our way of life. However, developed societies have reached a stage in which the fascination with technological innovations often results in their indiscriminate consumption. In this paper, road traffic is used as a line of argument to demonstrate that the random introduction of technology does not imply benefits to society. Particularly, it is analyzed why some of the potential benefits of technological progress are lost in fields such as traffic monitoring, data handling, and traffic management, or in sustainable mobility initiatives, such as the introduction of electric vehicles or the implementation vehicle sharing projects. The risks faced in the future advent of autonomous vehicles are also discussed, and ideas for improvement suggested. A critical reflection on other transportation modes that are expected to be realized in the near future is included as well. The performed analysis evidences that the potential improvement in personal mobility will not become a reality if it exclusively relies on the latest technological devices, in line with consumers' fantasies or economic interests. This is a statement that could be generalized to many other fields. The implementation/consumption of a particular technology should not be an objective in itself, but a tool to bring benefits to society.

AB Shared autonomous vehicles (SAVs) could provide low-cost service to travelers and possibly replace the need for personal vehicles. Previous studies found that each SAV could service multiple travelers, but many used unrealistic congestion models, networks, and/or travel demands. The purpose of this paper is to provide a method for future research to use realistic flow models to obtain more accurate predictions about SAV benefits. This paper presents an event-based framework for implementing SAV behavior in existing traffic simulation models. We demonstrate this framework in a cell transmission model-based dynamic network loading simulator. We also study a heuristic approach for dynamic ride-sharing. We compared personal vehicles and SAV scenarios on the downtown Austin city network. Without dynamic ride-sharing, the additional empty repositioning trips made by SAVs increased congestion and travel times. However, dynamic ride-sharing resulted in travel times comparable to those of personal vehicles because ride-sharing reduced vehicular demand. Overall, the results show that using realistic traffic flow models greatly affects the predictions of how SAVs will affect traffic congestion and travel patterns. Future work should use a framework such as the one in this paper to integrate SAVs with established traffic flow simulators. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB In this paper, the dynamic modeling and collaborative control of a multi-vehicle cooperative transportation system for load carrying is explored. A hierarchical modeling and constraint-following control scheme is creatively proposed. In the dynamic modeling stage, the separate models of system components including the load and vehicle carriers are firstly established at the lower level. Then the internal and external constraints corresponding to the system topology and the transportation task are designed to integrate separate models at a higher level. In the system control stage, a distributed collaborative control law is proposed based on the closed-form constraint forces, with which the load can follow the external constraints actively and the carriers can maintain the internal constraints passively. In order to overcome the influence of time-varying multi-source uncertainties of the system on control effectiveness and stability, an adaptive robust control term is designed based on the Lyapunov min-max approach. Both uniform boundedness and uniform ultimate boundedness of the constraint-following error are guaranteed. Comprehensive validations show that our propose scheme can significantly reduce the modeling complexity despite the strongly coupled topology and nonlinearity of the system, as well as achieving more precise and robust trajectory following control compared with the baseline methods.

AB This article proposes a model to estimate the probability of a vehicle reaching a near-term goal state using one or multiple lane changes based on parameters corresponding to traffic conditions and driving behavior. The proposed model not only has broad application in path planning and autonomous vehicle navigation, it can also be incorporated in advance warning systems to reduce traffic delay during recurrent and non-recurrent congestion. The model is first formulated for a two-lane road segment through systemic reduction of the number of parameters and transforming the problem into an abstract statistical form, for which the probability can be calculated numerically. It is then extended to cases with a higher number of lanes using the law of total probability. VISSIM simulations are used to validate the predictions of the model and study the effect of different parameters on the probability. For most cases, simulation results are within 4% of model predictions, and the effect of different parameters such as driving behavior and traffic density on the probability match our expectation. The model can be implemented with near real-time performance, with computation time increasing linearly with the number of lanes.

AB By overcoming constraints of low-cost sensors equipped on the autonomous marine vehicle (AMV), the classic path following approaches based on heading autopilot and course autopilot are improved to enhance the following accuracy of AMV, respectively. For the heading autopilot, adaptive line-of-sight (ALOS) is proposed to compensate for the generalized sideslip including the actual sideslip angle and the magnetic compass bias. For the course autopilot, extended Kalman filter (EKF) is employed to fusion the position and yaw angular rate to obtain the more precise and stable course, so as to substitute the unreliable course feedback from the satellite navigation receiver in cases of low speed and non ideal positioning. The performance and characteristics of both improved schemes are summarized through comparative experiments conducted on a low-cost AMV. Compared with the classic path following method, the straight line path following accuracy of the heading autopilot with generalized sideslip compensation and the course autopilot with EKF feedback are improved by 78.3% and 85.8% respectively. The circular path following accuracy are improved by 61.8% and 66.7% respectively. Engineers can choose the path following methods flexibly based on the hardware configuration, working environment and path type of the AMV to improve the following accuracy.

AB Business models are being transformed by increasing digitalization of the economy and the emergence of technological systems. In logistics, through innovation and the implementation of information processing systems using digital platforms and the integration of Connected and Autonomous Vehicles (CAV), the transformation of business models is being bolstered. However, the digitalization of the business fabric and the predisposition to integrate into logistics platforms will condition business evolution. This paper aims to reveal the evolutionary trends in the business models of companies in the road freight transport sector, and also to outline the benefits and main barriers faced by managers in creating, delivering, and capturing value in a business environment characterized by the emergence of new business models, digital logistics platforms and CAVs. Through qualitative research based on interviews with strategy managers and senior executives from mobility and technology companies, the findings reveal the importance of business integration on digital platforms to optimize resources and deliver better services. By managing aggregated data from CAVs, digital platforms will enable personalized and comprehensive services through omni-channel delivery. By creating single interfaces for contracting, customer care and customer service, platforms enable companies to specialize in specific services and increase profitability while covering complete needs through cross-company collaborations.

AB Fish can track their prey and detect their surroundings in a complex water environment because of their unique underwater perception advantage. In this paper, on the basis of the sensing flow-field environment mechanism of the fish lateral line system, by analyzing the sonar system of an autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) and the sensing principle of the fish lateral line system, the obstacle model of two shapes is established by using ANSYS software with computational fluid dynamics (CM) analysis method. Two characteristic variables of different flow velocity and obstacle size are combined to simulate the flow field. The flow field of the fluid through different shape obstacles is analyzed, and the variation of the flow velocity to the flow field around the obstacle is compared, with the aim to establish a method to actively perceive and analyze the surrounding flow-field information through the characteristic parameters (velocity, size, shape) of the underwater obstacle itself. This paper provides a novel idea and practical sensing means for underwater detection technology, which can fill the void left by sonar and vision systems in a chaotic water environment. Improving the adaptive ability of AUV flow field and providing the theoretical basis for realizing the bionic lateral line engineering in the future, this research has an important impetus to the development of AUVs.

AB This work presents a novel remote control solution for an Autonomous Vehicle (AV), where the system structure is split into two sides. Both sides are assumed to be synchronized and linked through a communication network, which introduces time-varying delays and packet disorder. An Extended Kalman Filter (EKF) is used to cope with the non-linearities that appear in the global model of the AV. The EKF fuses the data provided by the sensing devices of the AV in order to estimate the AV state, reducing the noise effect. Additionally, the EKF includes an h-step-ahead state prediction stage, which, together with the consideration of a packet-based control strategy, enables facing the network-induced delays. Since the AV position is provided by a camera, which is a slow sensing device, a dual-rate controller is required to achieve certain desired (nominal) dynamic control performance. The use of a dual-rate control framework additionally enables saving network bandwidth and deals with packet disorder. As the path-tracking control algorithm, pure pursuit is used. Application results show that, despite existing communication problems and slow-rate measurements, the AV is able to track the desired path, keeping the nominal control performance.

AB Vehicle recognition plays an important role in traffic surveillance systems, advanced driver-assistance systems, and autonomous vehicles. This paper presents a novel approach for multivehicle recognition that considers vehicle space location and classification as a coupled optimization problem. It can speed up the detection process with more accurate vehicle region proposals and can recognize multiple vehicles using a single model. The proposed detector is implemented in three stages: 1) obtaining candidate vehicle locations with prior objectness measure; 2) classifying vehicle region proposals to distinguish the three common types of vehicles (i.e., car, taxi, and bus) by a single convolutional neural network (CNN); and 3) coupling classification results with the detection process, which leads to fewer false positives. In experiments on high-resolution traffic images, our method achieves unique characteristics: 1) It matches the state-of-the-art detection accuracy; 2) it is more efficient in generating a smaller set of high-quality vehicle windows; 3) its searching time is decreased by about 30 times compared with the other two popular detection schemes; and 4) it recognizes different vehicles in each image using a single CNN model with eight layers.

AB Intelligent transport systems (ITS) explore the benefits of wearable devices to monitor driver health and aid in emergencies and advertising. It integrates multitasking, automatically finding a tourist spot, ordering food, and smartly turning on and off a vehicle. In a medical emergency, passengers can access nearby medical facilities, which are not available in the current ITS. To sort out this deficiency, develop a wearable device for autonomous vehicle driver health and passenger interaction system. As part of the embedded system, the wearable gadget is affixed to the vehicle driver and can control the vehicle's motor operation, accelerometers, and gyroscopes. Drivers can travel more comfortably and engage co-passengers by directing promotion and advertisement. The experiment determines which age group of drivers is best suited for handling multiple services simultaneously.

AB Autonomous mobile robots (AMRs) are being used extensively in civilian and military applications for applications such as underground mining, nuclear plant operations, planetary exploration, intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance (ISR) missions and manned-unmanned teaming. We consider a multi-objective, multiple-vehicle routing problem in which teams of manned ground vehicles (MGVs) and AMRs are deployed respectively in a leader-follower framework to execute missions with differing requirements for MGVs and AMRs while considering human-robot interactions (HRI). HRI studies highlight the costs of managing a team of follower AMRs by a leader MGV. This paper aims to compute feasible visit sequences, replenishments, team compositions and number of MGV-AMR teams deployed such that the requirements for MGVs and AMRs for the missions are met and the routing, replenishment, HRI and team deployment costs are at minimum. The problem is first modeled as a a mixed-integer linear program (MILP) that can be solved to optimality by off-the-shelf commercial solvers for small-sized instances. For larger instances, a variable neighborhood search algorithm is offered to compute near optimal solutions and address the challenges that arise when solving the combinatorial multi-objective routing optimization problem. Finally, computational experiments that corroborate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithms are presented.

ID 2-DIMENSIONAL SIMULATION; TRAJECTORY PREDICTION; BEHAVIOR MODELS;
   UNCERTAINTY; ROBOT
AB Turning behaviour is one of the most challenging driving manoeuvres that take place at intersections. Autonomous vehicles (AVs) are often overly conservative in these scenarios as they compromised to others' behaviour to realize behavioural consistency. This paper proposes an intended cooperative motion planning (ICMP) that can actively predict the intentions of interacting participants. This helps achieve socially compliant cooperation and enables each vehicle to converge upon a set of consistent behaviours. The ICMP framework divides the integrated driving process into two related modules: prediction and planning. These modules are integrated using the mechanism of intended cooperation, which first introduces the criteria for a cooperative response and then maps them in the motion planning space. The prediction module applies a Gaussian mixture model to learn human drivers' behaviour to determine conflict points, which helps to narrow down the solution spaces. In the planning module, paths are represented by quartic Bezier curves and speed is modelled as a polynomial function. Optimizations can then be used that maximize the efficiency and smoothness for path planning, and comfort and efficiency for speed planning. The test results show that ICMP-based AVs had consistent interactions with other vehicles. Moreover, when compared with a potential field-based method, the ICMP-based method had better performance in terms of safety, comfort and efficiency, especially when interacting with multiple oncoming vehicles.

AB A novel parallelization method of genetic algorithm (GA) solution of the Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP) is presented. The proposed method can considerably accelerate the solution of the equivalent TSP of many complex vehicle routing problems (VRPs) in the cloud implementation of intelligent transportation systems. The solution provides routing information besides all the services required by the autonomous vehicles in vehicular clouds. GA is considered as an important class of evolutionary algorithms that can solve optimization problems in growing intelligent transport systems. But, to meet time criteria in time-constrained problems of intelligent transportation systems like routing and controlling the autonomous vehicles, a highly parallelizable GA is needed. The proposed method parallelizes the GA by designing three concurrent kernels, each of which running some dependent effective operators of GA. It can be straightforwardly adapted to run on many-core and multi-core processors. To best use the valuable resources of such processors in parallel execution of the GA, threads that run any of the triple kernels are synchronized by a low-cost switching mechanism. The proposed method was experimented for parallelizing a GA-based solution of TSP over multi-core and many-core systems. The results confirm the efficiency of the proposed method for parallelizing GAs on many-core as well as on multi-core systems.

AB This paper focuses on the lateral control of intelligent vehicles; the aim is to minimize the lateral displacement of the autonomous vehicle with respect to a given reference trajectory. The control input is the steering angle, and the output is the lateral error displacement. We present here an analysis of commonality of three lateral nonlinear adaptive controllers. The first controller is a higher order sliding-mode controller (SMC). The second controller is based on the immersion and invariance (I&I) principle. The design of this controller led us to prove a very strong stability criterion of the closed-loop system for all controller gains chosen to be positive. Thereafter, some interesting characteristics of passivity of the systems were proved following this development. Hence, the third controller is a passivity-based controller (PBC), an adaptive PI controller based on the feedback of a passive output. To validate our control laws, tests have been performed on SCANeR Studio, a driving simulation engine, according to several real driving scenarios. A comparison of these different controllers is made to highlight the advantages and drawbacks of each control approach in lateral tracking of a reference trajectory.

AB In epidemic prevention and control measures, unmanned devices based on autonomous driving technology have stepped into the front lines of epidemic prevention, playing a vital role in epidemic prevention measures such as protective measures detection. Autonomous positioning technology is one of the key technologies of autonomous driving. The realization of high-precision positioning can provide accurate location epidemic prevention services and a refined intelligent management system for the government and citizens. In this paper, we propose an unmanned vehicle (UV) positioning system REW_SLAM based on lidar and stereo camera, which realize real-time online pose estimation of UV by using high-precision lidar pose correction visual positioning data. A six-element extended Kalman filter (6-element EKF) is proposed to fusion lidar and stereo camera sensors information, which retains the second-order Taylor series of observation and state equation, and effectively improves the accuracy of data fusion. Meanwhile, considering improving lidar outputs quality, a modified wavelet denoising method is introduced to preprocess the original data of lidar. Our approach was tested on KITTI datasets and real UV platform, respectively. By comparing with the other two algorithms, the relative pose error and absolute trajectory error of this algorithm are increased by 0.26 m and 2.36 m on average, respectively, while the CPU occupancy rate is increased by 6.685% on average, thereby proving the robustness and effectiveness of the algorithm.

AB This paper seeks to enhance the autonomy of underwater vehicles. The proposed approach takes as input a mission specified via a regular language and automatically plans a collision-free, dynamically feasible, and low-cost trajectory which enables the vehicle to accomplish the mission. Regular languages provide a convenient mathematical model that frees users from the burden of unnatural low-level commands and instead allows them to describe missions at a high level in terms of desired objectives. To account for the constraints imposed by the mission, vehicle dynamics, collision avoidance, and the complex spatial and temporal variability of the ocean environment, the approach tightly couples mission planning with sampling-based motion planning. A key aspect is a discrete abstraction obtained by combining the finite automaton representing the regular language with a navigation roadmap constructed by probabilistic sampling. The approach searches the discrete abstraction to compute low-cost and collision-free navigation routes that are compatible with the mission. Sampling-based motion planning is then used to expand a tree of dynamically feasible trajectories along the navigation routes. The approach is validated both in simulation and field experiments. Results demonstrate the efficiency and the scalability of the approach and show significant improvements over related work.

AB Autonomous Vehicles (AVs) promise of a multi-trillion-dollar industry that revolutionizes transportation safety and convenience depends as much on overcoming the psychological barriers to their widespread use as the technological and legal challenges. The first AV-related traffic fatalities have pushed manufacturers and regulators towards decisions about how mature AV technology should be before the cars are rolled out in large numbers. We discuss the psychological factors underlying the question of how safe AVs need to be to compel consumers away from relying on the abilities of human drivers. For consumers, how safe is safe enough? Three preregistered studies (N = 4566) reveal that the established psychological biases of algorithm aversion and the better-than-average effect leave consumers averse to adopting AVs unless the cars meet extremely potentially unrealistically high safety standards. Moreover, these biases prove stubbornly hard to overcome, and risk substantially delaying the adoption of life-saving autonomous driving technology. We end by proposing that, from a psychological perspective, the emphasis AV advocates have put on safety may be misplaced.

ID TIME-DEPENDENT DEMAND; TIMETABLE DESIGN; OPTIMIZATION
AB Jointly designing vehicle dispatch headway and capacity is a relatively new solution to the demand-supply asymmetry in urban mass transportation studies. This paper studies a new problem of this kind where a transportation corridor operates with modular autonomous vehicles (MAV) enabling station-wise docking; i.e., vehicles can change their formations (or capacity) at any station along the corridor. We formulate the problem into a compact mixed integer linear programming model where the passenger boarding order is explicitly modeled. Due to the multiple station system structure and the station-wise docking operation, the solution space of the model increases rapidly with the instance size, making it very challenging to solve the model with existing commercial solvers. To improve the solution efficiency, we design a customized branch and bound (B&B) algorithm with theoretical properties of the investigated problem. These properties offer upper and lower bounds to the optimal vehicle formation, reveal the relationship between the passenger queue and vehicle dispatch headway, and identify a dominance rule between any two feasible solutions to the investigated problem. They greatly reduce the number of nodes in the B&B tree that would grow dramatically without these properties. Further, the lower and upper bounds to the objective value at each node of the B&B tree are computed analytically, allowing us to search through the solution space very quickly. Consequently, the computation speed of the B&B algorithm is greatly improved. With numerical experiments, we show that the customized B&B algorithm outperforms a state-of-the-art commercial solver, Gurobi, and solves relatively large instances in real-world applications efficiently. The station-wise docking operation is shown to reduce system costs compared with existing fixed capacity operation. Further, its performance is affected by system parameters related to the vehicle operational cost and passenger waiting cost. Overall, this study contributes to the literature by extending the urban mass transportation design methodology from traditional fixed capacity design to the MAV-based station-wise docking design under various operational factors (e.g., minimum dispatch headway). The algorithm proposed can be used as a benchmark to verify the solution accuracy and computation performance for research efforts that aim to develop other solution algorithms for the investigated problem.

AB This paper presents a methodology for predicting the adoption rate of Connected Autonomous Trucks (CATs) in transportation organizations using peer effects. There are a number of different factors that must be considered when developing innovation adoption models for organizations. This paper briefly describes each of the relevant variables and combines them into a discrete choice model for predicting the adoption rate of CATs by a hypothetical sample of transportation organizations. The model incorporates new peer effect modeling techniques to simulate the competition and informal communication network. Preliminary results suggest that organizations which are larger are less likely to change their decisions due to the decisions of other, competing organizations, whereas smaller organizations are more easily influenced by the decisions of larger organizations. The methodology developed in this paper produces reasonable results using a hypothetical dataset, and the methodology has been designed to be transferrable to any number of organizational innovations.

ID FRAMEWORK
AB Highway driving places significant demands on human drivers and autonomous vehicles (AVs) alike due to high speeds and the complex interactions in dense traffic. Merging onto the highway poses additional challenges by limiting the amount of time available for decision-making. Predicting others' trajectories accurately and quickly is crucial to execute maneuvers safely. Many existing prediction methods based on neural networks have focused on modeling interactions to achieve better accuracy while assuming the existence of observation windows over 3 s long. This letter proposes a novel probabilistic model for trajectory prediction that performs competitively with as little as 400 ms of observations. The proposed model extends a deterministic car-following model to the probabilistic setting by treating model parameters as unknown random variables and introducing regularization terms. A real time inference procedure is derived to estimate the parameters from observations in this new model. Experiments on dense traffic in the NGSIM dataset demonstrate that the proposed method achieves state-of-the-art performance with both highly constrained and more traditional observation windows.

DT Review
DE traffic sign recognition; machine learning; deep learning
AB Autonomous vehicles have become a topic of interest in recent times due to the rapid advancement of automobile and computer vision technology. The ability of autonomous vehicles to drive safely and efficiently relies heavily on their ability to accurately recognize traffic signs. This makes traffic sign recognition a critical component of autonomous driving systems. To address this challenge, researchers have been exploring various approaches to traffic sign recognition, including machine learning and deep learning. Despite these efforts, the variability of traffic signs across different geographical regions, complex background scenes, and changes in illumination still poses significant challenges to the development of reliable traffic sign recognition systems. This paper provides a comprehensive overview of the latest advancements in the field of traffic sign recognition, covering various key areas, including preprocessing techniques, feature extraction methods, classification techniques, datasets, and performance evaluation. The paper also delves into the commonly used traffic sign recognition datasets and their associated challenges. Additionally, this paper sheds light on the limitations and future research prospects of traffic sign recognition.

AB Images of road scenes in low-light situations are lack of details which could increase crash risk of connected autonomous vehicles (CAVs). Therefore, an effective and efficient image enhancement model for low-light images is necessary for safe CAV driving. Though some efforts have been made, image enhancement still cannot be well addressed especially in extremely low light situations (e.g., in rural areas at night without street light). To address this problem, we developed a light enhancement net (LE-net) based on the convolutional neural network. Firstly, we proposed a generation pipeline to transform daytime images to low-light images, and then used them to construct image pairs for model development. Our proposed LE-net was then trained and validated on the generated low-light images. Finally, we examined the effectiveness of our LE-net in real night situations at various low-light levels. Results showed that our LE-net was superior to the compared models, both qualitatively and quantitatively. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB There are two main issues to consider when designing a controller for autonomous off-road vehicles: velocity and terrain irregularities. Whereas the first one is measurable, the second one is very difficult to determine. Solutions to cover these issues could be very complex and difficult to implement in an embedded system with limited resources. The results obtained in our previous research for an adaptive approach implemented in a tractor with varying hitch forces, lead to the improvements presented here. This paper proposes a robust digital RST pole placement controller design for the lateral position, with sensitivity functions tuned to cover uncertainties and non-linearities not considered in the model. Simulations were implemented to assess the performance of the system and the controller implementation was applied to a skid-steered agricultural robot with limited computational resources and a state-of-the-art navigation system, which delivered satisfactory results.

AB The research work presented in this paper has been funded by a national research project whose aims are to enable an Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) to fly autonomously with the use of a Digital Elevation Model (DEM) of the target area and to detect terrain changes with the use of a 3D Structure Change Detection Model (3D SCDM). A Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) works with both models in training the UAV in autonomous flying and in detecting terrain changes. The usability of such an autonomous flying IoT is demonstrated through its deployment in the search for water resources in areas where a satellite would not normally be able to retrieve images, e.g., inside gorges, ravines, or caves. Our experiment results show that it can detect water flows by considering different surface shapes such as standing water polygons, watersheds, water channel incisions, and watershed delineations with a 99.6% level of accuracy.

AB This paper presents a method to prevent the rollover of autonomous electric road sweepers (AERS). AERS have an articulated frame steering (AFS) mechanism. Moreover, the heights of the center of gravity of the front and rear bodies are high. As such, they are prone to rolling over at low speeds and at small articulation angles. A bicycle model with a nonlinear tire model was used as a vehicle model for AERS. Using that vehicle model, path tracking and speed controllers were designed in order to follow a predefined path and speed profile, respectively. To check the rollover propensity of AERS, load transfer ratio (LTR) based the rollover analysis was completed. Based on the results of the analysis, a rollover prevention scheme was proposed. To validate the proposed scheme, a simulation was conducted using a U-shaped path under constant speed conditions. From the simulation, it was shown that the proposed scheme is effective in preventing AERS from rolling over.

AB Horticultural robots designed for in-field use usually require a means of transportation around orchards or farms. A common approach is to directly integrate a drive system at the expense of increasing overall complexity. Alternatively, robots can be modularised and attached to general purpose platforms. General purpose platforms reported previously are designed to carry relatively light payloads orientated toward ground based crops. This paper presents a heavy-duty platform, capable of carrying modules of up to 1000 kg, beneath 1.4 m high pergola-style kiwifruit canopies. We discuss the design of the vehicle's software, electrical system, and mechanical structure. Sensors suitable for autonomous navigation are evaluated in-orchard and tested with prototype algorithms. Row following trials show a repeatability of within 75 mm using only a multi-layer lidar. With a method of automatically turning between rows, the vehicle traversed over 10 km of orchard rows unassisted. Crown Copyright (C) 2019 Published by Elsevier Ltd on behalf of IAgrE.

AB Despite the widespread application of Autonomous Vehicles (AV) to various services, there has been relatively little research carried out on pedestrian-AV interaction and trust within the context of service provided by AV. This study explores the communication design strategy promoting a pedestrian's trust and positive attitude to driverless services within the context of pedestrian-AV interaction using non-verbal social cues. An empirical study was conducted with an experimental VR environment to measure participants' intimacy, trust, and brand attitude toward AV. Further understanding of their social interaction experiences was explored through semi-structured interviews. As a result of the study, the interaction effect of social cues was found, and it was revealed that brand attitude was formed by the direct effects of intimacy and trust as well as the indirect effects of intimacy through trust's mediation. Furthermore, 'Conceptual Definition of Space' was identified to generate differences in the interplay among intimacy, trust, and brand attitude according to social cues. Quantitative and qualitative results were synthesized to discuss implications considering the service context. Practical implications were also addressed suggesting specific design strategies for utilizing the sociality of AV.

AB The adjusting of autonomous vehicles (AVs) steering angle represents a challenging issue in the intelligent vehicular applications. Among different control strategies, the model predictive control (MPC) is devoted to providing efficacious steering control for the AVs. However, the formulation of MPC with a few parameters is the main challenge to overcome the complicated computation that happens due to the long prediction and control horizons. Hybridization between discrete-time Laguerre function (DTLF) and MPC is suggested to formulate the MPC with few parameters. While the hybrid DTLF-MPC requires an adequate tuning technique for their gains to improve the system performance. A new low computational burden design is proposed in this paper to adjust the gains of the hybrid DTLF-MPC based on the social ski driver algorithm (SSDA). This algorithm is developed as a recently artificial intelligence technique. The tuned hybrid DTLF-MPC by SSDA is devoted to control AV's steering angle. Furthermore, the proposed system takes into account the vision dynamics. The system performance based on the tuned DTLF-MPC by SSDA is evaluated with the MPC based on the neural network algorithm for comparison. Different scenarios are carried out to confirm the superiority of the suggested control mechanism to handle small as well as large-scale variations of road curvatures.

AB In scene understanding for autonomous vehicles (AVs), models trained on the available datasets fail to generalize well to the complex, real-world scenarios with higher dynamics. In this work, we attempt to handle the distribution mismatch by employing the generative adversarial network (GAN) and weather modeling to strengthen the intra-domain data. We also alleviate the fragility of our trained models against natural distortions with stateof-the-art augmentation approaches. Finally, we assess our method for cross-domain object detection through CARLA simulation. Our experiments demonstrate that: (1) Augmenting training class with even limited intradomain data captured from the adverse weather conditions boosts the generalization of the two kinds of object detectors; (2) Exploiting GANs and weather modeling to elaborately simulate the adverse, intra-domain weather conditions manages to surmount the adverse data scarcity issue for intra-domain object detection; (3) A combination of Augmix and style augmentations not only can promote the robustness of our trained models against different natural distortions but also can boost their performance in the cross-domain object detection; (4) Training GANs for unsupervised image-to-image translation by means of the existing, large-scale datasets outside of our training domain is found beneficial to alleviate image-based and instance-based domain shifts.

AB This paper investigates the problem of precise trajectory tracking control of an autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) under parameter perturbations and external disturbances. To design a data-driven control scheme with high tracking accuracy and strong robustness, a compensated model-free adaptive control (MFAC) scheme is proposed by combining an extended state observer (ESO). Specifically, a data-driven structure-improved linear ESO (SLESO) is derived to online estimate the model approximation error generated by pseudo Jacobian matrix estimation in the typical MFAC scheme. Another problem of the typical MFAC is that it cannot be directly applied to robotic systems with rotation in the inertial frame. To tackle this issue, a two-loop controller architecture is used to design the proposed SLESO-MFAC scheme. In addition, the structure of the mathematical model of AUVs and force analysis are used in MFAC design for the first time, thus providing a straightforward initial value setting method with explicit physical interpretation and helping to judge if the assumptions in the MFAC scheme can be satisfied. Furthermore, the stability analysis of the designed control system is given. Finally, the robustness and effectiveness of the proposed SLESO-MFAC scheme are substantiated via simulations and comparisons using a realistic dynamic model of the Falcon AUV.

AB Autonomous Vehicles (AV) are used to solve the problem of data gathering in large scale sensor deployments with disconnected clusters of sensors networks. Our take is that an efficient strategy for data collection with AVs should leverage i) cooperation amongst sensors in communication range of each other forming a sensor cluster, ii) advanced coding and data storage techniques for easing the cooperation process, and iii) AV route-planning that is both content-and cooperation-aware. Our work formulates the problem of efficient data gathering as a cooperative route-optimization problem with communication constraints. We also analyze (network) coded data transmission and storage for simplifying cooperation amongst sensors as well as data collection by the AV. Given the complexity of the problem, we focus on heuristic techniques, such as particle swarm optimization, to calculate the AV's route and the times for communication with each sensor and/or cluster of sensors. We analyze two extreme cases, i.e., networks with and without intra-cluster cooperation, and provide numerical results to illustrate that the performance gap between them increases with the number of nodes. We show that cooperation in a 100 sensor deployment can increase the amount of data collected by up to a factor of 3 with respect to path planning without cooperation.

AB In order to reach the highest level of automation, autonomous vehicles (AVs) are required to be aware of surrounding objects and detect them even in adverse weather. Detecting objects is very challenging in sandy weather due to characteristics of the environment, such as low visibility, occlusion, and changes in lighting. In this paper, we considered the You Only Look Once (YOLO) version 5 and version 7 architectures to evaluate the performance of different activation functions in sandy weather. In our experiments, we targeted three activation functions: Sigmoid Linear Unit (SiLU), Rectified Linear Unit (ReLU), and Leaky Rectified Linear Unit (LeakyReLU). The metrics used to evaluate their performance were precision, recall, and mean average precision (mAP). We used the Detection in Adverse Weather Nature (DAWN) dataset which contains various weather conditions, though we selected sandy images only. Moreover, we extended the DAWN dataset and created an augmented version of the dataset using several augmentation techniques, such as blur, saturation, brightness, darkness, noise, exposer, hue, and grayscale. Our results show that in the original DAWN dataset, YOLOv5 with the LeakyReLU activation function surpassed other architectures with respect to the reported research results in sandy weather and achieved 88% mAP. For the augmented DAWN dataset that we developed, YOLOv7 with SiLU achieved 94% mAP.

AB With the rapid development of artificial intelligence (AI), autonomous vehicles (AVs) represent a major revo-lutionary trend leading to a long-term transition in mobility. Despite the uncertainty and controversy over AV ethics, however, little attention has been paid to the role of consumer ethics in their decision-making process for adopting AVs. By adopting behavioral reasoning theory (BRT), this paper investigates the antecedents and mechanisms influencing consumers' intention to use AV hailing services from the perspectives of personal values, reasons, and ethics. Based on a survey from an online sample platform, this study finds that consumers' ethical attitudes to AVs (i.e., using EVs is ethical or not) is influenced by personal values (such as openness to change and security value) and their reasons for and against AVs. Further, consumers' intention to use AV hailing services can be influenced by their ethical attitudes and the reasons for and against AVs. This study contributes to the literature on the adoption of AI-empowered smart products or service by revealing the role of consumer ethics as a key mediator in consumer decision-making processes. The results provide important public policy and managerial implications on regulating and managing the adoption of AVs.

AB Considering that the terrain-aided navigation (TAN) system based on iterated closest contour point (ICCP) algorithm diverges easily when the indicative track of strapdown inertial navigation system (SINS) is large, Kalman filter is adopted in the traditional ICCP algorithm, difference between matching result and SINS output is used as the measurement of Kalman filter, then the cumulative error of the SINS is corrected in time by filter feedback correction, and the indicative track used in ICCP is improved. The mathematic model of the autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) integrated into the navigation system and the observation model of TAN is built. Proper matching point number is designated by comparing the simulation results of matching time and matching precision. Simulation experiments are carried out according to the ICCP algorithm and the mathematic model. It can be concluded from the simulation experiments that the navigation accuracy and stability are improved with the proposed combinational algorithm in case that proper matching point number is engaged. It will be shown that the integrated navigation system is effective in prohibiting the divergence of the indicative track and can meet the requirements of underwater, long-term and high precision of the navigation system for autonomous underwater vehicles.

AB The coarse alignment stage of inertial navigation systems (INS) is a step of paramount importance, specially for vehicles that employ the latter as a reference navigation solution, as is the case of autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs). For such class of vehicles, the alignment has encumbrances that goes beyond those usually reported for terrestrial and aerial systems, as AUVs generally align at non benign environments (e.g., under swaying and mooring conditions) and have limited auxiliary navigation sensors. This work, hence, proposes a comparative analysis of the most representative coarse alignment methods applied to AUVs in mooring condition. The alignment approach herein explored, throughout its optimized and non-optimized versions, is the attitude decomposition-based initial alignment (ADIA) method, and the proposed comparison procedure tests different types of observation vectors resolved in the frames of interest. Experimental tests are conducted, which are based on kinematic data collected from an unmanned marine vehicle representing the typical swaying and attitude oscillations of AUVs in the mooring state, i.e., when subject to wave induced disturbances. Results lead to practical conclusions that can be applied to the AUV initial attitude estimation and are related to autonomy, accuracy and precision of the methods, as well as to their convergence rate and computational effort.

ID UNCERTAINTY
AB This paper addresses the trajectory-tracking problem under uncertain road-surface conditions for autonomous vehicles. We propose a stochastic nonlinear model predictive controller (SNMPC) that learns a tyre-road friction model online using standard automotive-grade sensors. Learning the entire tyre-road friction model in real time requires driving in the nonlinear, potentially unstable regime of the vehicle dynamics, using a prediction model that may not have fully converged. To handle this, we formulate the tyre-friction model learning in a Bayesian framework and propose two estimators that learn different aspects of the tyre-road friction. The estimators output the estimate of the tyre-friction model as well as the uncertainty of the estimate, which expresses the confidence in the model for different driving regimes. The SNMPC exploits the uncertainty estimate in its prediction model to take proper action when the uncertainty is large. We validate the approach in an extensive Monte Carlo study using real vehicle parameters and in CarSim. The results when comparing to various MPC approaches indicate a substantial reduction in constraint violations, as well as a reduction in closed-loop cost. We also demonstrate the real-time feasibility in automotive-grade processors using a dSPACE MicroAutoBox-II rapid prototyping unit, showing a worst-case computation time of roughly 40 ms.

AB Despite the growing demand for unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), the use of conventional UAVs is limited, as most of them require being remotely operated by a person who is not within the vehicle's field of view. Recently, many studies have introduced reinforcement learning (RL) to address hurdles for the autonomous flight of UAVs. However, most previous studies have assumed overly simplified environments, and thus, they cannot be applied to real-world UAV operation scenarios. To address the limitations of previous studies, we propose a stepwise soft actor-critic (SeSAC) algorithm for efficient learning in a continuous state and action space environment. SeSAC aims to overcome the inefficiency of learning caused by attempting challenging tasks from the beginning. Instead, it starts with easier missions and gradually increases the difficulty level during training, ultimately achieving the final goal. We also control a learning hyperparameter of the soft actor-critic algorithm and implement a positive buffer mechanism during training to enhance learning effectiveness. Our proposed algorithm was verified in a six-degree-of-freedom (DOF) flight environment with high-dimensional state and action spaces. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm successfully completed missions in two challenging scenarios, one for disaster management and another for counter-terrorism missions, while surpassing the performance of other baseline approaches.

AB This paper is concerned with the resilient speed control of an autonomous surface vehicle (ASV) in the presence of actuator anomalies. A data-driven model-free resilient speed control method is presented based on available input and output data only with pulse-width-modulation inputs. Specifically, a data -driven neural predictor is designed to learn the unknown system dynamics of the speed control system of the ASV. Then, a resilient speed control law is designed based on the learned dynamics obtained from the neural network predictor, where a cost function is designed for selecting the optimal duty cycle for the motor. The stability of the data-driven neural predictor is analyzed by using input-state stability (ISS) theory. The advantage of the developed data-driven model-free resilient control method is that the optimal speed control performance can be achieved in the presence of actuator anomalies without any modeling process. Simulation results show the learning ability of the data-driven neural predictor and the effectiveness of the proposed data-driven model-free resilient speed control method for the ASV subject to actuator anomalies.

AB For a state estimation problem of nonlinear system, the square-root cubature Kalman filter (SCKF) is an effective method when the noise statistical characteristics are known. However, the performance of SCKF often degrade significantly in the face of uncertain noises interference, particularly in case of measurement or system failure. In this paper, we focus on improving the accuracy and robustness of SCKF under irregular noise. First, a weighted adaptive SCKF (WASCKF) algorithm is presented with moving window method. The WASCKF can improve the accuracy of SCKF by adaptively adjusting the covariances of measurement noise and process noise. Next, in order to further improve the robustness of WASCKF against the abrupt abnormal noise, a correction adaptive SCKF (CASCKF) algorithm based on fault detection mechanism is proposed. The CASCKF algorithm can detect whether there is a fault according to a statistical function of Chi-square distribution, and can judge and carry out the necessary correction processing by using an isolate rule. Finally, the performance of CASCKF is verified by numerical experiments of autonomous vehicle target tracking problem. The results show that the proposed CASCKF algorithm has good accuracy and robustness even with sudden abnormal noise interference.

AB The autonomous vehicle (AV) industry aims to design strategic plans to ensure the safety of the developed systems before their mass deployment. Real-road testing is shown to be impractical for validating these systems as it requires many years if not decades of testing in different environmental conditions. For solving this issue, the method should be complemented with simulation. The primary goal of this research was to develop advanced techniques in the safety validation area by using end-to-end simulation technologies. In this study, we present a simulation approach for safety evaluation of an AV shuttle, iseAuto, currently operating at the Tallinn University of Technology campus. We created a virtual environment by using geospatial data from the specified path on the university campus that includes all relevant features. Then, we converted the map to a 3D format applicable for the SVL simulator. Also, we provided the AV 3D model to use in the simulation and equipped it with the SVL virtual sensors to provide data for the Autoware perception algorithms, which is the control software of the shuttle. To show the efficiency of the proposed method, we designed two overtaking scenarios and observed the AV behaviour under the test. Finally, we demonstrate how the system enables us to evaluate AV's decision-making performance and safety in different situations.

AB Amidst rapid urban development, sustainable transportation solutions are required to meet the increasing demands for mobility whilst mitigating the potentially negative social, economic, and environmental impacts. This study analyses autonomous vehicles (AVs) as a potential transportation solution for smart and sustainable development. We identified privacy and cybersecurity risks of AVs as crucial to the development of smart and sustainable cities and examined the steps taken by governments around the world to address these risks. We highlight the literature that supports why AVs are essential for smart and sustainable development. We then identify the aspects of privacy and cybersecurity in AVs that are important for smart and sustainable development. Lastly, we review the efforts taken by federal governments in the US, the UK, China, Australia, Japan, Singapore, South Korea, Germany, France, and the EU, and by US state governments to address AV-related privacy and cybersecurity risks in-depth. Overall, the actions taken by governments to address privacy risks are mainly in the form of regulations or voluntary guidelines. To address cybersecurity risks, governments have mostly resorted to regulations that are not specific to AVs and are conducting research and fostering research collaborations with the private sector.

AB This paper addresses the challenging issue of determining the most suitable control strategy (planning decision-action and their interactions), for autonomous navigation of vehicles which must deal with different environments contexts (e.g., cluttered or not, dynamic or not, etc.). The paper's main proposals are decomposed into two main parts: Firstly, the proposition of reliable and flexible components to perform short and long-term planning: at beginning, a generic and safe path planning-based on Parallel Elliptic Limit-Cycle (PELC) and its multi-criteria optimization (PELC*) have been proposed to perform either reactive or cognitive navigation. Afterward, it is proposed to suitably sequence several PELC/PELC* in order to obtain an optimal global path-based on PELC (gPELC*). Secondly, this paper proposes an overall Hybrid (reactive/cognitive) multi-controller architecture for autonomous navigation using PELC* and gPELC*. This architecture has been designed in order to use a uniform set-points convention and a common control law to perform several sub-tasks (e.g., obstacle avoidance, target reaching/tracking, path following, etc.). A multitude of simulations and a real experiment have been performed in order to confirm the potentialities of the overall proposed methodology. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Collision checking is the major computational bottleneck for many robot path and motion planning applications, such as for autonomous vehicles, particularly with grid-based environment representations. Apart from collisions, many applications benefit from incorporating costs into planning; cost functions or cost maps are a common tool. Similar to checking a single configuration for collision, evaluating its cost using a grid-based cost map also requires examining every cell under the robot footprint. This work gives theoretical and practical insights on how to efficiently check a large number of configurations for collision and cost. As part of this work, configuration space costs are formulated, which can be seen as generalization of configuration space obstacles allowing a complete configuration check incorporating the robot geometry to be done using a single lookup. Furthermore, this paper presents two efficient algorithms for their calculation: FAMOD, an approximate method based on convolution, which is independent of the size and the shape of the robot mask, and vHGW-360, an exact method based on the van Herk-Gil-Werman morphological dilation algorithm, which can be used if the robot shape is rectangular. Both algorithms were implemented and evaluated on graphics hardware to demonstrate the applicability and benefit to real-time path and motion planning systems.

DE Autonomic computing technology; Self-managed ocean engineering;
   Autonomous marine vehicles; Bio-inspired robot resilience
AB Autonomous Marine Vehicles (AMVs) are not only being required to carry out more complex tasks but also longer missions. This mainly requires effective resilient operation and efficient resource management to succeed in persistent presence at sea or ocean with minimal human interaction while maintaining seakeeping performance. Even though some of the current AMVs have a large degree of self-governance, most of them fail to support self-management (e.g. auto-maintenance during pre/in/post-mission phases). Autonomic Computing (AC) basically provides the following self-managing capabilities: self-healing, self-protecting, self-optimizing, and self-configuring. In addition, it provides systems with self-aware, self-adjusted, and self-situated abilities. AC comes from a biological metaphor based on the self-regulating capabilities of the autonomic nervous system in the human body. This paper introduces the AC concept to control architectures of AMVs to endow them with resilience and environmental efficiency. The above capabilities are to help persistent autonomy and automation endure over complex and long AMV operations. This paper presents the architectural aspects, and details of design and realization of this promising AC-based approach. It also discusses four key aspects from existing methodologies and technologies that are potential approaches to support the autonomic control architecture proposed for AMVs. Finally, future research directions are presented. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB To accelerate the widespread adoption of connected and autonomous vehicles (CAVs) and take full advantage of CAVs' transportation safety, efficiency, and pro-environment, a deep understanding of CAVs acceptance is needed. However, little is known about the combined effects of factors influencing CAVs acceptance using traditional statistical methods. We developed an integrated model to explore how various antecedent factors work together on CAVs' acceptance. The symmetric (Structure Equation Modeling) and asymmetric (Qualitative Comparative Analysis) techniques were utilized for analyzing data from 362 Chinese. PLS-SEM assesses the net effect of each antecedent on CAVs' adoption, while fsQCA provides supplementary analysis by revealing the configurations of causal conditions associated with CAVs' adoption. PLS-SEM results show that perceived usefulness, perceived ease of use, and initial trust directly influence users' willingness to adopt CAVs, while perceived risk, social influence, and facilitating conditions do not. Meanwhile, automation, ubiquitous connectivity, structural assurance, and corporation reputation indirectly influence CAVs adoption, while environmental performance and technological uncertainty have no statistically significant indirect effect. Interestingly, fsQCA reveals five configurations resulting in a high level of CAVs' acceptance, and seven configurations leading to the negation of CAVs' acceptance. The complementary analysis results provide insights into both theory and practice.

AB This article details the preliminary design and testing of a Resetting Anchor/Antenna Tether Mechanism (RAATM) for an autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV). The proposed mechanism is intended to enable an AUV to secure itself to the seabed, ascend, descend, transmit and receive signals via the tether, retract the anchor, and re-anchor again as required. The ability of an AUV to passively loiter on station for extended periods preserves power and may otherwise expand mission capabilities for a variety of underwater vehicles. If they are capable of communication through electromagnetic transmission, AUVs equipped with such technology may be utilized to form mobile networks that may, in turn, receive external communications from above the surface. Spherical AUV (SAUV) capabilities may be especially enhanced through the integration of the proposed mechanism. The RAATM was designed for integration with the Wreck Interior Exploration Vehicle (WIEVLE), a small SAUV designed for operations in entanglement-prone, extreme environments, but the RAATM may be used in any suitably-sized underwater vehicle capable of safely contacting the ocean floor. A prototype of the anchoring portion of the mechanism was constructed, and anchoring strength was tested repeatedly in three types of sediment, under varied configurations and loading angles, with promising results.

AB For the containment control problem of autonomous surface vehicles with external disturbances, a novel nonsingular fixed-time control scheme is developed, where the multi-ship system consists of real leaders and followers. In contrast with traditional containment cases studied in most of the existing literature, real leaders are required to track the desired trajectories, and the followers need to get into the convex hull spanned by the real leaders in a fixed time. The method for solving the fixed-time containment control problem is divided into the following steps: Firstly, a fixed-time disturbance observer is designed to estimate the external disturbance for the leaders and the followers, and the estimation result is used to compensate for the input of the control system; Second, combined with fixed-time stability theory and a switch function, a non-singular fixed-time trajectory tracking controller for leaders is designed, such that the position tracking error could be bounded within a fixed time; Third, to achieve formation efficiently, a non-singular fixed-time containment controller strategy incorporating with graph theory is proposed for coordinating followers, such that the fixed-time stability can be ensured. Finally, simulation examples are given to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.

AB This paper examines the potential of autonomous vehicle (AV) technology for enhancing first and last mile services for a light-rail station. We use an event-and agent-based simulation model to compare the performance of fixed and demand-responsive routing services. The routing of on-demand services is based on a matching algorithm in which incoming passenger requests are prioritized and assigned to vehicles under capacity constraints. Our findings indicate that, for a high-frequency light-rail feeder system, fixed routing is the preferred option, even with the assumed reduction in operational costs due to driver-less operations. However, we also observe that demand-responsive services can be as effective as fixed routing in off-peak hours, provided the heuristics for matching passengers to vehicles are effective. This implies that a combination of the two services could be beneficial in certain contexts. In addition, our results demonstrate that urban sprawl has an impact on the performance of the system, with the demand-responsive services becoming relatively better when urban sprawl increases, while the fixed routing remains superior across most key-performance indicators. To assess the performance of the different services, we employ cost-benefit analysis.

AB In this paper, a time-varying formation reconfiguration and obstacle avoidance strategy are investigated for a fleet of autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) in the three-dimensional (3-D) ocean environment. The proposed novel controller consists of improved artificial potential field, graph rigidity theory, and affine transformation (IAPF-GR-AT). Information manoeuvring and swarm AUVs are treated as a whole. First, when in an area containing obstacles, the IAPF method is used to plan a safe navigation route that matches the formation size. The planned path is equivalent to a virtual leader AUV, which serves as the leader AUV's tracking target. Second, the leader AUV and follower AUVs form a cubic structure based on the GR theory and then track the planned path. Third, the theory of AT is used for formation reconfiguration. The formation shape can be arbitrarily changed in 3-D space according to the environmental constraints or the needs of the mission, showing a dynamic characteristic and having good adaptability to the environment. In addition, when the formation AUVs pass through an obstacle area, the method is also conducive to avoiding the formation's long-term split. Finally, several simulation results for nine AUVs are offered to demonstrate the formation reconfiguration and obstacle avoidance performance of the designed controller.

AB The mobility industry is experiencing an in-depth transformation looking for higher efficiency, and this evolution has relevant impact from the economic and social perspective. Nevertheless, technological and mobility trends involve uncertainty on users, policy makers, and businesses. Thus, the analysis of the technologies and their associated trends is relevant for enabling a general understanding of new features and social benefits that can shape the mobility trends toward a better experience. This paper intends to forecast and understand the impact of the new trends on general public through qualitative research deployed with experts from different European countries. It aims at clarifying the predisposition to adapt daily habits to adopt autonomous and connected vehicles, electrical motorizations and servitization. Those areas of deployment in the mobility industry represent relevant dilemmas in terms of social exchange. Businesses, technical and physical infrastructures, public services and regulations are among those areas highly affected by this evolution. Despite the reported advantages of those trends, those innovations will only be supported by specific groups of population and policy-makers unless they show similar benefits to traditional mobility means. Mobility-as-a-Services will be widespread in parallel with the improvement of the service offered, cost reduction, and geographical coverage.

AB The combination of steering angle prediction and control of autonomous vehicles (AVs) is a challenging task. To improve the real-time steering angle prediction accuracy and the effectiveness of steering control, a novel steering angle prediction YOLOv5-based end-to-end adaptive neural network control for AVs is proposed. Firstly, since most of the lane line datasets are simulated images and lack of diversity, a novel lane dataset derived from the real roads are made manually to train the You Only Look Once version 5 (YOLOv5) network model. To improve the detection accuracy of the network model, the Generalized Intersection over Union (GIoU) of the bounding box regression loss function is updated to a Complete Intersection over Union (CIoU) with a better convergence effect. Furthermore, the neural network-based controller and disturbance observer are proposed to effectively control the steering angle predicted by YOLOv5 and estimate the lumped uncertainty. Meanwhile, a composite adaptive updating law is constructed by utilizing the tracking error and modeling error to improve steering performance. Finally, the system stability is proved by Lyapunov theory and the effectiveness of the proposed method is verified with experiments.

AB The use of an autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) to inspect underwater industrial infrastructure requires the precise, coordinated movement of the AUV relative to subsea objects. One significant underwater infrastructure system is the subsea production system (SPS), which includes wells for oil and gas production, located on the seabed. The present paper suggests a method for the accurate navigation of AUVs in a distributed SPS to coordinate space using video information. This method is based on the object recognition and computation of the AUV coordinate references to SPS objects. Stable high accuracy during the continuous movement of the AUV in SPS space is realized through the regular updating of the coordinate references to SPS objects. Stereo images, a predefined geometric SPS model, and measurements of the absolute coordinates of a limited number of feature points of objects are used as initial data. The matrix of AUV coordinate references to the SPS object coordinate system is computed using 3D object points matched with the model. The effectiveness of the proposed method is estimated based on the results of computational experiments with virtual scenes generated in the simulator for AUV, and with real data obtained by the Karmin2 stereo camera (Nerian Vision, Stuttgart, Germany) in laboratory conditions.

AB The cooperative motion of autonomous vehicles (AVs), which communicate through wireless local area networks (WLANs), has been implemented using various technologies, e.g., the Internet of things (IoT). However, there are several insecure disturbances that occur during the communication of intelligent entities. These disturbances can compromise the cooperative control of AVs. In this paper, we propose a cooperative protocol for the group motion in IoT that provides anti-disturbance protection for AVs. More specifically, we construct group motion models of AVs (GMM-AVs) with mixed disturbances. The disturbances are derived from matched and mismatched disturbances, where the former (the latter) denotes that the disturbances and the control inputs exist in the same (different) tunnels. We design disturbances sensors to detect the loss of GMM-AVs and propose anti-disturbance measures to compensate for the loss. Subsequently, we establish a distributed cooperative control protocol (DCCP-CP) that provides countermeasure protection by analyzing the group cooperation of AVs. We also achieve distributed consensus of AVs with multiple disturbances by studying the dynamic characterization of GMM-AVs. DCCP-CP may achieve cooperative group motion for AVs under the scenario of various disturbances. Finally, the simulations results verify the validity of GMM-AVs and DCCP-CP.

AB This study evaluates how various UAV flight policies affect energy consumption and the required charging infrastructure in last-mile parcel delivery applications. International UAV policies are reviewed and subcategorized into nine categories based on their stringency. Assuming autonomous operations of small-size quadrotor UAVs (13 min flight range), an experimentally verified energy model and demand data are used to simulate 3D trajectories of UAV missions in a digital-twin model, simulating last-mile parcel deliveries in Toronto. A novel optimization model is developed to minimize the allocated charging stations. The results show that the maximum and minimum altitude limitations increase the required charging stations by up to 52%. Minimum horizontal clearing distance increases the required charging stations by up to 75%. The results highlight increased cost per parcel delivery associated with policy strictness ranging from $0.078 (lean policies) to $0.086 (strict policies). Overall, the results highlight the need for contextual-based policy solutions.

AB Millimeter-wave automotive radar is essential for realizing autonomous driving. Realistic channel model and simulation are important for system and sensing algorithm design. This work introduces channel measurements and ray-tracing (RT) channel simulations for frequency modulated continuous wave (FMCW) automotive mmWave radar. The 77 GHz channel measurements in an urban crossroads environment are presented. The dominant echoes (multi-path components) of the measurement are detected and matched with corresponding objects for each frame. A measurement-based electromagnetic (EM) parameter estimation method is proposed to find the optimal parameter set that minimizes the error of simulated radar cross section (RCS). As a result, the issue of lacking reliable EM material parameters for RT simulation at 77 GHz frequency band is tackled. Simulation results are validated in power, range, velocity, and angle domains with the provided EM parameter set. Extending validated RT simulations in similar environments with various configurations allows more reliable channels for rigorous testing without the limitation of channel measurement.

AB Automated mission planning for unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) is difficult because of the propagation of several sources of error into the solution, as for any large scale autonomous system. To ensure reliable system performance, we quantify all sources of error and their propagation through a mission planner for operation of UAVs in an obstacle rich environment we developed in prior work. In this sequel to that work, we show that the mission planner developed before can be made robust to errors arising from the mapping, sensing, actuation, and environmental disturbances through creating systematic buffers around obstacles using the calculations of uncertainty propagation. This robustness makes the mission planner truly autonomous and scalable to many UAVs without human intervention. We illustrate with simulation results for trajectory generation of multiple UAVs in a surveillance problem in an urban environment while optimizing for either maximal flight time or minimal fuel consumption. Our solution methods are suitable for any well-mapped region, and the final collision free paths are obtained through offline sub-optimal solution of an mTSP (multiple traveling salesman problem).

AB We study control of the angular-velocity actuated nonholonomic unicycle, via a simple, bounded extremum seeking controller which is robust to external disturbances and measurement noise. The vehicle performs source seeking despite not having any position information about itself or the source, able only to sense a noise corrupted scalar value whose extremum coincides with the unknown source location. In order to control the angular velocity, rather than the angular heading directly, a controller is developed such that the closed loop system exhibits multiple time scales and requires an analysis approach expanding the previous work of Kurzweil, Jarnik, Sussmann, and Liu, utilizing weak limits. We provide analytic proof of stability and demonstrate how this simple scheme can be extended to include position-independent source seeking, tracking, and collision avoidance of groups on autonomous vehicles in GPS-denied environments, based only on a measure of distance to an obstacle, which is an especially important feature for an autonomous agent.

AB Autonomous electric vehicle safety is crucially dependent on the accurate recognition of pedestrians in diverse situations. Current pedestrian detection techniques, however, face significant limitations due to reduced visibility and poor-quality images under low-lighting scenarios. With the aim of overcoming these challenges, this article proposes a novel, sustainable method for pedestrian detection and classification in electric vehicles using machine learning techniques. The approach processes video frame-based images as input, removing noise and smoothing the images for improved detection. A Bayesian component network analysis is employed to refine the features of the filtering-based boundary box detection, further enhancing the detection process. The selected features are then classified using a fully connected kernel operation based on the region with reward Q-Reinforcement architecture, resulting in a secure and efficient pedestrian detection system. The proposed method was evaluated on multiple image datasets using average precision, an area under the curve (AUC), log-average miss rate (MR), and root-mean-square error (RMSE) as performance measures. The experimental results demonstrated an average precision of 92%, MR of 48%, AUC of 56%, and RMSE of 61%. These findings indicate that the proposed technique effectively enhances pedestrian detection and classification for autonomous electric vehicles, contributing to increased safety and reliability in real-world applications.

AB To protect the personnel of the intervention units operating in high-risk areas, it is necessary to introduce (autonomous/semi-autonomous) robotic intervention systems. Previous studies have shown that robotic intervention systems should be as versatile as possible. Here, we focused on the idea of a robotic system composed of two vectors: a carrier vector and an operational vector. The proposed system particularly relates to the carrier vector. A simple analytical model was developed to enable the entire robotic assembly to be autonomous. To validate the analytical-numerical model regarding the kinematics and dynamics of the carrier vector, two of the following applications are presented: intervention for extinguishing a fire and performing measurements for monitoring gamma radiation in a public enclosure. The results show that the chosen carrier vector solution, i.e., the ground vehicle with six-wheel drive, satisfies the requirements related to the mobility of the robotic intervention system. In addition, the conclusions present the elements of the kinematics and dynamics of the robot.

AB Autonomous air combat is an inevitable trend in the development of unmanned combat aerial vehicle (UCAV) equipment. Its purpose is to generate maneuver trajectory so that UCAVs obtain better air combat situation. Therefore, aiming to solve a tactical maneuver trajectory optimization problem for an UCAV in autonomous air combat, this paper proposed a novel method by converting the problem to an optimization problem of characteristic parameters. On the one hand, the paper analyses the tactical maneuver trajectory and combines the situation evaluation model to construct a tactical maneuver trajectory optimization function based on characteristic parameters. On the other hand, multi-population rotation strategy differential evolution (MPRDE) algorithm is designed to search for the optimal characteristic parameters. The experimental results showed that the MPRDE algorithm has outstanding performance in convergence speed, global optimization ability and robustness, and the method based on characteristic parameters could effectively and quickly represent the tactical maneuver trajectory of UCAV by using MPRDE. Meanwhile, it satisfies the real-time requirements for generating tactical manoeuvring trajectory for UCAV autonomous air combat.

AB In this paper, we address the problem of safe and efficient intersection crossing traffic management of autonomous and connected ground traffic. Toward this objective, we propose an algorithm called the discrete-time occupancies trajectory based intersection traffic coordination algorithm (DICA). We show that the basic DICA has a computational complexity of O(n(2)L(m)(3)) where n is the number of vehicles granted to cross an intersection and L-m is the maximum length of intersection crossing routes. To improve the overall computational efficiency of the algorithm, the basic DICA is enhanced by several computational approaches that are proposed in this paper. The enhanced algorithm has the computational complexity of O(n(2)L(m) log(2) L-m). The improved computational efficiency of the enhanced algorithm is validated through simulations using an open source traffic simulator called the simulation of urban mobility (SUMO). The overall throughput, as well as the computational efficiency of the enhanced algorithm, are also compared with those of an optimized traffic light control algorithm.

AB This paper proposes a new robust nonlinear state feedback (NHSF) controller for an autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) in steering plane. A three-degree-of-freedom nonlinear model of an AUV has considered for developing a steering control law. In this, the energy dissipative theory is used which leads to form a Hamilton-Jacobi-Isaacs (HJI) inequality. The nonlinear control algorithm has been developed by solving HJI equation such that the AUV tracks the desired yaw angle accurately. Furthermore, a path following control has been implemented using the NHSF control algorithm for various paths in steering plane. Simulation studies have been carried out using MATLAB/Simulink environment to verify the efficacies of the proposed control algorithm for AUV. From the results obtained, it is concluded that the proposed robust control algorithm exhibits a good tracking performance ensuring internal stability and significant disturbance attenuation.

AB Autonomous vehicle (AV) technology for self-driving has emerged as a promising solution to alleviate traffic congestion, reduce accidents, and optimize road capacity and fuel consumption. However, these sensors are vulnerable, making AVs susceptible to cyber threats. Consequently, security becomes an indispensable and integral facet of AV architecture. One such challenge is establishing a secure session key between the sensor device and other entities to ensure secure and authorized communication. While some existing schemes support pre-quantum era secure session key establishment within AV systems, post-quantum security's a discernible gap. This paper introduces an innovative quantum secure and highly efficient authentication and key agreement (AKA) scheme. We propose a cloud-centric three-factor authentication and key agreement system based on Ring Learning With Errors (RLWE) to provide robust authentication for both cloud and AVs. Furthermore, we have devised two distinct session keys within our authentication mechanism: one for secure remote control between users and AVs, and the other for ensuring enhanced privacy when accessing cloud-stored data via the cloud server. The efficacy of our proposed design is substantiated through a comprehensive comparative study that includes performance evaluation. Our proposed scheme has better efficiency than existing schemes and is suitable for the post-quantum era.

AB The acceptance of AI-based intelligent transportation systems requires addressing the existing barriers and the adoption of macro-decisions and policies by policymakers and governments. This study evaluates the potential barriers to the adoption of Autonomous Vehicles (AVs) in developing countries by considering the sustainability dimensions. The barriers are identified by conducting a comprehensive literature review and studying the academic experts' opinions in related industries. By identifying the main barriers to the sustainable adoption of AVs, a synthesized approach of the Rough Best-Worst Method (RBWM) and Interval-Rough Multi Attributive Border Approximation Area Comparison (IR-MABAC) is utilized for weighting and evaluating each barrier in this context. According to the results of this study, the "inflation rate", "lack of internet connection quality", and "learning challenges and difficulties to use the AVs" are the top challenges and barriers to the AV adoption which need to be considered by policymakers. As the main contribution of this research, we provide efficient insights on a macro policy scale for decision-makers with respect to the main barriers to the implementation of AVs technology. From the AVs literature and to the best of our knowledge, this is the first study of its kind that considers the barriers to the AV technology implementation through the sustainability concept.

AB Object detection is a safety-critical aspect of autonomous driving, allowing vehicles to identify moving objects in the scene for tracking, prediction and decision making. Current detectors, however, tend to provide point estimates for detected objects, which lack information on the variability of the prediction and how well it fits the model that produced the prediction. Proper uncertainty estimation can be incorporated into traditional object detection pipelines to produce a measure of uncertainty alongside traditional point estimate object predictions. In this work, uncertainty estimates are implemented for LiDAR and camera object detectors using Bayesian theory, and the resulting output distributions are assessed using signal detection theory to generate an uncertainty based classifier that can evaluate its own performance. The classifier can be used to track the ratio of false positive to true positive detections, defined as the anomalous detections ratio. Findings from this work indicate that this novel metric is responsive to degraded driving conditions including night time driving and lens obstructions for the RGB camera, while in LiDAR data, the metric is responsive to snowfall and simulated rain conditions. These results are focused on the classification and regression of vehicle objects, making use of the sizeable ground-truth sets for vehicles that are provided in publicly-available autonomous driving data sets.

DT Article
DE Highly autonomous vehicles; seating orientation; finite element method;
   occupant kinematics; injury risk
AB In a highly autonomous vehicle (HAV), the rotatable seat is likely to be designed to facilitate ease of communication between the occupants. We hypothesize that the protective effects of current restraint systems vary among different seating configurations and that by using the rotational seat to alter the occupant's orientation in accordance with the direction of impact, occupants will be better protected. Moreover, in HAVs, it's likely that an imminent impact could be detected at a time of 200 ms, or even longer, prior to the initial contact. The availability of this additional time could be used strategically to actively position the occupants into a safer position for impact. Finite element simulations were performed using the THUMS model to test the hypothesis. The simulation results indicated that during a frontal impact, the backward-facing occupant is safer than occupants in other seating orientations. Moreover, 200 ms is sufficient to rotate the occupant by +/- 45 degrees and +/- 90 degrees without introducing additional injuries. Finally, the timing of the post-rotation impact also plays a role in injury risk of the rear-facing impact. Further studies are needed to optimize the rotating seat parameters in order to maintain occupant posture and improve crash safety in HAVs.

AB The main aims of this study are to investigate the hydrodynamic performance of an autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV), calculate its hydrodynamic coefficients, and consider the flow characteristics of underwater bodies. In addition, three important parts of the SUBOFF bare hull, namely the main body, nose, and tail, are modified and redesigned to improve its hydrodynamic performance. A three-dimensional (3D) simulation is carried out using the computational fluid dynamics (CFD) method. To simulate turbulence, the k-omega shear stress transport (SST) model is employed, due to its good prediction capability at reasonable computational cost. Considering the effects of the length-to-diameter ratio (LTDR) and the nose and tail shapes on the hydrodynamic coefficients, it is concluded that a hull shape with bullet nose and sharp tail with LTDR equal to 7.14 performs better than the SUBOFF model. The final proposed model shows lower drag by about 14.9% at u = 1.5 m center dot s(-1). Moreover, it produces 8 times more lift than the SUBOFF model at u = 6.1 m center dot s(-1). These effects are due to the attachment of the fluid flow at the tail area of the hull, which weakens the wake region.

AB This paper focuses on the attitude tracking control of the autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) using control moment gyros (CMGs) with the lumped nonlinearities including model uncertainty, coupling dynamic property, external disturbance, and input saturation. To describe the attitude of the AUV without singularities, quaternions are used to describe its translational and rotational motion. A finite-time convergent extended state observer (FTCESO) in conjunction with the sliding mode control (SMC) approach is exploited to design the tracking controller for the closed-loop system with the finite-time convergence. Meanwhile, in order to release the burden of the observer, the anti-windup compensator is utilized to handle the nonlinearity of input saturation. A switch function is considered to make a switch between the robust controller and the constant-rate reaching law. Subsequently, with consideration of the inherent singularity problem of actuator dynamics, the constrained steering logic is implemented to avoid this issue without introducing other torque errors in theory. Finite-time stability of the attitude tracking system is guaranteed by the Lyapunov-based approach. Finally, the simulation results validate the attitude tracking performance of the CMG-based AUV with the proposed control strategy, when it is subject to the stated nonlinear uncertainties.

AB Autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) have been widely employed in ocean survey, monitoring, and search and rescue tasks for both civil and military applications. It is beneficial to use multiple AUVs that perform environmental sampling and sensing tasks for the purposes of efficiency and cost effectiveness. In this paper, an adaptive path planning algorithm is proposed for multiple AUVs to estimate the scalar field over a region of interest. In the proposed method, a measurable model composed of multiple basis functions is defined to represent the scalar field. A selective basis function Kalman filter is developed to achieve model estimation through the information collected by multiple AUVs. In addition, a path planning method, the multidimensional rapidly exploring random trees star algorithm, which uses mutual information, is proposed for the multi-AUV system. Employing the path planning algorithm, the sampling positions of the AUVs are determined to improve the quality of future samples by maximizing the mutual information between the scalar field model and observations. Extensive simulation results are provided to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm. Additionally, an indoor experiment using four robotic fishes is carried out to validate the algorithms presented.

AB The structure design of an autonomous/remote underwater vehicle, Intelligence Ocean, capable of operating in ROV or AUV mode and acquiring marine environment information and its own status data are outlined first in this paper. The dynamics equations of underwater vehicles in horizontal and vertical are given to describe the movement of an underwater vehicle, taking the gravity, buoyancy, thrust and hydrodynamic force into account. Furthermore, in order to realize high precision automatic control of robot, the fuzzy control algorithm which belongs to the intelligent control is combined with the cascade PID control algorithm to realize an modified underwater vehicle control algorithm, which improves the applicability of the control algorithm and reduces the difficulty and workload of parameter adjustment. The proposed control algorithm is recognized in numerical simulations as well as in experimental tests which confirm the good performance of the controller and the prototype.

AB This article proposes a novel active non-singular integral terminal sliding mode fault tolerant control scheme based on compound iterative learning observer (CILO-NITSM-FTC) for the trajectory tracking control problems of autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs), which accompanied by nonlinear dynamics and possible thruster failures. The designed compound iterative learning observer (CILO) can effectively estimate the values of nonlinear dynamics and reconstruct the faults of the thrusters. Compared to the existing adaptive non-singular integral terminal sliding mode-based fault tolerant control (ANITSM-FTC), which is a passive fault tolerant control method essentially, the mentioned CILO-NITSM-FTC in this paper presents faster rate of convergence and more accurate control precision. In the design process of CILO, radial basis function neural network (RBFNN) is adopted to estimate the nonlinear dynamics, then approximation errors of neural network, thruster faults and external disturbances are considered as global disturbances. The estimated values obtained from CILO can be used to perform feedforward compensation on the designed controller to complete the reconstruction of thruster faults. Through rigorous mathematical proof and comparative numerical simulation experiments, the superiority and practicability of CILO-NITSM-FTC proposed in this paper are verified.

AB This article addresses cooperative path-following problem of autonomous surface vehicles (ASVs) over a wireless network with constrained resources. A network-based resource-aware control architecture is presented to avoid unnecessary communications, computations, and actuations. Specifically, an event-triggered cooperative control law is designed to deal with the limited network bandwidth. Each ASV broadcasts its cooperation variable to its neighboring ASVs based on predefined event conditions under directed communication links. Then, an event-triggered path-following control law is proposed based on a line-of-sight approach. An event-triggered extended state observer is developed to estimate the uncertainties and external disturbances without periodic estimation. Finally, an event-triggered kinetic control law with aperiodic actuation is developed. The input-to-state stability of the closed-loop path-following system is analyzed by employing cascade theory, and Zeno behavior is excluded. A salient feature of the proposed network-based resource-aware control architecture is that cooperative path following can be achieved with low network traffic and reduced computation. Experiment results are given to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed network-based resource-aware control architecture for multiple ASVs by using aperiodic communications, estimations, and executions.

AB Traffic safety of fully automated train operations is one of the most complex challenges in the field of railway traffic automation. One of the biggest problems with the introduction of driverless trains to the public railway infrastructure are the risks associated with the obstacles on the line, which represent one of the most common and most significant safety risks in railway traffic. The Obstacle Detection System (ODS), should meet the safety requirements, but also should not lead to a deterioration of the railway traffic. In addition to the purely technical issues of ODS development, the issue of determining the necessary requirements in terms of safety, reliability and efficiency must be considered. The paper analyses the current European regulations in the field of railway safety, safety requirements for certification of ODS, as well as risk control measures by the types of obstacles on the line. A survey of train drivers in the Republic of Serbia was conducted to understand the significance of particular obstacles and the manner of reaction of train drivers in case of their occurrence. The results of the survey and the available statistical indicators were used to assess the impact of certain categories of obstacles on railway safety. The criteria for defining the safety requirements necessary for the certification of ODS in autonomous vehicles have been proposed.

AB Whereas automated guided vehicles (AGVs) have traditionally been used for material handling, the utilisation of autonomous mobile robots (AMRs) is growing quickly owing to their scalability, versatility, and lower costs. In this paper, we address the pickup and delivery problem with consideration of the characteristics of AMRs in manufacturing environments. To solve the problem, we first propose a new mathematical formulation with consideration of both partial and full recharging strategies for minimisation of the total tardiness of transportation requests. We then propose two constructive heuristic algorithms with high computation speed, which are called the Transportation-Request-Initiated Grouping Algorithm (TRIGA) and the Vehicle-Initiated Grouping Algorithm (VIGA). Additionally, we develop a memetic algorithm (MA) that incorporates a genetic algorithm into local-search techniques for finding near-optimal solutions within a reasonable time. We evaluate the performance of the proposed algorithms in comparison with two dispatching rules, genetic algorithm, and neighbourhood search through simulation experiments with three sets of problem instances under different battery levels. The simulation results indicate that the proposed algorithms outperform the others with regard to the average total tardiness and the relative deviation index. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V.

AB Underwater control applications, especially ones using autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) have become very popular for industrial and military underwater exploration missions. This has led to the requirement of establishing a high data rate communication link between base stations and AUVs, while underwater systems mostly rely on acoustic communications. However, limited data rate and considerable propagation delay are the major challenges for employing acoustic communication in missions requiring high control gains. In this paper, we propose a hybrid acoustic and RF communication framework for establishing a networked control system, in which, for long distance communication and control the acoustic link is used, and in the short range, the RF link is employed. Our scenario for testing implements a docking maneuver application, where a docking station determines the positions of the AUVs via acoustic or RF communication, and different medium access schemes are used for coordinating the transmission of the nodes according to the communication mode. Considering the full dynamics of the entire system for controlling the AUVs, the real-time behavior of the underwater networked control system is evaluated realistically using our proposed integrated cosimulation environment, which includes different simulators. Our performance results indicate that under calm water conditions, our proposed hybrid system reduces the docking time by 33% compared to the acoustic-only.

AB Focusing on the collision avoidance problem for Unmanned Surface Vehicles (USVs) in the scenario of multi-vessel encounters, a USV autonomous obstacle avoidance algorithm based on the improved velocity obstacle method is proposed. The algorithm is composed of two parts: a multi-vessel encounter collision detection model and a path re-planning algorithm. The multi-vessel encounter collision detection model draws on the idea of the velocity obstacle method through the integration of characteristics such as the USV dynamic model in the marine environment, the encountering vessel motion model, and the International Regulations for Preventing Collisions at Sea (COLREGS) to obtain the velocity obstacle region in the scenario of USV and multi-vessel encounters. On this basis, two constraint conditions for the motion state space of USV obstacle avoidance behavior and the velocity obstacle region are added to the dynamic window algorithm to complete a USV collision risk assessment and generate a collision avoidance strategy set. The path re-planning algorithm is based on the premise of the minimum resource cost and uses an improved particle swarm algorithm to obtain the optimal USV control strategy in the collision avoidance strategy set and complete USV path re-planning. Simulation results show that the algorithm can enable USVs to safely evade multiple short-range dynamic targets under COLREGS.

AB An autonomous entry guidance law is developed based on 3-D analytical glide formulas, where the downrange formula is used to plan the longitudinal reference profile in order to meet the downrange and final energy requirements, and the crossrange formula is used to regulate the bank reversals in order to eliminate the crossrange error. As the analytical glide formulas ignore the effects of the Earth's rotation, a series of strategies is proposed for compensating these effects, which provides the guidance with the capability of steering the hypersonic glide vehicle with high Lift to Drag ratio (LID) to any place of the world accurately. The compensation strategies can be summarized into two parts: (1) the reference profiles are properly adjusted by roughly evaluating the effects of the Earth's rotation on the aerodynamic profiles over the whole flight, which can compensate most of the effects; (2) the current effects are accurately evaluated and then the guidance commands are slightly modulated for compensating the remaining effects. Due to careful design, the strategies will not result in drastic changes in the Angle of Attack (AOA) and can keep the bank angle almost constant during most of flight. (C) 2016 ISA.

ID SEMANTIC SEGMENTATION
AB Perception algorithms for autonomous vehicles demand large, labeled datasets. Real-world data acquisition and annotation costs are high, making synthetic data from simulation a cost-effective option. However, training on one source domain and testing on a target domain can cause a domain shift attributed to local structure differences, resulting in a decrease in the model's performance. We propose a novel domain adaptation approach to address this challenge and to minimize the domain shift between simulated and real-world LiDAR data. Our approach adapts 3D point clouds on the object level by learning the local characteristics of the target domain. A key feature involves downsampling to ensure domain invariance of the input data. The network comprises a state-of-the-art point completion network combined with a discriminator to guide training in an adversarial manner. We quantify the reduction in domain shift by training object detectors with the source, target, and adapted datasets. Our method successfully reduces the sim-to-real domain shift in a distribution-aligned dataset by almost 50%, from 8.63% to 4.36% 3D average precision. It is trained exclusively using target data, making it scalable and applicable to adapt point clouds from any source domain.

AB Diverse transport demands have resulted in the wide existence of heterogeneous vehicle automation systems. While these systems have demonstrated effectiveness, they also pose challenges in terms of the share of technological advancements among different organizations and lead to poor generalization ability of individual systems. This article proposes a Transformer-based unified framework, VistaGPT, to address these challenges. VistaGPT, composed of Modular Federations of Vehicular Transformers (M-FoV) and Automated Composing of Autonomous Driving Systems (AutoAuto), aims to overcome the information barriers due to system-level and module-level heterogeneity. M-FoV collects and organizes Transformer-based models in a modular fashion to facilitate system integration by providing diversity and versatility. AutoAuto utilizes large language models (LLMs) to automatically compose end-to-end autonomous driving systems with a "Dividing and Recombining" strategy. Besides, we deploy Scenario Engineering systems to evaluate the composed systems and provide systematic feedback for the optimization of AutoAuto, and Federated intelligence to contribute to diverse training samples and applications. With its capacity, scalability, and diversity, VistaGPT provides a new paradigm of LLM-aided system development for transport automation, which promotes virtual-real interactive parallel driving and advances progress toward "6S" objectives.

AB Learning techniques such as deep reinforcement learning have been increasingly used in the controller design for autonomous vehicles, e.g., lane changing controllers. Although the use of learning techniques can remarkably increase the level of autonomy, their presence poses a great challenge for safety assurance due to the black-box and data-driven nature of learning techniques. In this work, we study the problem of how to safeguard the learning-based lane changing controller for collision avoidance. Our solution leverages on the runtime assurance framework, in particular the Simplex architecture to bound the behavior of the learning-based controller and to provide safety guarantees. The basic idea is to encompass the learning-based controller with a safety-by-construction controller and a decision module, which monitors the output of the learning-based controller at runtime and implements a switching logic between these two controllers according to the changing environment. We present the detailed design of the decision module and formally prove its correctness for collision avoidance. We also carry out a comprehensive experimental evaluation in a set of realistic highway scenarios using the SUMO simulator. The simulation results show that our proposed solution can not only provide safety guarantee for the learning-based lane changing controller, but also maintain a considerable level of efficiency in different volumes of traffic flow.

AB This paper aims to provide stable landing methods and systems for hovering-type AUVs (autonomous underwater vehicles) on a seafloor, which will aid in seafloor investigations, such as gravity acceleration measurements near the seafloor. The proposed methods consist of two techniques. Firstly, a heading control method is proposed, in which the AUV is positioned to face currents before landing on the seafloor, thus reducing flow resistance. Secondly, a stability evaluation method is proposed, in which the landing quality is evaluated based on fast Fourier transform (FFT) analysis of its attitude. The methods were evaluated and verified based on data obtained from tank and sea experiments using an AUV Tri-TON. Thanks to the stability evaluation method, the landing stability was judged automatically with a success rate of 96% (27 of 28 cases). The heading control method also realized stable landing with a success rate of 80% (4 of 5 cases). To enhance the landing stability further, a buoyancy adjustment system was developed and verified using an AUV Tri-Dog 1. Thanks to the developed system, the stable landing was conducted successfully with a success rate of 100% (4 of 4 cases). The proposed methods and system will contribute to the stable landing of AUVs on the seafloor and enhance future seafloor surveys.

AB This paper presents an efficient path-planner based on a hybrid optimization algorithm for autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) operating in cluttered and uncertain environments. The algorithm integrates particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm with Legendre pseudospectral method (LPM), which is named as hybrid PSO-LPM algorithm. PSO is first employed as an initialization generator with its strong global searching ability and robustness to random initial values. Then, the searching algorithm is switched to LPM with the initialization obtained by PSO algorithm to accelerate the following searching process. The flatness property of AUV is also utilized to reduce the computational cost for planning, making the optimization algorithm valid for local re-planning to efficiently solve the collision avoidance problem. Simulation results show that the hybrid PSO-LPM algorithm is able to find a better trajectory than standard PSO algorithm and with the re-planning scheme it also succeeds in real-time collision avoidance from both static obstacles and moving obstacles with varying levels of position uncertainty. Finally, 100-run Monte Carlo simulations are carried out to check robustness of the proposed re-planner. The results demonstrate that the hybrid optimization algorithm is robust to random initializations and it is effective and efficient for collision-free path planning.

AB In this paper, three multivariable speed controllers (linear quadratic regulator -LQR, proportional integral derivative and Fuzzy) were compared with each other to find which one has the best software reliability. The reliability tests were conducted on perturbed controllers with injected faults, simulating typical programmer errors. These controllers were designed to operate in an autonomous ground vehicle, and they were tuned by using a genetic algorithm. Given the large number of tests to be performed it was decided to build a multi-computer simulator in which they were carried out more than 90000 essays. In each of the trials, the perturbed controllers were subjected to a tour of approximately 20 minutes on a slightly wavy ground. With the obtained data, the reliability curves were elaborated by means of the Kaplan-Meier procedure, and this allowed their comparison which was the aim of this research. Under the observed experimental conditions, the LQR controller provides the best behavior, the second position belongs to the MD controller, and the third one to the fuzzy controller.

AB Recently, the number of traffic safety studies involving connected and autonomous vehicles (CAVs) has been increasing. Due to the lack of information regarding the real behaviour of CAVs in mixed traffic flow, traffic simulation platforms are used to provide a reasonable approach for testing various scenarios and fleets. It is necessary to analyse how traffic safety is affected when key parameter assumptions are changed. The current study conducts a sensitivity analysis to identify the parameters used in CAV calibration that have the highest influence on traffic safety. Using a microsimulation-based surrogate safety assessment model approach (SSAM), traffic conflicts were identified, and a ceteris paribus analysis was conducted to measure the effect of gradually changing each parameter on the number of conflicts. Afterwards, a two-at-a-time sensitivity analysis was performed to explore the influence of simultaneously varying two parameters. The results revealed that reaction time, clearance, maximum acceleration, normal deceleration, and the sensitivity factor are key parameters. Studying these parameters two at a time revealed that low maximum acceleration, when combined with other parameters, consistently resulted in the highest number of conflicts, while combinations with short reaction time always yielded the best traffic safety results. This investigation broadens the understanding of CAV behaviour for future implementation for both manufacturers and researchers.

AB Applying reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms to control systems design remains a challenging task due to the potential unsafe exploration and the low sample efficiency. In this paper, we propose a novel safe model-based RL algorithm to solve the collision-free model-reference trajectory tracking problem of uncertain autonomous vehicles (AVs). Firstly, a new type of robust control barrier function (CBF) condition for collision-avoidance is derived for the uncertain AVs by incorporating the estimation of the system uncertainty with Gaussian process (GP) regression. Then, a robust CBF-based RL control structure is proposed, where the nominal control input is composed of the RL policy and a model-based reference control policy. The actual control input obtained from the quadratic programming problem can satisfy the constraints of collision-avoidance, input saturation and velocity boundedness simultaneously with a relatively high probability. Finally, within this control structure, a Dyna-style safe model-based RL algorithm is proposed, where the safe exploration is achieved through executing the robust CBF-based actions and the sample efficiency is improved by leveraging the GP models. The superior learning performance of the proposed RL control structure is demonstrated through simulation experiments.

AB When and how can researchers synthesize survey data with analyses of social media content to study public opinion, and when and how can social media data complement surveys to better inform researchers and policymakers? This paper explores how public opinions might differ between survey and social media platforms in terms of content and audience, focusing on the test case of opinions about autonomous vehicles. The paper first extends previous overviews comparing surveys and social media as measurement tools to include a broader range of survey types, including surveys that result from public deliberation, considering the dialogic characteristics of different social media, and the range of issue publics and marginalized voices that different surveys and social media forums can attract. It then compares findings and implications from analyses of public opinion about autonomous vehicles from traditional surveys, results of public deliberation, and analyses of Reddit posts, applying a newly developed computational text analysis tool. Findings demonstrate that social media analyses can both help researchers learn more about issues that are uncovered by surveys and also uncover opinions from subpopulations with specialized knowledge and unique orientations toward a subject. In light of these findings, we point to future directions on how researchers and policymakers can synthesize survey and social media data, and the corresponding data integration techniques, to study public opinion.

AB The paper develops and demonstrates a method of classifying oceanographic processes using an autonomous- underwater vehicle (AUV). First, we establish the "mingled-spectrum principle" which concisely relates observations from a moving platform to the frequency-wavenumber spectrum of the surveyed process. This principle clearly reveals the role of the AUV speed in mingling time and space. An AUV can distinguish between oceanographic processes by jointly utilizing temporal and spatial information. A parametric tool for designing an AUV spectral classifier is then developed based on the mingled-spectrum principle. An AUV's controllable speed tunes the separability between the mingled spectra of different processes. This property is the key to optimizing the classifier's performance. As a case study, AUV-based classification is applied to distinguish ocean convection from internal waves. It is demonstrated that at a higher AUV speed, convection's distinct spatial feature is highlighted to the advantage of classification. Finally, the AUV classifier is tested by the Labrador Sea Convection Experiment of February 1998. We installed an Acoustic Doppler Velocimeter in an AUV and it measured flow velocity in the Labrador Sea. Based on the vertical flow velocity, the AUV-based classifier captures convection's occurrence. This finding is supported by other oceanographic observations in the same experiment.

AB This paper explores the integrated optimal control scheme from the identification of underactuated autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) system dynamics model parameters to the application of Model Predictive Control (MPC) technology in underactuated AUV motion control, and presents the simulation and field test results. First, the AUV kinematics and dynamics models are introduced to represent the horizontal plane motion characteristics. Based on Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) numerical simulation and overset mesh technology, AUV plane motion is simulated to determine the unknown hydrodynamic coefficients in the model, and the accuracy of the mathematical model is validated by comparing the maneuverability simulation and field test results. After that, an adaptive line-of-sight (ALOS) guiding algorithm with exponentially variable forward distance is utilized in the guidance layer to reconcile the rapidity and stability of tracking. The path following problem is formulated as an MPC optimization problem that takes into account multiple realistic constraints and then converted into a standard convex quadratic programming structure, permitting for online real-time optimization. Simulation and field test results indicate that the control algorithm proposed in this paper provides a more effective control strategy than the traditional LOS+PID controller in tracking effect and robustness.

AB The integrated path tracking control of steering and differential braking can significantly improve the tracking performance of autonomous vehicles in collision avoidance in the limit conditions. However, the distribution of steering and braking control rights has not received sufficient attention in the existing control method. The distribution strategy is relatively simple and lacks theoretical support. Therefore, aiming at the problem of the distribution of steering and braking control rights in the integrated path tracking control, a tire force distribution rule is proposed in this study, and a path tracking control method based on holistic model predictive control (MPC) is designed. To describe the coupling and strong nonlinearity of tire dynamics, a UniTire tire model with combined slip conditions is established in the controller model. Furthermore, the nonlinear controller model is linearized by Taylor expansion and a linear time-varying MPC controller is designed to improve the real-time performance of the system. Finally, the effectiveness of the proposed method is verified via the co-simulation tests of CarSim and Simulink. The simulation tests at the different speeds and road friction coefficients demonstrate the superiority of the proposed method in path tracking performance, lateral stability, and traffic efficiency.

AB An effective approach to obstacle detection and avoidance for autonomous land vehicle (ALV) navigation in outdoor road environments using computer vision and image sequence techniques is proposed. To judge whether an object newly appearing in the image of the current cycle taken by the ALV is an obstacle, the object shape boundary is first extracted from the image. After the translation from the ALV location in the current cycle to that in the next cycle is estimated, the position of the object shape in the image of the next cycle is predicted, using coordinate transformation techniques based on the assumption that the height of the object is zero. The predicted object shape is then matched with the extracted shape of the object in the image of the next cycle to decide whether the object is an obstacle. We use a reasonable distance measure to compute the correlation measure between two shapes for shape matching. Finally, a safe navigation point is determined, and a turn angle is computed to guide the ALV toward the navigation point for obstacle avoidance. Successful navigation tests show that the proposed approach is effective for obstacle detection and avoidance in outdoor road environments. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Current research on artificial intelligence (AI) algorithms in safety-critical areas remains extremely challenging due to their inability to be fully verified at design time. In this paper, we propose an RTA-IR architecture, which bypasses the formal verification of the AI algorithm by incorporating runtime assurance (RTA) and provides safety assurances for the AI controllers of complex autonomous vehicles (such as those obtained using neural networks) without excessive performance sacrifice. RTA-IR consists of a high-performance and unproven advanced controller and two verifiable safety controllers and a decision module designed based on the Responsibility Sensitive Safety Model (RSS). The advanced controller is designed based on attention generating adversarial imitation learning(GAIL), which can imitate the efficient policies of experts from a set of expert demonstrations. RSS provides verifiable safety criteria and switching logic for the decision module, and RTA-IR provides safety for autonomous vehicles when the advanced controller produces unsafe control, as well as restoring control of the vehicle by the advanced controller under conditions that confirm safety. We tested and evaluated RTA-IR separately for two levels of traffic density in one driving task. Experiments have shown that RTA-IR exhibits superior performance in terms of both safety and efficiency compared to the baseline method.

AB Maneuverability is one of the main aspects to be considered during the early design stage of Autonomous Un-derwater Vehicles. Several captive tests such as Planar Motion Mechanism (PMM), Oblique towing test, and Rotating Arm tests were conducted to obtain the hydrodynamic derivatives of the Autonomous Underwater Vehicle (AUV). In this research, the effectiveness of control surfaces with Cruciform and X configurations has been predicted for the maneuverability of the DARPA SUBOFF model. Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) technique was applied and the k-omega turbulence model was used to estimate the flow characteristics in the boundary layer region. The Straight-Line Towing Tank test has been used to calculate the hydrodynamic de-rivatives due to linear velocity, while the Rotating Arm test with a moving reference frame has been used to estimate the hydrodynamic derivatives. All the tests were conducted at a speed of 6.5 knots and three angles of incidence (10,30,50) for Straight-Line motion and three radii (13m,18m,24m) for Rotating Arm test were adopted. The simulation results of hydrodynamic coefficients have been compared with experimental results for the Cruciform configuration and the error was below 15%. So, the same procedure was adopted for the X-form configuration, and the stability index was calculated for both configurations.

ID BLOCKCHAIN
AB As a state-of-the-art distributed learning approach, federated learning has gained much popularity in connected and autonomous vehicles (CAVs). In federated learning, models are trained locally, and only model parameters instead of raw data are exchanged to aggregate a global model. Compared with traditional learning approaches, the enhanced privacy protection and relieved network bandwidth provided by federated learning make it more favorable in CAVs. On the other hand, poisoning attack, which can break the integrity of the trained model by injecting crafted perturbations to the training samples, has become a major threat to deep learning in recent years. It has been shown that the distributed nature of federated learning makes it more vulnerable to poisoning attacks. In view of this situation, the strategies and attacking methods of the adversaries are worth studying. In this paper, two novel optimization-based black-box and clean-label data poisoning attacking methods are proposed. Poisoning perturbations are generated using particle swarm optimization hybrid with simulated annealing and genetic algorithm respectively. The attacking methods are evaluated by experiments conducted on the example of traffic sign recognition system on CAVs, and the results show that the prediction accuracy of the global model is significantly downgraded even with a small portion of poisoned data using the proposed methods.

ID POSE ESTIMATION
AB Cabled ocean observatory networks (COON) are used for long-term all-weather observation of submarine scientific data, which contribute to low-carbon ocean energy research. Autonomous underwater vehicles (AUV) with clean energy can provide active search capabilities by connecting with the docking station (DS) on the COON to complete energy and data transmission in long-term detection tasks. The AUV is guided by optical active landmarks and a vision system for short-range docking. In this study, we propose an active landmarks tracking framework to solve the problem of detecting failure caused by incomplete observation of landmarks. First, a two-stage docking algorithm based on CNN is used to estimate the 3D relative position and orientation between DS and AUV during docking, including detect phase and PnP pose estimator. Then extended Kalman filter and Hungarian matching algorithm are introduced to improve the robustness of the algorithm. The reliability of the vision-based short-range docking algorithm is verified in the pool, and the robustness of the algorithm to the field environment is shown in the lake field experiment combined with long-range guidance. The experimental results indicate that the algorithm framework can effectively leverage the landmarks information and enhance the scope of the visual guidance algorithm.

AB This paper conducts a numerical investigation on the hydrodynamic performance of a portable autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV). The portable AUV is designed to cruise and perform some tasks autonomously in the underwater world. However, its dynamic performance is strongly affected by hydrodynamic effects. Therefore, it is crucial to investigate the hydrodynamic performance of the portable AUV for its accurate dynamic modeling and control. In this work, based on the designed portable AUV, a comprehensive hydrodynamic performance investigation was conducted by adopting the computational fluid dynamics (CFD) method. Firstly, the mechanical structure of the portable AUV was briefly introduced, and the dynamic model of the AUV, including the hydrodynamic term, was established. Then, the unknown hydrodynamic coefficients in the dynamic model were estimated through the towing experiment and the plane-motion-mechanism (PMM) experiment simulation. In addition, considering that the portable AUV was affected by wave forces when cruising near the water surface, the influence of surface waves on the hydrodynamic performance of the AUV under different wave conditions and submerged depths was analyzed. Finally, the effectiveness of our method was verified by experiments on the standard models, and a physical experiment platform was built in this work to facilitate hydrodynamic performance investigations of some portable small-size AUVs.

AB Designing the boundary layer thickness and switching gain in the nonlinear part of sliding mode controller (SMC) is one of the main subjects in SMC design that needs human experience, knowledge on the amplitude of disturbances, and information about the bounds of system uncertainties. In this paper, to reduce the trial-and-error effort by the designer(s) two different fitness functions in the horizontal and vertical planes are presented and a heuristic method is used for their optimization. The optimal switching gain in the proposed approach properly compensates the unmodeled dynamics, model uncertainty, and external disturbances. Chattering phenomenon in control signals and noise measurement effect are reduced by the optimal selection of boundary layer thickness. This proposed method is applied to an autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) and evaluated through the real-time and cost-effective manner. The execution code is implemented on a single-board computer (SBC) through the xPC Target and is evaluated by the processor-in-the-loop (PIL) test. The results of the PIL test in the two different test cases indicate that the chattering phenomenon and amplitude of control signal applied to the actuators are reduced in comparison with the three conventional approaches in the AUV motion control.

AB In this paper, fast and accurate trajectory tracking control of an autonomous surface vehicle (ASV) with complex unknowns, including unmodeled dynamics, uncertainties, and/or unknown disturbances, is addressed within a proposed homogeneity-based finite-time control (HFC) framework. Major contributions are as follows: first, in the absence of external disturbances, a nominal HFC framework is established to achieve exact trajectory tracking control of an ASV, whereby global finite-time stability is ensured by combining homogeneous analysis and Lyapunov approach; second, within the HFC scheme, a finite-time disturbance observer (FDO) is further nested to rapidly and accurately reject complex disturbances, and thereby contributing to an FDO-based HFC(FDO-HFC) scheme, which can realize exactness of trajectory tracking and disturbance observation; and third, aiming to exactly deal with complicated unknowns including unmodeled dynamics and/or disturbances, a finite-time unknown observer (FUO) is deployed as a patch for the nominal HFC framework, and eventually results in an FUO-based HFC (FUO-HFC) scheme, which guarantees that accurate trajectory tracking can be achieved for an ASV under harsh environments. Simulation studies and comprehensive comparisons conducted on a benchmark ship demonstrate the effectiveness and superiority of the proposed HFC schemes.

AB While the idea of autonomous vehicles has been enthusiastically embraced by scientists and commercial markets alike, ranging from solving the last mile problem across shared economy models in various segments to human transportation logistics, more than just a few aspects require further development before driverless urban logistics can be organized more thoroughly and meaningfully for our practical purposes. Before fully autonomous vehicles become standard, many of these shortcomings can be addressed (in part) by the remote operation of vehicles. Besides the various technological challenges, remote operation of vehicles also has many important legal and economic implications, impacting a wide area, including data protection, liability for torts performed, and mundane fields such as road traffic law. Based on a case study of a start-up developing remote operation solutions in Germany (Vay), this paper analyses and further develops the regulatory framework of remote operation solutions by highlighting their legal and economic implications. Since remote operation solutions are comprised of cyber-physical systems, this research is located in the context of Smart Cities and Industry 5.0, i.e., our research contributes to the related regulatory framework of the Smart City concept as well as to Industry 5.0 in international terms. Finally, the paper discusses future perspectives and proposes specific modes of compliance.

AB Autonomous vehicles are anticipated to play an important role on future mobility offering encouraging solutions to today's transport problems. However, concerns of the public, which can affect the AVs' uptake, are yet to be addressed. This study presents relevant findings of an online survey in eight European countries. First, 1639 responses were collected in Spring 2020 on people's commute, preferred transport mode, willingness to use AVs and demographic details. Data was analyzed for the entire dataset and for vulnerable road users in particular. Results re-confirm the long-lasting discourse on the importance of safety on the acceptance of AVs. Spearman correlations show that age, gender, education level and number of household members have an impact on how people may be using or allowing their children to use the technology, e.g., with or without the presence of a human supervisor in the vehicle. Results on vulnerable road users show the same trend. The elderly would travel in AVs with the presence of a human supervisor. People with disabilities have the same proclivity, however their reactions were more conservative. Next to safety, reliability, affordability, cost, driving pleasure and household size may also impact the uptake of AVs and shall be considered when designing relevant policies.

AB Autonomous Underwater Vehicles (AUVs) are vehicles that are primarily used to accomplish oceanographic research data collection and auxiliary offshore tasks. At the present time, they are usually powered by lithium-ion secondary batteries, which have insufficient specific energies. In order for this technology to achieve a mature state, increased endurance is required. Fuel cell power systems have been identified as an effective means to achieve this endurance but no implementation in a commercial device has yet been realized. This paper summarizes the current state of development of the technology in this field of research. First, the most adequate type of fuel cell for this application is discussed. The prototypes and design concepts of AUVs powered by fuel cells which have been developed in the last few years are described. Possible commercial and experimental fuel cell stack options are analyzed, examining solutions adopted in the analogous aerial vehicle applications, as well as the underwater ones, to see if integration in an AUV is feasible. Current solutions in oxygen and hydrogen storage systems are overviewed and energy density is objectively compared between battery power systems and fuel cell power systems for AUVs. A couple of system configuration solutions are described including the necessary lithium-ion battery hybrid system. Finally, some closing remarks on the future of this technology are given.

TI Reinforcement Learning-Based Autonomous Navigation and Obstacle
   Avoidance for USVs under Partially Observable Conditions
SO MATHEMATICAL PROBLEMS IN ENGINEERING
LA English

ID UNMANNED SURFACE VEHICLE; GUIDANCE; FRAMEWORK; ALGORITHM
AB Unmanned surface vehicles (USVs) have been widely used in research and exploration, patrol, and defense. Autonomous navigation and obstacle avoidance, as the essential technology of USVs, are the key conditions for successful mission execution. However, fine modeling of conventional algorithms cannot meet the real-time precise behavior control strategy of USVs in complex environments, which poses a great challenge to autonomous control policy. In this paper, a deep reinforcement learning-based UANOA (USVs autonomous navigation and obstacle avoidance) method is proposed. The UANOA achieves the autonomous navigation task of USVs by real-time sensing of partially complex ocean information around and real-time output of rudder angle control commands of USVs. In our work, we employ a double Q-network to achieve end-to-end control from raw sensor input to output of discrete rudder action, and design a set of reward functions that can be adapted to USV navigation and obstacle avoidance. To alleviate the decision bias caused by partial observable of USVs, we use the long short-term memory (LSTM) networks to enhance the ability to remember the ocean environment of USVs. Experiments demonstrate that UANOA ensures a USV arrives at the target points with optimal path planning in complex ocean environments without any collisions occurring, and UANOA outperforms deep Q-network (DQN) and random control policy in convergence speed, sailing distance, rudder angle steering consumption, and other performance measurements.

AB This article proposes a swarm-based path-following guidance system for an autonomous marine multi-vehicle system. In particular, a team of unmanned surface vehicles is required to converge to and navigate along a desired reference path, while at the same time aggregating and maintaining a range-based formation configuration. First, a separate description is given for a swarm methodology, initially developed for small ground mobile robots and exploited to aggregate the robot team, and a virtual target-based path-following guidance system developed for unmanned surface vehicles, exploited to drive not the single vehicles but the robot formation as a whole. Then, the integration of the two proposed methodologies is reported and proven, in order to guarantee the feasibility and stability of the overall guidance framework. Simulative results are proposed to validate the effectiveness of the proposed methodology and to evaluate the system performances.

AB This paper proposes a multi-stage dueling deep Q-network (MS-DDQN) algorithm to address the high-speed aerial vehicle evasion problem. High-speed aerial vehicle pursuit and evasion are an ongoing game attracting significant research attention in the field of autonomous aerial vehicle decision making. However, traditional maneuvering methods are usually not applicable in high-speed scenarios. Independent of the aerial vehicle model, the implemented MS-DDQN-based method searches for an approximate optimal maneuvering policy by iteratively interacting with the environment. Furthermore, the multi-stage learning mechanism was introduced to improve the training data quality. Simulation experiments were conducted to compare the proposed method with several typical evasion maneuvering policies and to reveal the effectiveness and robustness of the proposed MS-DDQN algorithm.

AB This paper investigates the applicability of frequency-domain system identification technique to achieve the equivalent linear dynamics of an autonomous underwater vehicle for control design purposes. Frequency response analysis is performed on the nonlinear and coupled dynamics of the vehicle, utilizing the CIFER (R) software to extract a reduced-order model in the form of equivalent transfer functions. Advanced features such as chirp-z transform, composite window optimization, and conditioning are-employed to achieve high quality and accurate frequency responses. A particular frequency-sweep input is implemented to the nonlinear simulation model to achieve pole-zero transfer functions for yaw and pitch motions that were previously developed by the perturbed equations of motion. To evaluate the accuracy of the identified models, zig-zag test data are compared with the predicted responses for both identified and linearized models in time domain. The results show that the identified models perform significantly well in the presence of noise and model uncertainties with the maximum error of 12%, thanks to the precise spectral analysis. Proportional-integral controllers are designed based on the extracted models and tracking performance is experimentally demonstrated by several test results that show the ability of the vehicle to navigate autonomously and follow the GPS waypoints with reasonable accuracy.

AB This work is driven by our vision that cybernetic transport systems (CTSs) based on fully automated urban vehicles (cyberears) will be seen on city roads and new dedicated infrastructures in the near future. These automated vehicles can be heterogeneous systems, such as human-driven traffic, each having different features and functionalities. In our case, we have developed a control architecture that can manage automatic driving of two cars: 1) CyCabs and 2) automated mass-produced cars. This architecture is interoperable and generates humanlike control of vehicles in any situation. Installation and communication with each vehicle are easy. The autonomous route-tracking behaviors are similar, even if the mechanical, electronic, software, and hardware configurations are different for both cars. The results of the developments shown in this paper are part of the European Union (EU) CyberCars-2 Project, which is currently under deployment.

AB This paper introduces the functional system architecture of the Mengshi intelligent vehicle, winner of the 2018 World Intelligent Driving Challenge (WIDC). Different from traditional smart vehicles, a cognitive module is introduced in the system architecture to realise the transition from perception to decision-making. This is shown to enhance the practical utility of the smart vehicle, enabling safe and robust driving in different scenes. The collaborative work of hardware and software systems is achieved through multi-sensor fusion and artificial intelligence (AI) technologies, including novel use of deep machine learning and context-aware scene analysis to select optimal driving strategies. Experimental results using both robustness tests and road tests confirm that the Mengshi intelligent vehicle is reliable and robust in challenging environments. This paper describes the major components of this cognitively inspired architecture and discusses the results of the 2018 WIDC.

AB In a ride pooling system, riders may have varied behaviors in seeking pooled or non-pooled rides. It is important to understand the effect of these rider behaviors on the system performance in order to formulate policies to guide ride pooling implementation. Existing literature modeling ride pooling systems using agent-based models only considers the extreme cases in which riders either all participate or not participate in pooling. However, the pooling behaviors could be more complex. This study segments the rides in the system into five types (non-pooling only, non-pooling preferred, indifferent, pooling preferred, and pooling only). We use an agent-based model to simulate these preferences in a system of pooled autonomous vehicles. We use mixture experiments to vary the proportion of riders within these five types and build models to study the interactions among the rider types in terms of the system's service quality and environmental performance. The results show that higher service level is achieved when all riders in the system are open to pooling, with 30% of pooling only riders and 70% of pooling preferred or indifferent riders providing the maximum value. The results can help formulate incentives and policies to promote ride pooling participation to improve ride pooling system performance. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Terrain aided navigation (TAN) is a form of geophysical localization technique for autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) operating in GPS-denied environments. TAN performance on sensor-rich AUVs has been evaluated in sea trials. However, many challenges remain before TAN can be successfully implemented on sensor-limited AUVs, especially with coarse maps. To improve TAN performance over coarse maps, a Gaussian process (GP) is proposed for the modeling of bathymetric terrain and integrated into the particle filter (GP-PF). GP is applied to provide not only the bathymetric value prediction through learning a set of bathymetric data from coarse maps but also the variance of the prediction. As a measurement update, calculated on bathymetric deviation is performed through the PF to obtain absolute and bounded positioning accuracy. Through the analysis of TAN performance on experimental data for two different terrains with map resolutions of 10-50 m, both the ability of the proposed model to represent the actual bathymetric terrain with accuracy and the effect of the GP-PF for TAN on sensor-limited systems in suited terrain are demonstrated. The experiment results further verify that there is an inverse relationship between the coarseness of the map and the overall TAN accuracy in rough terrains, but there is hardly any relationship between them in relatively flat terrains.

AB A main challenge of military oceanography (MILOC) is to assess the oceanographic conditions of denied/high-risk marine regions. Monitoring technologies are limited to those that can provide access to these regions. Remote sensing and autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) can support MILOC requirements. Unfortunately, the environmental information gathered by these technologies is not complete: remote sensing provides information about some surface conditions and water-column integrated variables, whereas operational priorities often constrain AUVs use during real crisis situations to missions with higher priority than environmental assessment. Under this scenario, data fusion techniques to maximize the information of the collected data are essential. This paper attempts to reconstruct thermal fields fusing data gathered by remote sensing platforms and AUVs performing missions not specifically designed for environmental data collection. The technique estimates the state that maximizes the posterior probability subjected to some smoothing constraints. A variational methodology allows remote sensing information to serve as boundary constraints. The approach uses 3-D finite elements to solve the maximization problem. The procedure investigated has been tested with different smoothing constraints in a simulated environment and in a real field experiment conducted by the Muscle AUV in the Gulf of Riga (Baltic Sea) on April 19, 2008. Results highlight the relevance of incorporating the surface information provided by remote sensors into the estimation.

AB In this paper, a novel swarm control strategy based path following guidance is addressed for multiple underactuated surface vehicles (USVs) with complex unknowns including uncertain dynamics and time-varying disturbances. By employing swarm center position (SCP) guidance together with neural network approximators, the distributed robust controller is developed for each vehicle to follow the desired path, and guarantees that path following errors converge to a small neighborhood of origin. An improved artificial potential field (APF) is further responsible for collision avoidance, which makes vehicles bypass obstacles smoothly. The superiority of the proposed swarm control strategy is that the distributed controller and flexible formation enable USVs to follow the target and avoid collisions autonomously. Simulation results are proposed to illustrate the universal applicability and effectiveness of the proposed strategy.

AB As autonomous vehicles get closer to our daily lives, the need for architectures that function as redundant pipelines is becoming increasingly critical. To address this issue without compromising the budget, researchers aim to avoid duplicating high-cost sensors such as LiDARs. In this work, we propose using monocular cameras, which are already essential for some modules of the autonomous platform, for 3D scene understanding. While many methods for depth estimation using single images have been proposed in the literature, they usually rely on complex neural network ensembles that extract dense feature maps, resulting in a high computational cost. Instead, we propose a novel and inherently efficient method for obtaining depth images that replace tangled neural architectures with attention mechanisms applied to basic encoder-decoder models. We evaluate our method on the KITTI public dataset and in real-world experiments on our automated vehicle. The obtained results prove the viability of our approach, which can compete with intricate state-of-the-art methods while outperforming most alternatives based on attention mechanisms.

DE scenario generation; heterogeneous driver model; deep learning;

AB Virtual testing requires hazardous scenarios to effectively test autonomous vehicles (AVs). Existing studies have obtained rarer events by sampling methods in a fixed scenario space. In reality, heterogeneous drivers behave differently when facing the same situation. To generate more realistic and efficient scenarios, we propose a two-stage heterogeneous driver model to change the number of dangerous scenarios in the scenario space. We trained the driver model using the HighD dataset, and generated scenarios through simulation. Simulations were conducted in 20 experimental groups with heterogeneous driver models and 5 control groups with the original driver model. The results show that, by adjusting the number and position of aggressive drivers, the percentage of dangerous scenarios was significantly higher compared to that of models not accounting for driver heterogeneity. To further verify the effectiveness of our method, we evaluated two driving strategies: car-following and cut-in scenarios. The results verify the effectiveness of our approach. Cumulatively, the results indicate that our approach could accelerate the testing of AVs.

TI Challenges and Opportunities for Autonomous Micro-UAVs in Precision

SO IEEE MICRO
LA English
DT Article
AB Mobile robots such as unmanned ground vehicles (UGVs) and unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) are increasingly used for precision agriculture. While UGVs have larger payload capabilities and longer operation time, they are limited to 2-D space. This makes UAVs better suited for tasks that require fast coverage, harsh terrain traversal, and high altitude or multilevel operation. However, it remains a challenging task to develop a reliable yet fully autonomous UAV system that can actively extract actionable information in large-scale cluttered agricultural environments. Such a system will have to estimate its own poses, build a map of the environment, navigate through obstacles, and act to gather information with limited onboard computation and battery life. In this survey, we first review recent advances in UAV hardware and software, ranging from novel platforms and sensors to state-of-the-art autonomous navigation, object detection and segmentation, robot localization, and mapping algorithms related to agriculture. We then provide a list of challenges in each field and potential opportunities for the broader adoption of UAVs in precision agriculture.

DE Reinforcement learning; autonomous vehicle; Monte Carlo tree search;

AB Reinforcement learning has gradually demonstrated its decision-making ability in autonomous driving. Reinforcement learning is learning how to map states to actions by interacting with environment so as to maximize the long-term reward. Within limited interactions, the learner will get a suitable driving policy according to the designed reward function. However there will be a lot of unsafe behaviors during training in traditional reinforcement learning. This paper proposes a RL-based method combined with RI, agent and Monte Carlo tree search algorithm to reduce unsafe behaviors. The proposed safe reinforcement learning framework mainly consists of two modules: risk state estimation module and safe policy search module. Once the future state will he risky calculated by the risk state estimation module using current state information and the action outputted by the RL agent, the MCTS based safe policy search module will activate to guarantee a safer exploration by adding an additional reward for risk actions. We test the approach in several random overtake scenarios, resulting in faster convergence and safer behaviors compared to traditional reinforcement learning.

AB This work aims to develop and evaluate a navigation strategy based on optical payloads for Autonomous Underwater Vehicles (AUVs). The use of cameras for navigation purposes can make possible a correct vehicle localization in particular working conditions, where other sensors, such as Doppler Velocity Log (DVL), could not be used. In particular, feature detection and outliers removal algorithms have been chosen as possible critical step in the whole algorithm and have been carefully investigated. Underwater environment introduces challenging conditions for a feature based navigation system and, consequently, the images need to be firstly processed. The developed visual-inertial odometry (VIO) algorithm has been employed for the vehicle translation estimation and this information has been fused with the altimeter, Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU) and Fiber Optic Gyroscope (FOG) measurements. The developed algorithm was tested with an image set acquired by Zeno AUV in the Haifa Bay, Israel (September 2018) and with an image set acquired by FeelHippo AUV in Vulcano, Italy (June 2019) and the results were compared with the path estimated exploiting the other on-board sensors (e.g., the DVL, which has been considered as reference sensor for the benchmark path computation). The algorithm performances are evaluated in both cases, focusing either on the estimate quality and on the requested computational load.

As autonomous driving vehicles grows sophisticated, the top models are expected to detect novel classes beyond its prior objectives. Thus, incremental learning for object detection essentially ensures that a model is able to detect additional classes on the fly. In this work, we demonstrate how to update a model on new data and an existing model to append new classes on the existing model. The proposed method utilizes episodic memory to save finite samples of data and replay them during incremental learning. The results on PASCAL VOC2007 have suggested that the proposed method obtains the least mAP reduction, at 4.3%, compared against the all-classes learning in the 10+10 classes scenario, which is the lowest amongst other prior arts. Our method also has the highest backward and forward transfer among incremental learning strategies, indicating better memorization and adaptability.

ID AUTONOMOUS VEHICLES; DRIVING BEHAVIOR; DECELERATION
AB Several applications of artificially modeled drivers, such as autonomous vehicles (AVs) or surrounding traffic in driving simulations, aim to provide not only functional but also human-like behavior. The development of human-like AVs is expected to improve the interaction between AVs and humans in traffic, whereas, in a driving simulation, the objective is to create realistic replicas of real driving scenarios to investigate various research questions under safe and reproducible conditions. In urban traffic, driving behavior strongly depends on the situational context, which introduces new challenges not only for modeling but also for the evaluation of such models. However, current objective assessment strategies rarely consider situational context and human similarity, whereas subjective approaches are not suitable for iterative development processes. In this paper, we present a first attempt to make the plausibility and human-likeness of vehicles' trajectories objectively measurable. A multidimensional quality function is presented that incorporates various parameters characterizing human-like driving behavior and compares each of those parameters to human driving behavior under similar conditions. Among other things, our validation results show that the presented evaluation methodology is scalable to a wide range of situations has the ability to identify model weaknesses, and is able to reflect the way people distinguish between artificial and human behavior.

AB This article addresses an output-feedback flocking control problem for a swarm of autonomous surface vehicles (ASVs) to follow a leading ASV guided via a parameterized path. The leading and following ASVs are subject to completely unknown model parameters, external disturbances, and unmeasured velocities. A data-driven adaptive anti-disturbance control method is proposed for establishing a flocking behavior without any prior knowledge of model parameters. Specifically, a data-driven adaptive extended state observer (ESO) is proposed such that unknown input gains, unmeasured velocities, and total disturbance are simultaneously estimated. For the leading ASV, an output-feedback path-following control law is developed to follow a predefined parameterized path. For following ASVs, an output-feedback flocking control law is developed based on an artificial potential function for collision avoidance and connectivity preservation, in addition to a distributed ESO for estimating the velocity of the leading ASV through a cooperative estimation network. The simulation results are discussed to substantiate the efficacy of the proposed path-guided output-feedback ASV flocking control based on data-driven adaptive ESOs without measured velocity information.

AB The development of autonomous connected vehicles, moving as a platoon formation, is a hot topic in the intelligent transportation system (ITS) research field. It is on the road and deployment requires the design of distributed control strategies, leveraging secure vehicular ad-hoc networks (VANETs). Indeed, wireless communication networks can be affected by various security vulnerabilities and cyberattacks leading to dangerous implications for cooperative driving safety. Control design can play an important role in providing both resilience and robustness to vehicular networks. To this aim, in this article, we tackle and solve the problem of cyber-secure tracking for a platoon that moves as a cohesive formation along a single lane undergoing different kinds of cyber threats, that is, application layer and network layer attacks, as well as network induced phenomena. The proposed cooperative approach leverages an adaptive synchronization-based control algorithm that embeds a distributed mitigation mechanism of malicious information. The closed-loop stability is analytically demonstrated by using the Lyapunov-Krasovskii theory, while its effectiveness in coping with the most relevant type of cyber threats is disclosed by using PLEXE, a high fidelity simulator which provides a realistic simulation of cooperative driving systems.

AB Recently, Autonomous Ground Vehicles (AGV) and mobile robots have been rapidly developed in various engineering applications, such as Industry 4.0 factory and smart manufacturing. Indoor navigation was one of the most important tasks for the mobile systems as they were often designed to move from one location to another location autonomously without contacting the surrounding objects along the moving path in a usually dynamic and complex indoor environment. There were two key steps to achieve Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM). First, indoor positioning of the mobile system based on some measurements was done. The second step was to navigate itself inside the indoor map. This was a very challenging problem because there always existed uncertainties in the measurements. It was desired to estimate the positioning errors and determine a safe moving path with high reliability. This paper presented the methodologies for wireless indoor positioning and navigation of AGV with measurement uncertainties. Two kinds of AGV moving trajectories with various design parameters were simulated: a linear trajectory and a curved one. It was found that both greater number of sensors being used for wireless measurements and greater number of measurement trials for multilateration could effectively improve the accuracy of AGV positioning.

AB An underwater acoustical navigation (UWAN) system is widely used on an autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV). The navigation error prediction is of great significance to the design, use, and capability upgrade for the UWAN system. Owing to the trend of faster AUV and the need for higher navigation accuracy, traditional navigation models are mismatched. Besides, they adopt fixed input errors (including measurement errors of sound velocity, time delay, and array position), which are inconsistent with the real complex acoustic channel. As a consequence, the prediction accuracy of the navigation error is greatly reduced. The authors proposed a novel navigation error prediction method for UWAN based on AUV. Firstly, they established the acoustical navigation model for moving AUV and deduced the error prediction formula. Secondly, considering the complex underwater acoustic channel, they applied the variable error models as the inputs of the prediction formula. Finally, simulations and experiments in different situations verified the effectiveness of the proposed method. The method will provide effective theoretical support for the performance evaluation of the UWAN system based on moving AUV.

AB This paper is concerned with the target tracking of underactuated autonomous surface vehicles with unknown dynamics and limited control torques. The velocity of the target is unknown, and only the measurements of line-of-sight range and angle are obtained. First, a kinematic control law is designed based on an extended state observer, which is utilized to estimate the uncertain target dynamics due to the unknown velocities. Next, an estimation model based on a single-hidden-layer neural network is developed to approximate the unknown follower dynamics induced by uncertain model parameters, unmodeled dynamics, and environmental disturbances. A bounded control law is designed based on the neural estimation model and a saturated function. The salient feature of the proposed controller is twofold. First, only the measured line-of-sight range and angle are used, and the velocity information of the target is not required. Second, the control torques are bounded with the bounds known as a priori. The input-to-state stability of the closed-loop system is analyzed via cascade theory. Simulations illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed bounded controller for tracking a moving target.

AB We present a direct and an indirect nonlinear adaptive path-following controller for marine craft based on a line-of-sight guidance principle used by ancient navigators. The control laws are implemented using hydro-acoustic relative velocity measurements as opposed to absolute velocity measurements. For this purpose, a kinematic model for relative velocity in amplitude-phase form is derived. The first contribution is an adaptive indirect controller based on a disturbance observer designed for estimation and compensation of ocean currents. The equilibrium points of the cross-track and parameter estimation errors are proven to be globally exponentially stable. This guarantees that the estimated drift term converges to its true value exponentially. The observer is used in conjuncture with a control law to obtain asymptotic tracking and path following in the presence of ocean currents. The second contribution is a direct adaptive integral line-of-sight controller for path following. Global convergence of the cross-track error is proven by using Barblat's lemma, which ensures that the parameter estimation error is bounded. Both methods can be applied to the horizontal-plane motion of surface vessels and autonomous underwater vehicles. An autonomous underwater vehicle case study is included to verify the results.

AB This paper presents an accurate, fast, and robust path-following control approach for four-wheel independently actuated (FWIA) autonomous vehicles via integrated control of the active front-wheel steering (AFS) and direct yaw-moment control (DYC). The path following is realized through simultaneously converging the yaw rate and lateral velocity to their respective desired values which are generated according to the path-following demand. A novel integral sliding mode (ISM)-based composite nonlinear feedback (CNF) control technique considering the multi-input multi-output and the time-varying tracking reference is proposed, which has combined the advantages of CNF control in improving the transient performance and ISM control in guaranteeing good robustness. Chattering is avoided using a continuous ISM controller instead of generally adopted discontinuous ones based on a multivariable super-twisting algorithm (STA). System uncertainties, tire fore saturations, and variation of the desired-path curvature are compositively considered in the ISM-CNF controller design, with the stability of the overall system proved using Lyapunov method. CarSim-Simulink simulations have verified the effectiveness of the proposed controller in improving the transient path-following performance, inhibiting the overshoots, eliminating the steady-state errors, and rejecting the lumped disturbance considering the tire forces saturations and the varying path curvature.

ID AUTONOMOUS UNDERWATER VEHICLE; ATTITUDE
AB This paper presents a hierarchical disturbance rejection depth tracking control scheme for the underactuated autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) with comparative experimental results. The proposed hierarchical control scheme is constructed by two layers in the kinematics and dynamics. First, the line-of-sight (LOS) guidance is adopted to transform the depth tracking problem of the underactuated AUV into the pitch tracking in the kinematics layer, and then the adaptive line-of-sight guidance (ALOS) is proposed to estimate online and compensate for the angle of attack neglected in the traditional LOS guidance or in the presence of disturbance. Second, in order to further enhance the capability of disturbance rejection, active disturbance rejection control (ADRC) is adopted to track the desired pitch angle in the dynamics layer. In addition, a modified velocity saturation tracking differentiator (VSTD) by considering the motion characteristics of the AUV is introduced to enable the easy tuning of the control parameters and the adaptability to varying conditions in practice. Finally, a small size underactuated AUV prototype named as ARMs-AUV 1.0 is used to implement the control algorithms. Comparative experimental results are illustrated to demonstrate the effectiveness and the remarkable performance of the proposed depth tracking control scheme.

AB Multi-UAV is a complete system represented by multiple unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV) through collaborative technology. Besides, the UAV group has the advantages in the number and functions that a single UAV does not have. In a complex environment, a single UAV cannot complete a large number of material transportations and escort functions. This paper, from the perspective of cooperative control and material escort of the UAV group, solves the escort problem in the UAV group cruise. Then, an autonomous cooperative flocking algorithm for heterogeneous UAV swarm (ACHF) is proposed. Firstly, the movement control factor of the escort UAV is proposed, and the escort UAV is deployed in the periphery of the transport UAV in the flocking process. Secondly, the system loss function including position and angle is proposed to make the escort UAV deployed as evenly as possible in the periphery of the transport UAV. Finally, in the case of different numbers of UAVs and different environments, the effectiveness of ACHF is supported by theoretical analysis and demonstrated by experiments. The results show that the escort UAVs can be evenly distributed in the periphery of the transport UAVs, forming a group of UAVs with autonomous cooperative capability.

AB This paper investigates the event-triggered tracking control of fully actuated autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) in the vertical plane. Specifically, this paper studies the ETC in the sensor-to-controller channel, where the X-Z coordinates and the pitch angle are transmitted in an event-triggered manner. The greater communication saving is ensured. Additionally, the recently-raised problem of "jumps of virtual control laws" is solved by establishing an event-triggered adaptive neural observer. This observer can offer the benefit of state recovery, which conforms to the nautical practice. As the observer is co-located with the controller, a succinct triggering condition is devised to avoid the "Zeno" behavior and co-located with the sensors. To achieve the optimization of the long-term tracking performance, the reinforcement learning (RL) technique is performed by using the criticactor method with the radial basis function (RBF) neural networks (NNs). The critic NN approximates the performance index and is transferred as the reinforcement signal to the actor NN, which accounts for the uncertainties. The closed-loop stability is analyzed based on the observer-based tracking errors, and all of them are proved to be semi-globally uniformly ultimately bounded (SGUUB). Finally, a numerical experiment substantiates the effectiveness of the proposed scheme.

ID COLLISION-AVOIDANCE; FUZZY-LOGIC; NAVIGATION
AB This paper presents a multiobjective optimization approach for path planning of autonomous surface vehicles (ASVs). A unique feature of the technique is the unification of the Convention on the International Regulations for Preventing Collisions at Sea (COLREGs) with good seamanship's practice along with hierarchical (rather than simultaneous) inclusion of objectives. The requirements of collision avoidance are formulated as mathematical inequalities and constraints in the optimization framework and thus collision-free manoeuvres and COLREGs-compliant behaviours are provided in a seafarer-like way. Specific expert knowledge is also taken into account when designing the multiobjective optimization algorithm. For example, good seamanship reveals that if allowed, an evasive manoeuvre with course changes is always preferred over one with speed changes in practical maritime navigation. As a result, a hierarchical sorting rule is designed to prioritize the objective of course/speed change preference over other objectives such as path length and path smoothness, and then incorporated into a specific evolutionary algorithm called hierarchical multiobjective particle swarm optimization (H-MOPSO) algorithm. The H-MOPSO algorithm solves the real-time path planning problem through finding solutions of the formulated optimization problem. The effectiveness of the proposed H-MOPSO algorithm is demonstrated through both desktop and high-fidelity networked bridge simulations.

AB Many companies aim for delivering systems for autonomous driving reaching out for SAE Level 5. As these systems run much more complex software than typical premium cars of today, a thorough testing strategy is needed. Early prototyping of such systems can be supported using recorded data from on-board and surrounding sensors as long as open-loop testing is applicable; later, though, closed-loop testing is necessary-either by testing on the real vehicle or by using a virtual testing environment. This paper is a substantial extension of our work presented at the 2017 IEEE International Conference on Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITSC) that was surveying the area of publicly available driving datasets. Our previous results are extended by additional datasets and complemented with a summary of publicly available virtual testing environments to support closed-loop testing. As such, a steadily growing number of 37 datasets for open-loop testing and 22 virtual testing environments for closed-loop testing have been surveyed in detailed. Thus, conducting research toward autonomous driving is significantly supported from complementary community efforts: A growing number of publicly accessible datasets allow for experiments with perception approaches or training and testing machine-learning-based algorithms, while virtual testing environments enable end-to-end simulations.

AB Public perceptions play a crucial role in wider adoption of autonomous vehicles (AVs). This paper aims to make two contributions to the understanding of public attitudes toward AVs. First, we explore opinions regarding the perceived benefits and challenges of AVs among vulnerable road users - in particular, pedestrians and bicyclists. Second, the paper evaluated whether interaction experiences with AVs influence perceptions among vulnerable road users. To explore this, we examined survey data collected by Bike PGH, a Pittsburgh based organization involved in programs to promote safe mobility options for road users. Analysis of the data revealed that respondents with direct experience interacting with AVs reported significantly higher expectations of the safety benefits of the transition to AVs than respondents with no AV interaction experience. This finding did not differ across pedestrian and bicyclist respondents. The results of this study indicate that as the public increasingly interacts with AVs, their attitudes toward the technology are more likely to be positive. Thus, this study recommends that policy makers should provide the opportunities for the public to have interaction experience with AVs. The opportunities can be provided through legislation that allows auto manufacturers and technology industries to operate and test AVs on public roads. This interactive experience will positively affect people's perceptions and help in wider adoption of AV technology.

AB This manuscript presents an improved control algorithm, called Dynamic Sliding Mode Control based on Multiple Models Switching Laws (DSMC-MMSL), for the control of the depth of the studied Autonomous Underwater Vehicle (AUV) system, the diving plane controller of which faces disturbances arising from the coupled states. The diving plane model is strongly coupled with the state variables, such as surge speeds and course angles. To achieve the desired dynamic performance, the proposed algorithm consists of two parts: the diving plane control part and the pitch control part, which is used to avoid large pitch angles. Some direct switching control laws are used for the two parts to avoid some impulse phenomena on the control executions. The error-states exponential decay is recommended to eliminate the chattering on the sliding surface. The DSMC-MMSL controller was successfully implemented and experimentally validated with the studied AUV system designed and built by Shenyang Institute of Automation. The results of some lake trials demonstrated that the depth control performances of the AUV system were as desired, and that the AUV system was robust enough for the coupled state variables under the DSMC-MMSL algorithm control.

ID ADAPTIVE CRUISE CONTROL
AB Recognizing the need for responsible highway agencies to effectively manage emerging autonomous vehicles (AV) flows in contending with daily recurrent congestion, this study presents a systematic procedure for understanding the impacts of AV flows on traffic conditions under different AV behavioral mechanisms (i.e., car-following and lane-changing), and different penetration rates. Research results show that the presence of AV flows, depending on their adopted behavioral mechanisms, may have significant (either positive or negative) impacts on the overall traffic conditions. Hence, it is essential for responsible highway agencies to have proper operational guidelines to manage and coordinate AV flows. To demonstrate the proposed methodology, this study has carried out extensive simulation experiments using a congested segment of the MD-100 network (a multilane highway segment located in Maryland) under various AV penetration rates and observable behavioral patterns. The collected Measures of Effectiveness highlight that at each AV penetration level there exists a set of optimal behavioral patterns for the AV flows to coordinate with non-AV flows via the Vehicle to Infrastructure or Vehicle to Vehicle infrastructure so as to maximize the roadway capacity and minimize the resulting highway congestion.

AB To improve operational flexibility, throughput capacity, and responsiveness in order fulfillment operations, several distribution centers are implementing autonomous vehicle-based storage and retrieval system (AVS(RS) in their high-density storage areas. In such systems, vehicles are self-powered to travel in horizontal directions (x- and y- axes), and use lifts or conveyors for vertical motion (z-axis). In this research, we propose a multi-tier queuing modeling framework for the performance analysis of such vehicle-based warehouse systems. We develop an embedded Markov chain based analysis approach to estimate the first and second moment of inter-departure times from the load-dependent station within a semi-open queuing network. The linking solution approach uses traffic process approximations to analyze the performance of sub-models corresponding to individual tiers (semi-open queues) and the vertical transfer units (open queues). These sub-models are linked to form an integrated queuing network model, which is solved using an iterative algorithm. Performance estimates such as expected transaction cycle times and resource (vehicle and vertical transfer unit) utilization are determined using this algorithm, and can be used to evaluate a variety of design configurations during the conceptualization phase.

ID AUTONOMOUS UNDERWATER VEHICLE; UNDERACTUATED AUVS
AB When detecting the wall crack, interferences caused by wall effect will significantly increase the difficulty of controlling AUV. This paper focuses on observing and compensating for interferences in the design of the controller. The optimal weight distribution algorithm is proposed to obtain the desired real-time optimal heading, which ensures that the AUV can achieve autonomous following of the wall by adjusting the heading. The backstepping sliding mode controller based on a slow time-varying adaptive disturbance observer (ADO) is proposed, which can effectively observe and compensate for the interference during AUV near-wall following. Results show that the tracking error of the proposed controller can be greatly reduced compared with the PID controller, and the tracking error is significantly reduced compared with the conventional sliding mode controller. The proposed controller can converge fast with small overshoot and stable control effect. The ADO provides strong robustness against interference, such as wall effect. Thus, AUVs can stably perform near-wall-following tasks and capture clear videos.

SO SCIENTIFIC DATA
LA English
DT Article
AB Optical imaging is a common technique in ocean research. Diving robots, towed cameras, drop-cameras and TV-guided sampling gear: all produce image data of the underwater environment. Technological advances like 4K cameras, autonomous robots, high-capacity batteries and LED lighting now allow systematic optical monitoring at large spatial scale and shorter time but with increased data volume and velocity. Volume and velocity are further increased by growing fleets and emerging swarms of autonomous vehicles creating big data sets in parallel. This generates a need for automated data processing to harvest maximum information. Systematic data analysis benefits from calibrated, geo-referenced data with clear metadata description, particularly for machine vision and machine learning. Hence, the expensive data acquisition must be documented, data should be curated as soon as possible, backed up and made publicly available. Here, we present a workflow towards sustainable marine image analysis. We describe guidelines for data acquisition, curation and management and apply it to the use case of a multi-terabyte deep-sea data set acquired by an autonomous underwater vehicle.

Classical binarization methods have a low success rate in extracting guidance features from fuzzy underwater images, resulting in an insufficient stability of the PPARD estimation. Based on the fact that guidance lamps are blue strong point light sources, this study proposes an adaptive calculation method of binary threshold for the guidance image. To decrease the failure of guidance feature extraction, a guidance image enhancement method is proposed to strengthen the characteristic that the guidance lamps are strong point light sources with a certain area. The PPARD is estimated through solving the minimum value of the imaging error function for the vision-based extracted guidance features. The experimental results showed that the absolute estimation error for each degree of freedom in the PPARD was at most 10%, which was lower than that of the orthogonal iteration (OI) method. In addition, the proposed guidance feature extraction method proved to be better than the classical methods, with the extraction success rate reaching 87.99%.

ID AUTONOMOUS UNDERWATER VEHICLES; DESIGN
AB This article aims to develop an effective control method that can improve the convergence rate over the existing adaptive nonsingular integral terminal sliding mode control (ANITSMC) method for the trajectory tracking control of autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs). To achieve this goal, an adaptive fast nonsingular integral terminal sliding mode control (AFNITSMC) method is proposed. First, considering that the existing nonsingular integral terminal sliding mode (NITSM) has slow convergence rate in the region far from the equilibrium point, a fast NITSM (FNITSM) is proposed, which guarantees fast transient convergence both at a distance from and at a close range of the equilibrium point, and therefore increases the convergence rate over the existing NITSM. Then, using this FNITSM and adaptive technique, an AFNITSMC method is designed for AUVs. It yields local finite-time convergence of the velocity tracking errors to zero and then local exponential convergence of the position tracking errors to zero, without requiring any a priori knowledge of the upper bounds of the uncertainties and disturbances. Compared with the existing ANITSMC method, the salient feature of the proposed AFNITSMC method is that it provides AUV dynamics a faster convergence rate. Finally, simulation results demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed AFNITSMC method and its superiority over the existing ANITSMC method.

AB In this article, we theoretically investigate the dynamic aspects of the coverage degree and target detection in the underwater environment resulting from the given moving scenarios of the autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs). With the help of the continuous moving AUVs, the underwater targets, that cannot be detected by the stationary underwater acoustic sensor network, can be detected with an expected probability, which is determined on the basis of the selected moving scenario of the AUVs. We prove that, for an AUV with randomly selected initial starting point and initial direction, the straight trajectory is the optimal route to achieve the maximum coverage and target detection probability. Then, we present a mathematical model to quantitatively analyze the coverage degree in the underwater environment by using AUVs, as well as formulating the target detection probability of both static target detection and mobile target detection cases. Furthermore, by taking the exposure time of the target into account, we mathematically formulate and analyze the impact of the features of an AUV (i.e., sensing range and velocity) and the moving speed of the mobile target to the mobile target detection probability. We carry out intensive simulation experiments to evaluate the proposed mathematical model, and the experimental results further verify the correctness of our theoretical results.

AB This paper presents a hybrid baseline (HBL) navigation method for autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs). In this approach, a floating acoustic transponder is used to augment moving short baseline (MSBL) navigation, in which two transponders are mounted on a source ship. Kinematic information regarding the floating buoy and source ship are communicated via acoustic messages to the AUV fleet. Simultaneously, clock synchronization and a predefined broadcast cycle enables transponder-to-AUV range estimates based on the acoustic message time-of-flight. Using the extended Kalman (EKF) filter formulation, the broadcasted kinematic information and acoustic ranges are combined onboard each AUV in the fleet to estimate the states of the source ship, the floating transponder, and the AUV itself. Simulation was used to optimize the configuration and performance of the HBL navigation, and field tests were performed to evaluate the navigational performance. In post-processing, high-accuracy position and timing data for the source ship and floating buoy was added to the onboard navigation data in an EKF to recreate the path of the AUV. The accuracy of this post-mission localization was evaluated relative to AUV positions independently measured by an acoustic tracking array at the test facility. The resulting AUV position estimation showed a mean error of 1.59 m, an improvement over the previous result (using MSBL navigation only) of 3.30 m.

ID TRACKING
AB The objective of the CyberScout project is to develop an autonomous surveillance and reconnaissance system using a network of all-terrain vehicles. In this paper, we focus on two facets of this system: 1) vision for surveillance and 2) autonomous navigation and dynamic path planning. In the area of vision-based surveillance, we have developed robust, efficient algorithms to detect, classify, and track moving objects of interest (person, people, or vehicle) with a static camera. Adaptation through feedback from the classifier and tracker allow the detector to use grayscale imagery, but perform as well as prior color-based detectors. We have extended the detector using scene mosaicing to detect and index moving objects when the camera is panning or tilting. The classification algorithm performs well (less than 8% error rate for all classes) with coarse inputs (20 x 20-pixel binary image chips), has unparalleled rejection capabilities (rejects 72% of spurious detections), and can flag novel moving objects. The tracking algorithm achieves highly accurate (96%) frame-to-frame correspondence for multiple moving objects in cluttered scenes by determining the discriminant relevance of object features. We have also developed a novel mission coordination architecture, CPAD (Checkpoint/Priority/Action Database), which performs path planning via checkpoint and dynamic priority assignment, using statistical estimates of the environment's motion structure. The motion structure is used to make both preplanning and reactive behaviors more efficient by applying global context. This approach is more computationally efficient than centralized approaches and exploits robot cooperation in dynamic environments better than decoupled approaches.

AB This research presents a hybrid approach for path planning of autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs). During path planning, static obstacles affect the desired path and path distance which result in collision penalties. In this study, the merits of grey wolf optimization (GWO) and genetic algorithm (GA) of bionic-inspired algorithms are integrated to implement a hybrid grey wolf optimization (HGWO) algorithm which allows AUVs to reach their destination safely in an obstacle rich environment. The proposed hybrid path planner is employed for path planning of a single AUV based on collision avoidance. It uses the GA as an initialization generator to overcome the random initialization problem of GWO. In this research, the total cost is considered to be a function of path distance and collision penalties. Further, the application of the proposed hybrid path planner is extended for cooperative path planning of AUVs while avoiding collision using communication consensus. Simulation results are obtained for both a single AUV and multiple AUV path planning in a 3D obstacle rich environment using a proportional-derivative controller. The Kruskal-Wallis test is employed for a non-parametric statistical analysis, where the independence of the results given by the algorithms is demonstrated.

ID OPTIMIZATION
AB The massive amount of data generated daily by various sensors equipped with connected autonomous vehicles (CAVs) can lead to a significant performance issue of data processing and transfer. Network Function Virtualization (NFV) is a promising approach to improving the performance of a CAV system. In an NFV framework, Virtual Network Function (VNF) instances can be placed in edge and cloud servers and connected together to enable a flexible CAV service with low latency. However, protecting a service function chain composed of several VNFs from a failure is challenging in an NFV-based CAV system (VCAV). We propose an integer linear programming (ILP) model and two approximation algorithms for resilient services to minimize the service disruption cost in a VCAV system when a failure occurs. The ILP model, referred to as TERO, allows us to obtain the optimal solution for traffic engineering, including the VNF placement and routing for resilient services with regard to dynamic routing. Our proposed algorithms based on heuristics (i.e., TERH) and reinforcement learning (i.e., TERA) provide an approximation solution for resilient services in a large-scale VCAV system. Evaluation results with real datasets and generated network topologies show that TERH and TERA can provide a solution close to the optimal result. It also suggests that TERA should be used in a highly dynamic VCAV system.

AB Bathymetry is a subset of hydrography, aimed at measuring the depth of waterbodies and waterways. Measurements are taken inter alia to detect natural obstacles or other navigational obstacles that endanger the safety of navigation, to examine the navigability conditions, anchorages, waterways and other commercial waterbodies, and to determine the parameters of the safe depth of waterbodies in the vicinity of ports, etc. Therefore, it is necessary to produce precise and reliable seabed maps, so that any hazards that may occur, particularly in shallow waterbodies, can be prevented, including the high dynamics of hydromorphological changes. This publication is aimed at developing a concept of an innovative autonomous unmanned system for bathymetric monitoring of shallow waterbodies. A bathymetric and topographic system will use autonomous unmanned aerial and surface vehicles to study the seabed relief in the littoral zone (even at depths of less than 1 m), in line with the requirements set out for the most stringent International Hydrographic Organization (IHO) order-exclusive. Unlike other existing solutions, the INNOBAT system will enable the coverage of the entire surveyed area with measurements, which will allow a comprehensive assessment of the hydrographic and navigation situation in the waterbody to be conducted.

AB To achieve better trajectory tracking of the autonomous ground vehicle (AGV), a dual-motor autonomous steering structure and control method are proposed. The model predictive control (MPC) algorithm is utilized to calculate the optimal front wheel angle in real time based on the vehicle information, and dual-motor steering system follows the target angle to achieve trajectory tracking. In this process, to improve the stability of the angle motor, a coordinated steering controller of the angle motor and torque motor is proposed, and the type-2 fuzzy logic is designed based on the target front wheel angle and vehicle speed to optimize coordination coefficient. The front wheel angle step input and double-lane change trajectory tracking conditions are simulated in the carsim and simulink joint simulation platform, the results show that dual-motor steering system has good trajectory tracking ability, compared with no coordinated control, the current and velocity of angle motor are more stable under the coordinated steering control, which greatly reduces the steering load of the angle motor under different working conditions. The final hardware-in-loop test is put forward to verify the effectiveness of the MPC controller and coordinated steering controller.

DE Mobile sensor networks; search and survey; autonomous vehicles
AB In this work, we study algorithms for cooperative search and survey using a fleet of Autonomous Underwater Vehicles (AUVs). Due to the limited energy, communication range/bandwidth, and sensing range of the AUVs, underwater search and survey with multiple AUVs brings about several new challenges since a large amount of data needs to be collected by each AUV, and any AUV may fail unexpectedly. To address the challenges and meet our objectives of minimizing the total survey time and traveled distance of AUVs, we propose a cooperative rendezvous scheme called Synchronization-Based Survey (SBS) to facilitate cooperation among a large number of AUVs when surveying a large area. In SBS, AUVs form an intermittently connected network (ICN) in that they periodically meet each other for data aggregation, control signal dissemination, and AUV failure detection/recovery. Numerical analysis and simulations have been performed to compare the performance of three variants of SBS schemes, namely, Alternating Column Synchronization (ACS), Strict Line Synchronization (SLS), and X Synchronization (XS). The results show that XS can outperform other SBS schemes in terms of the survey time and the traveled distance of AUVs. We also compare XS with nonsynchronization-based survey and the lower bound on the survey time and traveled distance. The results show that XS achieves a close to optimal performance.

AB The car-sharing system based on booming autonomous connected electric vehicles (ACEV-based car sharing system) has a large potential to significantly improve mobility, safety, and environmental friendliness of current transportation systems. However, the ACEV-based car-sharing system lacks comprehensive investigations which considering new emerging features. Also, it is constrained by inherent shortages of traditional car-sharing policies and various involved electric vehicle technologies, e.g., high-cost vehicle relocation, limited vehicle range and long recharge time. To address these problems, a general two-stage multi-objective optimization model is proposed, where it comprehensively formulates the emerging features and mitigates the inherent shortages. Two major goals are achieved, where the appropriated geographical service area is optimized in the first stage and the charging infrastructure allocation is efficiently processed in the second stage. In each stage, the multi-objective optimization model would simultaneously benefit both users and service providers. Also, a novel hybrid parking mechanism is proposed to compromise user flexibility and system management efficiency. The results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method from multiple perspectives. (1) With appropriate estimations of a geographical service area and a reasonable ratio of vehicles to charging infrastructures, the proposed system can offer users efficient service qualities while maintaining a high vehicle usage frequency simultaneously. (2) Further, we find that the electric vehicle (EV) range, the charging speed, and the vehicle supply have a significant impact on the system. Especially, it noted that a fast charging speed gains a vital operation efficiency improvement. (3) In addition, more benefits are achieved when AV and CV technologies are adopted in the system. (4) Also, the adoption of ACEVs can almost reduce the overall CO2 emissions by 42.03% and energy consumption by 31.34% than internal combustion vehicles. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

ID GUIDANCE
AB Possible navigation schemes for an outdoor horticultural robot vehicle are considered. Problems encountered in applying techniques used successfully for industrial Automated Guided Vehicles are highlighted, with particular reference to the problem of finding vehicle position in an absolute Cartesian coordinate frame.
   An alternative navigation scheme is proposed, which relies only on local sensing capabilities. Demanded paths are specified without reference to absolute positions; instead the rows of crop themselves are employed as a navigational aid. Vehicle position is measured relative to the demanded path.
   A Kalman filter based algorithm is described which maintains an estimate of vehicle position in this path-relative coordinate frame; input is taken from a machine vision system which is capable of locating crop rows within a video image. This system permits guidance of an experimental vehicle along artificial crop rows at speeds of up to 1.5 ms(-1) with an acuracy of +/- 20 mm.

AB In this paper, a robust procedure for estimating of nominal hydrodynamic coefficients of an autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) in presence of parameter uncertainties is proposed. Some parameters of the model of an AUV, such as its hydrodynamic coefficients, may perturb from their nominal values because of changes in its operating conditions and the surrounding environment. This paper presents two different filters for robust identification of the AUV parameters. The robust extended Kalman filter (REKF) and the extended H-infinity (EH infinity) filter are implemented to estimate the nominal hydrodynamic coefficients of the AUV. By using a model of a sample AUV and simulating the motion of the vehicle in the diving mode involving parameter perturbations, the performance of the filters is compared. The results show that the REKF outperforms the EH infinity, filter in this application. Also, the performance of these estimation algorithms is compared with the standard extended Kalman filter (EKF), using the data obtained from experimental test of a real AUV. It is observed that the model using the identified values of hydrodynamic coefficients of both filters can predict the actual trajectory of the vehicle and the robust filters are more accurate as compared to the standard EKF.

AB This paper provides an overview of the Naval Postgraduate School ARIES autonomous underwater vehicle and its control and navigation performance. An attempt is made to highlight its current operational capabilities and provide a description of future enhancements for greater mission utility and flexibility. An overview of the vehicle design along with descriptions of all major hardware components and sensors is given. A major discussion of the implementation of a modular, multirate, multiprocess software architecture for the ARIES is provided. The architecture is designed to operate using either a single computer processor or two independent, cooperating processors linked through a network interface for improved load balancing. A dual computer implementation is presented here since each processor assumes different tasks for mission operation. Also included is a section on the underwater navigation method using a real-time extended Kalman filter that fuses all sensor data and computes the real time position, orientation, velocity, etc., of the vehicle. Experimental results for navigational accuracy using a DGPS/IMU/Doppler-aided navigation system are presented with DGPS pop-up maneuvers. Navigational accuracy is a requirement for the use of ARIES as a mobile communications network node. This work provides some examples of missions possible with such a node and the current state of its command and control system.

ID OBSERVER; SYSTEMS; REJECTION
AB This paper studies the position regulation problems of an Autonomous Underwater Vehicle (AUV) subject to external disturbances that may have abrupt variations due to some events, e.g., water flow hitting nearby underwater structures. The disturbing forces may frequently exceed the actuator capacities, necessitating a constrained optimization of control inputs over a future time horizon. However, the AUV dynamics and the parameters of the disturbance models are unknown. Estimating the Markovian processes of the disturbances is challenging since it is entangled with uncertainties from AUV dynamics. As opposed to a single-Markovian description, this paper formulates the disturbed AUV as an unknown Markovian-Jump Linear System (MJLS) by augmenting the AUV state with the unknown disturbance state. Based on an observer network and an embedded solver, this paper proposes a reinforcement learning approach, Disturbance-Attenuation-net (MDA-net), for attenuating Markovian-jump disturbances and stabilizing the disturbed AUV. MDA-net is trained based on the sensitivity analysis of the optimality conditions and is able to estimate the disturbance and its transition dynamics based on observations of AUV states and control inputs online. Extensive numerical simulations of position regulation problems and preliminary experiments in a tank testbed have shown that the proposed MDA-net outperforms the existing DOB-net and a classical approach, Robust Integral of Sign of Error (RISE).

AB In recent years, artificial intelligence (AI) has become one of the most prominent fields in autonomous vehicles (AVs). With the help of AI, the stress levels of drivers have been reduced, as most of the work is executed by the AV itself. With the increasing complexity of models, explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) techniques work as handy tools that allow naive people and developers to understand the intricate workings of deep learning models. These techniques can be paralleled to AI to increase their interpretability. One essential task of AVs is to be able to follow the road. This paper attempts to justify how AVs can detect and segment the road on which they are moving using deep learning (DL) models. We trained and compared three semantic segmentation architectures for the task of pixel-wise road detection. Max IoU scores of 0.9459 and 0.9621 were obtained on the train and test set. Such DL algorithms are called "black box models" as they are hard to interpret due to their highly complex structures. Integrating XAI enables us to interpret and comprehend the predictions of these abstract models. We applied various XAI methods and generated explanations for the proposed segmentation model for road detection in AVs.

TI Fault diagnosis in autonomous underwater vehicle propeller in the

AB Propellers are one of the key parts on the autonomous underwater vehicles. When adopting the conventional particle filter to estimate the degree of fault, based on the status given by the sensors, the diagnosis value is not always satisfactory in the transition stage (as it accelerates substantially). The diagnosis value is relatively larger than it is in the cruising stage, and this might weaken the ability to classify using the fault diagnosis method. This article proposes a new fault diagnosis method combining the grey prediction and rank particle filter method. The main improvements include two aspects: status input prediction and thrust loss trend analysis. The status input into the rank particle filter is predicted by the grey prediction method, to meet the condition that the thrust loss estimation does not change quickly when the control signal changes drastically. Subsequently, the control signal change rate is combined to analyse the thrust loss change trend. This improvement reduces the diagnosis value under normal conditions and enlarges the ratio between faulty and normal conditions. Simulation experiments are carried out to verify the performance of the proposed algorithm. The results show that the proposed method could reduce the thrust loss estimation error and enlarge the ratio of diagnosis value between faulty and normal conditions, providing basis for the following operation.

ID DIAGNOSIS
AB A novel thruster fault identification method for autonomous underwater vehicle is presented in this article. It uses the proposed peak region energy method to extract fault feature and uses the proposed least square grey relational grade method to estimate fault degree. The peak region energy method is developed from fusion feature modulus maximum method. It applies the fusion feature modulus maximum method to get fusion feature and then regards the maximum of peak region energy in the convolution operation results of fusion feature as fault feature. The least square grey relational grade method is developed from grey relational analysis algorithm. It determines the fault degree interval by the grey relational analysis algorithm and then estimates fault degree in the interval by least square algorithm. Pool experiments of the experimental prototype are conducted to verify the effectiveness of the proposed methods. The experimental results show that the fault feature extracted by the peak region energy method is monotonic to fault degree while the one extracted by the fusion feature modulus maximum method is not. The least square grey relational grade method can further get an estimation result between adjacent standard fault degrees while the estimation result of the grey relational analysis algorithm is just one of the standard fault degrees.

AB Pooled on-demand services promise to provide a convenient mobility experience and increase efficiency of road transport. We apply an established ride-pooling algorithm within the simulation framework MATSim to an autonomous fleet serving almost 2 million requests in Munich. Two mode choice scenarios are implemented, one substituting all car trips by ride-pooling, another one with free mode choice. For both scenarios we compare a stop-based and a door-to-door service in terms of system efficiency and noise imissions, applying an updated noise prediction model in MATSim. The results contribute to the systematic analysis of ride-pooling and show the effects of the proposed policies and service designs, which are essential for an efficient system with low noise exposure. Replacing all car trips by a stop-based ride-pooling system leads to a drastic noise reduction in residential areas whereas door-to-door systems may even increase noise exposure due to additional pick-up/drop-off rides and detours.

AB The primary focus of autonomous driving research is to improve driving accuracy and reliability. While great progress has been made, state-of-the-art algorithms still fail at times and some of these failures are due to the faults in sensors. Such failures may have fatal consequences. It therefore is important that automated cars foresee problems ahead as early as possible. By using real-world data and artificial injection of different types of sensor faults to the healthy signals, data models can be trained using machine learning techniques. This paper proposes a novel fault detection, isolation, identification and prediction (based on detection) architecture for multi-fault in multi-sensor systems, such as autonomous vehicles.Our detection, identification and isolation platform uses two distinct and efficient deep neural network architectures and obtained very impressive performance. Utilizing the sensor fault detection system's output, we then introduce our health index measure and use it to train the health index forecasting network.

ID PATH PLANNING ALGORITHM; COORDINATION CONTROL; UNDERACTUATED SHIPS
AB In this paper, a hierarchical control framework with relevant algorithms is proposed to achieve autonomous navigation for an underactuated unmanned surface vehicle (USV) swarm. In order to implement automatic target tracking, obstacle avoidance and avoid collisions between group members, the control framework is divided into three layers based on task assignments: flocking strategy design, motion planning and control input design. The flocking strategy design transmits some basic orders to swarm members. Motion planning applies the potential function method and then improves it; thus, the issue of autonomous control is transformed into one of designing the velocity vector. In the last layer, the control inputs (surge force and yaw moment) are designed using the sliding mode method, and the problem of underactuation is handled synchronously. The proposed closed-loop controller is shown to be semi-asymptotically stable by applying Lyapunov stability theory, and the effectiveness of the proposed methodology is demonstrated via numeric simulations of a homogeneous USV swarm.

AB Tractor-trailer systems as multibody modular robotic systems have been widely used to increase load transportation capacity. Control of these systems started from motion aid facilities in human-driven vehicles to fully autonomous mobile robots in recent years. The mobility of these systems is restricted due to the presence of nonholonomic constraints of wheels and also to the system severe underactuated nature. Several control problems are under research for autonomous navigation of such systems. Trajectory tracking is one of the main problems in the context of autonomous nonholonomic systems. In this paper, dynamic modeling and control of a car with n trailers have been developed. First, a dynamic model of the system is obtained. Next, an output feedback kinematic controller and a feedback linearization kinetic controller have been used for tracking control of the system. Finally, experimental results are presented to show the merits of the proposed method.

ID OBSTACLE AVOIDANCE; OPTIMIZATION
AB This paper presents a trajectory planner for autonomous driving based on a Nonlinear Model Predictive Control (NMPC) algorithm that accounts for Pacejka's nonlinear lateral tyre dynamics as well as for zero speed conditions through a novel slip angle calculation. In the NMPC framework, road boundaries and obstacles (both static and moving) are taken into account with soft and hard constraints implementation. The numerical solution of the NMPC problem is carried out using ACADO toolkit coupled with the quadratic programming solver qpOASES. The effectiveness of the proposed NMPC trajectory planner has been tested using CarMaker multibody models. The formulation of vehicle, road and obstacles' models has been specifically tailored to obtain a continuous and differentiable optimisation problem. This allows to achieve a computationally efficient implementation by exploiting automatic differentiation. Moreover, robustness is improved by means of a parallelised implementation of multiple instances of the planning algorithm with different spatial horizon lengths. Time analysis and performance results obtained in closed-loop simulations show that the proposed algorithm can be implemented within a real-time control framework of an autonomous vehicle.

ID RECONSTRUCTION
AB Inspection and maintenance of marine energy farms are becoming increasingly important as more farms are developed and constructed. In this study, structural monitoring system using an autonomous surface vehicle (ASV) has been proposed to enable the inspection of an offshore power plant under harsh ocean disturbances. In particular, the ASV uses guidance and control laws to minimize the deviation from the desired path in waypoint tracking. The ASV was also equipped with multi-modal sensors - sonar and light detection and ranging (LiDAR) - for mapping underwater and surface structures. By utilizing the navigation sensors, the motion of the ASV in ocean disturbances was accurately estimated and incorporated into the mapping process to produce consistent multi-modal maps. Furthermore, dedicated outlier removal methods were proposed to improve the performance over conventional approaches in real offshore data. We considered the sparsity of the sonar and LiDAR data in their respective modality during acquisition and designed novel submap-based filtering to remove the outliers. To validate the proposed system, a field test was conducted on an offshore wave farm structure. It was verified that the ASV can cope with ocean disturbances in its waypoint tracking, and the resulting multi-modal maps are consistent and outlier-free.

Each connecting joint is driven by a two-stage bevel gear, which is compact in structure and has good strength and rigidity, and can drive the cabins to achieve two degrees of freedom (i.e., pitch and yaw) motion. Computational fluid dynamics (CFD) technology was used to build a numerical pool and calculate the added mass coefficient and drag coefficient of each cabin. The kinematics model of MJ-AUV was established and the force analysis was carried out. On this basis, the simulation environment was built through computational multi-body dynamics (MBD) software MSC Adams, which was used to systematically analyze the multiple motion states of MJ-AUV. Lake and sea trials conducted in Thousand Islet Lake, the South China Sea, Qingdao Coast, and other places have validated the actual performance of the designed MJ-AUV, including cruising mode, vertical profile motion, deep diving and water surface motion.

DE Localization; autonomous vehicle navigation; visual-based navigation
AB In this letter, we propose a method for accurately estimating the 6-Degree Of Freedom (DOF) pose in an urban environment when a High Definition (HD) map is available. An HD map expresses 3D geometric data with semantic information in a compressed format and thus is more memory-efficient than point cloud maps. The small capacity of HD maps can be a significant advantage for autonomous vehicles in terms of map storage and updates within a large urban area. Unfortunately, existing approaches failed to sufficiently exploit HD maps by only estimating partial pose. In this study, we present a full 6-DOF localization against an HD map using an onboard stereo camera with semantic information from roads. We introduce an 8-bit representation for road information, which allow for effective bitwise operation when matching between query data and the HD map. For the pose estimation, we leverage a particle filter followed by a full 6-DOF pose optimization. Our experimental results show a median error of approximately 0.3 m in the lateral and longitudinal directions for a drive of approximately 11 km. These results can be used by autonomous vehicles to correct the global position without using Global Positioning System (GPS) data in highly complex urban environments. The median operation speed is approximately 60 msec supporting 10 Hz.

AB Improved designs for Autonomous Underwater Vehicles (AUV) are becoming increasingly important due to their utility in academic and industrial applications. However, a majority of such testing and design is carried out under conditions that may not reflect the operating environment of shallow water AUVs. This may lead to imprecise estimations of the AUV's performance and sub-optimal designs. This article presents experimental and numerical studies carried out in conjunction, to investigate the hydrodynamic characteristics of AUV hulls at different Reynolds numbers over sloped channel-beds. We carry out experiments to measure the velocity field and turbulent statistics around the AUV with quantified uncertainty. These are contrasted against corresponding flat bed experiments to gauge the effect of test bed topography on AUV performance. The experimental data was used to validate Reynolds Stress Model predictions. Hydrodynamic parameters such as drag, pressure and skin friction coefficients were predicted from the RSM simulations at different test bed slopes, angles of attack and drift angles of the AUV hull, to analyze the hydrodynamic performance of the AUV. The results presented in this article offer avenues for design improvement of AUVs operating in shallow environments, such as the continental slope and estuaries.

AB Autonomous Vehicles (AVs) are increasingly embraced around the world to advance smart mobility and more broadly, smart, and sustainable cities. Algorithms form the basis of decision-making in AVs, allowing them to perform driving tasks autonomously, efficiently, and more safely than human drivers and offering various economic, social, and environmental benefits. However, algorithmic decision-making in AVs can also introduce new issues that create new safety risks and perpetuate discrimination. We identify bias, ethics, and perverse incentives as key ethical issues in the AV algorithms' decision-making that can create new safety risks and discriminatory outcomes. Technical issues in the AVs' perception, decision-making and control algorithms, limitations of existing AV testing and verification methods, and cybersecurity vulnerabilities can also undermine the performance of the AV system. This article investigates the ethical and technical concerns surrounding algorithmic decision-making in AVs by exploring how driving decisions can perpetuate discrimination and create new safety risks for the public. We discuss steps taken to address these issues, highlight the existing research gaps and the need to mitigate these issues through the design of AV's algorithms and of policies and regulations to fully realise AVs' benefits for smart and sustainable cities.

ID PRODUCT GROWTH; POLICY
AB Autonomous vehicles (AVs) are expected to act as an economically-disruptive transportation technology offering several benefits to the society and causing significant changes in travel behavior and network performance. However, one of the critical issues that policymakers are facing is the absence of a sound estimation of their market penetration. This study is an effort to quantify the effect of different drivers on the adoption timing of AVs. To this end, we develop an innovation diffusion model in which individuals' propensities to adopt a new technology such as AVs takes influence from a desire to innovate and a need to imitate the rest of the society. It also captures various sources of inter-personal heterogeneity. We found that conditional on our assumptions regarding the changes in market price of AVs over time, their market penetration in our study region (Chicago metropolitan area) will eventually reach 71.3%. Further, model estimation results show that a wide range of socio-demographic factors, travel pattern indicators, technology awareness, and perceptions of AVs are influential in people's AV adoption timing decision. For instance, frequent long-distance travelers are found to make the adoption decision more innovatively while those who have experienced an accident in their lifetime are found to be more influenced by word of mouth.

AB Autonomous Underwater Vehicles (AUVs) are an indispensable tool for studying the world's oceans. They can be equipped with sophisticated sensors and are capable of collecting scientific data under difficult and harsh conditions. Most AUVs rely on batteries to operate, making energy a critical resource. This paper evaluates the benefits of adaptive sampling strategies that allow AUVs to change sensing behaviors by modeling and tracking underwater features. For many AUVs, particularly gliders, these strategies can effectively extend mission duration. Often, necessary or likely preconditions of environmental features can be detected with simple, low energy cost sensors in combination with modeling software. Once precursors have been identified, more sophisticated and energy-hungry sensors can be utilized, collecting scientific data of higher quality. The use of both hardware and software trigger chains can reduce the energy consumption of sensors without sacrificing the collection of relevant data. We used thermocline detection software together with a lower powered sensor to trigger more expensive fluorescence and backscatter sensors on the Slocum Glider. The use of several different thermocline detection algorithms enabled us to compare their precision and power/energy savings. We show energy savings of up to 82% in simulations, and 50% and 63% through two at-sea experiments. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB This paper presents an optimal and efficient path planner based on a shell space decomposition (SSD) scheme for autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) operating in cluttered and uncertain environments. In 3D space the shells define the volume between adjacent spheres, whereas in a 2D plane the shells become annuli which define the area between adjacent circles. In this scheme, the search space is decomposed into shells radiating out from start to destination with a control point placed within each region. The trajectory is then generated from the control points using Splines. This arrangement gives freedom to the placement of the control points, while still restricting the search space to reduce computation time. The SSD scheme has been integrated with a QPSO based path planner and tested to find an optimal trajectory for an AUV navigating through a variable ocean environment.in the presence of obstacles. Simulation results show that the proposed SSD approach is able to obtain a more optimized trajectory than the circle/sphere constrained methods and achieve faster convergence speed than the full space searching method. Monte Carlo trials were run to assess the robustness of the SSD method, the results demonstrate the inherent superiority of the proposed SSD method. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Roundabouts have many benefits when compared with traditional signal-controlled intersections: improve safety, reduce delay, improve traffic flow, are less expensive, and occupy less area. The behavior of traffic participants is full of uncertainties in the real world. An automated system that relies only on its perception is unable to safely enter the roundabout until a large gap occurs or the vehicle approaching has actually left the roundabout or passed the conflict area. In order to improve the driving quality, autonomous vehicles should be able to infer the correct intention at roundabouts as early as possible. In this work, a method to classify the intentions of the surrounding vehicles at unsignalized roundabouts is proposed. For each vehicle at the scene, a Dynamic Bayesian Network is instantiated and the intentions are inferred using a particle filter.

AB Autonomous Undenvater Vehicles (AUVs) are mobile platforms with excellent maneuverability, which are preferred for microscale and mesoscale ocean feature tracking in near real time mode. With their good maneuverability and low cost, AUVs make autonomy mobile observation of ocean dynamic process feasible and convenient. Aiming for the observation of the typical microscale and mesoscale oceanographic features near South China Seas, we give thorough discussion of control and tracking strategy with AUVs. Firstly, we give the composition of autonomy observation system, mainly including vehicle dynamic control, multi underwater vehicles path plan and data process. Secondly, considering the driving factors and variation properties of the ocean feature, we give the control and decision making strategy with underwater vehicles for ocean feature tracking. Lastly, with respect to different types of ocean feature, we give discussion of advantages and constraint conditions of the AUVs control and tracking strategy.

AB The unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)-aided vehicular communication can be greatly facilitated by joint optimization of UAV trajectory design and vehicle assignment. While most existing works are based on the full observation of system state, we consider the partial observability with predicting the vehicles' trajectories. The vehicle trajectory prediction and joint optimization problem are modeled as a Partially-Observable Markov Decision Process (POMDP). To deal with the non-Markovian of the POMDP, we construct a new deep recurrent Q-network (DRQN) framework based on deep Q-network (DQN) algorithm and Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) layer. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed DRQN-based scheme is fast convergent and outperforms the baseline schemes in terms of the sum spectral efficiency.

AB Object detection is an important factor in the autonomous driving industry. Object detection for autonomous vehicles requires robust results, because various situations and environments must be considered. A sensor fusion method is used to implement robust object detection. A sensor fusion method using a network should effectively meld two features, otherwise, there is concern that the performance is substantially degraded. To effectively use sensors in autonomous vehicles, data analysis is required. We investigated papers in which the camera and LiDAR data change for effective fusion. We propose a feature switch layer for a sensor fusion network for object detection in cameras and LiDAR. Object detection performance was improved by designing a feature switch layer that can consider its environment during network feature fusion. The feature switch layer extracts and fuses features while considering the environment in which the sensor data changes less than during the learning network. We conducted an evaluation experiment using the Dense Dataset and confirmed that the proposed method improves the object detection performance.

ID STIMULATION
AB Automotive radar sensors play a key role in the current development of autonomous driving. Their ability to detect objects even under adverse conditions makes them indispensable for environment-sensing tasks in autonomous vehicles. The thorough and in-place validation of radar sensors demands an integrative test system. Radar target simulators (RTSs) are capable of performing over-the-air validation tests by creating artificial radar echoes that are perceived as targets by the radar under test (RuT). Since the authenticity and credibility of these targets are based on the accuracy with which they are generated, their simulated position must be arbitrarily adjustable. In this article, a new approach to synthesize virtual radar targets at an arbitrary angle of arrival (AoA) is presented. The concept is based on the superposition of the returning signals of two adjacent RTS channels. A theoretical model describing the basic principle and its constraints is developed. Additionally, a measurement campaign is conducted that verifies the practical functionality of the proposed scheme.

AB Perspective-taking (PT) accessibility has been recognized as an important factor in affecting moral reasoning, also playing a non-trivial role in moral investigation towards autonomous vehicles (AVs). A new proposal to deepen this effect leverages the principles of the veil of ignorance (VOI), as a moral reasoning device aimed to control self-interested decisions by limiting the access to specific perspectives and to potentially biased information. Throughout two studies, we deepen the role of VOI reasoning in the moral perception of AVs, disclosing personal and contingent information progressively throughout the experiment. With the use of the moral trilemma paradigm, two different VOI conditions were operationalized, inspired by the Original Position theory by John Rawls and the Equiprobability Model by John Harsanyi. Evidence suggests a significant role of VOI reasoning in affecting moral reasoning, which seems not independent from the order in which information is revealed. Coherently, a detrimental effect of self-involvement on utilitarian behaviours was detected. These results highlight the importance of considering PT accessibility and self-involvement when investigating moral attitudes towards AVs, since it can help the intelligibility of general concerns and hesitations towards this new technology.

AB This article investigates the singularity avoidance adaptive output-feedback fixed-time consensus control problem for multiple autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) subject to nonlinearities. A distributed state observer is designed to reconstruct the unmeasurable coupling states of each AUV system. In order to handle the unknown nonlinearities of the multi-AUV systems, the fuzzy logic systems are adopted to approximate unknown hydrodynamic parameters. By combining adaptive fixed-time control with backstepping technology, an adaptive singularity avoidance fixed-time consensus control algorithm is developed, where a new error switching mechanism is designed for avoiding the singularity problem caused by the differentiation of the virtual control law. Subsequently, a singularity avoidance distributed adaptive output-feedback fixed-time fuzzy controller is presented, under which an auxiliary function is designed to handle the difficulty of the fixed-time stability analysis under the output-feedback control strategy, where two types of observer errors are needed in the designed Lyapunov function to achieve the fixed-time stability. Then, based on the fixed-time stability criterion, it is proved that both the consensus tracking performance and the closed-loop stability can be guaranteed in fixed time. Finally, a simulation example verifies the effectiveness of the developed control strategy.

ID SCHEME
AB A novel laser-assisted LED for adaptive-driving-beam (ADB) headlights employing an ultra-reliable Ce3+: YAG-based single crystal phosphor (SCP)-converter layer for use in autonomous vehicles is demonstrated. The SCP fabricated at a high-temperature of 1,940 degrees C exhibited better thermal stability than other phosphor-converter materials, evidenced by a thermal aging test. The high-beam pattern of the ADB is measured at a luminous intensity of 88,436 cd at 0 degrees, 69,393 cd at +/- 2.5 degrees, and 42,942 cd at +/- 5 degrees, which well satisfies the ECE R112 class B regulation. The advantage of introducing the laser-assisted LED system employing the highly reliable SCP is to produce the high intensity for the ADB, which enables the increase of the field of view by 20% and the brightness by 28% for the ADB headlight and results in improving the visibility from +/- 7 degrees to +/- 8.5 degrees and the illumination distance up to 200 m. This proposed advance ADB headlight with the ultra-reliable SCP and the novel laser-assisted LED is favorable as one of the most promising ADB light source candidates for use in the next-generation autonomous vehicle applications.

AB Consumer resistance is a major barrier to diffusing radical innovation into mainstream markets. While recent studies have highlighted the influence that brands might have on innovation adoption decisions, surprisingly little is understood about the role of brands in overcoming consumer resistance to radical innovation such as Artificial Intelligence (AI) technology. To address this, we investigate consumer resistance to AI-powered technology in the context of autonomous vehicles. Specifically, this study builds on the self-brand connection and brand concept literature to examine: (1) the mechanism through which self-brand connection influences radical innovation adoption by mitigating consumer resistance; (2) how this mechanism is moderated by the brand concept (conservation vs. openness); and (3) how brands can effectively overcome consumer resistance through marketing communications. By means of three empirical studies, we find that self-brand connections are positively associated with intentions to adopt radical innovation and that this effect is mediated by reduced risk barriers (Study 1). We further demonstrate that the influence of self-brand connection is much lower for conservation brands than for openness brands (Study 2). Finally, we show that conservation brands can leverage consumers' self-brand connection when they effectively enhance their innovation capabilities through marketing communications (Study 3).

ID CLUSTERING PROTOCOL
AB The Internet of underwater things (IoUT) has become a promising and vibrant paradigm which mainly relies on the underwater acoustic wireless sensor networks (UASN). IoUT was first proposed to facilitate offshore real-time monitoring and exploration of underwater environments. It is now becoming a key component for building and connecting the futuristic underwater smart cities. However, Acoustic waves used in underwater communication suffer from long propagation delays and high transmission energy requirements. Therefore, approaches for autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) assisted data collection and cluster-based routing were proposed to overcome these drawbacks. In this article, we present a smart genetic-based AUV path planning algorithm for data collection to enhance the performance of UASN. In addition, we combine our smart data collection technique with a dynamic location-unaware clustering algorithm to further reduce energy consumption with mobility consideration. Our simulation results showed that our genetic-based technique achieves more than 145% increase in network lifetime and almost a 75% reduction in energy expenditure compared with traditional diagonal path selection technique. More simulations comparing our combined technique with a novel clustering technique showed that the network lifetime is twice as better, total energy consumption is nearly 30% less, and the delivery ratio is 15% more at low densities.

AB In this study, a hierarchical robust nonlinear (HRN) controller is designed for the trajectory-tracking of an autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) subject to uncertainties (e.g., current disturbances, unmodeled dynamics and parameter variations). The proposed HRN controller respectively utilizes the back-stepping and sliding-mode control technique with hierarchical structure based on the kinematic and dynamic models of the system. Both trajectory-tracking and Virtual velocity control of the AUV are achieved with guaranteed asymptotic stability. An initial study was performed based on a simplified 4 degree-of-freedom model for the AUV to evaluate the viability of the proposed approach. Simulations results showed excellent performance of the AUV closed-loop system. A 6 degree-of freedom model of the AUV system was later developed and an HRN controller was designed for trajectory tracking of the AUV. The robustness of the proposed HRN controller was verified through injection of random uncertainties into the system model. The closed-loop stability of the proposed individual subsystems is respectively guaranteed to have uniformly ultimately bounded (UUB) performance based on the Lyapunov stability criteria. Furthermore, computer simulations have shown that the overall closed-loop system with an HRN controller achieves good asymptotic tracking performance which proves the feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed control scheme.

AB The existing wireless power transfer systems for autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) have problems due to long transmission distances and the unstable attitudes of AUVs, which result in poor system performance. To solve this problem, this paper proposes a lightweight universal variable ring-shaped magnetic coupler for the shape characteristics of AUVs and the charging platform environment. In particular, the size of the magnetic coupler transmitter can be varied according to the size of the AUV, resulting in a close fit between the magnetic coupler transmitter and receiver, reducing the transmission distance and fixing the AUV attitude. To achieve a lightweight receiver and reduce the burden on the AUV, the design is optimized in terms of both the system topology and the magnetic coupler structure. First, the LCC-S topology is used to reduce the number of components on the secondary side. Second, the use of a nanocrystalline ribbon as the core material effectively reduces the weight of the magnetic coupler receiver. Finally, a 300-W experimental platform is built to verify the functionality of the designed magnetic coupler. The experimental results show that the system has a DC-DC transfer efficiency of 86%. With the variable ring-shaped magnetic coupler, the charging power can be increased by 7.2% when the transmission efficiency remains unchanged.

AB Current 3D target detection methods used in the field of autonomous driving generally have low real-time performance and insufficient target context feature to detect dynamic multi-target accurately. In order to solve these problems, a dynamic multi-target detection algorithm of voxel point cloud fusion based on PointRCNN is proposed, which adopts a two-stage detection structure. The first stage directly processes the point cloud to extract key point features and divides voxel space. A novel submanifold sparse convolution is used to extract voxel features. Then key point features and voxel features of the point cloud are merged to generate pre-selection boxes. In the second stage, reference points are set based on the voxel features. The features of key points around reference points are merged for the second time to achieve optimized detection boxes. Finally, for the problem of inconsistent confidence, a mandatory consistency loss function is proposed to improve the accuracy of the detection box. The proposed algorithm was compared with other algorithms in three different datasets, and further tested on a self-made dataset from an actual vehicle platform. Results showed that the proposed algorithm had higher accuracy, better robustness, stronger generalization ability for dynamic multi-target detection.

AB The integration of Industry 4.0 concepts into today's manufacturing settings has introduced new technology tools that have already started providing companies an increased level of efficiency in certain operations. Autonomous Transfer Vehicles (ATV) are one of these new tools that are popular in today's manufacturing settings. As these tools become an integral part of the manufacturing ecosystem, accurate diagnosis of ATV faults and anomalies will also be crucial in manufacturing settings. Similar to any other intelligent detection of machinery faults, analyzing and utilizing signals measured from attached ATV sensors may reveal any uncovered operational faults or critical operational/safety concerns. In this context, this paper focuses on an intelligent fault detection of an ATV tool utilizing signals measured from multiple attached sensors. A novel Convolutional Neural Network -based data fusion approach, utilizing short time Fourier Transform, is proposed for the detection and identifi-cation of operational faults occurring in an ATV. The approach is tested on an experimental dataset, consisting of two motors' sound and vibration signals, collected as an ATV operates for a specific task under three different conditions. The diagnosis results indicate that the proposed deep learning-based multisensory fault diagnosis approach is able to diagnose operational conditions with significantly high accuracy compared to single or dual sensor approaches.

AB This study aims to establish a dynamic mesh model based on the horizontal planar motion mechanism (HPMM) test and provide a comprehensive database of hydrodynamic coefficients for the autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) numerically and experimentally. A series of HPMM tests in National Cheng Kung University's towing tank validated the simulation results. The dynamic mesh model can be performed on oscillation motions of the yaw mode, the pitch mode, and the roll mode by adding a series of comprehensive user-defined functions (UDFs). The test of straight-line motion with constant drift angles, the pure surge test, the pure yaw test, the pure pitch test, the pure yaw test with a constant drift angle, and the pure pitch test with a constant drift angle are all available for the yaw and pitch modes. In addition, the pivot roll test is included in the roll mode. After measuring forces and moments from an individual HPMM test, the hydrodynamic coefficients can be derived by means of Fourier analysis and the least-square method. Since most numerical results are reasonably in good agreement with the experimental data, applying the proposed dynamic mesh model to the simulation of the HPMM tests in the towing tank can be demonstrated.

AB Shared autonomous vehicles (SAVs) will be an important force to in reshaping urban morphology. The high operation rate and sharing degree of SAV are considered to result in a great reduction in parking area in future cities. Parking space is now a huge and widely distributed urban stock space type, which is bound to become a major challenge and opportunity for sustainable urban renewal in the digital era. Based on the SAV scenario, this paper reviews the current research on the sustainable renewal of urban public parking spaces, and proposes the four key issues involved: how much to renew (i.e., demand forecast analysis), when to renew (i.e., update time series evaluation), what to renew (i.e., function replacement decision) and how to update (i.e., design empirical research). Furthermore, it puts forward a preliminary idea on, and constructs a research framework for, the sustainable renewal methods of parking space under the SAV scenario. Finally, the theoretical, practical and policy implications of the research on sustainable renewal methods of urban public parking space are discussed. It will have great reference value for the redevelopment and reuse of the urban space types including fragmented, widely distributed and large-scale.

Most existing centralized navigation systems often cannot react promptly to real-time local traffic situations, while most existing distributed navigation systems are vulnerable to privacy attacks. To overcome these drawbacks, we propose a learning model that provides a provable guarantee of vehicles' privacy while still enabling efficient navigation under real-time traffic conditions. The proposed model adopts a novel multi-agent system with customized differentially private mechanisms. To verify the effectiveness and stability of our approach, we implement the proposed method on CARLA, which is an autonomous driving simulator. In four experimental tasks with varying parameters, we demonstrate fully that our proposed method outperforms other benchmarks.

AB This paper gives sufficient conditions for string instability in an array of linear time-invariant autonomous vehicles with communication constraints. The vehicles are controlled autonomously and are subject to a rigid or semi-rigid formation policy. The individual controllers are assumed to have a limited range of forward and backward communication with other vehicles. Sufficient conditions are given that imply a lower bound on the peak of the frequency response magnitude of the transfer function mapping a disturbance to the leading vehicle to a vehicle in the chain. This lower bound quantifies the effect of spacing separation policy, intervehicle communication policy, and vehicle settling response performance. These results extend earlier works to give a unified treatment of heterogeneous, non-nearest neighbor communication and semi-rigid one-dimensional formation control.

AB Driving in a dynamic, multi-agent, and complex urban environment is a difficult task requiring a complex decision-making policy. The learning of such a policy requires a state representation that can encode the entire environment. Mid-level representations that encode a vehicle's environment as images have become a popular choice. Still, they are quite high-dimensional, limiting their use in data-hungry approaches such as reinforcement learning. In this article, we propose to learn a low-dimensional and rich latent representation of the environment by leveraging the knowledge of relevant semantic factors. To do this, we train an encoder-decoder deep neural network to predict multiple application-relevant factors such as the trajectories of other agents and the ego car. Furthermore, we propose a hazard signal based on other vehicles' future trajectories and the planned route which is used in conjunction with the learned latent representation as input to a down-stream policy. We demonstrate that using the multi-head encoder-decoder neural network results in a more informative representation than a standard single-head model. In particular, the proposed representation learning and the hazard signal help reinforcement learning to learn faster, with increased performance and less data than baseline methods.

AB In this paper, a simulation-based regression analysis for the rack configuration of an autonomous vehicle storage and retrieval system (AVS/RS) is presented. The aim of this study is to develop mathematical functions for the rack configuration of an AVS/RS that reflects the relationship between the outputs (responses) and the input variables (factors) of the system under various scenarios. In the regression model, we consider five outputs: the average cycle time of storage and retrieval transactions, the average waiting time for vehicle transactions, the average waiting time of vehicles (transactions) for the lift, the average utilisation of vehicles and the average utilisation of the lifts. The input variables are the number of tiers, aisles and bays that determine the size of the warehouse. Thirty regression models are developed for six warehouse scenarios. The simulation model of the system is developed using ARENA 12.0 commercial software and the statistical analyses are completed using MINITAB statistical software. Two different approaches are used to fit the regression functions-stepwise regression and the best subsets. After obtaining the regression functions, we optimise them using the LINGO software. We apply the approach to a company that uses AVS/RS in France.

We present an optimized CRYSTALS-Dilithium software which can quickly process each signing and verification in parallel using embedded Graphic Processing Unit.

AB Autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) shows great potential in the Internet of Underwater Things (IoUT) system, in which the path planning algorithm plays a fundamental role. However, the complex underwater environment brings greater challenges to AUV path planning, especially the ocean current, which has a profound impact on time and energy consumption. This article focuses on the complex ocean current condition and proposes an underwater path planning method based on proximal policy optimization (UP4O). In this novel method, a deep reinforcement network is constructed to serve as a decision control to plan the moving direction of AUV. An information encoding module is developed to extract the features of the local obstacles. Furthermore, UP4O integrates the obstacle features with the current state information, including relative position, ocean current, and velocity, enabling the AUV to focus on the global direction and local obstacles at the same time. Additionally, to further adapt to the ocean current and shorten the time cost, UP4O expands the action space of AUV, realizing a fine and flexible action adjustment. The wide applicability of UP4O has been proved by numerous experiments. The proposed algorithm can always plan the time-saving and collision-free paths in complex underwater environments with various terrains and ocean current.

AB In this paper, a fuzzy sliding mode active disturbance rejection control (FSMADRC) scheme is proposed for an autonomous underwater vehicle-manipulator system (AUVMS) with a two-link and three-joint manipulator. First, the AUVMS is separated into nine subsystems, and the combined effects of dynamic uncertainties, hydrodynamic force, unknown disturbances, and nonlinear coupling terms on each subsystem are lumped into a single total disturbance. Next, a linear extended state observer (LESO) is presented to estimate the total disturbance. Then, a sliding mode active disturbance rejection control (SMADRC) scheme is proposed to enhance the robustness of the control system. The stability of the SMADRC and the estimation errors of the LESO are analyzed. Because it is difficult to simultaneously adjust several parameters for a LESO-based SMADRC scheme, a fuzzy logic control (FLC) scheme is used to formulate the FSMADRC to determine the appropriate parameters adaptively for practical applications. Finally, two AUVMS tasks are illustrated to test the trajectory tracking performance of the closed-loop system and its ability to reject and attenuate the total disturbance. The simulation results show that the proposed FSMADRC scheme achieves better performance and consume less energy than conventional PID and FLC techniques.

AB The proportional and derivative (PD) and proportional, integral, and derivative (PID) controllers have been used extensively in industry due to their simplicity and effectiveness. This paper aims to investigate whether simple PD and adaptive PD-based controllers work for a complex system consisting of a group of multiple autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs). Simple control laws with exact and uncertain gravity compensation are proposed for shape control of multiple AUVs. The proposed adaptive PD-based controller, in the presence of gravity uncertainty, requires only the model of gravity and buoyancy regressor matrix and does not require any knowledge of the inertia matrix, Coriolis and centripetal force, hydrodynamic damping and the parameters of the gravity, and buoyancy forces of the AUVs. Hence, the proposed controllers have the advantages of simplicity and ease of implementation. A novel collision and obstacle avoidance strategy using multi-layer region control concept, which limit the unnecessary use of high control efforts that lead to oscillatory movements of AUVs, is discussed. Lyapunov-like functions are proposed for the stability analysis. Simulation studies on AUVs with 6 degrees-of-freedom are presented to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed controllers.

AB A lithium-ion polymer battery cell is an ideal energy source for underwater vehicles due to its high energy density and small volume. However, the performance of lithium-ion batteries in a 10 000 m deep sea is still unknown and is of particular concern in the design of 10 000 m autonomous remote vehicles (ARVs). In this paper, we explore how the external characterizing parameters of a LiFePO4 polymer battery during discharge are affected by a high pressure of 100 MPa and low temperature of 3 degrees C for simulating the conditions experienced in a 10 000 m deep sea environment. An unscented Kalman filter (UKF) algorithm is applied to estimate the state of charge (SoC) of a battery to investigate the influence of high hydrostatic pressure on SoC estimation due to changes in parameters. The results indicate that the LiFePO4 polymer battery works under 100 MPa hydrostatic pressure, but its parameters change obviously and influence SoC estimation. SoC estimation accuracy was improved through compensating the functions of open circuit voltage (OCV) versus the state of charge (OCV-SoC) of the battery in a 100 MPa hydrostatic pressure and a low temperature environment.

AB Autonomous vehicles (AVs) rely on advanced sensory systems, such as Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR), to function seamlessly in intricate and dynamic environments. LiDAR produces highly accurate 3D point clouds, which are vital for the detection, classification, and tracking of multiple targets. A systematic review and classification of various clustering and Multi-Target Tracking (MTT) techniques are necessary due to the inherent challenges posed by LiDAR data, such as density, noise, and varying sampling rates. As part of this study, the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) methodology was employed to examine the challenges and advancements in MTT techniques and clustering for LiDAR point clouds within the context of autonomous driving. Searches were conducted in major databases such as IEEE Xplore, ScienceDirect, SpringerLink, ACM Digital Library, and Google Scholar, utilizing customized search strategies. We identified and critically reviewed 76 relevant studies based on rigorous screening and evaluation processes, assessing their methodological quality, data handling adequacy, and reporting compliance. As a result of this comprehensive review and classification, we were able to provide a detailed overview of current challenges, research gaps, and advancements in clustering and MTT techniques for LiDAR point clouds, thus contributing to the field of autonomous driving. Researchers and practitioners working in the field of autonomous driving will benefit from this study, which was characterized by transparency and reproducibility on a systematic basis.

AB High-quality strategic planning of autonomous mobility-on-demand (AMOD) systems is critical for the success of the subsequent phases of AMOD system implementation. To assist in strategic AMOD planning, we propose a dynamic and flexible flow-based model of an AMOD system. The proposed model is computationally fast while capturing the state transitions of two coordinated flows (i.e. co-flows): the AMOD service fleet vehicles and AMOD customers. Capturing important quantity dynamics and conservations through a system of ordinary differential equations, the model can economically respond to a large number and a wide range of scenario-testing requests. The paper illustrates the model efficacy through a basic example and a more realistic case study. The case study envisions replacing Manhattan's existing taxi service with a hypothetical AMOD system. The results show that even a simple co-flow model can robustly predict the systemwide AMOD dynamics and support the strategic planning of AMOD systems.

AB In response to the absence of standardized work practices, work safety measures, efficient work procedures, and suitable line planning methods for exploring seabed topography using autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) equipped with side-scan sonar systems, this paper proposes a design framework for side-scan sonar measurement technology based on AUVs. Detailed research has been conducted on line planning methods that differ significantly from those used in shipborne operations. The new line planning method was developed based on the performance characteristics of AUV equipment, the principles of motion modes, and shipborne side-scan sonar operations. The validity of the line planning method was verified through actual sea experiments using different types of AUVs in various terrains. The experimental results demonstrate that the new survey line planning method is distinct from existing AUV path planning methods and is highly applicable for conducting seabed topography exploration operations. Furthermore, the technical design scheme studied in this article is applicable in different sea areas and ensures the safety, operational efficiency, and data quality of AUVs. It holds significant importance for marine science engineering and practical applications. The article also features an analysis of successful data collected from AUVs equipped with side-scan sonar for conducting seabed topography exploration operations.

AB In recent years, researchers have emphasized the relevance of data about commonsense moral judgments for ethical decision-making, notably in the context of debates about autonomous vehicles (AVs). As such, the results of empirical studies such as the Machine Moral Experiment have been influential in debates about the ethics of AVs and some researchers have even put forward methods to automatize ethical decision-making on the basis of such data. In this paper, we argue that data collection is not a neutral process, and the difference in study design can change participants' answers and the ethical conclusions that can be drawn from them. After showing that participants' individual answers are stable in the sense that providing them with a second occasion to reflect on their answers does not change them (Study 1), we show that different conclusions regarding participants' moral preferences can be reached when participants are given a third option allowing AVs to behave randomly (Study 2), and that preference for this third option can be increased in the context of a collective discussion (Study 3). We conclude that design choices will influence the lessons that can be drawn from surveys about participants' moral judgments about AVs and that these choices are not morally neutral.

AB This study aims to develop an experimental-based adaptive fuzzy controller for the diving control system (DCS) of autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) to ensure high stability and rapid integration. The DCS is designed with a depth sensor and an attitude and heading reference system (AHRS) to sense the attitude vector and the current depth of AUV in real-time as the control inputs of attitude close-loop and to calculate yaw and pitch controls of AUV. Therefore, the DCS can integrate depth-keeping and attitude stability controls into the AUV. To verify the robustness and adaptability of the DCS with adaptive fuzzy control, the DCS with universal fuzzy control (A-type DCS), improved fuzzy control (B-type DCS), and adaptive fuzzy control (C-type DCS) have been analyzed. The experimental analysis indicates that the C-type DCS features higher robustness to external force interference than the other types of DCS. The present study establishes an adaption function based on depth -keeping control experiments and demonstrates robustness of the adaptive fuzzy control DCS to environmental disturbances. Consequently, the proposed adaptive fuzzy control DCS is a model-free design that resolves the problem of depth-keeping and attitude stability controls of AUV with unknown hydrodynamic coefficients, rudder dynamics and time-varying external forces.

AB When it comes to some essential abilities of autonomous ground vehicles (AGV), detection is one of them. In order to safely navigate through any known or unknown environment, AGV must be able to detect important elements on the path. Detection is applicable both on-road and off-road, but they are much different in each environment. The key elements of any environment that AGV must identify are the drivable pathway and whether there are any obstacles around it. Many works have been published focusing on different detection components in various ways. In this paper, a survey of the most recent advancements in AGV detection methods that are intended specifically for the off-road environment has been presented. For this, we divided the literature into three major groups: drivable ground and positive and negative obstacles. Each detection portion has been further divided into multiple categories based on the technology used, for example, single sensor-based, multiple sensor-based, and how the data has been analyzed. Furthermore, it has added critical findings in detection technology, challenges associated with detection and off-road environment, and possible future directions. Authors believe this work will help the reader in finding literature who are doing similar works.

AB The purpose of this paper is to present the design, development and testing of an innovative instrument called GraviMob, which allows performing dynamic measurements of underwater gravity anomalies. After recalling the interest in underwater gravimetry, we describe the system, the core of which consists of triads of accelerometers rigidly attached to an Autonomous Underwater Vehicle (AUV). The article also presents the mathematical methods for estimating the east, north and vertical components of the local gravity vector. An unscented Kalman filter, integrating AUV position and orientation data, performs estimation of gravity in a frame adapted to its interpretation. To assess its performance, GraviMob was tested in the Mediterranean Sea during the year 2016. A comparison of the surface gravimetric signal previously acquired by the French Navy indicates that the maximum discrepancy between the vertical gravity component and its reference is below 4 mGal. Components of the vertical deflection calculated from GraviMob's measurements were compared with those calculated from recent gravity field models. While a remarkable agreement was found on the north component, there remains a discrepancy (7 arcsec) on the east component which can be largely reduced by refining the estimation of the orientation of GraviMob's sensitive axes in the AUV.

ID DESIGN
AB Compared to air surroundings, the marine environment is not stable due to the influence of ocean currents and other factors. Misalignments always occur inevitably when autonomous underwater vehicles are charging wirelessly in the docking station. Therefore, misalignment insensitive underwater wireless power transfer system need to be investigated. In this article, a novel hybrid transmitter composed of conical and planar spiral coils is proposed that greatly improves the misalignment tolerance and transfer performance. First, the coil tilt angle theory (CTAT) is presented and verified to determine the optimum tilt angle of conical coil. Then, based on the CTAT, a circular uniform magnetic field zone with a diameter of 30 cm in charging plane can be achieved by flexibly designing the hybrid transmitter. Moreover, a three-dimensional finite-element simulation software is employed to study the eddy current loss under different circumstances. Finally, experimental results show that the proposed transmitter has better performance in output power and power transfer efficiency (PTE) stability within the possible working region compared with conventional transmitters. It has demonstrated that the output power changes only within 5.7% and the PTEs maintain at approximately 86% in excessive misalignment area with transfer distance of 2 cm.

AB Underwater acoustic localization (UWAL) is a useful technique, and is applied in finding the acoustical sources, such as the black box. The existing UWAL methods are mainly based on the time of arrival (TOA), the time difference of arrival (TDOA), and the direction of arrival (DOA), which need the time synchronization, the knowledge of signal period, and the high precision angular measurement, respectively. However, these conditions are difficult to be satisfied in the scene of locating the black box utilizing single autonomous underwater vehicle. In this article, we propose the definition of second-order time difference of arrival (STDOA) and establish the localization model based on the STDOA. The proposed STDOA-based method eliminates the unknown signal period and overcomes the restriction of the traditional TDOA-based method. Combined with the particle filter, target tracking algorithm based on the STDOA is also presented. Precision analysis and the simulation results validate the effectiveness of the STDOA-based method and prove that the proposed method achieves a comparable localization precision compared with the TOA-based method and the TDOA-based method, and a higher precision compared to the DOA-based method.

ID VISION
AB We suggest the use of extended landmarks, such as shorelines, creeks, tree lines, and railroads, as well as roads for autonomous navigation of an unmanned air vehicle (UAV). In particular, we recommend the use of shorelines, because of their common availability, their ease of detection, and their significance in terms of events happening along them. Monitoring coastlines and waterways from low flying UAVs has many applications for military and civilian use. We report the development of a vision system that has enabled a prototype UAV to follow shorelines autonomously (without requiring maps or GPS). Using a near-infrared sensor the vision system distinguishes water from land (irrespective of water's color) and issues commands to the autopilot to follow the coastline or the riverbank. One insight of this problem is that the control algorithm could be integrated deeply with the vision system. This has the benefit of delaying smoothing/regularization so that it could occur in the context of the control coordinate system rather than the image or ground coordinate system. The algorithm itself is simple, but it possibly points the way to future algorithms which could more closely couple image processing and control. Furthermore, the experience gained in this work may be of value in the development of vision systems for following other types of paths. (C) 2010 Published by Elsevier Inc.

AB Extensive use of autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) in oceanographic applications necessitates investigation into the hydrodynamic forces acting over an AUV hull form operating under deeply submerged condition. This paper presents a towing tank-based experimental study on forces and moment on AUV hull form in the vertical plane. The AUV hull form considered in the present program is a 1:2 model of the standard hull form Afterbody1. The present measurements were carried out at typical speeds of autonomous underwater vehicles (0.4-1.4 m/s) by varying pitch angles (0-15). The hydrodynamic forces and moment are measured by an internally mounted multi-component strain gauge type balance. The measurements were used to study variation of axial, normal, drag, lift and pitching moment coefficients with Reynolds number (Re) and angle of attack. The measurements have also been used to validate results obtained from a CFD code that uses Reynolds Average Navier-Stokes equations (ANSYS (TM) Fluent). The axial and normal force coefficients are increased by 18% and 195%; drag, lift and pitching moment coefficients are increased by 90%, 182% and 297% on AUV hull form at alpha = 15 and Re-v = 3.65 x 10(5). These results can give better idea for the efficient design of guidance and control systems for AUV. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB This paper presents the current status of the Springrobot autonomous vehicle project, whose main objective is to develop a safety-warning and driver-assistance system and an automatic pilot for rural and urban traffic environments. This system uses a high precise digital map and a combination of various sensors. The architecture and strategy for the system are briefly described and the details of lane-marking detection algorithms are presented. The R and G channels of the color image are used to form graylevel images. The size of the resulting gray image is reduced and the Sobel operator with a very low threshold is used to get a grayscale edge image. In the adaptive randomized Hough transform, pixels of the gray-edge image are sampled randomly according to their weights corresponding to their gradient magnitudes. The three-dimensional (3-D) parametric space of the curve is reduced to the two-dimensional (2-D) and the one-dimensional (1-D) space. The paired parameters in two dimensions are estimated by gradient directions and the last parameter in one dimension is used to verify the estimated parameters by histogram. The parameters are determined coarsely and quantization accuracy is increased relatively by a multiresolution strategy. Experimental results in different road scene and a comparison with other methods have proven the validity of the proposed method.

AB A mobile ad hoc network (MANET) consists of mobile wireless terminals without using base stations. MANETs are expected to be utilized for various purposes such as traffic jam information announcements for vehicles and safety confirmation systems in disaster. Each MANET uses unique routing protocols that have been adapted for particular applications. Therefore, utilizing a common routing protocol for multiple MANETs is difficult. In this paper, we propose an Autonomous Clustering-based Inter-Domain Routing protocol to communicate between MANETs. Using the autonomous clustering, the proposed inter-domain routing scheme can change the network gateways between MANETs adaptively according to the network topology changes.

AB In this paper we propose a real-time maneuver generation algorithm for Autonomous Vehicles (AVs). Given a planar road geometry with static and moving obstacles along it, we are interested in finding collision-free maneuvers that satisfied the AV's dynamics and subject to physical and comfort limits. Based on longitudinal and transverse coordinates, we propose a novel collision avoidance constraint and formulate a suitable maneuver regulation optimal control problem. Maneuver regulation has intrinsic robustness with respect to standard trajectory tracking that stems from the requirement of following a desired path with a desired velocity profile assigned on it. The optimization problem is solved by using a nonlinear optimal control technique that generates (local) optimal trajectories. We demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed algorithm by providing numerical computations on two different scenarios. Finally, experimental results are presented to demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed algorithm both in terms of computational effort and dynamic features captured.

AB Latest technological improvements increased the quality of transportation. New data-driven approaches bring out a new research direction for all control-based systems, e.g., in transportation, robotics, IoT and power systems. Combining data-driven applications with transportation systems plays a key role in recent transportation applications. In this paper, the latest deep reinforcement learning (RL) based traffic control applications are surveyed. Specifically, traffic signal control (TSC) applications based on (deep) RL, which have been studied extensively in the literature, are discussed in detail. Different problem formulations, RL parameters, and simulation environments for TSC are discussed comprehensively. In the literature, there are also several autonomous driving applications studied with deep RL models. Our survey extensively summarizes existing works in this field by categorizing them with respect to application types, control models and studied algorithms. In the end, we discuss the challenges and open questions regarding deep RL-based transportation applications.

AB Autonomous vehicles as well as sophisticated driver assistance systems use stereo vision to perceive their environment in 3D. At least two Million 3D points will be delivered by next generation automotive stereo vision systems. In order to cope with this huge amount of data in real-time, we developed a medium level representation, named Stixel world. This representation condenses the relevant scene information by three orders of magnitude. Since traffic scenes are dominated by planar horizontal and vertical surfaces our representation approximates the three-dimensional scene by means of thin planar rectangles called Stixel.
   This survey paper summarizes the progress of the Stixel world. The evolution started with a rather simple representation based on a flat world assumption. A major break-through was achieved by introducing deep-learning that allows to incorporate rich semantic information. In its most recent form, the Stixel world encodes geometric, semantic and motion cues and is capable to handle even steepest roads in San Francisco.

ID CLASSIFICATION
AB Driving in adverse weather conditions is a key challenge for autonomous vehicles (AV). Typical scene perception models perform poorly in rainy, foggy, snowy, and cloudy conditions. In addition, we observe transition states between extremes (cloudy to rainy, rainy to sunny, etc.) in nature with variations in adversity. It is crucial to define and understand these transition states in order to develop robust AV perception models. Existing research works on classification focused on identifying extreme weather conditions. However, there is a lack of emphasis on the transition between these extreme weather scenes. Hence, this paper proposes an approach to define and understand six intermediate weather transition states: sunny to rainy, rainy to sunny, and others. Firstly, we propose a way to interpolate the intermediate weather transition data using a variational autoencoder and extract its spatial features using VGG. Further, we model the temporal distribution of these spatial features using a gated recurrent unit to classify the corresponding transition state. Also, we introduce a large-scale dataset called the AIWD6: Adverse Intermediate Weather Driving dataset, generated for three different time intervals. Experimental results on the AIWD6 dataset demonstrate that our model efficiently generates weather transition conditions for AV technology. Also, the spatio-temporal deep neural network can effectively classify the adverse weather transition states for different time intervals.

AB In this paper, a model predictive control (MPC) method optimized by an adaptive particle swarm optimization (APSO) algorithm is proposed. Combined with non-singular terminal sliding mode control (NTSMC), the inner and outer double-closed-loop control system is constructed to solve the fully actuated autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) dynamic trajectory tracking control problem. First, the outer loop controller generates the expected optimal velocity commands and passes them to the inner loop velocity controller, which generates the available control inputs to ensure the entire closed-loop trajectory tracking. In the controller design stage, system input and state constraints are effectively considered. After that, a compensator based on an adaptive radial basis function (RBF) neural network (NN) is designed to compensate for the model error and external sea state disturbances and to improve the control accuracy of the system. Then, the stability of the proposed controller is proved based on Lyapunov analysis. Finally, the dynamic trajectory tracking performance of an AUV with different sea state disturbances is verified by simulation, and the simulation results are compared with double-closed-loop PD control and cascade control of standard MPC based on PSO and SMC. The results show that the designed controller is effective and robust.

AB This paper addresses the problem of trajectory tracking control of an Autonomous Surface Vehicle (ASV) with the presence of uncertainties and disturbances. First, a Time-Varying Nonsingular Terminal Sliding Mode (TV-NTSM) manifold is designed by incorporating a piecewise-defined function of time into a nonsingular terminal sliding mode (NTSM) manifold. As a result, the reaching phase that exists in traditional sliding mode is totally sup-pressed as well as the avoidance of the singularity problem. Then, a TV-NTSM controller is proposed to guarantee the convergence of the tracking errors to the origin in finite-time and to ensure the global robustness of the system with respect to large uncertainties and unknown environmental disturbances. To meet the mission requirement, an adequate method is given for the parameters system selection to guarantees the convergence of the tracking errors to the origin in prespecified time. Furthermore, an adaptive tuning law is introduced to es-timate the unknown upper bounds of the lumped uncertainty, which is convenient for practical implementation. The stability of the closed-loop system is verified by Lyapunov theory and simulation results are carried out to prove the effectiveness of the proposed control algorithm.

AB Docking technology for autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) involves energy supply, data exchange and navigation, and plays an important role to extend the endurance of the AUVs. The navigation method used in the transition between AUV homing and docking influences subsequent tasks. How to improve the accuracy of the navigation in this stage is important. However, when using ultra-short baseline (USBL), outliers and slow localization updating rates could possibly cause localization errors. Optical navigation methods using underwater lights and cameras are easily affected by the ambient light. All these may reduce the rate of successful docking. In this paper, research on an improved localization method based on multi-sensor information fusion is carried out. To improve the localization performance of AUVs under motion mutation and light variation conditions, an improved underwater simultaneous localization and mapping algorithm based on ORB features (IU-ORBSALM) is proposed. A nonlinear optimization method is proposed to optimize the scale of monocular visual odometry in IU-ORBSLAM and the AUV pose. Localization tests and five docking missions are executed in a swimming pool. The localization results indicate that the localization accuracy and update rate are both improved. The 100% successful docking rate achieved verifies the feasibility of the proposed localization method.

AB Knowing the displacement capacity and mobility patterns of industrially exploited (i.e., fished) marine resources is key to establishing effective conservation management strategies in human-impacted marine ecosystems. Acquiring accurate behavioral information of deep-sea fished ecosystems is necessary to establish the sizes of marine protected areas within the framework of large international societal programs (e.g., European Community H2020, as part of the Blue Growth economic strategy). However, such information is currently scarce, and high-frequency and prolonged data collection is rarely available. Here, we report the implementation of autonomous underwater vehicles and remotely operated vehicles as an aid for acoustic long-baseline localization systems for autonomous tracking of Norway lobster (Nephrops norvegicus), one of the key living resources exploited in European waters. In combination with seafloor moored acoustic receivers, we detected and tracked the movements of 33 tagged lobsters at 400-m depth for more than 3 months. We also identified the best procedures to localize both the acoustic receivers and the tagged lobsters, based on algorithms designed for off-the-shelf acoustic tags identification. Autonomous mobile platforms that deliver data on animal behavior beyond traditional fixed platform capabilities represent an advance for prolonged, in situ monitoring of deep-sea benthic animal behavior at meter spatial scales.

AB Vehicle automation is progressing rapidly and autonomous vehicles (AVs) are forecast to become a central feature of transportation systems globally. This development has the potential to result in profound changes in walking behaviors. The present study examined this issue from the perspective of relevant experts for the purpose of informing health policy. Interviews were conducted with 44 key stakeholders in Australia (n = 34), the European Union (n = 5), the UK (n = 4), and the US (n = 1). The stakeholders represented a wide range of sectors including government, AV manufacturing/servicing companies, transport policy consortiums, technology firms, insurers (public and private), trade unions, consumer representation organizations, and academia. Two potential scenarios were evident in interviewees' discussions of the ways AVs are likely to be introduced and the implications for walking behaviors. The most beneficial scenario, but the least likely to eventuate, was considered to be the situation where people relinquish private vehicle ownership and rely on a combination of walking, public transport, and on-demand transport. The alternative scenario involved greater private AV ownership, traffic congestion, and urban sprawl, resulting in less walking activity. The convergence of the stakeholders' views around the opposing identified scenarios highlights the need for proactive policy development to ensure the emerging transport transformation does not result in substantial increases in sedentarism.

AB This paper proposes a framework for analysing interactions between socio-technical systems and for identifying their impacts on transition of socio-technical systems. The framework is framework as: interfaces between systems, relationships between systems through their interface, intensity of interactions, impacts of inter-system interactions. The framework is intended to assist in the systematic identification of potential interactions between two systems. This may assist in identifying how the interactions are part of the co-evolutionary process and hence where measures to strengthen interactions can support the transition process. The application of the framework to heat pumps and autonomous vehicles reveals the flexibility of the suggested scheme of analysis for different types of systems.

AB We design and experimentally evaluate a hybrid safe-by-construction longitudinal collision avoidance controller for autonomous vehicles. The controller combines into a single architecture the respective advantages of a model predictive controller and a discrete safe controller. The model predictive controller is used to achieve optimal efficiency in nominal conditions. The safe controller avoids collision by applying two different policies, for nominal and out-of-nominal conditions, respectively. We present design principles for both controllers and show how each one can contribute in the hybrid architecture to improve performance, road occupancy and passenger comfort while preserving safety. The experimental results confirm the feasibility of the approach and the practical relevance of hybrid controllers for safe and efficient driving.

AB To deal with the disturbances of wave and current in the heading control of Autonomous Underwater Vehicles (AUVs), an optimal disturbances rejection control (ODRC) approach for AUVs in shallow water environment is designed to realize this application. Based on the quadratic optimal control theory, the AUVs heading control problem can be expressed as a coupled two-point boundary value (TPBV) problem. Using a recently developed successive approximation approach, the coupled TPBV problem is transformed into solving a decoupled linear state equation sequence and a linear adjoint equation sequence. By iteratively solving the two equation sequences, the approximate ODRC law is obtained. A Luenberger observer is constructed to estimate wave disturbances. Simulation is provided to demonstrate the effectiveness of the presented approach.

Alice utilizes a highly networked control system architecture to provide high performance autonomous driving in unknown environments. Innovations include a vehicle architecture designed for efficient testing in harsh environments, a highly sensory-driven approach to fuse sensor data into speed maps used by real-time trajectory optimization algorithms, health and contingency management algorithms to manage failures at the component and system level, and a software logging and display environment that enables rapid assessment of performance during testing. The system successfully completed several runs in the National Qualifying Event, but encountered a combination of sensing and control issues in the Grand Challenge Event that led to a critical failure after traversing approximately 8 miles.

AB Taking advantage of two-way communication infrastructure and bidirectional energy trading between utility companies and customers in the future smart grid (SG), autonomous energy management programs become crucial to the demand-side management (DSM). Most of the existing autonomous energy management schemes are for the scenario with a single utility company or the scenario with one-way energy trading. In this paper, an autonomous household energy management system with multiple utility companies and multiple residential customers is studied by considering the bidirectional energy trading. To minimize the overall costs of both the utility companies and the residential customers, the energy management system is formulated as a double cooperative game. That is, the interaction among the residential users is formulated as a cooperative game, where the players are the customers and the strategies are the daily schedules of their household appliances; and the interaction among the utility companies is also formulated as a cooperative game, where the players are the suppliers and the strategies are the proportions of the daily total energy they provide for the customers. Without loss of generality, the bidirectional energy trading in the double cooperative game is formulated by allowing plug-in electric vehicles (PEVs) to discharge and sell energy back. Two distributed algorithms will be provided to realize the global optimal performance in terms of minimizing the energy costs, which can be guaranteed at the Nash equilibriums of the formulated cooperative games. Finally, simulation results illustrated that the proposed double cooperative game can benefit both the utility companies and residential users significantly.

AB In this investigation, an advanced modeling method, called online sequential extreme learning machine with a hyper-level fault tolerance-based supervisor (OSELM-FTS), is utilized to develop a robust safety-oriented autonomous cruise control based on the model predictive control (MPC) technique. The resulting MPC-based cruise controller is used to improve the driving safety and reduce the energy consumption of an electric vehicle (EV). The structural flexibility of OSELM-FTS allows us to not only improve the operating features of the EV, but also develop an intelligent supervisor which can detect any operating fault and send proper commands for the adaption of the MPC controller. This introduces a degree of robustness to the devised controller, as OSELM-FTS automatically detects and filters any operating faults which may undermine the performance of the MPC controller. To ascertain the veracity of the devised controller, three well-known MPC formulations, i.e. linear MPC (LMPC) and nonlinear MPC (NMPC) and diagonal recurrent neural network MPC (DRNN-MPC), are applied to the baseline EV and their performances are compared with OSELM-FTS-MPC. To further elaborate on the computational advantages of OSELM, a well-known chunk-by-chunk incremental machine learning approach, namely selective negative correlation learning (SNCL), is taken into account. The results of the comparative study indicate that OSELM-FTS-MPC is a very promising control scheme and can be reliably used for safety-oriented autonomous cruise control of the EVs.

AB This paper deals with an embedded fault detection and isolation (FDI)-fault-tolerant control approach applied to an overactuated electric vehicle. This method is described in the following three major steps: 1) trajectory planning based on the inverse kinematic modeling of the vehicle; 2) model-based fault diagnosis of the traction system; and 3) vehicle control reconfiguration in faulty situations. Autonomous vehicles, as studied in this paper, are very suited to accomplish missions in confined space or in hostile environments (in radioactive environments and spatial programs), where the success of the mission is more important than the cost of the additional actuators. The proposed FDI approach provides an early detection of the faults, allowing safe reconfiguration of the system control. Cosimulation results using experimental data show the performances and advantages of the presented approach.

AB Ocean exploration is one of the fundamental issues for the sustainable development of human society, which is also the basis for realizing the concept of the Internet of Underwater Things (IoUT) applications, such as the smart ocean city. The collaboration of heterogeneous autonomous marine vehicles (AMVs) based on underwater wireless communication is known as a practical approach to ocean exploration, typically with the autonomous surface vehicle (ASV) and the autonomous underwater glider (AUG). However, the difference in their specifications and movements makes the following problems for collaborative work. First, when an AUG floats to a certain depth, and an ASV interacts via underwater wireless communication, the interaction has a certain time limit and their movements to an interaction position have to be synchronized; secondly, in the case where multiple AUGs are exploring underwater, the ASV needs to plan the sequence of surface interactions to ensure timely and efficient data collection. Accordingly, this paper proposes a heuristic surface path planning method for data collection with heterogeneous AMVs (HSPP-HA). The HSPP-HA optimizes the interaction schedule between ASV and multiple AUGs through a modified shuffled frog-leaping algorithm (SFLA). It applies a spatial-temporal k-means clustering in initializing the memeplex group of SFLA to adapt time-sensitive interactions by weighting their spatial and temporal proximities and adopts an adaptive convergence factor which varies by algorithm iterations to balance the local and global searches and to minimize the potential local optimum problem in each local search. Through simulations, the proposed HSPP-HA shows advantages in terms of access rate, path length and data collection rate compared to recent and classic path planning methods.

AB The Autonomous Mobility-on-Demand system is an emerging green and sustainable transportation system providing on-demand mobility services for urban residents. To achieve the best recharging, delivering, and repositioning task assignment decision-making process for shared autonomous electric vehicles, this paper formulates the fleet dynamic operating process into a multi-agent multi-task dynamic dispatching problem based on Markov Decision Process. Specifically, the decision-making process at each time step is divided into 3 sub-processes, among which recharging and delivery task assignment processes are transformed into a maximum weight matching problem of bipartite graph respectively, and the repositioning task assignment process is quantified as a maximum flow problem. Kuhn-Munkres Algorithm and Edmond-Karp Algorithm are adopted to solve the above two mathematical problems to achieve the optimal task allocation policy. To further improve the dispatching performance, a new instant reward function balancing order income with trip satisfaction is designed, and a state-value function estimated by Back Propagation-Deep Neural Network is defined as a matching degree between each shared autonomous electric vehicle and each delivery task. The numerical results show that: (i) a reward function focusing on income and satisfaction can increase total revenue by 33.2%, (ii) the introduction of task allocation repositioning increases total revenue by 50.0%, (iii) a re-estimated state value function leads to a 2.8% increase in total revenue, (iv) the combination of charging and task repositioning can reduce user waiting time and significantly improve user satisfaction with the trip.

AB There is an increasing demand for using Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV), known as drones, in different applications such as packages delivery, traffic monitoring, search and rescue operations, and military combat engagements. In all of these applications, the UAV is used to navigate the environment autonomously - without human interaction, perform specific tasks and avoid obstacles. Autonomous UAV navigation is commonly accomplished using Reinforcement Learning (RL), where agents act as experts in a domain to navigate the environment while avoiding obstacles. Understanding the navigation environment and algorithmic limitations plays an essential role in choosing the appropriate RL algorithm to solve the navigation problem effectively. Consequently, this study first identifies the main UAV navigation tasks and discusses navigation frameworks and simulation software. Next, RL algorithms are classified and discussed based on the environ-ment, algorithm characteristics, abilities, and applications in different UAV navigation problems, which will help the practitioners and researchers select the appropriate RL algorithms for their UAV navigation use cases. Moreover, identified gaps and opportunities will drive UAV navigation research.

AB This paper envisions and assesses the performance of an autonomous bus-on-demand (ABoD) system. We take Fuyang, Zhejiang, China, as the study area to investigate the spatiotemporal distribution of bus travel demand during workdays, and we propose replacing inefficient bus routes with the ABoD system. Agent-based models with various bus dispatching and operation control strategies are constructed to evaluate the performance of the ABoD system. The behaviors and interactions of the agents, passengers, autonomous buses, and a control center are designed. After the verification of the simulated bus travel demand with real-world demand, a series of scenarios with various ABoD operation strategies are simulated. The simulation results show that, in comparison with both current fixed-schedule bus services and the optimized bus dispatching strategies, the ABoD system occupies fewer road resources and utilizes bus vehicles more efficiently. Besides, the system is adaptive to the sudden surge in bus travel demand and is economically sustainable.

AB Orchard operations are considered a promising area for the implementation of robotic systems because of the inherent structured operational environment that arises from time-independent spatial tree configurations. In this paper, a route planning approach is developed and tested using a deterministic behaviour robot (named AMS - autonomous mechanisation system). The core of the planning method is the generation of routing plans for intra- and inter-row orchard operations, based on the adaptation of an optimal area coverage method developed for arable farming operations (B-patterns). Experiments have verified that operational efficiencies can be improved significantly compared with the conventional, non-optimised method of executing orchard operations. Specifically, the experimental results showed that the non-working time reduction ranged between 10.7% and 32.4% and that the reduction in the non-working distance ranged between 17.5% and 40.2% resulting to savings in the total travelled distance ranged between 2.2% and 6.4%.

AB This paper presents an energy-based trajectory tracking control for a fully actuated underwater vehicle using a Hamiltonian-like framework and an asymmetric bounded control input. The following controller design criteria are addressed: effect of thruster faults, disturbances, and model uncertainties of the vehicle. The main ingredient for the design of the proposed controller has been a time-delay estimation (TDE) approach. Global asymptotic stability is ensured when the above controller design criteria are not considered in the plant model, and the boundedness of the closed-loop system variables is achieved when they are present and influence its behavior. Simulations are shown to illustrate the performance of the proposed controller on an underwater vehicle model.

AB This article examines the mechanisms by which aperiodic denial-of-service (DoS) attacks can exploit vulnerabilities in the TCP/IP transport protocol and its three-way handshake during communication data transmission to hack and cause data loss in networked control systems (NCSs). Such data loss caused by DoS attacks can eventually lead to system performance degradation and impose network resource constraints on the system. Therefore, estimating system performance degradation is of practical importance. By formulating the problem as an ellipsoid-constrained performance error estimation (PEE) problem, we can estimate the system performance degradation caused by DoS attacks. We propose a new Lyapunov-Krasovskii function (LKF) using the fractional weight segmentation method (FWSM) to examine the sampling interval and introduce a relaxed, positive definite constraint to optimize the control algorithm. We also propose a relaxed, positive definite constraint that reduces the initial constraints to optimize the control algorithm. Next, we introduce an alternate direction algorithm (ADA) to solve the optimal trigger threshold and design an integral-based event-triggered controller (IETC) to estimate the error performance of NCSs with limited network resources. Finally, we verify the effectiveness and feasibility of the proposed method using the Simulink joint platform autonomous ground vehicle (AGV) model.

ID AUTONOMOUS UNDERWATER VEHICLES
AB A novel path planning approach for autonomous underwater vehicles is proposed in this paper. It seeks a better navigation path under complex terrain and uncertain ocean currents. On the one hand, this problem is converted into a deterministic optimization problem using the order relation of interval number and vector analysis method. On the other hand, the whale optimization algorithm using segment learning and adaptive operator selection is proposed to solve this problem. Firstly, the elite and edge sets are judged by fitness and Euclidean distance, respectively. Based on them, a dynamic partitioning strategy and a weighted mean strategy are used to construct virtual individuals. The virtual individuals are incorporated into the whale optimization algorithm to construct an evolutionary pool, which can realize the balance between exploration to exploitation to improve the search ability of the algorithm. Second, an adaptive operator selection mechanism considering individual preferences is added to the algorithm. This mechanism uses the operators' historical information and future projections to guide the individual in choosing an appropriate evolutionary operator. The simulation results show that the robustness and search capability of the algorithm presented in this study are more potent than other comparative algorithms.

AB With the rapid development of connected and autonomous vehicles (CAVs), a large number of mobile and edge applications (APPs) have been developed and deployed through green communication and networking technology. The problem of high energy consumption during APPs usage becomes serious and in this paper, we propose to optimize energy usage through effective APPs recommendation. Traditional recommendation methods have been developed for years, such as collaborative filtering and latent factor models. But those methods are not designed for APPs recommendation and only focus on the use of historical records. We find that there are hidden relationships in the content and context of APPs in green communication and networking. In this paper, we develop a holistic APPs recommendation framework for CAVs in green communication and networking. The developed framework is driven by machine learning, where we propose two joint matrix factorization models and hidden relationship mining method. The machine learning-driven models can leverage the neglected information and learn latent features in APPs recommendation for CAVs. We used a real-word mobile and edge APPs dataset, performed sufficient experiments and compared our framework with well-known methods. Experimental results show that our framework produces the best performance in all test cases.

AB This paper describes a route planner that enables an autonomous underwater vehicle to selectively complete part of the predetermined tasks in the operating ocean area when the local path cost is stochastic. The problem is formulated as a variant of the orienteering problem. Based on the genetic algorithm (GA), we propose the greedy strategy based GA (GGA) which includes a novel rebirth operator that maps infeasible individuals into the feasible solution space during evolution to improve the efficiency of the optimization, and use a differential evolution planner for providing the deterministic local path cost. The uncertainty of the local path cost comes from unpredictable obstacles, measurement error, and trajectory tracking error. To improve the robustness of the planner in an uncertain environment, a sampling strategy for path evaluation is designed, and the cost of a certain route is obtained by multiple sampling from the probability density functions of local paths. Monte Carlo simulations are used to verify the superiority and effectiveness of the planner. The promising simulation results show that the proposed GGA outperforms its counterparts by 4.7%-24.6% in terms of total profit, and the sampling-based GGA route planner (S-GGARP) improves the average profit by 5.5% compared to the GGA route planner (GGARP).

AB We develop a new kind of underwater inductive coupling power transfer (ICPT) system to evaluate wireless power transfer in autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) docking applications. Parameters that determine the performance of the system are systematically analyzed through mathematical methods. A circuit simulation model and a finite element analysis (FEA) simulation model are developed to study the power losses of the system, including copper loss in coils, semiconductor loss in circuits, and eddy current loss in transmission media. The characteristics of the power losses can provide guidelines to improve the efficiency of ICPT systems. Calculation results and simulation results are validated by relevant experiments of the prototype system. The output power of the prototype system is up to 45 W and the efficiency is up to 0.84. The preliminary results indicate that the efficiency will increase as the transmission power is raised by increasing the input voltage. When the output power reaches 500 W, the efficiency is expected to exceed 0.94. The efficiency can be further improved by choosing proper semiconductors and coils. The analysis methods prove effective in predicting the performance of similar ICPT systems and should be useful in designing new systems.

ID 3D OBJECT DETECTION
AB Three-dimensional object detection is the core of an autonomous driving perception system, which detects and analyzes targets around the vehicle to obtain their sizes, shapes, and categories to provide reliable operational decisions for achieving autonomous driving. To improve the detection and localization accuracy of multi-object targets such as surrounding vehicles and pedestrians in autonomous driving scenarios, based on PointPillars fast object detection network, a three-dimensional object detection algorithm based on the channel attention mechanism, ECA Modules-PointPillars, is proposed. Firstly, the improved algorithm uses point cloud columnarization features to convert a three-dimensional point cloud into a two-dimensional pseudo-image. Then, combining the 2D backbone network for feature extraction with the Efficient Channel Attention (ECA) modules to achieve the enhancement of the positional feature information in the pseudo-image and the weakening of the irrelevant feature information such as background noise. Finally, the single-shot multibox detector (SSD) algorithm was used to complete the 3D object detection task. The experimental results show that the improved algorithm improves the mAP by 3.84% and 4.04% in BEV mode and 3D mode, respectively, compared to PointPillars, which improves the mAP by 4.64% and 5.89% in BEV mode and 3D mode, respectively, compared to F-PointNet, improves the mAP by 11.78% and 14.19% in BEV mode and 3D mode, respectively, compared to VoxelNet, and improves the mAP by 9.47% and 6.55% in BEV mode and 3D mode, respectively, compared to SECOND, demonstrating the effectiveness and reliability of the improved algorithms in autonomous driving scenarios.

AB The use of drones is becoming more present in modern daily life. One of the most challenging tasks associated with these vehicles is the development of perception and autonomous navigation systems. Competitions such as Artificial Intelligence Robotic Racing (AIRR) and Autonomous Drone Racing were launched to drive the advances in such strategies, requiring the development of integrated systems for autonomous navigation in a racing environment. In this context, this paper presents an improved integrated solution for autonomous drone racing, which focuses on simple, robust, and computationally efficient techniques to enable the application in embedded hardware. The strategy is divided into four modules: (i) A trajectory planner computes a path that passes through the sequence of desired gates; (ii) a perception system that obtains the global pose of the vehicle by using an onboard camera; (iii) a localization system which merges several sensed information to estimate the drone's states; and, (iv) an artificial vector field-based controller in charge of following the plan by using the estimated states. To evaluate the performance of the entire integrated system, we extended the FlightGoggles simulator to use gates similar to those used in the AIRR competition. A computational cost analysis demonstrates the high performance of the proposed perception method running on limited hardware commonly embedded in aerial robots. In addition, we evaluate the localization system by comparing it with ground truth and when there is a disturbance in the location of the gates. Results in a representative race circuit based on the AIRR competition showed the proposed strategy's competing performance, presenting itself as a feasible solution for drone racing systems.

This is the first time autonomous docking to a dynamic docking station has been presented. Furthermore, the presented system does not require a specially designed docking station but uses a conventional cage type TMS. The paper presents and discusses real-world environmental tests successfully completed during January 2019 in the North Atlantic Ocean. To validate the performance of the system, a commercial state of the art underwater navigation system has been used. The results demonstrate a significant advancement in resident ROV automation and capabilities, and represents a system which can be retrofitted to the current ROV fleet.

AB Unmanned ground vehicle (UGV) is developing towards high mobility and intelligence, where path tracking plays a particularly important role. This paper investigated the path tracking control strat-egy of variable-configuration unmanned ground vehicle. In order to overcome the structural and unstructured uncertainties, a model free predictive control (MFAPC) strategy using particle swarm optimization (PSO) is presented. The control scheme of MFAPC is improved by integrating vehicle state parameters. Then, the main parameters of the improved control scheme are optimized by PSO algorithm. The effectiveness of the proposed method under different operation conditions is verified by simulation. The experimental results show that the proposed scheme does not require the accurate mathematical model and can quickly track the reference path.(c) 2022 ISA. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

ID ROAD VEHICLES; GENERATION; WAVES
AB The demand for reliable autonomous systems capable to detect and identify heavy military vehicles becomes an important issue for UN peacekeeping forces in the current delicate political climate. A promising method of detection and identification is the one using the information extracted from ground vibration spectra generated by heavy military vehicles, often termed as their seismic signatures. This paper presents the results of the theoretical investigation of ground vibration spectra generated by heavy military vehicles, such as tanks and armed personnel carriers. A simple quarter car model is considered to identify the resulting dynamic forces applied from a vehicle to the ground. Then the obtained analytical expressions for vehicle dynamic forces are used for calculations of generated ground vibrations, predominantly Rayleigh surface waves, using Green's function method. A comparison of the obtained theoretical results with the published experimental data shows that analytical techniques based on the simplified quarter car vehicle model are capable of producing ground vibration spectra of heavy military vehicles that reproduce basic properties of experimental spectra.

AB This paper investigates the issue of cooperative diving of a multi-autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) system using self-triggered distributed model predictive control (DMPC). Firstly, a basic DMPC approach is proposed to realize cooperative diving, where a stability condition is derived to facilitate control design. Then, the self -triggering mechanism is introduced into the basic DMPC approach to further save communication and compu-tation resources. The triggering interval is determined with the maximum time instant satisfying the terminal constraint after solving the optimization problem, and this helps reduce the computation burden at each control loop. The feasibility and Lyapunov stability of the self-triggered DMPC approach are analyzed. Numerical simulation is provided to verify the effectiveness of the proposed method.

ID AUTONOMOUS VEHICLES; OPPORTUNITIES; SERVICES
AB Shared mobility services involving electric autonomous shuttles have increasingly been implemented in recent years. Because of various restrictions, these services are currently offered on fixed circuits and operated with fixed schedules. This study introduces a service variant with flexible stopping patterns and schedules. Specifically, in the electric dial-a-ride problem on a fixed circuit (eDARP-FC), a fleet of capacitated electric shuttles operates on a given circuit consisting of a recharging depot and a sequence of stations where passengers can be picked up and dropped off. The shuttles may perform multiple laps, between which they may need to recharge. The goal of the problem is to determine the vehicles' stopping sequences and schedules, including recharging plans, so as to minimize a weighted sum of the total passenger excess time and the total number of laps. The eDARP-FC is formulated as a nonstandard lap-based mixed integer linear programming and is shown to be NP-Hard. Efficient polynomial time algorithms are devised for two special scheduling subproblems. These algorithms and several heuristics are then applied as subroutines within a large neighborhood search metaheuristic. Experiments on instances derived from a real-life system demonstrate that the flexible service results in a 32%-75% decrease in the excess time at the same operational costs.

   Autonomous Underwater Vehicle: Design and Field Experiments
SO IEEE ROBOTICS AND AUTOMATION LETTERS

DT Article
DE Marine robotics; localization; autonomous vehicle navigation
AB Underwater positioning is critical to autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) for navigation and geo-referencing. The rapid attenuation of the electromagnetic wave in the underwater environment prevents the use of traditional positioning methods such as the Global Positioning System, whereupon acoustic methods like ultra-short baseline (USBL) positioning systems play an important role in AUV navigation. However, the high cast and complexity of classical USBL systems have stifled the democratization of these technologies, which leads to a new method called passive inverted ultra-short baseline (piUSBL) positioning. In a typical piUSBL system. a single beacon is placed at a reference point, periodically broadcasting a positioning signal. A passive USBL receiver, time-sy nchronized to the beacon, is mounted on an AUV to get one-way travel-time (OWTT) slant range and azimuth estimates. The passive nature of the receiver means the system is inexpensive, low-power, and lightweight. Particularly, the omnidirectional broadcasted signals offer a feasible solution for concurrent multi-AUV navigation. This letter demonstrates a full-stack design and development of a piUSBL, positioning system, and presents evaluations of the accuracy and reliability of the system through a series of experiments. More significantly, a successful sea trial of a disc-shaped AUV outfitted with our piUSBL was conducted in the South China Sea.

AB Many drivers support the push towards the automation of transportation. Technology and automotive companies, the general public, and governments are all seen as the main groups pushing the automation revolution forward. The key to this revolution's success will rest with the perception of the professionals in the field as their perception will affect the way that Autonomous Vehicles (AVs) are adopted. This study surveyed 185 experienced industry professionals to gather their comments and opinions on AVs' purported safety benefits and drawbacks. The results in this paper illustrate that the 'incorrect understanding of the surrounding objects by AVs' could be the most significant technical concern and may lead to accidents. Some professionals had concerns about trusting the AVs' safe operation without steering wheels, while some others believed that there is a chance that having steering wheels may increase safety concerns. The findings also suggest that while AVs might reduce the number of accidents, this may not necessarily be the case for the severity of any accidents. The severity may remain unchanged or even increase as a result of the adoption of AVs. This paper's results show that the majority of the professionals consulted agreed that AVs have the potential to increase road safety significantly. However, the consensus was that more research and testing is needed in this field.

AB Conventional docking and charging systems for autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) typically suffer from complex structures and rigorous requirements for accurate underwater positioning. In this study, an omnidirectional planar AUV charging platform is proposed, providing an AUV with stable charging performance regardless of its position and direction. A compact single layer planar coil array with ferrite core and moderate overlaps is proposed. Guided by a mathematical model of the eddy current loss, the ferrite shielding thickness is optimised, reducing 95% of the downside eddy current loss with minimal material cost. The layout of the coil arrays is optimised in the magnetic field domain, achieving maximal average magnetic field density with limited fluctuation. Ferrite shielding and the mutual inductance between the coil units are considered in the circuit, high misalignment tolerance and limited eddy current loss are both achieved. The theoretical results are validated by an underwater experiment.

AB This paper presents a parameterized batch reinforcement learning algorithm for near-optimal longitudinal control of autonomous land vehicles (ALVs). The proposed approach uses an actor-critic architecture, where parameterized feature vectors based on kernels are learned from collected samples for approximating the value functions and policies. One difference between the parameterized batch actor-critic (PBAC) algorithm and previous actor-critic learning approaches is that the critic and actor in PBAC share the same linear features, which has been theoretically proved to be a beneficial property for the convergence of actor-critic learning approaches. In order to obtain better learning efficiency, least-squares-based batch updating rules are designed for the critic and actor, respectively. Based on the PBAC learning algorithm, a data-driven longitudinal control method is presented for ALVs to obtain near-optimal control policies which adaptively tune the fuel/brake control signals to track different speeds. A multiobjective reward function is designed so that both tracking precision and driving smoothness are considered. Extensive experiments were conducted on a real ALV platform while driving on flat, slippery, sloping, and bumpy roads. The experimental results illustrate the superiority of the PBAC-based self-learning controller over conventional longitudinal control methods such as proportional-integral (PI) control and learning-based PI control.

AB Environment perception plays a significant role in autonomous driving since all traffic participants in the vehicle's surroundings must be reliably recognized and localized in order to take any subsequent action. The main goal of this paper is to present a neural network approach for fusing camera images and LiDAR point clouds in order to detect traffic participants in the vehicle's surroundings more reliably. Our approach primarily addresses the problem of sparse LiDAR data (point clouds of distant objects), where due to sparsity the point cloud based detection might become ambiguous. In the proposed model each 3D point in the LiDAR point cloud is augmented by semantically strong image features allowing us to inject additional information for the network to learn from. Experimental results show that our method increases the number of correctly detected 3D bounding boxes in sparse point clouds by at least 13-21% and thus raw sensor fusion is validated as a viable approach for enhancing autonomous driving safety in difficult sensory conditions.

AB A vehicular network is composed of an in-vehicle network (IVN) and Internet of Vehicles (IoV). IVN exchanges information among in-vehicle devices. IoV constructs Vehicle-to-X (V2X) networks outside vehicles and exchanges information among V2X elements. These days, in-vehicle devices that require high bandwidth is increased for autonomous driving services. Thus, the spread of data for vehicles is exploding. This kind of data is exchanged through IoV. Even if the Ethernet backbone of IVN carries a lot of data in the vehicle, the explosive increase in data from outside the vehicle can affect the backbone. That is, the transmission efficiency of the IVN backbone will be reduced due to excessive data traffic. In addition, when IVN data traffic is transmitted to IoV without considering IoV network conditions, the transmission efficiency of IoV is also reduced. Therefore, in this paper, we propose an IoV access gateway to controls the incoming data traffic to the IVN backbone and the outgoing data traffic to the IoV in the network environment where IVN and IoV are integrated. Computer simulations are used to evaluate the performance of the proposed system, and the proposed system shows better performance in the accumulated average transmission delay.

AB Vehicle behavior analysis is an essential issue in the autonomous vehicle field. Most studies have mainly considered nearby vehicles based on a dense point cloud from 3D LIDAR while ignoring the potential risk caused by distant vehicles. In this study, we explore the complementary property of sparse point cloud cluster and propose a behavior analysis method for distant vehicles via pose estimation and tracking. First, multi-frame fitting is conducted using a convolution optimization technique to estimate vehicle pose at each frame effectively. Second, the framework of interacting multiple models is built to combine the constant velocity model and variable-axis Ackerman steered model to extract the motion characteristics of distant vehicles. Finally, the distant vehicle behavior is learned using the variation of track trajectories based on the sequence of position and velocity information during a given time window. Experimental results not only verify the effectiveness of the proposed pose estimation and tracking method but also demonstrate that the newly developed system can improve the behavior classification accuracy robustly when tracked vehicles are located at farther range from LIDAR.

AB The traffic preview information is very helpful for hybrid vehicles when distributing the power requirement of the vehicle to power sources and when determining the next driving route of the vehicle. In this research, an energy management approach for hybrid vehicles is proposed, which optimizes the vehicle velocity profile while minimizing the fuel consumption with the help of the traffic preview information, so that a further energy saving for hybrid vehicles can be achieved. The Pontryagin's Minimum Principle (PMP) is adopted on the proposed approach. A fuel cell hybrid vehicle (FCHV) is selected as an example, and the proposed energy management approach is applied to the FCHV in a computer simulation environment for the offline and online cases respectively. Simulation results show that the fuel economy of the FCHV is improved by the proposed energy management approach compared to a benchmark case where the driving cycle is fixed and only the hybrid power split (allocation) ratio is optimized. The proposed energy management approach is useful especially for the autonomous hybrid vehicles. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Autonomous and decentralized unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) networks are used in many applications, including disaster management, environment monitoring, and surveillance. The performance of the routing protocols in these networks drops significantly due to frequent route breaks and traffic congestion at high node speeds. This is partly because the routing metrics used in many of the existing protocols are sensitive to the intra-flow interference after the source node starts transmission on the selected route. Moreover, these schemes do not estimate potential packet drops or take preventive measures, such as route switching and queue management. To address these issues, we present a cross-layer, mobility, and congestion-aware optimized link state routing protocol for an autonomous and decentralized UAV network, which incorporates the following mechanisms: 1) Multimetric route selection which includes hop count, route lifetime, estimated time to destination, and number of interfering links; 2) preemptive route switching that prevents packet transmission over the broken and congested routes; and 3) queue management to prioritize transmission of packets based on their survivability score. We also present key observations on routing protocol design and a theoretical analysis to show the impact of data rate, route length, and interfering links on the packet service rate and congestion. The proposed routing scheme achieves a significantly higher packet delivery ratio and lower route computation overhead for delay-sensitive data flows at different data rates, node densities, and high speeds, as compared to the standard and multimetric OLSR protocols.

AB Object detection plays an important role in autonomous driving systems. LiDAR is widely used in autonomous driving vehicles and robots as a sensor for environmental perception. Recently, the development of computational power and deep learning technology makes it possible to classify and locate objects from LiDAR point cloud in a single end-to-end learnable network. However, objects are sparsely distributed in large point cloud field, and are always been partly scanned by LiDAR, which pose a challenge for accurate and rapid object positioning and classification from the raw point cloud. In this paper, we introduce a new single-shot refinement neural network for fast and accurate 3D object detection from the raw LiDAR point cloud. Firstly, we exploit self-attention mechanism in main object detection branch to enhance object feature representation. Secondly, we apply deformable convolution for learning adaptive receptive fields to fully capture the features of rotating and partially visible objects. Thirdly, an object refinement branch is introduced to produce a finer regression of objects upon the primary estimation from the main detection branch. All proposed modules have been proven to effectively improve the accuracy of object detection. Our method is evaluated on KITTI 3D detection benchmark and achieves state-of-the-art results while maintains real-time efficiency. Furthermore, real-time test in autonomous driving vehicle demonstrates that our method is robust to 16 channels LiDAR and can meet the demands of accuracy, efficiency, and visibility of object detection in various urban scenarios.

AB Detecting obstacles accurately is a vital part of realizing autonomous driving. But utilizing single sensors, for example, RGB camera or LiDAR itself, is difficult to meet the needs of autonomous driving under the condition of sparse environmental sensing data. In contrast, equipments that can collect data in large quantities are expensive and difficult to be utilized in practical applications. Hence, under the premise of ensuring low application costs, the difficult task is to obtain high-precision three-dimensional information of obstacles in real-time from sparse data. To overcome this problem, a real-time detection technique that combines LiDAR data and image information for obstacles detection is proposed in this article. It can detect vehicles close to the ART in sparse data in real-time. The sparse point cloud is de-noised initially and the ground is separated from the initial cloud data. The remained cloud, which includes surrounding vehicles, are processed by the clustering algorithm according to the structural relationship and scanning mechanism of the LiDAR. Then the processed LiDAR data is fused with the classification information generated from images based on a neural network to locate suspicious obstacles. The ratio values between the central values of vehicles and image width are obtained in the image coordinate system. Then the category information and ratio values are mapped on the processed LiDAR clusters during ART operation. The method is tested and verified in the real field. The evaluation results show that the proposed method can achieve an average accuracy of 85.5% for obstacle classification with a cost-effective sensing suit.

AB As automobile manufacturers have begun to design, engineer, and test autonomous driving systems of the future, brain imaging with functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) can provide unique insights about cognitive processes associated with evolving levels of autonomy implemented in the automobile. Modern fNIRS devices provide a portable, relatively affordable, and robust form of functional neuroimaging that allows researchers to investigate brain function in real-world environments. The trend toward "naturalistic neuroscience" is evident in the growing number of studies that leverage the methodological flexibility of fNIRS, and in doing so, significantly expand the scope of cognitive function that is accessible to observation via functional brain imaging (i.e., from the simulator to on-road scenarios). While more than a decade's worth of study in this field of fNIRS driving research has led to many interesting findings, the number of studies applying fNIRS during autonomous modes of operation is limited. To support future research that directly addresses this lack in autonomous driving research with fNIRS, we argue that a cogent distillation of the methods used to date will help facilitate and streamline this research of tomorrow. To that end, here we provide a methodological review of the existing fNIRS driving research, with the overarching goal of highlighting the current diversity in methodological approaches. We argue that standardization of these approaches will facilitate greater overlap of methods by researchers from all disciplines, which will, in-turn, allow for meta-analysis of future results. We conclude by providing recommendations for advancing the use of such fNIRS technology in furthering understanding the adoption of safe autonomous vehicle technology.

AB Active safety system components, such as autonomous emergency braking (AEB) systems, are designed to play a key role in preventing serious car accidents. We investigate the extent to which vehicles with an AEB system are safer than those without it. Empirical analysis shows that the relative risk of accident when driving a car equipped with AEB is not lower than driving one without AEB. However, when we focus on drivers aged 70 years or older, those driving with AEB are safer than they otherwise would be: their risk is approximately two-third lower. Thus, an AEB system is effective for drivers who need the most assistance.

AB Different health-monitoring techniques were considered in the literature to enhance the safety and stability of Connected Autonomous Vehicle (CAV) platoons. Mitigating these faults is faster and more reliable if the fault structure is known. In this paper, we propose using transmissibility operators, which are relationships that relate a set of velocities with another in the platoon, to classify the faults. Transmissibility operators were shown to be exceptional in signal estimation. However, it is also shown to be noncausal and thus can only be used offline. To this end, we propose using Data Aggregation (DAgger), an extension to imitation learning, to transfer the classification experience from transmissibility operators to a novice machine learning agent to be used online. The integration of transmissibility-DAgger gives the ability to adapt to new fault classes without the need to re-train the diagnosis model from the beginning. A heterogeneous CAV platoon was modeled with three different faults separately. These faults are actuator disturbances, false data injection attacks, and communication time delays. The classification scheme depends on estimating the faulty signal in the case of each fault class. Next, the measured faulty signal is compared with the three estimations, and the closer fault estimation to the measured one is considered the actual fault on the platoon. The proposed algorithm is then tested on the platoon model and then applied to an experimental setup that consists of three autonomous robots. The proposed results are compared with six different machine learning classification models. The overall classification accuracy achieved was 95.8% for the experiment using the proposed approach.

TI An STPA-based formal composition framework for trustworthy autonomous

ID SAFETY
AB A key risk with autonomous systems (AS) is the trustworthiness of the decision-making and control mechanisms that replace human control. To be trustworthy, systems need to remain safe while being resilient to unpredictable changes, functional/operational failures and cybersecurity threats. Rigorous validation and verification are essential to ensure trustworthiness of AS. Current engineering practice relies heavily on Verification and Validation (V&V) test-and-fix of system characteristics which is very time-consuming and expensive, limiting the possibilities for exploration of alternatives in system design. Instead, we focus on building a correct-by-construction system. In this paper, we present an approach to identifying and analysing mission requirements for squads of autonomous missions. Clear definition of requirements is an important pre-requisite for mission planning and for V&V of mission management. We use a structured approach to requirements identification and use formal modelling to help remove ambiguities in the requirements and to specify formal properties that should be satisfied by the missions. Our approach use a combination of analysis techniques based on Systems Theoretic Process Analysis (STPA) and formal modelling to generate critical requirements that ensure the safety and security of the system. We also suggest a compositional approach for formal modelling to enhance re-usability and address the complexity of formal modelling. Our approach is being evaluated through consideration of a combined mission of an Unmanned Surface Vehicle (USV) with deployment/recovery of small Unmanned Underwater Vehicles (UUV) within a shipping channel whereby the USV has to safely maintain station for a long period and then proceed to recover the UUV, while maintaining a communication link to an Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV).

DE Autonomous landing; Image-based visual servoing; Sensor fusion; Unmanned
   aerial vehicle
AB Autonomous takeoff and landing are crucial for unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) to perform various missions automatically. However, navigation sensors with low accuracy such as global positioning system (GPS) are limited in autonomous takeoff and landing for marine applications when ships are moving fast and oscillating by sea waves. In this study, an image-based visual servoing (IBVS) technique, which was originally used to land a UAV on a static target, is extended for a moving target. In particular, the ship velocity is estimated and used as a feed-forward term in the IBVS controller. To accurately estimate the velocity of the ship, velocity data from the GPS on the ship, image information obtained from the camera in the UAV, and dynamic model of the ship are combined using the Kalman filter framework. Besides, considering the under-actuated nature of the UAV and oscillation of the ship, a virtual plane concept, adaptive IBVS gain and feature shape compensation are introduced. Lastly, to apply the IBVS controller to the moving ship deck landing, a robust and safe autonomous landing procedure, starting from the approach to the touchdown phase, is also developed. The proposed autonomous landing system is validated via simulations and various real-world flight experiments simulating situations in which the ship is moving fast and oscillated by sea waves. In the flight experiments, the UAV lands successfully on the landing pad with the average touchdown error of 0.2 m while the ship is oscillating at the Sea State 4 and is moving faster than 5 m/s.

AB This article studies the design, modeling, and implementation of a path-following algorithm as a guidance, navigation, and control (GNC) architecture for an autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV). First, a mathematical model is developed based on nonlinear equations of motion and parameter estimation techniques, including the model validation based on field test data. Then, the guidance system incorporates a line-of-sight (LOS) algorithm with a combination of position PID controllers. The GNC architecture includes a modular and multi-layer approach with an LOS-based, path-following algorithm in the AUV platform. Furthermore, the navigation used in the path-following algorithm is developed based on a predefined coverage area. Finally, this study addresses simulation and field test control scenarios to verify the developed GNC architecture.

ID UNDERWATER DOCKING; DESIGN
AB Underwater docking technology enables autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) to execute long-term observation missions by periodically recovering and recharging AUVs. The conventional AUV homing and docking operations utilize acoustic and optical sensors at different ranges relative to the docking station. However, this method cannot perform perfectly in confined water regions because of the acoustic reflection and multipath effect. Thus, this paper proposes a novel navigation system, which fuses downward-looking visual odometry and model-based velocity for homing, and recognizes and tracks the light marker for terminal docking, in order to overcome the defects of the conventional navigation method. The reservoir experiment result verifies the effectiveness of the proposed method and shows good potential to extended applications in underwater routine cruise.

AB Semi- or fully autonomous personal aerial vehicles (PAVs) are currently studied and developed by public and private organizations as a solution for traffic congestion. While optimal collision-free navigation algorithms have been proposed for autonomous robots, trajectories and accelerations for PAVs should also take into account human comfort. In this letter, we propose a reactive decentralized collision avoidance strategy that incorporates passenger physiological comfort based on the optimal reciprocal collision avoidance strategy. We study in simulation the effects of increasing PAV densities on the level of comfort, on the relative flight time and on the number of collisions per flight hour and demonstrate that our strategy reduces collision risk for platforms with limited dynamic range. Finally, we validate our strategy with a swarm of ten quadcopters flying outdoors.

AB Autonomous driving is receiving increasing attention in the automotive industry as well as in public transport. However, it is still unclear whether users are willing to use automated public transportation at all. In order to answer this and other questions, the transport company of the city of Mainz, Germany, tested the autonomous minibus EMMA (Elektro-Mobilitat Mainz Autonom) on a 600-meter-long test track in public space. The study presented here was conducted with the aim of exploring crucial determinants for the use of an autonomous minibus. On the basis of established acceptance models, a questionnaire was developed, which was completed in a field survey by a total of 942 participants before or after their journey with the minibus. Autonomous vehicles in public transport in general and the minibus in particular were evaluated positively by the majority of respondents. Above all, participants judged safety and environmental friendliness of the minibus as important. Participants who completed the questionnaire after their first trip with EMMA provided higher ratings of acceptance than those who had not travelled on the bus. Performance expectancy was the most important predictor for both acceptance of automated public transport in general and acceptance of the minibus EMMA. However, the experienced valence of the ride, in terms of how pleasant or unpleasant passengers experienced the first trip with the minibus, also affected acceptance of the minibus. This suggests a role of valence on intention-to-use, which has hardly been considered in previous theories and studies. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) is a well-known solution for mapping and realizing autonomous navigation of an Autonomous Underwater Vehicle (AUV) in unknown underwater environments. However, the inaccurate time-varying observation noise will cause filtering divergence and reduce the accuracy of localization and feature estimation. In this paper, VB-AUFastSLAM based on the unscented-FastSLAM (UFastSLAM) and the Variational Bayesian (VB) is proposed. The UFastSLAM combines unscented particle filter (UPF) and unscented Kalman filter (UKF) to estimate the AUV poses and features. In addition, to resist the unknown time-varying observation noise, the method of Variational Bayesian learning is introduced into the SLAM framework. Firstly, the VB method is used to estimate the joint posterior probability of the AUV path and observation noise. The Inverse-Gamma distribution is used to model the observation noise and real-time noise parameters estimation is performed to improve the AUV localization accuracy. Secondly, VB is reused to estimate the noise parameters in the feature update stage to enhance the performance of the feature estimation. The proposed algorithms are first validated in an open-source simulation environment. Then, an AUV SLAM system based on the Inertial Navigation System (INS), Doppler Velocity Log (DVL), and single-beam Sonar are also built to verify the effectiveness of the proposed algorithms in the marine environment. The accuracy of the proposed methods can reach 0.742% and 0.776% of the range, respectively, which is much better than 1.825% and 1.397% of the traditional methods.

AB Various sensors can be attached and added to autonomous vehicles, included visual cameras, radar, LiDAR (Light Detection And Ranging), and GNSS (Global Navigation Satellite System). These sensors have been studied in many research areas, in particular studies on building precise 3D maps. It is essential for autonomous driving to create an accurate 3D map of the surrounding scene. However, creating an accurate static 3D map is difficult due to changes in moving objects or dynamic environments. Spurious objects on the 3D map can be handled by removing or ignoring them for 3D mapping. Following this idea, we propose an object segmentation and inpainting network. The proposed network called SAM-Net, addresses the object duplication issue by segmenting the objects and inpainting them with the segmentation results. Conventional inpainting research has dealt with RGB images. No matter how well such approaches reconstruct holes or corrupted images, they do not establish 3D points' relationship with the point cloud frame. Therefore, we suggest a depth inpainting method for outdoor object segmentation and inpainting tasks that utilizes a high-precision depth range sensor (Velodyne HDL-64E), which is not suggested before. Unfortunately, no dataset exists for the outdoor depth inpainting task. Thus, to train our model, we generate a new dataset by locating objects on a clean static background. Moreover, our proposed method shows outstanding depth performance compared to the previous visual inpainting method. Our dataset will be available at: ``https://github.com/JunhyeopLee/lidar_inpainting''.

AB Unmanned surface vehicles (USVs) are of increasing importance to a growing number of sectors in the maritime industry, including offshore exploration, marine transportation, and defense operations. A major factor in the growth in use and deployment of USVs is the increased operational flexibility that is offered through use of optimized motion planners that generate optimized trajectories. Unlike path planning in terrestrial environments, planning in the maritime environment is more demanding as there is need to assure mitigating action is taken against the significant, random, and often unpredictable environmental influences from winds and ocean currents. With the focus on these necessary requirements as the main basis of motivation, this article proposes a novel motion planner, denoted as Gaussian process motion planning 2 star (GPMP2*), extending the application scope of the fundamental Gaussian-process-based motion planner, Gaussian process motion planning 2 (GPMP2), into complex maritime environments. An interpolation strategy based on Monte Carlo stochasticity has been innovatively added to GPMP2* to produce a new algorithm named GPMP2* with Monte Carlo stochasticity, which can increase the diversity of the paths generated. In parallel with algorithm design, a robotic operating system (ROS)-based fully-autonomous framework for an advanced USV, the Wave Adaptive Modular Vessel 20, has been proposed. The practicability of the proposed motion planner as well as the fully-autonomous framework has been functionally validated in a simulated inspection missions for an offshore wind farm in ROS.

AB A novel framework is proposed for enhancing the driving safety and fuel economy of autonomous vehicles (AVs) with the aid of vehicle-to-infrastructure (V2I) communication networks. The problem of driving trajectory design is formulated for minimizing the total fuel consumption, while enhancing driving safety (by obeying the traffic rules and avoiding obstacles). In an effort to solve this pertinent problem, a deep reinforcement learning (DRL) approach is proposed for making collision-free decisions. Firstly, a deep Q-network (DQN) aided algorithm is proposed for determining the trajectory and velocity of the AV by receiving real-time traffic information from the base stations (BSs). More particularly, the AV acts as an agent to carry out optimal action such as lane change and velocity change by interacting with the environment. Secondly, to overcome the large overestimation of action values by the Q-learning model, a double deep Q-network (DDQN) algorithm is proposed by decomposing the max-Q-value operation into action selection and action evaluation. Additionally, three practical driving policies are also proposed as benchmarks. Numerical results are provided for demonstrating that the proposed trajectory design algorithms are capable of enhancing the driving safety and fuel economy of AVs. We demonstrate that the proposed DDQN based algorithm outperforms the DQN based algorithm. Additionally, it is also demonstrated that the proposed fuel-economy (FE) based driving policy derived from the DRL algorithm is capable of achieving in excess of 24% of fuel savings over the benchmarks.

AB High definition (HD) map is a key technology that enables autonomous driving, which has the characteristic of frequent updates and low delay requirements. In order to minimize the HD map updating latency, this paper jointly considers the generation and transmission processes of HD map. The generation process of HD map relies heavily on the data captured by different types of sensors, which is modeled by the federated analytics process. Also, in order to quantify the diversity of utilized sensors, the concept of love of variety is introduced in this paper. Then, considering HD map is composed of dynamic and static layers that have different latency requirements during the transmission process, this paper proposes a method to allocate edge server capacity to each HD map layer such that the overall information staleness can be minimized. Firstly, the deterministic edge capacity case is discussed and the solution is derived by obtaining the Karush-Kuhn-Tucker conditions. Then, considering the practice that an edge server provides services to multiple attached devices simultaneously, contentions among these devices make available capacity for the autonomous vehicle variational. Therefore, an uncertain edge capacity case is discussed as well, where the uncertainty is described by Wasserstein metrics and the problem is reformulated into distributional robust chance constrained optimization problem. And for the low latency purpose, we utilize an inner approximation to reduce the complexity of the original problem and find a suboptimal solution. Finally, simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed methods that achieves the lowest latency for HD map updating.

AB In recent years, research into autonomous vehicles (AVs) has become highly popular in industrialized nations due to their importance in the future success of smart cities. Research on this mobility technology and the critical elements affecting its development in developing countries, however, has been rather limited. This paper aims to shed light on the most influential elements of AV adoption in developing nations. A structural analysis approach is used, based on the primary qualitative data-that was gathered via an expert-opinion poll utilizing the fuzzy Delphi with a snowballing method and engaging 25 experts in the field in two rounds-, in accordance with the tradition of futurist research. The analysis has led to the identification of 11 key factors, from the initial factor pool of 54, affecting AV adoption in the case study context of Iran. The results of the analysis revealed the following conclusions, that fall under the policy and legislation domain, and present the most significant issues impacting AV adoption: (a) Future orientation of government-consistency and of accountability of policies, the long-term vision of the government for developing AVs industry; (b) Managing the international sanctions for foreign investment, and; (c) Funding mega projects to enable AVs. The results indicate that the establishment of legislation and the formulation of government policy regarding the provision of infrastructure, investment, and credit allocation are crucial for the development of AVs in Iran and other developing nations with comparable characteristics.

AB We describe the design and implementation of an autonomous prototype vehicle which finds an empty parking slot in a parking area, and parks itself in the empty parking slot, using neural networks based on deep reinforcement learning (RL). To perform an autonomous parking procedure for our prototype vehicle, two different artificial neural networks (ANNs) are trained using a deep RL Algorithm in a simulation environment and embedded into the computing platform of the prototype car. One of the ANNs enables the vehicle to drive autonomously in the parking environment. At the same time, an image processing algorithm is used to determine whether a parking slot is empty. When the image processing algorithm finds a suitable parking slot, a different ANN is activated and performs a safe parking procedure. However, ANN-based machine learning techniques require high processing power and impose a high computational burden on embedded CPU and GPU platforms. To alleviate the computational burden, one can achieve higher performance and less power consumption using an application-specific hardware design, where logic resources are fully exploited according to the algorithm of interest, in an energy-efficient manner. In this article, hardware accelerators for our ANN models are designed and generated via the Vivado high-level synthesis (HLS) tool, targeting an ARM based programmable SoC platform, ZedBoard. Our ANN accelerators have achieved a speedup of 17x as compared to an ARM software implementation. For deeper fully-connected layers used in deep RL-based solutions, function-level parallelism (Vivado's dataflow) is employed to improve the computational efficiency. Our proposed stage-level description for fully connected layers outperforms recent studies in terms of computation time.

AB Harmful algae blooms (HABs) in coastal marine environments are increasing in number and duration, pressuring local resource managers to implement mitigation solutions to protect human and ecosystem health. However, insufficient spatial and temporal observations create uninformed management decisions. In order to better detect and map blooms, as well as the environmental conditions responsible for their formation, long-term, unattended observation platforms are desired. In this article, we describe a new cost-efficient, autonomous, mobile platform capable of accepting several sensors that can be used to monitor HABs in near real time. The Navocean autonomous sail-powered surface vehicle is deployable by a single person from shore, capable of waypoint navigation in shallow and deep waters, and powered completely by renewable energy. We present results from three surveys of the Florida Red Tide HAB (Karenia brevis) of 2017-2018. The vessel made significant progress toward waypoints regardless of wind conditions while underway measurements revealed patches of elevated chl. a likely attributable to the K. brevis blooms as based on ancillary measurements. Measurements of colored dissolved organic matter (CDOM) and turbidity provided an environmental context for the blooms. While the autonomous sailboat directly adds to our phytoplankton/HAB monitoring capabilities, the package may also help to ground-truth satellite measurements of HABs if careful validation measurements are performed. Finally, several other pending and future use cases for coastal and inland monitoring are discussed. To our knowledge, this is the first demonstration of a sail-driven vessel used for coastal HAB monitoring.

AB In precision agriculture, remote sensing is an essential phase in assessing crop status and variability when considering both the spatial and the temporal dimensions. To this aim, the use of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) is growing in popularity, allowing for the autonomous performance of a variety of in-field tasks which are not limited to scouting or monitoring. To enable autonomous navigation, however, a crucial capability lies in accurately locating the vehicle within the surrounding environment. This task becomes challenging in agricultural scenarios where the crops and/or the adopted trellis systems can negatively affect GPS signal reception and localisation reliability. A viable solution to this problem can be the exploitation of high-accuracy 3D maps, which provide important data regarding crop morphology, as an additional input of the UAVs' localisation system. However, the management of such big data may be difficult in real-time applications. In this paper, an innovative 3D sensor fusion approach is proposed, which combines the data provided by onboard proprioceptive (i.e., GPS and IMU) and exteroceptive (i.e., ultrasound) sensors with the information provided by a georeferenced 3D low-complexity map. In particular, the parallel-cuts ellipsoid method is used to merge the data from the distance sensors and the 3D map. Then, the improved estimation of the UAV location is fused with the data provided by the GPS and IMU sensors, using a Kalman-based filtering scheme. The simulation results prove the efficacy of the proposed navigation approach when applied to a quadrotor that autonomously navigates between vine rows.

AB Autonomous or automated vehicles (AVs) have the potential to improve traffic safety by eliminating majority of human errors. As the interest in AV deployment increases, there is an increasing need to assess and understand the expected implications of AVs on traffic safety. Until recently, most of the literature has been based on either survey questionnaires, simulation analysis, virtual reality, or simulation to assess the safety benefits of AVs. Although few studies have used AV crash data, vulnerable road users (VRUs) have not been a topic of interest. Therefore, this study uses crash narratives from four-year (2017-2020) of AV crash data collected from California to explore the direct and indirect involvement of VRUs. The study applied text network and compared the text classification performance of four classifiers Support Vector Machine (SVM), Naive Bayes (NB), Random Forest (RF), and Neural Network (NN) and associated performance metrics to attain the objective. It was found that out of 252 crashes, VRUs were, directly and indirectly, involved in 23 and 12 crashes, respectively. Among VRUs, bicyclists and scooterists are more likely to be involved in the AV crashes directly, and bicyclists are likely to be at fault, while pedestrians appear more in the indirectly involvements. Further, crashes that involve VRUs indirectly are likely to occur when the AVs are in autonomous mode and are slightly involved minor damages on the rear bumper than the ones that directly involve VRUs. Additionally, feature importance from the best performing classifiers (RF and NN) revealed that crosswalks, intersections, traffic signals, movements of AVs (turning, slowing down, stopping) are the key predictors of the VRUs-AV related crashes. These findings can be helpful to AV operators and city planners.

AB The capability of path tracking largely determines the operational efficiency of deep-sea mining vehicles. In this paper, the relationships of vehicle-sediment mechanical interaction were obtained by sinkage and shear tests. Then, an overset grid method was used to establish the computational fluid dynamics (CFD) model of the vehicle, and the spatial hydrodynamic distribution was calculated in different motion states. Based on the above research, a multi-body dynamic (MBD) model of the mining vehicle was developed, which considered the spatial hydrodynamic effects and the mechanical interaction between vehicle and sediment. In addition, a path-tracking controller based on fuzzy logic control was proposed. A genetic algorithm optimized the fuzzy rules through co-simulation between the controller and the MBD model. Finally, the co-simulation results of the vehicle which moved along the expected path indicated that the performance of the optimized fuzzy controller was preferable to the original fuzzy controller.

AB Platoons are efficient solutions to improve road transportation, traffic throughput, and other demands. But problems such as environmental disturbances, network imperfections, and unaware surrounding vehicles increase the necessity for resilient methods that ensure stability and connectivity among the platoon members. Hence, in this paper, we study the problem of decentralized control for platoons of heterogeneous vehicles under a limited communication range with a constant spacing policy. The goals are to guarantee inter-vehicle distances in steady-state, and resourcefulness to overcome entrances and exits of vehicles. Our main result is a resilient strategy, composed of a reconfiguration protocol and some simple rules for tuning the control law, based on local information about the relative connectivity to neighbors. It guarantees, in a decentralized manner, the automatic reorganization of the platoon under the entry and exit of agents. We conclude by illustrating our approach with simulated experiments on platoons with different numbers of vehicles, and by comparing it with the current state-of-the-art.

AB Obstacle detection in single images is a challenging problem in autonomous navigation on low-cost condition. In this paper, we introduce an approach for obstacle detection in single images with deep neural networks. We propose the followings: (1) a deep model combined with other deep neural network for obstacle detection; (2) a method to segment obstacles and infer their depths. Among others, both local and global information are generated in our method for better classification and portability. Experiments are performed on the open datasets and images captured by our autonomous vehicle. The results show that our method is effective in both obstacle detection and depth inference.

AB Seabed inspection is one of the most sought-after applications for autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs). Acoustical sensors, such as side-scan sonars and forward-looking sonars (FLSs), are commonly favored over optical cameras to carry out such a task. Indeed, sonars are not influenced by illumination conditions and can provide high-range data. However, due to the lack of features and low resolution, acoustical images are often hard to interpret with conventional automatic techniques, forcing human operators to analyze thousands of collected images to identify the so-called objects of potential interest (OPIs). In this article, we report the development of an automatic target recognition (ATR) methodology to identify and localize OPIs in FLS imagery. Such detections have been then exploited to realize a virtual world model with the probabilistic multiple hypothesis anchoring data association and model tracking algorithm. Distinct models of convolutional neural networks have been trained with a data set acquired in May 2019 at the Naval Support and Experimentation Centre (Centro di Supporto e Sperimentazione Navale-CSSN) basin in La Spezia, Italy. The ATR strategy has been successfully validated offline with the data gathered in October 2019 in the same site where the seabed targets were replaced and relocated. As regards the world modeling technique, it has been preliminarily tested on a simulated scenario built upon unmanned underwater vehicle Simulator. Finally, both the ATR and world modeling systems were on-field tested in October 2020 at the CSSN basin in a multivehicle architecture by employing an acoustical channel between FeelHippo AUV and an autonomous moving buoy.

AB The multi-spectral image pairs composed of LIDAR and RGB images demonstrates more effective detection performance in complex traffic environments, such as low illumination, motion blur and strong noise, etc. However, there is still a lack of relevant research on how to better fuse the two modalities to improve the robustness and detection accuracy of the perception system for autonomous vehicles under the condition of low visible light image quality. In this paper, we proposed a dual-modal image quality aware deep neural network (DMIQADNN). We comprehensively compared and analyzed the adaptions of fusion architectures in the early, middle, late, and score stages. By comprehensively considering the detection accuracy and detection speed, the fusion architecture in the middle stage was selected. Besides, we developed an image quality assessment network (IQAN) to evaluate the image quality score for RGB images. The corresponding fusion weights for RGB sub-network and LIDAR sub-network were adaptively assigned by using the proposed fusion weight assignment function. Then based on the calculated fusion weights, the RGB and LIDAR sub-networks were adaptively merged via a data fusion sub-network. The RGB images in the KITTI dataset were processed by reducing illumination and adding motion blur and Gaussian noises to produce a modified dataset containing 7481 RBG-LIDAR image pairs, and the DNIQADNN was trained and tested by semi-automatic annotation. The experimental results on modified KITTI Benchmark and dataset collected by using our own developed autonomous vehicle validate the robustness and effectiveness of proposed method. The ultimate FPS and AP values of the DNIQADNN reach 27 and 39.1, which are superior to those of the state-of-the-art instance segmentation networks.

AB Environment perception plays a crucial role in enabling collaborative driving automation, which is considered to be the ground-breaking solution to tackling the safety, mobility, and sustainability challenges of contemporary transportation systems. Despite the fact that computer vision for object perception is undergoing an extraordinary evolution, single-vehicle systems' constrained receptive fields and inherent physical occlusion make it difficult for state-of-the-art perception techniques to cope with complex real-world traffic settings. Collaborative perception (CP) based on various geographically separated perception nodes was developed to break the perception bottleneck for driving automation. CP leverages vehicle-to-vehicle and vehicle-to-infrastructure communication to enable vehicles and infrastructure to combine and share information to comprehend the surrounding environment beyond the line of sight and field of view to enhance perception accuracy, lower latency, and remove perception blind spots. In this article, we highlight the need for an evolved version of the collaborative perception that should address the challenges hindering the realization of level 5 AD use cases by comprehensively studying the transition from classical perception to collaborative perception. In particular, we discuss and review perception creation at two different levels: vehicle and infrastructure. Furthermore, we also study the communication technologies and three different collaborative perception message-sharing models, their comparison analyzing the trade-off between the accuracy of the transmitted data and the communication bandwidth used for data transmission, and the challenges therein. Finally, we discuss a range of crucial challenges and future directions of collaborative perception that need to be addressed before a higher level of autonomy hits the roads.

DE Imitation learning; autonomous driving; control
AB We present an end-to-end imitation learning system for agile, off-road autonomous driving using only low-cost on-board sensors. By imitating a model predictive controller equipped with advanced sensors, we train a deep neural network control policy to map raw, high-dimensional observations to continuous steering and throttle commands. Compared with recent approaches to similar tasks, our method requires neither state estimation nor on-the-fly planning to navigate the vehicle. Our approach relies on, and experimentally validates, recent imitation learning theory. Empirically, we show that policies trained with online imitation learning overcome well-known challenges related to covariate shift and generalize better than policies trained with batch imitation learning. Built on these insights, our autonomous driving system demonstrates successful high-speed off-road driving, matching the state-of-the-art performance.

AB Vehicle trajectory prediction is an important decision-making and planning basis for autonomous driving systems that enables them to drive safely and efficiently. To accurately predict vehicle trajectories, the complex representations and dynamic interactions among the elements in a traffic scene are abstracted and modelled. This paper presents vehicle-road relationships net, a deep learning network that extracts features from vehicle-road relationships and models the effects of traffic environments on vehicles. The introduction of geographic highway information and the calculation of spatiotemporal distances with a reference not only unify heterogeneous vehicle-road relationship representations into a time series vector but also reduce the requirement for sensing transient changes in the surrounding area. A hierarchical long short-term memory network extracts environmental features from two perspectives-social interactions and road constraints-and predicts the future trajectories of vehicles by their manoeuvre categories. Accordingly, vehicle-road relationships net fully exploits the contributions of historical trajectories and integrates the effects of road constraints to achieve performance that is comparable to or better than that of state-of-the-art methods on the next-generation simulation dataset.

AB The human impact on the coastal ecosystems is a global environmental concern. Due to the growing urbanization, industrialization, and transportation, this impact on the living and non-living components of the coastal area is expected to further increase in the coming years. Artificial intelligence based automation of the coastal monitoring, including data collection, analysis and decision making, provides real-time insights and opportunities for large-scale coastal management and governance. In this paper, a framework for autonomous litter surveying and human activity monitoring for governance intelligence in coastal eco-cyber-physical systems (ecoCystem) is presented. A large dataset of more than 20,000 images focused on smart coastal management is collected to model the real world scenarios. A combination of various artificial intelligence based methods are used for automatic detection and classification of various litter in the coastal environment. Furthermore, the proposed framework is capable of autonomous monitoring of humans activities and detection of illegal entry of vehicles and boats to the beach area. The accuracy of the proposed autonomous system is 87% for correct classification of fully visible litter and 95% for fully visible vehicles. The experimental results show that the application of computer vision and machine learning for autonomous litter classification shows promising results for increasing the speed and scale of litter surveying in the coastal area. Further training of the artificial intelligence models is necessary for increasing the accuracy of the proposed framework and real-world deployment in the coastal environment. The proposed human activity monitoring system can be used for autonomous coastal law enforcement and real-time and active protection of the coastal zones.

AB With the rapid development of Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) systems, the autonomous landing of a UAV on a moving Unmanned Ground Vehicle (UGV) has received extensive attention as a key technology. At present, this technology is confronted with such problems as operating in GPS-denied environments, a low accuracy of target location, the poor precision of the relative motion estimation, delayed control responses, slow processing speeds, and poor stability. To address these issues, we present a hybrid camera array-based autonomous landing UAV that can land on a moving UGV in a GPS-denied environment. We first built a UAV autonomous landing system with a hybrid camera array comprising a fisheye lens camera and a stereo camera. Then, we integrated a wide Field of View (FOV) and depth imaging for locating the UGV accurately. In addition, we employed a state estimation algorithm based on motion compensation for establishing the motion state of the ground moving UGV, including its actual motion direction and speed. Thereafter, according to the characteristics of the designed system, we derived a nonlinear controller based on the UGV motion state to ensure that the UGV and UAV maintain the same motion state, which allows autonomous landing. Finally, to evaluate the performance of the proposed system, we carried out a large number of simulations in AirSim and conducted real-world experiments. Through the qualitative and quantitative analyses of the experimental results, as well as the analysis of the time performance, we verified that the autonomous landing performance of the system in the GPS-denied environment is effective and robust.

ID PERCEPTION
AB Midway through the 2007 DARPA Urban Challenge, MIT's robot "Talos" and Team Cornell's robot "Skynet" collided in a low-speed accident. This accident was one of the first collisions between full-sized autonomous road vehicles. Fortunately, both vehicles went on to finish the race and the collision was thoroughly documented in the vehicle logs. This collaborative study between MIT and Cornell traces the confluence of events that preceded the collision and examines its root causes. A summary of robot-robot interactions during the race is presented. The logs from both vehicles are used to show the gulf between robot and human-driver behavior at close vehicle proximities. Contributing factors are shown to be (1) difficulties in sensor data association leading to an inability to detect slow-moving vehicles and phantom obstacles, (2) failure to anticipate vehicle intent, and (3) an overemphasis on lane constraints versus vehicle proximity in motion planning. Finally, we discuss approaches that could address these issues in future systems, such as intervehicle communication, vehicle detection, and prioritized motion planning.

AB In recent years, e-commerce businesses have seen an increase in the daily volume of packages to be delivered, as well as an increase in the number of particularly demanding customer expectations. In this respect, the delivery mechanism became prohibitively expensive, particularly for the final kilometer. To stay competitive and meet the increased demand, businesses began to look for innovative autonomous delivery options for the last mile, such as autonomous unmanned aerial vehicles/drones, which are a promising alternative for the logistics industry. Following the success of drones in surveillance and remote sensing, drone delivery systems have begun to emerge as a new solution to reduce delivery costs and delivery time. In the coming years, autonomous drone sharing systems will be an unavoidable logistical solution, especially with the new laws/recommendations introduced by the Flight World Organization on how to organize the operations of these special unmanned airline systems. This paper provides a comprehensive literature survey on a set of relevant research issues and highlights the representative solutions and concepts that have been proposed thus far in the design and modeling of the logistics of drone delivery systems, with the purpose of discussing the respective performance levels reached by the various suggested approaches. Furthermore, the paper also investigates the central problems to be addressed and briefly discusses and outlines a series of interesting new research avenues of relevance for drone-based package delivery systems.

AB Navigation techniques for autonomous sailboats are faced with two inherent difficulties. The uncontrollable and partially unpredictable nature of thrust forces on one hand and the complex kinematics of sailboats on the other hand. This paper proposes a new reactive navigation approach, based on artificial potential fields, that addresses these two problems simultaneously. Environment and specific sailboat navigation constraints are represented by a local potential built around the vehicle location. Changes of wind direction and detected obstacles affect this periodically updated potential, which guarantees the real-time computation of a feasible heading for the boat. Numerical simulations are presented and validate the proposed algorithm under various wind conditions. Field trials eventually illustrate the efficiency of this navigation technique using a reduced-scale autonomous sailboat prototype. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

DE crop row guidance; localization; situation awareness
AB Autonomous driving is greatly impacting intensive and precise agriculture. Matter-of-factly, the first commercial applications of autonomous driving were in autonomous navigation of agricultural tractors in open fields. As the technology improves, the possibility of using autonomous or semi-autonomous tractors in orchards and vineyards is becoming commercially profitable. These scenarios offer more challenges as the vehicle needs to position itself with respect to a more cluttered environment. This paper presents an adaptive localization system for (semi-) autonomous navigation of agricultural tractors in vineyards that is based on ultrasonic automotive sensors. The system estimates the distance from the left vineyard row and the incidence angle. The paper shows that a single tuning of the localization algorithm does not provide robust performance in all vegetation scenarios. We solve this issue by implementing an Extended Kalman Filter (EKF) and by introducing an adaptive data selection stage that automatically adapts to the vegetation conditions and discards invalid measurements. An extensive experimental campaign validates the main features of the localization algorithm. In particular, we show that the Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) of the distance is 16 cm, while the angular RMSE is 2.6 degrees.

AB Tourism is central to late-modern life, and tourism research that threatens this centrality is prone to media attention. Framed by sociotechnical transitions theory, we introduce the concept of 'shadowcasting' to show how tourism knowledge disseminated through the media, combined with public comments on its reporting, cast shadows that co-constitute imagined futures. We illustrate shadowcasting through a mixed method approach that demonstrates how media reporting and public comments on a recent paper on autonomous vehicles in tourism emerged and diverged from the original paper. Our findings reveal that issues around sex and terrorism were sensationalised, generating diverse public discourses that challenge linear visions of future transport efficiency. Our concluding discussion indicates other tourism research contexts that are most inclined to shadowcasting.

The primary function of the AUV was to provide georeferenced, high-resolution optical validation of seabed interpretations based on acoustic data. We describe the AUV capabilities and its operation in the context of the multiple systems used in the cruise. The data processing pipeline involved in generating simultaneous localization and mapping based navigation, large-scale, three-dimensional visualizations, and automated classification of survey data is briefly described. We also present preliminary results illustrating the type of data products possible with our system and how they can inform the science driving the cruise. (C) 2010 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

   classification; model fusion; machine learning
AB The autonomous technology of unmanned platforms is the most dynamic frontier among fields of technology and, inevitably, is trending towards future development. Aiming at the dual requirements of reliable and real-time autonomous decision-making of unmanned underwater vehicles in complex and unfamiliar environments, this article proposes an intelligent decision-making method of attack behavior based on model fusion. The experimental dataset is generated through simulation modeling, and an appropriate amount of noise is added to simulate the observation error in a real situation. The threshold of weapon-hit probability is set according to the requirements of combat missions, and the decision-making of attack behavior is transformed into the problem of imbalanced sample classification with noisy data. Through theoretical analysis and experimental testing, the classification effects of algorithms such as Logistic Regression (LR), K-nearest neighbor (KNN), support vector machine (SVM), multilayer perceptron (MLP), decision tree (DT), and ensemble learning are compared. On this basis, the intelligent decision model is constructed by using synthetic minority oversampling technique resampling and three model fusion methods of voting, stacking, and blending. The experimental results show that compared with traditional simulation decision-making and common classification algorithms, the proposed method has higher accuracy, recall rate, area-under-the-curve value, and model generalization ability. It can not only effectively identify the impact of noise data on attack-behavior decision-making, but also ensures the decision-making speed through offline training, and provides references for the research in the field of equipment development and intelligent decision-making in the future.

AB The future of privately owned, fully automated vehicles (AVs) is highly uncertain, especially the impacts to greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. We simulate the impacts of climate policy on AV uptake in Canada's light-duty vehicle sector and the corresponding GHG emissions, including changes to efficiency, vehicle kilometre travelled (VKT), and zero-emissions vehicle (ZEV) sales. We use a technology adoption model which includes consumer preferences and endogenous learning, while also representing automaker decisions. In scenarios where AVs become fully available for sale in 2025, consumer uptake ranges from 15% to 36% new market share by 2035- some of which displace ZEV sales. With or without strong climate policy, the availability of AVs leads to a small increase in GHG emissions, largely due to increased VKT per vehicle and among new user groups. However, enactment of a strong carbon price or ZEV sales mandate can still substantially reduce emissions in the AV scenarios.

AB This paper addresses the implementation of a predictive control strategy for Unmanned Air Vehicles in the presence of bounded disturbances. The goal is to prove the feasibility of such a real-time optimization-based control design and to demonstrate its tracking capabilities for the nonlinear dynamics with respect to a reference trajectory which is pre-specified via differential flatness. In order to benefit from the computational advantages of the linear predictive control formulations, an off-line linearization strategy of the nonlinear model of the vehicle along the flat trajectory is employed. The proposed method exhibits effective performance validated through software-in-the-loop simulations and real flight tests on different Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs). (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

The vehicle is outfitted with a professional (Applanix POS-LV) and consumer (Xsens MTi-G) inertial measurement unit, a Velodyne three-dimensional lidar scanner, two push-broom forward-looking Riegl lidars, and a Point Grey Ladybug3 omnidirectional camera system. Here we present the time-registered data from these sensors mounted on the vehicle, collected while driving the vehicle around the Ford Research Campus and downtown Dearborn, MI, during November-December 2009. The vehicle path trajectory in these data sets contains several large-and small-scale loop closures, which should be useful for testing various state-of-the-art computer vision and simultaneous localization and mapping algorithms.

AB This paper aims to investigate a low-complexity tracking control method for autonomous underwater helicopters (AUH), which is devoid of nonlinear approximation strategies, ensuring good efficiency and keeping a high accuracy in environmental disturbances and modeling uncertainty. The Nussbaum function and shifting function are introduced to solve the problem of unknown control direction and initial condition of system error, respectively. Besides, to reduce the controller's update rate and the thruster's mechanical loss, an incremental event-triggered control mechanism with two thresholds is added to the algorithm. Finally, the simulations on AUHs show the effectiveness of the proposed scheme.

AB Scientific knowledge on autonomous-driving technology is expanding at a faster-than-ever pace. As a result, the likelihood of incurring information overload is particularly notable for researchers, who can struggle to overcome the gap between information processing requirements and information processing capacity. We address this issue by adopting a multi-granulation approach to latent knowledge discovery and synthesis in large-scale research domains. The proposed methodology combines citation-based community detection methods and topic modelling techniques to give a concise but comprehensive overview of how the autonomous vehicle (AV) research field is conceptually structured. Thirteen core thematic areas are extracted and presented by mining the large data-rich environments resulting from 50 years of AV research. The analysis demonstrates that this research field is strongly oriented towards examining the technological developments needed to enable the widespread rollout of AVs, whereas it largely overlooks the wide-ranging sustainability implications of this sociotechnical transition. On account of these findings, we call for a broader engagement of AV researchers with the sustainability concept and we invite them to increase their commitment to conducting systematic investigations into the sustainability of AV deployment. Sustainability research is urgently required to produce an evidence-based understanding of what new sociotechnical arrangements are needed to ensure that the systemic technological change introduced by AV-based transport systems can fulfill societal functions while meeting the urgent need for more sustainable transport solutions.

DT Article
AB With the rapid growth of traffic demand and the development of intelligent technology, autonomous transportation system (ATS) has been considered as future transportation system. The evaluation of a designed physical architecture of ATS is necessary for understanding whether and how ATS operates and evolves automatically without manual works, and architecture simulation is a method for solving such research problem. Therefore, in this study, architecture simulation based on system dynamics modelling has been employed for physical architecture research. Under this methodology, a simulation case for scenario "Autonomous Vehicle on a Crossing in an Autonomous Transportation System" has been studied for understanding the information flow in ATS to evaluate and optimise its physical architecture of ATS. In conclusion, the system dynamic model could help researchers understand and evaluate the physical architecture's operation of ATS by scenario analysis.

AB Autonomous point to point shuttles are an emerging paradigm of a future mobility-on-demand ecosystem. However, the traffic and environmental impacts of their operation are largely under researched especially in relation to influential infrastructure related factors and service-related specifications. The scope of this study is to reveal the factors that may affect the degree and magnitude of the road segment level impacts of an autonomous urban shuttle service (AUSS) operating in a city using microsimulation and structural equation modeling (SEM). For the purposes of this research, a systematic framework is developed and applied in the city center of Athens (Greece), which encompasses different scenarios of operations including: (i) Baseline (no AUSS operation), (ii) AUSS operation with a dedicated lane during peak hour, (iii) AUSS operation mixed with regular traffic during peak hour and (iv) AUSS operation mixed with regular traffic during off-peak hour. Two connected automated vehicle (CAV) profiles were used to model the advent of automation in the overall traffic: a cautious profile is introduced first, followed by a more aggressive profile. SEM findings indicate that the AUSS operation has a significant effect on cumulative travel time per segment and CO2 emissions per segment only during the scenario of mixed operation with traffic during off-peak hours. Additionally, the influence of the network geometry is correlated with reduced travel time and with increased CO2 emissions. Road traffic density was found to be positively correlated with both travel time and CO2 emissions, while the penetration of both cautious and aggressive CAVs was found to be negatively correlated with both indicators.

   Vehicle Operations in the Antarctic

ID LOGIC; FRAMEWORK; BENEATH
AB With the maturing of autonomous technology and better accessibility, there has been a growing interest in the use of autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs). The deployment of AUVs for under-ice marine science research in the Antarctic is one such example. However, a higher risk of AUV loss is present during such endeavors due to the extreme operating environment. To control the risk of loss, existing risk analyses approaches tend to focus more on the AUV's technical aspects and neglect the role of soft factors, such as organizational and human influences. In addition, the dynamic and complex interrelationships of risk variables are also often overlooked due to uncertainties and challenges in quantification. To overcome these shortfalls, a hybrid fuzzy system dynamics risk analysis (FuSDRA) is proposed. In the FuSDRA framework, system dynamics models the interrelationships between risk variables from different dimensions and considers the time-dependent nature of risk while fuzzy logic accounts for uncertainties. To demonstrate its application, an example based on an actual Antarctic AUV program is presented. Focusing on funding and experience of the AUV team, simulation of the FuSDRA risk model shows a declining risk of loss from 0.293 in the early years of the Antarctic AUV program, reaching a minimum of 0.206 before increasing again in later years. Risk control policy recommendations were then derived from the analysis. The example demonstrated how FuSDRA can be applied to inform funding and risk management strategies, or broader application both within the AUV domain and on other complex technological systems.

AB Recent studies have shown evidence of a significant decline of the Posidonia oceanica (P.O.) meadows on a global scale. The monitoring and mapping of these meadows are fundamental tools for measuring their status. We present an approach based on a deep neural network to automatically perform a high-precision semantic segmentation of the P.O. meadows in sea-floor images, offering several improvements over the state-of-the-art techniques. Our network demonstrates outstanding performance over diverse test sets, reaching a precision of 96.57% and an accuracy of 96.81%, surpassing the reliability of labeling the images manually. Moreover, the network is implemented in an autonomous underwater vehicle, performing an online P.O. segmentation, which will be used to generate real-time semantic coverage maps.

AB This article presents a software layer to abstract users ofunmanned aerial vehiclesfrom the specific hardware of the platform and the autopilot interfaces. The main objective of ourunmanned aerial vehicle abstraction layer(UAL) is to simplify the development and testing of higher-level algorithms in aerial robotics by trying to standardize and simplify the interfaces with the unmanned aerial vehicles. Unmanned aerial vehicle abstraction layer supports operation with PX4 and DJI autopilots (among others), which are current leading manufacturers. Besides, unmanned aerial vehicle abstraction layer can work seamlessly with simulated or real platforms and it provides calls to issue standard commands such as taking off, landing or pose, and velocity controls. Even though unmanned aerial vehicle abstraction layer is under continuous development, a stable version is available for public use. We showcase the use of unmanned aerial vehicle abstraction layer with a set of applications coming from several European research projects, where different academic and industrial entities have adopted unmanned aerial vehicle abstraction layer as a common development framework.

AB In this paper, off-road path recognition and navigation control method are studied to realize intelligent vehicle autonomous driving in unstructured environment. Firstly, the traversable path is achieved by vision and laser sensors. The vehicle steering and driving coupled dynamic model is established. Secondly, a coordinated controller for steering and driving is proposed via the back-stepping variable structure control method, which can be used to deal with the unmatched uncertainties of the control system model. To reduce the chattering phenomenon caused by variable structure, the boundary layer approach is introduced. The results of simulation and off-road experiment show the effectiveness and robustness of the proposed controller.

DT Article
DE LTE; vehicle to vehicle (V2V); connected vehicles; resource scheduling;

AB In this letter, we investigate the distributed autonomous resource selection for LTE vehicle to vehicle (V2V) broadcast. The effectiveness of collision avoidance and location based resource allocation enhancements is examined. It is found that collision avoidance with multiple data resources reservation per schedule assignment (SA) is a key to improve broadcast reliability. However, in the existing collision avoidance algorithm reserving multiple resources per SA can lead to many data packet collisions if a SA collision happens. We propose an enhanced collision avoidance to address this issue. The idea is to use selected data packets to disseminate the reservation of data resources and SA resources, which can provide better communication among neighbor vehicles on resource reservation and reduce data collisions. Simulation results show that the proposed collision avoidance enhancement can effectively improve SA and data transmission reliability. The network capacity in terms of supported vehicles under given V2V service requirements is largely increased by 17% at a negligible cost of added overhead.

To reduce expensive costs of operations, improvements on autonomous observation capabilities has a key role. In this work, we offer coverage improvements for our autonomous environmental monitoring system. We compared different path planning approaches to find out the optimum path planning solution. Simulation results showed that required task execution time and required resources are decreased by usage of improved decomposition of the coverage field.

ID MODEL
AB Self-awareness of its own state during autonomous operation is critical for Autonomous Underwater Vehicles (AUVs) to execute tasks and monitor their health. Automated data analysis methods appear to be the most appropriate tool for attempting to understand and elucidate the motion states of AUVs. However, research scholars often focus on the state recognition of small AUVs used for shallow water detection, and the relevant conclusions cannot be directly applied to deep-sea AUVs. As a representative deep-sea AUV, Qianlong-3 is studied in this paper. In this study, a data-driven approach was employed to recognize the motion states and control modes of the Qianlong-3 AUV while retaining the original data noise. First, the class imbalance problem in the data was addressed, and then the data features were enhanced through a sliding window statistical method. By comparing the differences in the accuracy of motion state recognition after class imbalance processing using different supervised learning methods, the Random Forest (RF) algorithm was found to be the most suitable classification algorithm. In addition, the Toeplitz Inverse Covariance-Based Clustering (TICC) algorithm was used to recognize and mine the motion states and control modes of the AUV. The TICC algorithm was effective in extracting latent information from the actual data. Finally, through correlation analysis, the three motion states of the AUV were discussed, and the control modes for each of these states were determined. Overall, this study demonstrates the feasibility of relevant algorithms in practical deep-sea applications for state recognition and control mode mining. This provides valuable reference and experience for the development of future deep-sea AUV.

AB Mixed traffic flow is a prevalent phenomenon in the trend of connected automated vehicles (CAVs), where a diverse set of road users, including cars, motorcycles, bicycles, pedestrians, and even animals, share the road infrastructure. This coexistence poses a range of challenges, not limited to traffic safety, efficiency, and environmental sustainability. Compared with the traditional traffic streams, the controllability of connected and automated vehicles within mixed traffic offers new possibilities for eco-driving. As CAV technologies continue to flourish, this study explores the imperative of constructing eco-roads within a mixed traffic framework and optimizing eco- driving strategies to enhance vehicle energy efficiency and reduce emissions. We extended the concept of mixed traffic flow to incorporate scenarios involving animal crossings, introducing an eco-road-based green mixed traffic model. Analyzing the driving behaviors of both autonomous and manually-driven vehicles within a vehicular network ecosystem, we proposed an eco- road driving model that includes vehicle-following and lane-changing behaviors. From the perspective of dynamic programming, we conducted a discrete analysis to create an energysaving driving model apt for mixed traffic conditions, with Q-Learning serving as the optimal solver. We further validated our theoretical framework through simulations conducted on ecoroads in Shanghai, taking into account the inherent risks brought about by the crossing of wildlife. Our empirical results indicated that the recommended energy-saving strategies could potentially reduce fuel consumption by 6-11%. Interestingly, the energy-saving effects are amplified with an increasing density of networked autonomous vehicles (CAVs) within the mixed traffic environment. Our findings strengthen the feasibility of our model and the efficacy of our algorithmic approach, confirming that the described driving strategies hold great promise for significantly improving energy efficiency in the domain of connected vehicles under the premise of ensuring the safety of driving and wildlife.

DE Active SLAM; AUV; Bathymetric SLAM; Mutual information
ID SIMULTANEOUS LOCALIZATION
AB Bathymetric simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) methods have shown their potential in deep-sea navigation and mapping for autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs). However, Bathymetric SLAM may fail catastrophically in area with flat terrain, due to the invalid loop closures caused by fake terrain matching results. This paper proposed an active bathymetric SLAM method, which drives an AUV into the area with sizeable topographic relief for accurate loop detection actively. A terrain-complexity-related mutual information utility function is proposed to optimize the trading-off between exploration and revisiting tasks of a vehicle. A simulation system has been constructed using both the robot operating system (ROS) and unity3d software to verify our algorithm. The simulation experiments show that our method is more efficient than state-of-the-art algorithms.

AB This article investigates the robust adaptive control for the longitudinal dynamics of autonomous underwater vehicle with target tracking based on fuzzy logic system. Through dynamic transformation, the target tracking command is converted to the pitch angle command. The tracking controller using switching mechanism is designed where the fuzzy logic system (FLS) cooperates with the robust design to deal with dynamics uncertainty. Considering the approximation ability of FLS, the modeling error is constructed and employed to design the fuzzy update law. The parameter adaptation law is further introduced for the unknown control gain function. The uniformly ultimate boundedness stability is proved through Lyapunov analysis. Simulation tests on the task of moving target tracking present higher tracking and learning performance.

ID DECISION
AB To determine the navigational states of an autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV), a data analysis approach of AUV navigation based on complex networks is proposed in this study. First, the noise in AUV navigation data is eliminated by the projection-density peaks clustering algorithm (Pro-DPCA), and the weighted complex networks of the de-noising data are constructed. The nodes of networks characterize AUV navigation states. Subsequently, we compute the topological statistics of the complex networks to obtain the fluctuation patterns of the AUV navigational data. This is used to analyse AUV navigational states. For verifying the approach, the heading data at different depths is analysed in our experiments. The experimental results indicate that the topological statistics of the complex networks accurately describe the navigational states of AUV at different depths.

ID SYSTEM
AB A rear-end collision avoidance system (RECAS) could reduce accidents by assisting drivers during emergencies through autonomous braking. If the decision to intervene is made too early, the intervention can become a disturbance Hence, proper threat assessment is important to make a decision for intervention in a RECAS. In this study, a new threat assessment measure using a varying time headway has been proposed to develop a rear-end collision avoidance algorithm (RECAA) for heavy commercial road vehicles in heterogeneous traffic. The proposed varying time headway depends on the type of lead vehicle, host vehicle load conditions, road conditions and relative longitudinal speed. The developed RECAA was implemented in a hardware-in-loop experimental setup that is equipped with the vehicle dynamic simulation software, IPG/TruchMaker and tested for vehicle following scenarios using different types of lead vehicles and host vehicle loading conditions. The results showed that the proposed varying time headway improved the RECAA by activating the host vehicle's brake system at different time instants based on the type of lead vehicle and thereby preventing the unintended early brake intervention of RECAS.

AB Safely interacting with other traffic participants is one of the core requirements for autonomous driving, especially in intersections and occlusions. Most existing approaches are designed for particular scenarios and require significant human labor in parameter tuning to be applied to different situations. To solve this problem, we first propose a learning-based Interaction Point Model (IPM), which describes the interaction between agents with the protection time and interaction priority in a unified manner. We further integrate the proposed IPM into a novel planning framework, demonstrating its effectiveness and robustness through comprehensive simulations in highly dynamic environments.

AB In this paper a new distributed feedback strategy is proposed for controlling a rigid, acyclic formation of kinematic point-modeled mobile autonomous agents in the plane. The strategy makes use of a new concept called a "target point" and is applicable to any two-dimensional, acyclic formation whose underlying directed graph can be generated by a sequence of Henneberg vertex additions. It is shown that the method can cause a group of agents starting in any given initial positions in the plane to move into a prescribed formation exponentially fast provided the formation's designated leader and first follower start in different positions.

AB With the development of multi-autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) cooperative systems, the evaluation of their reliability is becoming more and more important. Aimed at the characteristics of the system, three reliability indexes standard entropy of rank distribution, all-terminal reliability and standard natural connectivity are determined in this paper. Topology structure and underwater acoustic communication are considered. The calculation methods of the three reliability indexes are proposed, and the characteristics of these indexes are analyzed. The reliability indexes of two multi-AUV cooperative systems are obtained as examples. Results show that these three indexes reflect different aspects of reliability for multi-AUV cooperative systems. This paper provides some methods to evaluate the reliability of multi-AUV cooperative systems, which is of practical value.

AB In a common parking lot, much of the space is devoted not to parking but to lanes in which cars travel to and from parking spaces. Lanes must not be blocked for one simple reason: a blocked car might need to leave before the car that blocks it. Self-parking and intelligent communication capabilities of autonomous vehicles introduces an opportunity to overcome this constraint, and therefore to achieve much higher storage capacity of cars. We show how to maximize the number of cars in a parking lot that assumes interfering cars could be moved out of the way by a centralized controller. We provide optimal results for small lots with a single entry point, and we offer heuristic methods for larger lots. Improvements in parking capacity of 80 percent is possible.

AB Perception reaction time and mental workload have proven to be crucial in manual driving. Moreover, in highly automated cars, where most of the research is focusing on Level 4 Autonomous driving, take-over performance is also a key factor when taking road safety into account. This study aims to investigate how the immersion in non-driving related tasks affects the take-over performance of drivers in given scenarios. The paper also highlights the use of virtual simulators to gather efficient data that can be crucial in easing the transition between manual and autonomous driving scenarios. The use of Computer Aided Simulations is of absolute importance in this day and age since the automotive industry is rapidly moving towards Autonomous technology. An experiment comprising of 40 subjects was performed to examine the reaction times of driver and the influence of other variables in the success of take-over performance in highly automated driving under different circumstances within a highway virtual environment. The results reflect the relationship between reaction times under different scenarios that the drivers might face under the circumstances stated above as well as the importance of variables such as velocity in the success on regaining car control after automated driving. The implications of the results acquired are important for understanding the criteria needed for designing Human Machine Interfaces specifically aimed towards automated driving conditions. Understanding the need to keep drivers in the loop during automation, whilst allowing drivers to safely engage in other non-driving related tasks is an important research area which can be aided by the proposed study.

ID POLYNOMIAL APPROACH; WAVE-PROPAGATION; LEGENDRE
AB Algorithms that enable acoustic sensing vehicles to autonomously map acoustic fields are being developed, but some require an analytical representation of the data collected from the acoustic field with specific continuity properties. One optimal control technique that has these requirements and has been used in autonomous acoustic sensing algorithms is Pontryagin's Maximum Principle (PMP). Given that most real-world fields are modeled by numerical methods, the need to create continuous analytical representations from data is a hurdle in realistic applications of these autonomous algorithms. In this work, finite series of basis functions are used to solve this problem. The basis functions are selected to meet the criteria of the PMP, and are used to approximate the field from the data collected. While this approach meets the criteria of the algorithm, it can be a computationally expensive approach for complex fields and large datasets. This paper looks at the trade off between accuracy and computational time, for different frequencies and levels of field complexity. A previously published ocean profile developed from data taken off the island of Elba is used in the normal mode software, Kraken, to generate the acoustic fields used to test this method. The candidate basis functions considered are trigonometric functions analogous to finite Fourier series, and Legendre polynomials. The Legendre polynomials are shown to have higher accuracy when used with a dynamically selected exclusion range at low frequencies and a cubic spline interpolation method for generating intermediate data points at higher frequencies. Run times are calculated and while both candidate basis functions are shown to meet the requirements of the PMP algorithm, the Legendre polynomials require the least amount of run time.

AB For autonomous vehicles, it is an important requirement to obtain integrate static road information in real-time in dynamic driving environment. A comprehensive perception of the surrounding road should cover the accurate detection of the entire road area despite occlusion, the 3D geometry and the types of road topology in order to facilitate the practical applications in autonomous driving. To this end, we propose a lightweight and efficient LiDAR-based multi-task road perception network (LMRoadNet) to conduct occlusion-free road segmentation, road ground height estimation, and road topology recognition simultaneously. To optimize the proposed network, a corresponding multi-task dataset, named MultiRoad, is built semi-automatically based on the public SemanticKITTI dataset. Specifically, our network architecture uses road segmentation as the main task, and the remaining two tasks are directly decoded on a concentrated 1/4 scale feature map derived from the main task & x2019;s feature maps of different scales and phases, which significantly reduces the complexity of the overall network while achieves high performance. In addition, a loss function with learnable weight of each task is adopted to train the neural network, which effectively balances the loss of each task and improves performance of the individual tasks. Extensive experiments on the test set show that the proposed network achieves great performance of the three tasks in real-time, outperforms the conventional multi-task architecture and is comparable to the state-of-the-art efficient methods. Finally, a fusion strategy is proposed to combine results on different directions to expand the field of view for practical applications.

AB This paper addresses the problem of three-dimensional (3D) path following control for underactuated autonomous underwater vehicles in the presence of parameter uncertainties and external disturbances. Firstly, 3D path following error model was established based on virtual guidance method. Then, an adaptive robust control system was proposed using backstepping and sliding mode control, and we adopt fuzzy logic theory to approximate unknown nonlinear function to solve the problems of nonlinearity, uncertainties and external disturbances in the path following. System stability was proved by Lyapunov stable theory. Finally, simulations were conducted and the results showed that the controller is of excellent adaptability and robustness in the presence of parameter uncertainties and external disturbances.

AB As marine activities expand, deploying underwater autonomous vehicles (AUVs) becomes critical. Efficiently navigating these AUVs through intricate underwater terrains is vital. This paper proposes a sophisticated motion-planning algorithm integrating deep reinforcement learning (DRL) with an improved artificial potential field (IAPF). The algorithm incorporates remote sensing information to overcome traditional APF challenges and combines the IAPF with the traveling salesman problem for optimal path cruising. Through a combination of DRL and multi-source data optimization, the approach ensures minimal energy consumption across all target points. Inertial sensors further refine trajectory, ensuring smooth navigation and precise positioning. The comparative experiments confirm the method's energy efficiency, trajectory refinement, and safety excellence.

AB For an autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV), a nonlinear sliding-mode control based on linear-in-parameter neural network (NSMC-NN) is proposed to deal with the unknown dynamics and the external environmental disturbances and a first-order robust exact differentiator is introduced considering unknown velocities of an AUV. The sliding-mode surfaces of NSMC-NN can enter into the boundary layers after a period that depends on the design parameters. To demonstrate the feasibility of the proposed controller, simulation studies applying Omni-Directional Intelligent Navigator (ODIN) are carried out, compared with proportional-integral-derivative (PID) and the modified sliding-mode control (MSMC). The simulation results show that the presented control method can achieve the effective control performance.

AB This paper describes autonomous unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) guidance technologies developed and demonstrated in a flight test sponsored by the DARPA Software Enabled Control program. The flight experiment took place in June 2004 using a Boeing UAV testbed and demonstrated important autonomy capabilities enabled by a receding horizon guidance controller and fault detection filter. The receding horizon controller (RHC) design process is presented in detail as well as demonstration scenarios which were designed to exercise and evaluate the primary functionalities; of the control system. Simulation results of the key capabilities are shown and compared with recorded flight data for evaluation purposes. Hardware-in-the-loop simulations and other high-fidelity test run results illustrate secondary capabilities such as controller reconfiguration due to actuator fault and maneuvering limit enforcement using output constraints in the receding horizon approach.

This article focuses on the application of deep learning algorithms to present a fusion monitoring solution which was three different algorithms: a violent action detection system, which recognizes violent behaviors between passengers, a violent object detection system, and a lost items detection system. Public datasets were used for object detection algorithms (COCO and TAO) to train state-of-the-art algorithms such as YOLOv5. For violent action detection, the MoLa InCar dataset was used to train on state-of-the-art algorithms such as I3D, R(2+1)D, SlowFast, TSN, and TSM. Finally, an embedded automotive solution was used to demonstrate that both methods are running in real-time.

AB With growing numbers of intelligent autonomous systems in human environments, the ability of such systems to perceive, understand, and anticipate human behavior becomes increasingly important. Specifically, predicting future positions of dynamic agents and planning considering such predictions are key tasks for self-driving vehicles, service robots, and advanced surveillance systems. This article provides a survey of human motion trajectory prediction. We review, analyze, and structure a large selection of work from different communities and propose a taxonomy that categorizes existing methods based on the motion modeling approach and level of contextual information used. We provide an overview of the existing datasets and performance metrics. We discuss limitations of the state of the art and outline directions for further research.

AB This technical paper describes existing capabilities and new research results for autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) for use in locating, characterizing, and monitoring underwater munitions. The authors introduce advances in sensor technologies and search methods pertinent to AUV-based underwater munition mitigation operations. Results are presented from a series of trials using in situ chemical sensors to detect both conventional and nonconventional underwater munitions in real time. These technologies are considered within the context of chemical plume tracing and biomimetic search algorithms. This paper concludes with a look toward future AUV sensor payloads with more extensive real-time situation awareness. Advancement of these technologies and. methods will be critical for realizing the potential of AUV platforms to manage the risks posed by underwater munitions sites.

AB Road traffic accidents, congestion and their ensuing issues are of international concern. A recent technological development to alleviate this situation is the autonomic car. A driverless vehicle will transport its passengers to their destinations. User experience would be enhanced by adapting the workings of the vehicle in line with the personality of its user. An autonomic car information system preference questionnaire was designed, focusing on different components of a futuristic information system. Participants comprised 155 students. The results demonstrated two factors: willingness to share information and need for control. A regression analysis on the automatic car preferences, personality (the Big 5), gender, and age showed that openness, consciousnesses, and age were related to different preferences. The results are assessed, followed by a discussion on personality in relation to the autonomic car.

AB This article presents the design and implementation of a drive-by-wire system and a navigation control system for an autonomous Formula SAE race car. The result is the development of a platform for research into autonomous driving which can be easily replicated. Drive-by-wire actuators for acceleration, braking and steering of the vehicle are discussed, as well as the embedded low-level control system. The high-level navigation system features sensor fusion of a 6-dof IMU with a standard GPS and the integration of an automotive LIDAR. Operation of the vehicle is via a multi-threaded program with asynchronous IO and is based upon recording and driving waypoints. In addition to independent safety interlocks, active safety systems are an integral part to both the drive-by-wire and navigation systems.

AB Automated storage and retrieval systems (AS/RSs) and autonomous vehicle storage and retrieval systems (AVS/RSs) are two competing technologies for the handling, storage and retrieval of unit-loads in the reserve section of an automated warehouse. In this paper, we model variants of the two systems as an open queuing network (OQN) and use an existing tool for the analysis of OQNs, called the manufacturing system performance analyser (MPA), for analysing the performance of the AS/RS and AVS/RS. Experimental results are provided to show that MPA is a better choice than simulation to quickly evaluate alternate configurations of the two systems. We use MPA to answer a series of design questions for AS/RS and AVS/RS design conceptualisation.

AB Autonomous Vehicle (AV) technology is a disruptive transportation technology that promises to revolutionize how people travel. Due to their potential mobility benefits and associated impacts on public health and the environment, they have received massive attention from transportation experts. To date, there have been numerous academic research conducted regarding AVs, and many attempts have been made to summarize these research documents by manually reviewing them. Nevertheless, due to the vast nature of the existing literature, it is challenging to synthesize the themes in AV-related research and to explore their trends to inform future research direction. This study aims to utilize an advanced natural language processing technique to provide a comprehensive overview of the recent developments in AV-related research. The abstracts of 3292 articles published in transportation-based journals from January 2016 to October 2022 were collected and used for this study. A Structural Topic Model (STM) was employed to explore the dominant research themes hidden in the extant literature on AV research, examine their evolution over time, and determine the topics highly associated with developing and developed economies. Overall, the study highlighted that the least common themes in the literature are in the areas of the development of complex vehicle designs, safety, environmental benefits, and the impact of AVs on transportation infrastructure. Nevertheless, themes concerning AV safety and the environment are emerging as hot topics since late 2021. Topics related to investigating user perceptions, policies/approaches to increase user demand, and AV control/stability are highly studied. Besides, they predominantly originated from developed countries. The research themes, their associated trends, and the key policy suggestions drawn from the study are potentially useful for making well-informed research funding decisions, setting research priorities for countries, and guiding the future research endeavours of researchers.

AB The recognition of vehicle cluster situations is one of the critical technologies of advanced driving, such as intelligent driving and automated driving. The accurate recognition of vehicle cluster situations is helpful for behavior decision-making safe and efficient. In order to accurately and objectively identify the vehicle cluster situation, a vehicle cluster situation model is proposed based on the interval number of set pair logic. The proposed model can express the traffic environment's knowledge considering each vehicle's characteristics, grouping relationships, and traffic flow characteristics in the target vehicle's interest region. A recognition method of vehicle cluster situation is designed to infer the traffic environment and driving conditions based on the connection number of set pair logic. In the proposed model, the uncertainty of the driver's cognition is fully considered. In the recognition method, the relative uncertainty and relative certainty of driver's cognition, traffic information, and vehicle cluster situation are fully considered. The verification results show that the proposed recognition method of vehicle cluster situations can realize accurate and objective recognition. The proposed anthropomorphic recognition method could provide a basis for vehicle autonomous behavior decision-making.

AB The research and development of autonomous vehicle (AV) technology have been gaining ground globally. However, a few studies have performed an in-depth exploration of the contributing factors of crashes involving AVs. This study aims to predict the severity of crashes involving AVs and analyze the effects of the different factors on crash severity. Crash data were obtained from the AV-related crash reports presented to the California Department of Motor Vehicles in 2019 and included 75 uninjured and 18 injured accident cases. The points-of-interest (POI) data were collected from Google Map Application Programming Interface (API). Descriptive statistics analysis was applied to examine the features of crashes involving AVs in terms of collision type, crash severity, vehicle movement preceding the collision, and degree of vehicle damage. To compare the classification performance of different classifiers, we use two different classification models: eXtreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) and Classification and Regression Tree (CART). The result shows that the XGBoost model performs better in identifying the injured crashes involving AVs. Compared with the original XGBoost model, the recall and G-mean of the XGBoost model combining POI data improved by 100% and 11.1%, respectively. The main features that contribute to the severity of crashes include weather, degree of vehicle damage, accident location, and collision type. The results indicate that crash severity significantly increases if the AVs collided at an intersection under extreme weather conditions (e.g., fog and snow). Moreover, an accident resulting in injuries also had a higher probability of occurring in areas where land-use patterns are highly diverse. The knowledge gained from this research could ultimately contribute to assessing and improving the safety performance of the current AVs.

AB The automotive industry today faces three major transitions: the emergence of autonomous driving, electric powertrain replacing the internal combustion engine, and changes in possession of automobiles, e.g., increased usage of car sharing. As all three transitions are fostered by technologies that drive digital transformation of automobiles, the Technology Acceptance Model (TAM) by Davis represents the underlying research model of this paper. Hypotheses are developed and tested for a sample of 1177 participants using Partial Least Squares Structural Equation Modeling (PLS-SEM). Group differences are investigated for three markets: Europe, North America, and China. The paper confirms the underlying assumptions of the Technology Acceptance Model in the context of automobiles. Further, it illustrates influential societal norms and individual experiences for technology acceptance. In addition, compound effects for technology acceptance are found, e.g., the perceived enjoyment of electric driving affects the acceptance of autonomous driving and car possession behavior. The novel approach to integrate three different technologies within the Technology Acceptance Model requires unifying items to a level which makes them comparable, limiting the results for each individual technology. For practice, automotive manufacturers obtain advice on how to foster technology acceptance. For society, the paper uncovers the role of societal norms for technology acceptance in the context of automobiles. Policy makers can obtain insights on how to successfully increase technology acceptance, e.g., for environmental purposes. Conclusively, the paper applies the Technology Acceptance Model for three developments in the context of automobiles, thereby extending current research using the Technology Acceptance Model.

AB In this work, we deal with autonomous tracking and disturbance rejection problem of quadrotor vehicle flying in uncertain environment. The vehicles kinematic and modeling error uncertainties are associated with external disturbance, inertia, mass, and nonlinear aerodynamic forces and moments. The proposed method integrate the techniques from adaptive control and robust control theory. Robust and adaptive control algorithms for translational and orientation tracking are derived using Lyapunov method. It is shown in our analysis that the altitude, position, and attitude tracking errors are bounded and their bounds asymptotically converge to zero in Lyapunov sense. Simulation results on a commercial quadrotor flying vehicle are given to demonstrate the effectiveness of theoretical arguments for real world application.

AB In this article, we present a framework to use an autonomous multirotor unmanned aerial system (UAS) for cyanobacterial harmful algal blooms (CHABs) monitoring. The requirements of CHABS monitoring, and the factors are analysed. Formulae are developed to describe the relation between the image qualities and the UAS performance. Experiments are designed to investigate the influences of the flight parameters (the flight altitude, the flight speed and the shutter time of the camera) on the image resolution. CHABs detection experiments were carried out at Kingston, Canada. Experimental results show that the autonomous UAS is a promising enabling technology to contribute to a novel CHABs detection method.

DT Article
AB Considering the complexity and uncertainty of decision-making in the operating environment of an unmanned underwater vehicle (UUV), this study proposes an autonomous decision-making method based on the dynamic influence diagram (DID) and expected utility theory. First, a threat assessment model is established for situation awareness of the UUV. Accordingly, a DID model is developed for autonomous decision-making of the UUV. Then, based on the threat assessment results for the UUV, the utility of each decision-making plan in the decision-making nodes is inferred and predicted. Subsequently, the principle of maximum expected utility is used to select an optimal autonomous decision-making plan. Finally, the effectiveness of the DID method is verified by simulation. Compared with the traditional expert systems, the DID system shows great adaptability and exhibits better solutions of dynamic decision problems under uncertainty.

AB This paper proposes a GA-LOS-PI controller-based four-level control system that accurately evaluates pavement compaction effect of DYNAPAC CC6200 autonomous articulated vehicle (AAV). In the evaluation layer, various performance indicators are evaluated, including stability, rapidity and accuracy when trajectory tracking, and the ratio of required compaction to actual compaction once and twice and compaction repeatability index when pavement compacting. In the decision and control layer, incremental PI controller is used as the main control strategy, line of sight (LOS) guidance is introduced to eliminate system control lag, and genetic algorithm (GA) is used for searching the best proportional. The comparative simulation results of no controller, the traditional incremental PI controller, LOS-PI controller with human driving experience initial control parameters (HDEICP), GA-LOS-PI controller with random initial control parameters (RICP) and GA-LOS-PI controller with HDEICP manifest evidently that the proposed GA-LOS-PI controller with HDEICP has almost no steady-state error.

AB The three-dimensional (3D) path following problem of an underactuated autonomous underwater vehicle with ocean currents disturbances is addressed in this paper. Firstly, the motion equation under the ocean currents disturbance is established, and the dynamic model of 3D tracking error is constructed based on virtual guidance method. Then, a finite-time control scheme based on super-twisting observer and command filtered backstepping technology is proposed. We adopt super-twisting observer based on finite-time theory to observe the ocean currents disturbances for improving the system robust. A command filtered backstepping is proposed to replace the differential process in the conventional backstepping method for avoiding the differential expansion problem. The filter compensation loop is designed to ensure the accuracy of the filtered signal, and the anti-integration saturation link is designed considering the influence of integral saturation. Lyapunov stability theory is used to prove the stability of the underactuated AUV. Simulation studies are conducted to show the effectiveness and robustness of the controller.

AB A vision-based approach to obstacle avoidance for autonomous land vehicle (ALV) navigation in indoor environments is proposed. The approach is based on the use of a pattern recognition scheme, the quadratic classifier, to find collision-free paths in unknown indoor corridor environments. Obstacles treated in this study include the walls of the corridor and the objects that appear in the way of ALV navigation in the corridor. Detected obstacles as well as the two sides of the ALV body are considered as patterns, A systematic method for separating these patterns into two classes is proposed. The two pattern classes are used as the input data to design a quadratic classifier, Finally, the two-dimensional decision boundary of the classifier, which goes through the middle point between the two front vehicle a heels, is taken as a local collision-free path, This approach is implemented on a real ALV and successful navigations confirm the feasibility of the approach.

AB We use the recent advances in Deep Learning to solve an underwater motion planning problem by making use of optimal control tools-namely, we propose using the Deep Galerkin Method (DGM) to approximate the Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman PDE that can be used to solve continuous time and state optimal control problems. In order to make our approach more realistic, we consider that there are disturbances in the underwater medium that affect the trajectory of the autonomous vehicle. After adapting DGM by making use of a surrogate approach, our results show that our method is able to efficiently solve the proposed problem, providing large improvements over a baseline control in terms of costs, especially in the case in which the disturbances effects are more significant.

AB The aim of this paper is to develop a fuzzy iterative sliding mode control (FISMC) scheme for special autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) on three-dimensional (3D) path following. In this paper, the characteristics of the AUV are considered, which include a large scale, large inertia, and high speed. The FISMC controller designs iterative sliding mode surfaces by using a hyperbolic tangent function to keep the system with fast convergence and robust performance. At the same time, system uncertainties and environmental disturbances are taken into account. The control algorithm introduces fuzzy control to optimize the control parameters online to enhance the adaptability of the system and inhibit the chattering of the actuators. The performance of the proposed FISMC is demonstrated with numerical simulations.

AB We present a path-and motion-planning scheme that is "multiresolution" both in the sense of representing the environment with high accuracy only locally and in the sense of addressing the vehicle kinematic and dynamic constraints only locally. The proposed scheme uses rectangular multiresolution cell decompositions, efficiently generated using the wavelet transform. The wavelet transform is widely used in signal and image processing, with emerging applications in autonomous sensing and perception systems. The proposed motion planner enables the simultaneous use of the wavelet transform in both the perception and in the motion-planning layers of vehicle autonomy, thus potentially reducing online computations. We rigorously prove the completeness of the proposed path-planning scheme, and we provide numerical simulation results to illustrate its efficacy.

SO JOURNAL OF FIELD ROBOTICS

DT Article
AB In recent years, much progress has been made in outdoor autonomous navigation. However, safe navigation is still a daunting challenge in terrain containing vegetation. In this paper, we focus on the segmentation of ladar data into three classes using local three-dimensional point cloud statistics. The classes are: "scatter" to represent porous volumes such as grass and tree canopy; "linear" to capture thin objects like wires or tree branches, and finally "surface" to capture solid objects like ground surface, rocks, or large trunks. We present the details of the proposed method, and the modifications we made to implement it on-board an autonomous ground vehicle for real-time data processing. Finally, we present results produced from different stationary laser sensors and from field tests using an unmanned ground vehicle. (C) 2006 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

AB Project AURORA aims at the development of an unmanned airship capable of autonomous flight over user-defined locations for aerial inspection and imagery, acquisition. Presents a guidance control strategy for the trajectory path following of the AURORA airship, where the objective is to make the vehicle follow a set of predefined points. The guidance strategy is based on a path tracking error generation methodology that takes into account both the distance and the angular errors of the airship with respect to the desired trajectory. The guidance system is composed of a path tracking guidance controller (as outer loop) and a heading controller (as inner loop), using the rudder deflection. Also proposes an additional roll controller, using the aileron input, in order to reduce rolling oscillations during yaw maneuvering and due to atmospheric turbulence.

AB This paper discusses the development of a low-cost, redundant, strapdown inertial measurement unit (IMU). The unit comprises four ceramic vibrating structure gyroscopes and four QLC 400 accelerometers configured on a truncated tetrahedron design. This design allows for the optimal configuration of the eight sensors. which in turn provides for a theoretical 33% increase in information. The redundant sensor configuration also allows for fault detection, which is required for many autonomous applications. This initiative is a precursor for future developments with more sensors to provide fault isolation. The paper will also present a navigation system implementing the redundant IMU with the global positioning system. Results are provided of this navigation system being implemented in an unmanned air vehicle.

AB A combined double-sensor architecture, laser and camera, and a new algorithm named RLPF are presented as a solution to the problem of identifying and localizing a pallet, the position and angle of which are a priori known with large uncertainty. Solving this task for autonomous robot forklifts is of great value for logistics industry. The state-of-the-art is described to show how our approach overcomes the limitations of using either laser ranging or vision. An extensive experimental campaign and uncertainty analysis are presented. For the docking task, new dynamic nonlinear path planning which takes into account vehicle dynamics is proposed.

AB In the case of Autonomous Underwater Vehicle (AUV) navigating with low speed near water surface, a new method for design of roll motion controller is proposed in order to restrain wave disturbance effectively and improve roll stabilizing performance. Robust control is applied, which is based on uncertain nonlinear horizontal motion model of AUV and the principle of zero speed fin stabilizer. Feedback linearization approach is used to transform the complex nonlinear system into a comparatively simple linear system. For parameter uncertainty of motion model, the controller is designed with mixed-sensitivity method based on H-infinity robust control theory. Simulation results show better robustness improved by this control method for roll stabilizing of AUV navigating near water surface.

TI A controller design for autonomous underwater vehicle "MR-X1'' using

DT Article
AB The Independent Administrative Corporation Japan Agency for Marine-Earth Science and Technology (JAMSTEC) has been developing light-and-small autonomous underwater vehicles (AUV), named "Marine Robot Experimental 1" ("MR-X1"). In this paper, the motion control problem of "MR-X1" is considered. Since the dynamics of "MR-X1" depends upon its own speed, the problem in question becomes a non-linear control problem. A new controller design method using linear matrix inequalities (LMIs) is proposed in order to adapt the problem in question. The algorithm, which gives a solution of a linear matrix inequality (LMI), can adapt to solve numerous LMIs simultaneously. LMIs can be obtained by substituting several speeds into the dynamics of "MR-X1". The proposed controller, which can be derived from the solution of LMIs, becomes a stabilizing controller for all substituted speeds.

The control of the docking maneuver is based on a fuzzy sensor fusion strategy featuring GPS and Machine Vision (MV) data. The design for a smooth docking maneuver under the presence of wake effects is performed; desirable performances were achieved with LQR-based control laws for the docking, of the UAV to the probe-drogue refueling system.

AB This study aimed to apply a journey mapping methodology to identify travel considerations and barriers for people with disabilities (PWDs) at each travel stage, from considering a trip through to arriving at the destination for their current modes of transportation, with the objective of understanding and avoiding "pain points" during a transition to autonomous driving systems. Twenty PWDs, including those with physical, visual, aural, cognitive, and combined physical/visual impairments, participated in a semistructured one-on-one interview. Descriptive statistics were used for demographic information, and qualitative content analysis was used to analyze the transcribed interviews and extract themes. Themes were further organized by the modes of transportation used. The top four themes in considering and planning a trip were third-party assistance availability (private vehicle, public transportation, and paratransit), finding an accessible or suitable parking space (private vehicle), access to a service location (public transportation and paratransit), and transportation schedules (public transportation and paratransit). The top four travel barriers to locating, entering, riding, and exiting transportation and arriving at the destination were vehicle ingress/egress (private vehicle and public transportation), concerns about wheelchair securement (public transportation and paratransit), requiring third-party assistance (private vehicle and public transportation), and accessibility to service locations (public transportation). The study suggests that to mitigate travel considerations and barriers for PWDs, vehicle-specific barriers and infrastructure issues should be addressed simultaneously. We anticipate that the findings will provide insights into the design and development of autonomous vehicles, to better accommodate the needs of PWDs.

AB We analyze the role of product liability for the emergence and development of smart products such as autonomous vehicles (AVs). We develop, and calibrate to the U.S. car market, a dynamic model where a (monopolistic) innovator chooses safety stock investments, the timing of market introduction, and the product price. Inducing higher long-term product safety through a strict (partial) liability rule reduces short-term safety investments and slows down AV market penetration. By contrast, negligence-based liability fosters initial investments without hampering long-term product safety. However, too stringent liability might forestall investments in the development of AVs and their market introduction. (c) 2021 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB This study considers the 3D scenario where an autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) tracks an emitter while estimating the emitter's location by measuring the emitter's frequency and elevation-azimuth angle. To enhance the emitter estimation based on frequency-angle measurements, this study presents an AUV's path planner considering acceleration limits, such as the bounded turn rate. As far as the author's knowledge, the proposed path planner is novel in presenting an AUV's 3D path planner to enhance the emitter estimation based on frequency-angle measurements. The proposed 3D planner is useful in underwater target tracking, since the AUV approaches the emitter while avoiding 3D threat environments. The effectiveness of the proposed planner is verified by utilising simulations.

AB In this paper, I explore the navigational implications of a possible driving world. In the last few years, autonomous vehicles (AVs) have garnered significant attention, with much of this scrutiny centered on the technical possibilities, legal restrictions, and utilitarian ethics of AVs. In this paper, I look at how AVs are radically transforming the nature of navigational decision-making. Research into the automation of industrial processes and aircraft fly-by-wire systems suggests that navigational supervision, by humans, will become a significant duty, recalibrating navigation itself. I draw out the implications of automation through three navigational practices of the 'driving-machine' I refer to as route-calculation, terrain-optimization, and object-recognition. Attending to these practices assists in the ongoing interrogation of the machinic rendering of automobile space.

ID NETWORKS; SYSTEMS
AB Neurofuzzy modelling is ideally suited to many nonlinear system identification and data modelling applications. By combining the attractive attributes of fuzzy systems and neural networks transparent models of ill-defined systems can be identified Available expert a priori knowledge is used to construct an initial model. Data modelling techniques om the neural network, statistical and conventional system identification communities are then used to adapt these models. As a result accurate parsimonious models which are transparent and easy to validate are identified. Recent advances in the data-driven identification algorithms have now made neurofuzzy modelling appropriate for high-dimensional problems for which the expert knowledge and data may be of a poor quality.
   In this paper neurofuzzy modelling techniques are presented. This powerful approach to system identification is demonstrated by its application to the identification of an Autonomous Underwater Vehicle (AUV).

AB Environmental perception technology is the basis and premise of intelligent vehicle decision control of intelligent vehicles, a crucial link of intelligent vehicles to realize intelligence, and also the basic guarantee of its safety and intelligence. The accuracy and robustness of the perception algorithm will directly affect or even determine the realization of the upper function of intelligent vehicles. The wrong environmental perception will affect the control of the vehicle, thus causing safety risks. This paper discusses the intelligent vehicle perception technology and introduces the development status and control strategies of several important sensors such as machine vision, laser radar, and millimeter-wave radar. Target detection, target recognition, and multisensor fusion are analyzed in the optimized part of sensor results. The functions of the intelligent vehicle assistance system which has been applied to the ground at present are described, and the lane detection, adaptive cruise control (ACC), and autonomous emergency braking (AEB) are analyzed. Finally, the paper looks forward to the research direction of sense-based intelligent vehicle perception technology, which will play an important role in guiding the development of intelligent vehicles and accelerate the landing process of intelligent vehicles.

AB This paper presents the use of deep Reinforcement Learning (RL) for autonomous navigation of an Unmanned Ground Vehicle (UGV) with an onboard three-dimensional (3D) Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) sensor in off-road environments. For training, both the robotic simulator Gazebo and the Curriculum Learning paradigm are applied. Furthermore, an Actor-Critic Neural Network (NN) scheme is chosen with a suitable state and a custom reward function. To employ the 3D LiDAR data as part of the input state of the NNs, a virtual two-dimensional (2D) traversability scanner is developed. The resulting Actor NN has been successfully tested in both real and simulated experiments and favorably compared with a previous reactive navigation approach on the same UGV.

AB In an effort to pursue more advanced missions in space, improved on-board trajectory optimization and path (re)planning capabilities are necessary. Over the past decades, numerous missions have pushed the state of the art in autonomous rendezvous and proximity operations (RPOs). Regardless of the mission, any RPO guidance algorithm must be able to react to a dynamic environment while generating a fuel-efficient trajectory. An adaptive artificial potential function (AAPF) guidance exhibiting these properties has been experimentally evaluated on a spacecraft air-bearing test bed and its performance compared to traditional APF and other real-time guidance methods.

AB A system of systems (SoS) is a large-scale integrated system. In an SoS, many complex independent systems work collectively for a common mission. Modeling of SoS is challenging due to their large-scale and complexity of the constituent systems. In this paper, generic modeling of a class of SoS, namely mechatronic systems, is proposed based on bond graph modeling approach. Bond graph modeling enables to develop a unified model of SoS, which combines the behavioral and the organizational modeling approaches of SoS. The proposed approach for SoS modeling is applied to intelligent transportation system, where road traffic dynamic in a platoon of intelligent autonomous vehicles (IAVs) is considered for modeling. Finally, the developed bond graph model is simulated for a platoon of four IAVs forming SoS.

We address the problem by using an unsupervised learning algorithm to generate a sparse graph representing the topological structure of the environment and use it for planning paths in 3D spaces. We propose GNGraph, an integrated solution combining the Growing Neural Gas algorithm to generate the sparse graph, a stop criterion to guarantee the graph's connectivity and a collision check to assess the edges and nodes validity. The proposed solution has been tested on simulated and real environment maps, and compared against a state-of-the-art graph planning algorithm among other global planning methods.

AB With the development of multi-autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) cooperative systems, the evaluation of their reliability is becoming more and more important. Since AUVs are always in motion, the reliability of the system is not stationary, but it varies with time. This paper studies the time-varying reliability evaluation indexes for multi-AUV cooperative systems. Aimed at elucidating the characteristics of the system, by considering the motion of the AUVs, two time dependent reliability evaluation indexes, natural connectivity and all-terminal reliability of the basic reliability indexes, are determined with the graph theory. Then the time-varying reliability of multi-AUV cooperative systems is evaluated combining with an actual example. This paper provides a method to evaluate the time-varying reliability of multi-AUV cooperative systems.

AB This paper addresses the problem of enabling a group of autonomous vehicles to effectively patrol an environment significantly larger than their communication and sensing radii. Our formulation uses an a priori spatial decomposition of the environment into smaller areas in order to provide a framework for the allocation of vehicles to different parts of the environment. We develop a distributed cooperative control algorithm that transfers vehicles between these areas based on only local information and prove that it achieves the proper environment-wide distribution of vehicles within a finite time interval. Various applications are discussed and simulations are included to illustrate convergence dynamics as well as to quantify practical performance as a function of problem parameters.

ID REGISTRATION
AB We present a perception system for enabling automated loading with waist-articulated wheel loaders. To enable autonomous loading of piled materials, using either above-ground wheel loaders or underground load-haul-dump vehicles, 3D data of the pile shape is needed. However, using common 3D scanners, the scan data is distorted while the wheel loader is moving towards the pile. Existing methods that make use of 3D scan data (for autonomous loading as well as tasks such as mapping, localisation, and object detection) typically assume that each 3D scan is accurate. For autonomous robots moving over rough terrain, it is often the case that the vehicle moves a substantial amount during the acquisition of one 3D scan, in which case the scan data will be distorted. We present a study of auto-loading methods, and how to locate piles in real-world scenarios with nontrivial ground geometry. We have compared how consistently each method performs for live scans acquired in motion, and also how the methods perform with different view points and scan configurations. The system described in this paper uses a novel method for improving the quality of distorted 3D scans made from a vehicle moving over uneven terrain. The proposed method for improving scan quality is capable of increasing the accuracy of point clouds without assuming any specific features of the environment (such as planar walls), without resorting to a "stop-scan-go" approach, and without relying on specialised and expensive hardware. Each new 3D scan is registered to the preceding using the normal-distributions transform (NDT). After each registration, a mini-loop closure is performed with a local, per-scan, graph-based SLAM method. To verify the impact of the quality improvement, we present data that shows how auto-loading methods benefit from the corrected scans. The presented methods are validated on data from an autonomous wheel loader, as well as with simulated data. The proposed scan-correction method increases the accuracy of both the vehicle trajectory and the point cloud. We also show that it increases the reliability of pile-shape measures used to plan an efficient attack pose when performing autonomous loading.

AB Successful exchanges of cooperative awareness messages (CAMs) among neighboring vehicles are essential in the intelligent transportation system (ITS) to ensure safe autonomous driving. Especially in cellular vehicle-to-everything (C-V2X) mode-4, where the resource allocation process in the vehicles is autonomous without centralized control, efficient resource selection to minimize collisions is necessary to enhance the CAM delivery ratio (CDR). In this paper, we propose an enhanced operation of LTE C-V2X mode-4 by using virtual cells (VCs) with orthogonal resource allocation, extended master information block (EMIB) with a resource usage bitmap (RuBMP), and smart roaming in the virtual cell boundary. We propose a virtual cell manager (VCM) that monitors resource usage via CAM broadcasts from vehicles, configures the RuBMP to show the overall resource block usage, includes it in EMIB messages, and broadcasts the EMIB every 10ms. The periodic broadcast of the EMIB with the RuBMP enables vehicles to avoid selection of resources currently used by other vehicles, and minimizes collisions during CAM broadcasts. Smart roaming enables seamless, successful CAM broadcasts even at the boundary of virtual cells where resources (subchannels and subframes) must be re-selected based on the state of the next virtual cell. The analytical model of the proposed scheme (including successful CDR) is provided, and the performances are analyzed with NS-3 simulations for overlapped virtual cells in metropolitan areas with high densities of vehicles. The proposed scheme shows a 99.2% (or more) successful CAM delivery ratio for overlapped cells with up to 400 vehicles per virtual cell using four LTE sidelink subchannels.

AB Autonomous Underwater Vehicles (AUVs) have been focused on by research efforts because of their extensive applications in scientific, commercial as well as military fields. However, due to the complexity of underwater environments, AUV navigation remains a challenging problem. This review first presents a comprehensive description of the three classical techniques of AUV navigation, i.e., Dead Reckoning, Signal-Based Navigation, and Map-Matching Navigation. In what follows, an in-depth survey of Integrated Navigation is given. Furthermore, a thorough discussion on Cooperative Navigation is also detailed along with an analysis of its capabilities and limitations. Finally, recent significant challenges of AUV navigation and further research directions are summarized.

AB Classification of aerial imagery is essential for water channel surveillance and waterfront land cover characterization. It is also beneficial to long-duration collaborative autonomous navigation of both unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) and autonomous surface vehicles (ASVs) to fulfill unmanned hydrologic data collection, environmental inspection, and disaster warning tasks. Deep semantic segmentation networks trained on aerial imagery have shown great results, however, they require finely labeled data. Existing aerial image datasets contain mostly urban scenes or fluvial images taken from ground level or collected from the Internet, there are no datasets that incorporate aerial and fluvial scenes with detailed annotation from different perspectives or include waterborne obstacles. To tackle this problem, aerial fluvial image dataset (AFID) is presented with multiple camera perspectives of fluvial scenes and is semantically labeled with emphasis on water and waterborne obstacles. Deep neural networks for binary (water and nonwater) semantic segmentation, with 12 different combinations of five encoders and three decoding architectures, are trained and tested in a curriculum learning scheme. Model performance is benchmarked on AFID, and the accuracy-efficiency tradeoff is discussed with the conclusion that the Unet architecture with a mix transformer encoder achieves the best segmentation performance with moderate computational consumption. The AFID dataset is publicly available to facilitate future work on developing new lightweight semantic segmentation models. Our immediate future plan will focus on the coordination of air and surface-water autonomous systems for navigable water detection and obstacle avoidance in high-risk challenging environments.

AB With the rapid growth of express delivery in urban areas, the use of driverless vehicles as an alternative to traditional human delivery can reduce costs and improve efficiency. The route planning of driverless vehicles is crucial in realizing autonomous navigation, which improves the working level and ensures improvements in efficiency. However, it is difficult to reasonably organize the real-time delivery, taking into account several factors that influence the planning of routes, such as load capabilities, power limits and traffic conditions. To deal with this concern, we propose an integrated approach including a multistage model and improved genetic algorithm to obtain the optimal delivery plan for driverless vehicles. The experimental results in an urban scenario with a realistic delivery service show the superiority of our proposition in the delivery efficiency.

Robotic vehicles are essential for exploring vast deep-ocean resources, spatiotemporal monitoring of oceans to understand the patterns of climate change, monitoring marine pollution, providing defense, and identifying assets lost in the oceans. The article discusses key design considerations for realizing safe, reliable, and efficient deep-ocean unmanned and manned robotic vehicles capable of operating in challenging environments characterized by high hydrostatic pressure, low temperature, salinity, darkness, dynamic medium, and soft seabed conditions. Strategic technologies to enable cost-effective and increased spatiotemporal monitoring including homing and docking stations, autonomous intervention vehicles, swarm robotic systems, and bio-inspired vehicle designs are discussed.

AB Landmark navigation is a common positioning method for material handling vehicles operating in industrial environments. The position is calculated based on relative measurements to landmarks, the locations of which are known in advance. This paper analyzes the sensitivity of absolute positioning techniques to noisy data and landmark configuration, aiming to determine landmark positioning guidelines to improve the accuracy of the material handling vehicle's navigation. An error sensitivity map (ESM) shows the critical zones where calculation is especially susceptible to erroneous data. These zones are then combined with the accuracy required by the operational constraints to determine the preferred landmarks' configuration. Results of analytical and simulated tests and their effect on the vehicle's dynamic performance are presented. Finally, an example that incorporates the analysis results is presented.

AB Autonomous electric vehicles (AEVs) will become an inevitable trend in the future transportation network and have an important impact on the power grid. It is difficult to find the optimal distributed charging solution for AEVs to minimize the system cost with some uncertainties. In this paper, we investigate an AEVs charging and discharging problem with vehicle-to-grid (V2G) services. We aim to minimize the total electricity cost and battery degradation cost of AEVs and charging station batteries with V2G services, which takes the random arrival and departure of AEVs into account. We first propose a distributed charging framework of AEVs and charging stations by clustering method with the constraint of limited AEVs for each charging station in a region and formulate a distributed offline optimization problem. Then we formulate a distributed online charging optimization problem and propose a distributed online AEV charging scheduling (DOAS) algorithm to get an optimal charging solution. To study a more practical case, we reformulate the distributed online optimization problem with the uncertainties from base loads, renewable energy and charging demands. Furthermore, to improve the time efficiency of DOAS algorithm, we reduce the dimension of the distributed problem and design a dimension-reduction DOAS (DDOAS) algorithm. To seek a robust solution with some uncertainties, we propose a DDOAS algorithm with DRO based on Wasserstein distance (DDODW). Simulation results show that DOAS and DDOAS algorithms can have a close-to-optimal charging cost and a significantly less battery degradation cost of charging stations, compared with centralized online charging scheduling algorithm and DDOAS algorithm is more time-efficient than DOAS algorithm. The proposed DDODW algorithm can provide a robust solution for the energy schedule

AB The transport policy discourse posits Shared Autonomous Vehicles (SAVs) as a more sustainable solution for the implementation of road automation technology. A successful implementation of SAV services strongly depends on being able to meet user's needs, as well as responding to their expectations. For this reason, the public has a central role in the definition of appropriate and realistic policies for the design, regulation and adoption of new automated mobility services. However, whilst there has been considerable attention to individuals' attitudes towards road transport automation, few have applied participatory or co-design methods to help define new SAV services. Moreover, most of the existing studies have also been hypothetical rather than examining vehicles in real service settings. This paper addresses these imbalances through reporting a two-stage research initiative. Initially a local shared automated vehicle service (LSAVS) concept was examined in a co-design workshop (Stage 1), leading to the development of a conceptual framework for social acceptance. This was then applied (Stage 2) in qualitative empirical research into the experiences of participants who rode in two different live prototype LSAVS. It was found that social considerations such as equity in access to mobility services, social inclusion, environmental protection, and concerns about control over interpersonal interactions emerged as strong acceptance factors within participants' construction of the conceptual services and responses to exposure to actual services. However, broad socio-political aspirations beyond transport policy were also important. It is concluded that achieving high levels of social acceptance where these utopian expectations meet commercial realities and public-sector constraints will be a major policy challenge facing any attempt to introduce an LSAVS with strong sustainable mobility credentials.

SO TURKISH JOURNAL OF ELECTRICAL ENGINEERING AND COMPUTER SCIENCES

DT Article
DE Traffic simulation system; agent modeling; scene graphs
AB In this study, a traffic simulation system (TSS) to provide novice driver candidates with opportunities for training and testing has been developed. Autonomous vehicles that follow the flow of traffic in a microsimulation environment were prepared using a hierarchical concurrent state machine. Autonomous vehicles are skilled and have behavioral aspects such as tracking the lanes, following the vehicles, complying with traffic rules, decelerating, accelerating, and intersection crossings. These driver behaviors are parameterized to allow the autonomous agents to act while disregarding the rules (i.e. aggressive behaviors) or behaving normally. The TSS is operated in 3 different modes, namely the orientation, training, and testing modes. During the orientation phase, the candidate driver's target is to get used to the system and the vehicle, along with traffic rules in city conditions. During training, the driver is warned orally (when necessary) and given written handouts about the mistakes that occurred during the training session. The rules to be obeyed in traffic are kept in an XML file in the system and the data are used to follow the driver's behaviors. During the testing phase, an evaluation mechanism is employed. It observes whether the drivers obey or disregard the rules during the testing time interval. At the end of the test drive, a report showing the driver's mistakes is given. The reports and test results can be recorded in the database with the drivers' names for further analysis and evaluation processes. Driver candidates perform the driving using a steering wheel and pedals, along with a screen platform consisting of 3 monitors. With the TSS user interface, parameterized items such as vehicle selection, the crowdedness of the traffic, the timing of the traffic lights, and the determination of air conditions are possible. The system provides a cheap, affordable, and nonrisky platform for the trainees. Test results show that the system improves the drivers' skills and builds trust in them.

AB In order to solve the problems of rapid path planning and effective obstacle avoidance for autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) in 2D underwater environment, this paper proposes a path planning algorithm based on reinforcement learning mechanism and particle swarm optimization (RMPSO). A feedback mechanism of reinforcement learning is embedded into the particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm by using the proposed RMPSO to improve the convergence speed and adaptive ability of the PSO. Then, the RMPSO integrates the velocity synthesis method with the Bezier curve to eliminate the influence of ocean currents and save energy for AUV. Finally, the path is developed rapidly and obstacles are avoided effectively by using the RMPSO. Simulation and experiment results show the superiority of the proposed method compared with traditional methods.

AB Path planning plays an important role in the motion of autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs). It has always been a hot research topic. Aiming at the problems of traditional particle swarm optimization (PSO) in path planning, an improved PSO algorithm is proposed in this paper. In the initialization stage, the particles are initialized by a chaotic sequence. During algorithm processing, the sine function is used to dynamically decrease the particle weight. In the region near the optimal solution selected in each iteration of the PSO algorithm, a chaos algorithm is used to avoid falling into the local optimal value. Simulation experiment results show that the improved PSO algorithm greatly increases the effectiveness of the initial particles and can get the optimal path more quickly and accurately.

ID SYSTEM-IDENTIFICATION; CONTROL DESIGN
AB Complex engineering systems are usually described by the interaction of several agents and characterized by highly nonlinear dynamics. Control of multivariable nonlinear systems is a widely explored topic, and many different studies have been presented in the scientific literature. However, most of the existing methods strongly rely upon an accurate model of the system, which is generally costly and/or hard to undertake in practice. In this work, we propose a multivariable extension of the data-driven inversion-based control (D-2-IBC) method, where a model of the system is derived from data and considered relevant or not, based only on its weight on the final control performance. This method will prove its effectiveness on a challenging application: the stability control of a four-wheel steering autonomous vehicle.

A cascade control design incorporating a current control, cylinder position control and velocity control is proposed. The cylinder position controller uses a set of gain scheduled lag compensators in series with a sequence of segmented deadzone inversions. The deadzone inversions compensate for nonlinear valve dynamics. The velocity controller consists of a digital feedback control. A stability analysis of the closed loop system is performed. Experimental results from a self-propelled windrower are used to demonstrate the effectiveness of the control system. (c) 2004 Elsevier B.V: All rights reserved.

AB A vertically arranged twin-pod autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) is presently under development in St. John's Newfoundland. A large separation of the centre of gravity (CG) and the centre of buoyancy (CB) can be achieved by placing heavy batteries and payloads in the lower pod and placing the light controller and communication electronics on the upper pod. With the large vertical separation between CG and CB the twin-pod vehicle becomes highly stable in pitch and roll and thus provides an ideal platform for obtaining photos, video and sonar images of the seabed. This paper presents the vehicle motion simulations that have been done in support of this novel AUV design and development.

First, we present maneuvering kinematics and vehicle dynamics in a unified framework. Based on H(infinity) loop-shaping procedure, the 2-DOF autopilot controller has been presented to enhance stability and path tracking. By use of model reduction, the high-order control system is reduced to one with reasonable order, and further the scaled low-order controller has been analyzed in both the frequency and the time domains. Finally, it is shown that the autopilot control system provides robust performance and stability against prescribed levels of uncertainty.

AB Automotive-Industry 5.0 will use Beyond Fifth-Generation (B5G) communications to provide robust, abundant computation resources and energy-efficient data sharing among various Intelligent Transportation System (ITS) entities. Based on the vehicle communication network, the Internet of Vehicles (IoV) is created, where vehicles' resources, including processing, storage, sensing, and communication units, can be leveraged to construct Vehicular Cloudlet (VC) to realize resource sharing. As Connected and Autonomous Vehicles (CAV) onboard computing is becoming more potent, VC resources (comprising stationary and moving vehicles' idle resources) seems a promising solution to tackle the incessant computing requirements of vehicles. Furthermore, such spare computing resources can significantly reduce task requests' delay and transmission costs. In order to maximize the utility of task requests in the system under the maximum time constraint, this paper proposes a Secondary Resource Allocation (SRA) mechanism based on a dual time scale. The request service process is regarded as M/ M/1 queuing model and considers each task request in the same time slot as an agent. A Partially Observable Markov Decision Process (POMDP) is constructed and combined with the Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) algorithm known as QMix, which exploits the overall vehicle state and queue state to reach effective computing resource allocation decisions. There are two main performance metrics: the system's total utility and task completion rate. Simulation results reveal that the task completion rate is increased by 13%. Furthermore, compared with the deep deterministic policy optimization method, our proposed algorithm can improve the overall utility value by 70% and the task completion rate by 6%. & COPY; 2022 The Author(s).

ID ALLOCATION
AB Complementary filtering is a frequency based method used to design data processing algorithms exploiting signals with complementary spectra. The technique is mostly used in sensor fusion architectures, but it may also be effective in the design of state estimators. In spite of its potential in several areas of robotics, the complementary filtering paradigm is poorly used as compared to alternative time domain methods. The first part of the paper aims at reviewing the basics of complementary filtering in sensor data processing and linear systems state estimation. The second part of the paper describes how to exploit the main ideas of complementary filtering to design a depth controller for an actuator redundant autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV). Unlike with alternative state space methods commonly used to address the design of control solutions for actuator redundant systems, the proposed approach allows to fully exploit the knowledge of frequency characteristics of actuators. Simulation results are reported to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed solution.

AB The Venturer project is trialling an autonomous vehicle (AV) in the context of use on urban roads. This paper summarises a literature review undertaken to assist in developing a research agenda for the trialling. The first contribution of the paper is a framework of four use scenarios for AVs as follows: (1) fully segregated AV network, (2) motorway or expressway network, (3) typical urban network, (4) shared space. The paper then focuses on a review of the social interactions in the street environment and discusses issues concerning human behaviour in relation to autonomy. The second contribution of the paper is a set of research questions for AV trialling in relation to other road users, including, pedestrians and cyclists, which have emerged from the literature review.

AB This paper studies an optimal control problem for a string of vehicles with safety requirements and finite-time specifications on the approach time to a target region. Our problem formulation is motivated by scenarios involving autonomous vehicles circulating on arterial roads with intelligent management at traffic intersections. We propose a provably correct distributed control algorithm that ensures that the vehicles satisfy the finite-time specifications under speed limits, acceleration saturation, and safety requirements. The safety specifications are such that collisions can be avoided even in cases of communication failure. We also discuss how the proposed distributed algorithm can be integrated with an intelligent intersection manager to provide information about the feasible approach times of the vehicle string and a guaranteed bound of its time of occupancy of the intersection. Our simulation study illustrates the algorithm and its properties regarding approach time, occupancy time, and fuel and time cost.

AB Potential conflict situations between vehicles in the presence of obstacles are addressed by a decentralized approach imposing sense constraints, i.e., requiring that the vehicles circumvent an obstacle in a predetermined sense: either clockwise or counterclockwise. Model Predictive Control is used to plan trajectories using binary decision variables. In order to do that, a novel scheme to choose the feasible regions is proposed, and then obstacle avoidance constraints are encoded using tuples of binary decision variables. Sense constraints arise naturally as an extension of the proposed encoding scheme, allowing for decentralized planning, given that the vehicles agree on the required sense of circumvention. Simulation results are used to illustrate the benefits of

ID LEADER-FOLLOWER FORMATION
AB The paper presents a neural control system for a swarm of underwater vehicles. A swarm consists of a leader vehicle and follower vehicles. The leader leads the swarm along a predetermined trajectory, detects obstacles and determines obstacle avoidance manoeuvrers for the whole swarm, while the followers follow the leader in a specific formation and avoid the leader and each other. In order to keep the formation without colliding with other members of the swarm, the followers are equipped with a neural control system designed with a neuro-evolutionary algorithm called Hill Climb Assembler Encoding. The system is fed with three sources of information. The first is the leader which, using an acoustic communication system, sends information about its manoeuvrers as well as about the desired type of formation. The second source is sonar, i.e. underwater acoustic radar, whose disadvantage is the difficulty in interpreting the results of operation, i.e. it is difficult to determine whether the observed object is another vehicle or an obstacle. The third source is a camera observation unit consisting of three cameras located around the vehicle. Unfortunately, the disadvantage of this unit is a very short range in opaque water. The proposed control system was tested in simulation conditions and proved to be highly effective. The results of the simulation as well as the design of the system are presented in the paper.& COPY; 2023 The Author(s). Published by Elsevier B.V.

ID HYBRID SYSTEMS; VERIFICATION
AB This article presents a scalable approach for identifying system inputs and trajectories that lead to undesirable scenarios in a cyber-physical system (CPS). The proposed approach falls under the broad class of falsification methods. The objective in falsification is to find initial conditions and input signals resulting in trajectories that violate a system property expressed as a formal specification. The existing falsification methods are not suitable for handling systems where the input at a specific time depends on the state history of the system. Autonomous vehicle platoons and certain multi-agent systems that are required to maintain connectivity are some examples of such systems. In the first part of this article, we employ a graph-search-based motion planning algorithm to develop a falsification method capable of identifying falsifying inputs for the aforementioned class of systems. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the approach through a case study involving a vehicle platoon consisting of three autonomous vehicles, wherein one of the vehicles is tasked to execute a lane-change maneuver. In the second part, we extend the proposed approach to analyze a network of three unmanned underwater vehicles, wherein our objective is to identify system inputs resulting in trajectories that lead to a deadlock. The approach leverages the component-based structure inherent in the considered multi-agent system and employs a surrogate model in place of computationally demanding components present in the system. These modifications are shown to improve the scalability of the approach and reduce the computational time in finding falsifying trajectories.

AB For safe and efficient navigation of heterogeneous multiple mobile robots (HMRs), it is essential to incorporate dynamics (mass and inertia) in motion control algorithms. Many methods rely only on kinematics or point-mass models, resulting in conservative results or occasionally failure. This is especially true for robots with different masses. In this article, we develop a novel navigation methodology for a distributed scheme by incorporating the robots' dynamics through calculating the time to collision (TTC) and designing a new controller accordingly that avoids collisions. We first propose a new predictive collision term by TTC that will be used to quantify imminent collisions among HMRs. Subsequently, using this term, we develop a novel nonlinear controller that explicitly incorporates TTC in the design and guarantees collision-free motion. Simulations and experiments were performed to demonstrate the effectiveness of the developed methods. We first compared the results of our proposed approach with controllers that only consider the robots' kinematics. It was shown that the proposed control strategy (a TTC-based controller) proves to be less conservative when determining safe motions. Specifically, for environments with limited space, it was demonstrated that using robots' kinematics may result in a collision, while our strategy results in safe motion. We also performed experiments that proved collision-free navigation of HMRs with this approach. The outcomes of this work provide more reliable motion control for HMRs, especially when the robots' masses or inertias are significantly different, for example, warehouses. The developments in this work are also applicable to vehicles and can therefore be beneficial in automated collision avoidance in autonomous driving and intelligent transportation.

AB Reliability-based global path planning incorporates reliability constraints into path planning to ensure that off-road autonomous ground vehicles can operate reliably in uncertain off-road environments. Current two-stage reliability-based path planning methods involve separate stages for surrogate modeling of mobility prediction and global path planning, resulting in a large number of unnecessary mobility simulations that makes the approaches computationally expensive. To tackle this challenge, this work proposes a novel efficient reliability-based global path planning approach, named ER-RRT*, which couples adaptive surrogate modeling with the rapidly-exploring random tree star (RRT*) algorithm. Firstly, a surrogate model for vehicle mobility prediction is used to guide the exploration of random trees subject to a mobility reliability constraint. Subsequently, the exploration trees and reliability assessment are employed to inform mobility simulations for the surrogate model refinement. These steps are implemented iteratively and thereby drastically reducing the required mobility simulations for path planning through the integration of adaptive surrogate modeling with global path planning. With a focus on the uncertainty in the slope map and soil properties of deformable terrain, we demonstrate ER-RRT* using a case study and compare it with the current two-stage approach. The results show that ER-RRT* is much more efficient than the current method in both computational time and the required number of mobility simulations for surrogate model construction. In addition, the path identified by ER-RRT* exhibits a comparable cost in distance to its counterpart obtained using the two-stage method.

AB This paper proposes a simulation framework that quantitatively assesses the direct and indirect effects of connected and autonomous vehicles (CAVs) on a supply chain system by varying the levels of CAV market penetration and driverless truck adoption. To quantify CAV effects on transportation network, this paper first collects secondary data and adopts simulation parameters and equations from existing literature. The results from transportation analysis are then incorporated into supply chain analysis to evaluate how CAVs would change supply chain performance measured by total travel time, greenhouse gas emissions, and supply chain cost. As the performance of supply chain systems involving perishable or semi-perishable products is highly sensitive to CAV market penetration rate and driverless truck adoption rate mainly because of reduced travel time, this paper uses fresh potato supply chain systems as an illustrative example. The case study results indicate that CAVs can greatly improve supply chain performance directly and indirectly by decreasing total travel time and supply chain costs, whereas emissions are reduced primarily through the adoption of driverless trucks in the supply chain system. The effect of CAVs on supply chain performance becomes even greater when commodities travel longer distances. This study will allow supply chain managers (and grocery delivery companies) to better understand how supply chain design and operation could be transformed and reoptimized in response to the introduction of CAV technologies. The research outcomes would help them better utilize the opportunities and address possible challenges that may arise as a result of CAVs.

AB The proposed autonomous hybrid charging station in this paper is energized by a photovoltaic (PV) system, which should provide electric vehicles (EVs), and water electrolyzer (WE) with electricity. The WE operates by using electricity to produce and store hydrogen to feed hydrogen vehicles (HVs). Moreover, a fuel cell (FC) is allocated to the system, which uses the stored hydrogen to regenerate electricity the PV system is beyond reach. A supplementary diesel generator is also installed in the charging station to avoid power shortage as a conservative measurement. The hydrogen and electric demand of the station is accompanied by uncertainties, which should be taken into account in designing the charging station. Therefore, information-gap decision theory (IGDT) is employed to deal with the uncertainties. This approach provides the investor with three different strategies of risk-averse strategy (RAS), risk-neutral strategy (RNS), and risk-seeker strategy (RSS), which can help the investor with making a better decision. The outcome of the simulation proved that in RAS if the investor decides to invest 13.9% more capital, based on the robustness function, the charging station withstands the 9.6% deviation of uncertain parameters' fraction error. However, should the investor decide to take risks in the construction of the charging station, by paying 13.9% less, the system is 10.7% fragile to the information-gap of uncertainties. Besides, the rated power of the PV system reaches from 1612 kW in RNS to 1731 kW in RAS while it decreased to 1479 kW in RSS. (C) 2020 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB The aim of this study was to develop trajectory planning that would allow an autonomous racing car to be driven as close as possible to what a driver would do, defining the most appropriate inputs for the current scenario. The search for the optimal trajectory in terms of lap time reduction involves the modeling of all the non-linearities of the vehicle dynamics with the disadvantage of being a time-consuming problem and not being able to be implemented in real-time. However, to improve the vehicle performances, the trajectory needs to be optimized online with the knowledge of the actual vehicle dynamics and path conditions. Therefore, this study involved the development of an architecture that allows an autonomous racing car to have an optimal online trajectory planning and path tracking ensuring professional driver performances. The real-time trajectory optimization can also ensure a possible future implementation in the urban area where obstacles and dynamic scenarios could be faced. It was chosen to implement a local trajectory planning based on the Model Predictive Control (MPC) logic and solved as Linear Programming (LP) by Sequential Convex Programming (SCP). The idea was to achieve a computational cost, 0.1 s, using a point mass vehicle model constrained by experimental definition and approximation of the car's GG-V, and developing an optimum model-based path tracking to define the driver model that allows A car to follow the trajectory defined by the planner ensuring a signal input every 0.001 s. To validate the algorithm, two types of tests were carried out: a Matlab-Simulink, Vi-Grade co-simulation test, comparing the proposed algorithm with the performance of an offline motion planning, and a real-time simulator test, comparing the proposed algorithm with the performance of a professional driver. The results obtained showed that the computational cost of the optimization algorithm developed is below the limit of 0.1 s, and the architecture showed a reduction of the lap time of about 1 s compared to the offline optimizer and reproducibility of the performance obtained by the driver.

ID ELECTRIC VEHICLES
AB For connected and autonomous electric vehicles (CAEVs), drivers must choose a power-efficient route because the energy source of a CAEV is a battery. The driver can find the power-efficient route and reduce the risk of the battery running out if the CAEV navigation system can accurately predict the battery's state of charge (SOC) based on the power consumption prediction for the selected route. As the driver's driving pattern and the vehicle's battery capacity are different for individual vehicles, it is important to predict the power consumption and battery SOC for the selected route. In this paper, the system model of CAEV to collect on-board diagnostics (OBD), OBD data cloud (ODC) to manage the OBD data, and the sequence of message exchange between them is proposed. Further, we propose an algorithm that can learn power consumption based on machine learning (ML) in the ODC. It predicts the battery SOC at the end of a trip using the current SOC when the onboard navigation system requests prediction for a specific route of the CAEV. The algorithm's performance has been evaluated by the OBD dataset of personal vehicles collected in Michigan based on three road types: downtown, urban road, and highway. The results confirmed that the proposed MLR+DNN model could predict battery consumption with an average accuracy of 92%. Additionally, an average accuracy of 94% was obtained in selecting the most similar personal driving cycle (PDC) using hierarchical grey relational analysis (GRA), which is about 15% higher than the accuracy obtained by using the dynamic time warping (DTW) method.

AB The autonomous vehicles (AVs) need to share the driving environment with the human driving vehicles (HDVs) on expressway in the future. The non-humanlike lane changing (LC) behavior of AVs can mislead human drivers, which brings potential risks. Stronger humanlike ability requires a more complex algorithm. However, the requirement of the on-board vehicle computation resources limits the humanlike ability of LC algorithms. In this context, considering environmental risks, driver speed requirements and driver focus shifting process, this paper proposes a new type of LC algorithm based on artificial potential field (APF) aiming to improve the humanlike ability. The coupling relationship between the longitudinal and the lateral potential field forces is analyzed theoretically based on environmental risk APF. Based on the relationship, we proposed a conversion mechanism of the driver between the lateral and longitudinal potential field forces to mimic the driver's speed requirement. Then a target lane selection strategy is designed to trade-off the driver's speed requirement and safety between multiple lanes. Finally, to mimic the driver's focus transfer process, the lateral forces of the ego vehicle are analyzed theoretically to further propose a moving virtual lane lines algorithm to build the lateral space varying potential field. The algorithm proposed in this paper is validated by comparing with other LC algorithms in the real traffic scenarios. The results indicate that the proposed algorithm has a better ability to mimic human driver's LC decision-making and provides a smoother and safer humanlike trajectory.

ID MECHANICS; TELEOSTEI; BOXFISHES
AB Recent developments in the design and propulsion of biomimetic autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) have focused on boxfish as models (e. g. Deng and Avadhanula 2005 Biomimetic micro underwater vehicle with oscillating fin propulsion: system design and force measurement Proc. 2005 IEEE Int. Conf. Robot. Auto. (Barcelona, Spain) pp 3312 - 7). Whilst such vehicles have many potential advantages in operating in complex environments (e. g. high manoeuvrability and stability), limited battery life and payload capacity are likely functional disadvantages. Boxfish employ undulatory median and paired fins during routine swimming which are characterized by high hydromechanical Froude efficiencies (approximate to 0.9) at low forward speeds. Current boxfish- inspired vehicles are propelled by a low aspect ratio, ' plate- like' caudal fin (ostraciiform tail) which can be shown to operate at a relatively low maximum Froude efficiency (approximate to 0.5) and is mainly employed as a rudder for steering and in rapid swimming bouts (e. g. escape responses). Given this and the fact that bioinspired engineering designs are not obligated to wholly duplicate a biological model, computer chips were developed using a multilayer perception neural network model of undulatory fin propulsion in the knifefish Xenomystus nigri that would potentially allow an AUV to achieve high optimum values of propulsive efficiency at any given forward velocity, giving a minimum energy drain on the battery. We envisage that externally monitored information on flow velocity (sensory system) would be conveyed to the chips residing in the vehicle's control unit, which in turn would signal the locomotor unit to adopt kinematics (e. g. fin frequency, amplitude) associated with optimal propulsion efficiency. Power savings could protract vehicle operational life and/ or provide more power to other functions (e. g. communications).

First, we propose spline- and bidirectional-search-based hybrid A* using G(2) continuous motion primitives with multiple turning radii depending on cubic Bezier curves. In addition, we present a heuristic applying the vector field histogram to find a path around narrow passages with efficiency rather than optimization. We demonstrate the benefits of our method through simulations and experimental results using an autonomous ground vehicle in environments with narrow passages.

AB This paper proposes a reactive obstacle avoidance approach based solely on image data from a monocular camera stream. By clustering and analyzing the optical flow, this approach is able to identify potential collisions with dynamic obstacles. Epipolar geometry is exploited to derive velocity commands that ensure a collision-free path for a highly maneu-verable autonomous vehicle via a real-time optimizer. First, the underlying image processing and optimization principles are explained in detail, before simulation results show the general feasibility of the approach. Finally, real-world tests with the ROboMObil, the German Aerospace Center's robotic electric vehicle, are provided to demonstrate its applicability.

AB In a platoon-based vehicular cyber-physical system (VCPS), the traffic capacity and the fuel efficiency can be significantly improved by maintaining a small inter-vehicle distance (IVD). Meanwhile, the vehicle-to-infrastructure (V2I) communications provided by the roadside unit (RSU) are important for promoting the development of autonomous vehicles and reshaping the driving experience. However, as maintaining a small IVD inside the platoon may result in severe inter-beam interference, there is a tradeoff between the traffic capacity and the communication efficiency. In this paper, we formulate an optimization problem to minimize the IVD (a.k.a spacing) under the V2I quality-of-service (QoS) requirements by jointly controlling the transmit power, the beamwidth, and the IVD in a platoon-based VCPS. The traffic and channel uncertainties significantly complicate the analytical characterization of the impact of IVD, transmit power, and beamwidth on the QoS requirements. To solve the intractable challenging problem and capture the inherent timescale difference between the communication and vehicular systems, we propose a novel data-driven two-timescale reinforcement learning framework to control the beamforming and the spacing of the platoon at two timescales. With elaborately designed state, action, and reward, we develop a soft actor-critic based two-timescale deep reinforcement learning (DRL) algorithm to learn an effective policy for the control-communication co-design problem. Simulation results validate the effectiveness of spacing control and show that the proposed two-timescale DRL algorithm can significantly improve the traffic capacity and reduce the air drag coefficient while satisfying the QoS requirements of V2I communications.

AB Unmanned system has become more and more popular as it can adapt to diverse environments and has prospective applications. Especially, the coordination among heterogeneous vehicles is capable of completing complicated tasks, which is often beyond the ability of homogeneous vehicles. In this paper, the underwater target strike mission is concentrated, and the mission is completed by the coordination between a UAAV and an AUV. UAAV and AUV are deployed in this mission because UAAV has strong search ability in air and can communicate with AUV directly after it dives into water. Firstly, to decompose the problem, the mission is divided into two phases, i.e., single flying of UAAV and underwater coordination between UAAV and AUV. In the coordinated path planning model, the motion of vehicles, the constraints in different media and the optimization index in each phase are all formulated into mathematical forms. Based on the particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm, the collocation points are used to determine the locations of control variables. Those points can reduce the computation load and improve the solution quality, and they are distributed by height and moment according to the forms of constraints in each phase. Besides, the strategy of addressing infeasible solutions is generated to guarantee the normal operation of PSO-based algorithm. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed two-phase coordinated path planning method can generate coordinated paths, and the obtained results is very close to the optimal solution in theory. Compared to the whole method, the two-phase method can better deal with the complicated constraints in each phase.

ID SOLUTION SEPARATION; NAVIGATION; SYSTEMS
AB Autonomous vehicles require a real-time positioning system with in-lane accuracy. They also require an autonomous onboard integrity monitoring (IM) technique to verify the estimated positions at a pre-defined probability. This can be computationally demanding. PPP-RTK is a promising positioning technique that can serve this purpose. Since PPP-RTK is developed to process undifferenced and uncombined (UDUC) observations for both network and user sides, it provides the residuals of the individual measurements. This can be exploited to reduce the computational load consumed in the fault detection and exclusion (FDE) process, included in the IM task, without compromising the positioning availability. This research proposes filtering the faulty satellites by the network, then the hardware and location-dependent faults at the user end can be identified. This is achieved by calculating the ratio between the matching UDUC residuals of the user receiver and the nearest reference station observations. This ratio is used to rank the individual observations where the observation with the largest ratio is most likely to be the faulty one. Therefore, it is more likely to identify the faulty observation without generating and testing numerous subsets. In addition, the exclusion can be attempted per observation, which preserves observation availability, unlike the grouping techniques that perform the exclusion per satellite. The method was examined in two test cases where geodetic and commercial receivers were used. Results show that the computational load has been reduced significantly by about 85-99% compared to the solution separation and Chi-squared test methods that are commonly used for FDE.

ID AUTOMATED VEHICLES; MOBILITY; DEMAND
AB This article seeks to clarify how autonomous vehicles (AV) could affect urban planning and the built environment, to what extent these effects are compatible with municipalities' existing objectives, and what lessons can be drawn from that. The paper combines a systematic review of the literature, a quantitative online survey, and qualitative interviews with representatives from urban transport planning authorities in Germany. Four concrete 'use-cases' were applied to structure the survey.
   Results show that respondents are rather skeptical about the compatibility of AV with existing transport and urban planning objectives, above all to strengthen non-motorized transportation and to promote public transportation. Particularly, automating private motorized travel appears not to match municipal planning perspectives. On the contrary, transport planners think that shared autonomous vehicles as a complement to public transport systems are more appropriate to support urban development strategies. Their most prominent concern with respect to AV is the expectation that car travel will increase with AV, propagating problems like congestion and negative environmental effects. However, survey respondents expect that effects differ quite strongly depending on how AV will occur.
   As a lesson, the study suggests that different AV use-cases should receive specific attention to explore their potentials and challenges. The study likewise suggests to, given the discrepancy between the objectives of urban transport planning and federal government's policy focus, consider consolidating the communal strategic positions on research and development priorities. The results indicate a demand for studies that demonstrate how AV can respond to more fundamental challenges and goals that city planner's face. Given the wide range of potential implications, the study suggests to broaden the debate from its present primary focus on the transport planning domain to city planning and development.

AB This paper presents a tracking control method for the lateral motion of an autonomous land vehicle (ALV). This method is based on active disturbance rejection control (ADRC) scheme and differential flatness theory. The lateral motion is hard to control since it is underactuated, nonlinear, and with large uncertainties. By making a small-angle approximation, the dynamic model is linearized. The flatness of the linear model is proved and a flat output is found. An equivalent form of the model is obtained based on the flat output and its derivatives only. Moreover, an ADRC is adopted to guarantee both control accuracy and strong robustness. Simulation results are presented and the results show the effectiveness of the control strategies.

AB This study presents a localization system using visual information for guidance and navigation of a biomimetic autonomous underwater vehicle (BAUV). The BAUV tracks a mooring cable using two cameras and sonar. Sonar has good accuracy in detecting longitudinal distances but is poor in detecting lateral distances. Since a stereo image has quantization errors, for the cameras, measurement errors in lateral directions are less than those in the optic-axis direction. An extended Kalman filter was employed to combine observational information derived from the cameras and sonar of the mooring cable position with the navigation data of the BAUV. This work demonstrates, using water tank experiments, the effectiveness of the proposed tracking technique in decreasing uncertainty in position estimations of the BAUV and mooring cable.

AB Autonomous vehicles, and in particular autonomous trucks (ATs), are an emerging technology that is becoming a reality in the transportation sector. This paper addresses the problem of optimizing the routes and the speeds of ATs making deliveries under uncertain traffic conditions. The aim is to reduce the cost of emissions, fuel consumption and travel times. The traffic conditions are represented by a discrete set of scenarios, using which the problem is modeled in the form of two-stage stochastic programming formulations using two different recourse strategies. The strategies differ in the amount of information available during the decision making process. Computational results show the added value of stochastic modeling over a deterministic approach and the quantified benefits of optimizing speed. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The rapid advances in technology can be witnessed in the emergence of cyber-physical systems that pertain to several domains of our society. In transportation, we see the emergence of self-driving vehicles that utilize a multitude of sensors and intelligent learning techniques to navigate autonomously. Such vehicles are complex cyber-physical systems that are mobile and due to their sensor and intrinsic intelligence are able to collect, analyze, and capitalize upon an unprecedented amount of fine-grained data, as well as collaborate in real time with multiple stakeholders. Although such rich data can play a key role in data-driven economies of scale, this raises questions with respect to privacy-and integrity-dependent scenarios. In this work, the feasibility of ensuring integrity, and hence safety, while preserving privacy in the emerging hyperconnected vehicle scenarios is discussed. An exemplary case study on real-time vehicle interactions pertaining to map updates exemplifies the combination of privacy-enhancing technologies with integrity-protecting mechanisms.

AB Unmanned ground/aerial vehicles (UGAVs) boosts many potential applications over past few years, but it is still challenging to autonomously coordinating multiple vehicles due to many unpredictable factors in real environments. Especially, it is difficult to make every UGAV keep staying in the communication range of the others all the time, as UGAVs are supposed to have various velocities and be applied in complicated environments. This paper investigates the research efforts related to data communication by using unmanned vehicles as data mules, and presents a theoretical model that derives the optimal message ferrying policy between two distant ground stations, even if the communication range of each vehicle cannot cover the working area directly. Flying paths of UGAVs are categorized into six kinds of typical path patterns and two policies for overcoming the unpredictability of the real environments are discussed. Analysis and simulation show that setting rendezvous points is an effective way for reducing the unpredictability of multiple unmanned vehicles.

AB The number of vehicles on the road (worldwide) is constantly increasing, causing traffic jams and congestion especially in city traffic. Anticipatory vehicle routing techniques have thus far been applied to fairly small networked traffic scenarios and uniform traffic. We note here a number of limitations of these techniques and present a routing strategy on the assumption of a city map that has a large number of nodes and connectivity and where the vehicles possess highly varying speed capabilities. A scenario of operation with such characteristics has not previously been sufficiently studied in the literature. Frequent short-term planning is preferred as compared with infrequent planning of the complete map. Experimental results show an efficiency boost when single-lane overtaking is allowed, traffic signals are accounted for and every vehicle prefers to avoid high traffic density on a road by taking an alternative route. Comparisons with optimistic routing, pessimistic routing and time message channel routing are given. Copyright (c) 2014 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

TI Optimal Retrieval in Puzzle-Based Storage Systems Using Automated Mobile

ID SINGLE-ITEM
AB Puzzle-based storage (PBS) systems store unit loads at very high density, without consuming space for transport aisles. In such systems, each load is stored on a moving device (conveyor module or transport vehicle), making these systems very expensive to build and maintain. This paper studies a new type of PBS system where loads are moved by a small number of autonomous mobile robots (AMRs). The AMRs (or vehicles) can travel freely underneath loads and lift a specific load and carry it to a neighboring vacant space. These systems are hard to analyze, as all the AMRs can move simultaneously with or without loads. We formulate an integer linear programming model that minimizes the retrieval time and the number of load and vehicle movements. The proposed model can handle single-load movements as well as block movements, multiple input/output points, and various constraints on simultaneous vehicle movements. The integer linear programming formulation can solve relatively small problems (a grid with up to about 50 cells) and a sufficient number of empty cells. For larger systems or those with few empty cells, a three-phase heuristic (3PH) is developed, which significantly outperforms the heuristic methods known to date and solves large instances sufficiently fast. The 3PH and an additional hybrid heuristic yield relatively small gaps from a lower bound provided by the integer linear programming model. We find that increasing the number of vehicles has a diminishing return effect on the retrieval times. Using a relatively small number of vehicles makes retrieval times only slightly longer than those obtained when having a vehicle under each load (which is equivalent to the traditional PBS systems). With single-load movement, more vehicles are needed compared with block movement to reach short retrieval times. Also, the marginal contribution of extra empty slots appears to decrease rapidly, which implies high storage densities can be obtained in practice.

AB In this study we investigate changes in travel due to level 2 automation among owners of electric vehicles in California. Level 2 automation has the potential to reduce driver fatigue and make driving less stressful which could mean drivers choose to travel more. We use questionnaire survey data to investigate changes to long distance travel and annual vehicle miles travelled (VMT) due to automation. Results show those who report doing more long-distance travel because of automation are younger; have a lower household income; live in urban areas; own a longer-range electric vehicle; use automation in a variety of conditions; and have pro-technology attitudes and prefer outdoor lifestyles. We use propensity score matching to investigate whether automation leads to an increase in annual VMT. The results of this show 4059-4971 more miles per year among users of level 2 automation compared to owners of similar vehicles without automation.

AB The main trend in the development of intelligent vehicles has been on ensuring comfort, safety, efficiency, and environmental sustainability. However, current research focuses primarily on the safety and energy saving of intelligent vehicles, and a comfortable driving experience through a human-machine interaction system has not been sufficiently investigated. This study used a highfidelity 6-degree-of-freedom driving simulator to evaluate the impact of an independentlydesigned vehicle driving condition prompt (DCP) systems on subjective passenger comfort and motion sickness. The experiment showed that when future driving information is obtained through the vehicle DCP systems, the passengers' subjective comfort is improved, motion sickness is alleviated, and the degree of passenger posture instability is reduced. These conclusions contribute toward improving the comfort of autonomous vehicles and providing a reference for the future design of human-machine interaction systems for intelligent vehicles.

AB Urban mobility is in the midst of a revolution, driven by the convergence of technologies such as artificial intelligence, on-demand ride services, and Internet-connected and self-driving vehicles. Technological advancements often lead to new hazards. Coupled with the increased levels of automation and connectivity in the new generation of autonomous vehicles, cybersecurity is emerging as a key threat affecting these vehicles. Traditional hazard analysis methods treat safety and security in isolation and are limited in their ability to account for interactions among organizational, sociotechnical, human, and technical components. In response to these challenges, the cybersafety method, based on System Theoretic Process Analysis (STPA and STPA-Sec), was developed to meet the growing need to holistically analyze complex sociotechnical systems. We applied cybersafety to coanalyze safety and security hazards, as well as identify mitigation requirements. The results were compared with another promising method known as Combined Harm Analysis of Safety and Security for Information Systems (CHASSIS). Both methods were applied to the Mobility-as-a-Service (MaaS) and Internet of Vehicles (IoV) use cases, focusing on over-the-air software updates feature. Overall, cybersafety identified additional hazards and more effective requirements compared to CHASSIS. In particular, cybersafety demonstrated the ability to identify hazards due to unsafe/unsecure interactions among sociotechnical components. This research also suggested using CHASSIS methods for information lifecycle analysis to complement and generate additional considerations for cybersafety. Finally, results from both methods were backtested against a past cyber hack on a vehicular system, and we found that recommendations from cybersafety were likely to mitigate the risks of the incident.

AB In this article, we propose a new mobility model, called Attractor Based Inter-Swarm collaborationS (ABISS), for improving the surveillance of restricted areas performed by unmanned autonomous vehicles. This approach uses different types of vehicles which explore an area of interest following unpredictable trajectories based on chaotic solutions of dynamic systems. Collaborations between vehicles are meant to cover some regions of the area which are unreachable by members of one swarm, e.g., unmanned ground vehicles on water surface, by using members of another swarm, e.g., unmanned aerial vehicles. Experimental results demonstrate that collaboration is not only possible but also emerges as part of the configurations calculated by a specially designed and parameterised evolutionary algorithm. Experiments were conducted on 12 different case studies including 30 scenarios each, observing an improvement in the total covered area up to 11%, when comparing ABISS with a non-collaborative approach.

AB Road wetness can lead to a significant loss in tyre traction. Although a driver can easily distinguish between dry and wet roads, the thickness of a water film on the road (wetness) and its impact on the vehicle dynamics are more difficult for a driver to classify. Furthermore, autonomous vehicles also need a graded classification of road conditions. There are known sensors, which are able to classify road conditions, but these are either not able to quantify the road wetness or are not suitable for mass production. Therefore, this work analyses a method to measure the road wetness by analysing tyre spray with plain acceleration sensors at positions like wheel arch liner or side skirt. It discusses influences of vehicle speed, road wetness, tyres, road structure and sensor positioning. The results show that a quantification of road wetness is possible, but it relies on the sum of all boundary conditions.

ID INTERNET
AB Connected and autonomous vehicles (CAVs) are promising due to their potential safety and efficiency benefits, and have attracted massive investment and interest from government agencies, industry, and academia. With more computing and communication resources available, both vehicles and edge servers are equipped with a set of cam-era-based vision sensors, also known as Visual IoT (VIoT) techniques, for sensing and perception. Tremendous efforts have been made to achieve programmable communication, computation, and control. However, they are conducted mainly in silo mode, limiting the responsiveness and efficiency of handling challenging scenarios in the real world. To improve the end-to-end performance, we envision that future CAVs require co-design of communication, computation, and control. This article presents our vision of the end-to-end design principle for CAVs, called 4C, which extends the VIoT system by providing a unified communication, computation, and control co-design framework. With programmable communications, fine-grained heterogeneous computation, and efficient vehicle controls in 4C, CAVs can handle critical scenarios and achieve energy-efficient autonomous driving. Finally, we present several challenges to achieving the vision of the 4C framework.

AB A visual localization approach for unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) based on the hybrid real-time stereo visual odometry (VO) is presented. The hybrid VO initializes the semidirect visual odometry (SVO) with depth obtained from the stereo camera, which runs with the monocular scheme at 30 Hz. Meanwhile, a feature-based stereo VO runs in a parallel thread to improve the reliability. Considering the robustness of the feature-based VO, we not only are able to estimate the pose of the UAV with the same rate of the incoming images but also to recover the pose of the UAV when the SVO fails. We demonstrate the accuracy and the reliability of the hybrid VO based on a public benchmark dataset and a dataset recorded on our experimental platform. In addition, the autonomous hovering experiment verifies that the estimated result is fast and accurate enough to control the position Of the UAV.

ID AUTONOMOUS UNDERWATER VEHICLES
AB The algorithm used for terrain-aided navigation (TAN) is crucial for high performance of such a totally autonomous and long-duration underwater vehicle navigation technique. This paper presents results of an investigation into the matching errors of the revised iterative closest contour point (ICCP) algorithm for underwater TAN. In particular the quantitative relationship of the matching errors with terrain features is studied in this paper. Among 10 terrain factors, 6 of them have been shown to have the most influence on the accuracy of the revised ICCP algorithm. Three statistical methods, including multiple regression, logistic regression, and discriminant analysis, are applied to mathematically derive the different relationships between the terrain factors and the matching errors. Each formula uses no more than three terrain factors to fit the matching errors. This paper also studies the effect of other factors, including the initial error of the inertial navigation system (INS), the INS accuracy, the map resolution, the vehicle speed, the matching path length, and the sonar accuracy, on the matching errors.

The quasi-Lagrange formulation is utilized in deriving a realistic mathematical model of the UVMS considering joints' friction, hysteretic coupling between the joints and links, and the nonlinear hydrodynamic forces acting on the system, such as added mass, viscous damping, buoyancy, drag, and vortex-induced forces. Numerical simulations are performed to demonstrate the effects of hydrodynamic forces and system coupling between the vehicle and the manipulator and the joints and the links on the precise positioning of the end effector.

AB Vehicle detectors provide essential information about parking occupancy and traffic flow. To cover large areas that lack a suitable electrical infrastructure, wired sensors networks are impractical because of their high deployment and maintenance costs. Wireless sensor networks (WSNs) with autonomous sensor nodes can be more economical. Vehicle detectors intended for a WSN should be small, sturdy, low power, cost-effective, and easy to install and maintain. Currently available vehicle detectors based on inductive loops, ultrasound, infrared, or magnetic sensors do not fulfill the requirements above, which has led to the search for alternative solutions. This paper presents a vehicle detector which includes a magnetic and an optical sensor and is intended as sensor node for use with a WSN. Magnetic sensors based on magnetoresistors are very sensitive and can detect the magnetic anomaly in the Earth's magnetic field that results from the presence of a car, but their continuous operation would drain more than 1.5 mA at 3 V, hence limiting the autonomy of a battery-supplied sensor node. Passive, low-power optical sensors can detect the shadow cast by car that covers them, but are prone to false detections. The use of optical triggering to wake-up a magnetic sensor, combined with power-efficient event-based software, yields a simple, compact, reliable, low-power sensor node for vehicle detection whose quiescent current drain is 5.5 mu A. This approach of using a low-power sensor to trigger a second more specific sensor can be applied to other autonomous sensor nodes.

AB The advancement of the Intelligent Transport Systems (ITS) and the emerging Connected and Automated Vehicles (CAVs) technology are acknowledged to hold a great potential to mitigate challenging problems in the current transportation networks. Particularly, a proper traffic control strategy with a precise vehicular movement control scheme can alleviate the congestion and improve the safety and efficiency of the traffic. This paper proposes a novel bi-level control framework that combines a design of traffic signal timings at a network level, and a detailed trajectory control policy for individual vehicles at a link-level within a network of CAVs. We develop a group-based longitudinal trajectory planning scheme to coordinate vehicular movements at the lower level of our framework while abiding by the signal operations along with end-to-end vehicle routing decisions from the upper network level optimization. This joint and mutual interaction between the two different control strategies in the urban signalized corridors is complex and can significantly affect the overall network's performance, nevertheless has not been explored previously in the literature. The proposed framework enables such studies where we derive an efficient algorithm that iteratively solves the mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) and linear programming models in each link at the lower and over the network at the upper levels, respectively. Numerical results show the effectiveness of the proposed joint control framework in network performance regarding the average travel time, queue formation and dissipation across the network.

AB This work examines the hypothesis that partially observable Markov decision process (POMDP) planning with human driver internal states can significantly improve both safety and efficiency in autonomous freeway driving. We evaluate this hypothesis in a simulated scenario where an autonomous car must safely perform three lane changes in rapid succession. Approximate POMDP solutions are obtained through the partially observable Monte Carlo planning with observation widening (POMCPOW) algorithm. This approach outperforms over-confident and conservative MDP baselines and matches or outperforms QMDP. Relative to the MDP baselines, POMCPOW typically cuts the rate of unsafe situations in half or increases the success rate by 50%.

AB Accurate and robust extrinsic calibration is necessary for deploying autonomous systems which need multiple sensors for perception. In this letter, we present a robust system for real-time extrinsic calibration of multiple lidars in vehicle base framewithout the need for any fiducialmarkers or features. We base our approach on matching absolute GNSS (Global Navigation Satellite System) and estimated lidar poses in real-time. Comparing rotation components allows us to improve the robustness of the solution than traditional least-square approach comparing translation components only. Additionally, instead of comparing all corresponding poses, we select poses comprising maximum mutual information based on our novel observability criteria. This allows us to identify a subset of the poses helpful for real-time calibration. We also provide stopping criteria for ensuring calibration completion. To validate our approach extensive tests were carried out on data collected using Scania test vehicles (7 sequences for a total of approximate to 6.5 Km). The results presented in this letter show that our approach is able to accurately determine the extrinsic calibration for various combinations of sensor setups.

AB By adopting bioinspired morphing fins, we demonstrate how to achieve good directional stability, exceptional maneuverability, and minimal adverse response to turbulent flow, properties that are highly desirable for rigid hull AUVs, but are presently difficult to achieve because they impose contradictory requirements. We outline the theory and design for switching between operating with sufficient stability that ensures a steady course in the presence of disturbances, with low corrective control action; reverting to high maneuverability to execute very rapid course and depth changes, improving turning rate by 25% up to 50%; and ensuring at all times that angular responses to external turbulence are minimized. We then demonstrate the developments through tests on a 1 m long autonomous underwater vehicle, named Morpheus. The vehicle is capable of dynamically changing its stability-maneuverability qualities by using tuna-inspired morphing fins, which can be deployed, deflected and retracted, as needed. A series of free-swimming experiments and maneuvering simulations, combined with mathematical analysis, led to the design of optimal retractable morphing fins.

AB Humans make daily routine decisions based on their internal states in intricate interaction scenarios. This article presents a probabilistically reconstructive learning approach to identify the internal states of multivehicle sequential interactions when merging at highway on-ramps. We treated the merging task's sequential decision as a dynamic, stochastic process and then integrated the internal states into a hidden Markov model (HMM)-Gaussian mixture regression (GMR) model, a probabilistic combination of an extended GMR and HMM. We also developed a variant of the expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm to estimate the model parameters and verified it based on a real-world dataset. Experiment results reveal that three interpretable internal states can semantically describe the interactive merge procedure at highway on-ramps. This finding provides a basis for developing an efficient model-based decision-making algorithm for autonomous vehicles (AVs) in a partially observable environment.

AB This paper addresses a filter-backstepping based neural adaptive formation control of leader-following AUVs with model uncertainties and external disturbances in three dimensional space. For this purpose, a formation control strategy is proposed by employing filter backstepping technique to avoid the explosion of complexity in the standard backstepping design. This technique can not only significantly simplify the design process of the backstepping controller, but also reduce the influence of high-frequency measurement noise. Then, multi-layer neural networks are incorporated with an adaptive robust technique to deal with the uncertain dynamics, approximation errors and nonlinear disturbances induced by the waves and ocean currents. A Lyapunov-based stability analysis is provided to guarantee that the tracking errors for all the AUVs are uniformly ultimately bounded (UUB). Finally, simulation results for a group of AUVs are provided to demonstrate the tracking performance of the designed formation controller.

   saturation: Design and experiments
SO JOURNAL OF THE FRANKLIN INSTITUTE-ENGINEERING AND APPLIED MATHEMATICS

ID NONLINEAR-SYSTEMS; STABILIZATION; PERFORMANCE; STABILITY
AB This paper presents a new control method for autonomous vehicles. The design goal is to perform the automatic lane keeping under multiple system constraints, namely actuator saturation of the steering system, roads with unknown curvature and uncertain lateral wind force. Such system constraints are explicitly taken into account in the control design procedure. To achieve this goal, we propose a new constrained Takagi-Sugeno fuzzy model-based control method using fuzzy Lyapunov control framework. The resulting non-parallel distributed compensation controller is able to handle not only various system constraints but also a large variation range of vehicle speed. In particular, Taylor's approximation method is exploited to reduce not only the numerical complexity for real-time implementation but also the conservatism of the results. The design conditions are strictly expressed in terms of linear matrix inequalities which can be efficiently solved with available numerical solvers. The effectiveness of the proposed control method is demonstrated through both simulation and hardware experiments with various driving scenarios. (C) 2017 The Franklin Institute.

ID AUTONOMOUS UNDERWATER VEHICLE; SYSTEM; DESIGN
AB This paper deals with the motion control of a hovering autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) with four horizontal and two vertical thrusters, when one or more thrusters are completely malfunctioned. Three thruster fault cases are considered: one horizontal thruster is faulty; two horizontal thrusters are faulty; and one vertical thruster is faulty. Through a series of simulations and an experiment, it is validated that the AUV can track a planned path in a 3-D space with minimally three thrusters (two are horizontal ones); however, some cases require the changes of the vehicle's preferred direction of motion and its movement manner. Additionally, when the number of active horizontal thrusters is less than the required degree-of-freedom, a continuous state feedback control law does not exist due to the non-holonomic constraint. This paper highlights that the hovering AUV can overcome the non-holonomic constraint if using the feature that their translational and rotational motions can be controlled independently.

TI Integrated navigation for an autonomous underwater vehicle carrying

SO IET RADAR SONAR AND NAVIGATION
LA English
DT Article
AB As the autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) becomes more popular in various ocean applications, its navigation technique has attracted great attention since it is often crucial that the vehicle position be known precisely. Selection of a practical navigation scheme is a tradeoff between performance, space/power budget and cost. In this study, a low-cost, small-size navigation system for an AUV carrying synthetic aperture sonar (SAS) is presented. An integrated navigation method is also developed based on the extended Kalman filter, in which two novel processes, track-based compass calibration and adaptive beamforming-based SAS micro-navigation, are incorporated. For compass calibration, the heading bias caused by hard iron interferences is estimated through a surface calibration run; for displaced phase centre antenna-based micro-navigation, sway estimation is done by applying adaptive beamforming to the overlapped phase centre array. A number of AUV field tests were implemented and the results demonstrate that a relative navigation error of as low as 0.23% of the travelling distance in circular runs can be achieved using the developed approach.

AB Our past work introduced source seeking methods for GPS-denied autonomous vehicles using only local signal measurement and operating in two dimensions. In this paper, we extend these results to three dimensions. The 3-D extensions introduce many interesting challenges, including the choice of vehicle models in 3-D, sensor placement to allow probing-based gradient estimation of an unknown signal field in 3-D, the question of what type of pattern of vehicle motion can be produced in an underactuated 3-D vehicle to allow tuning by single-loop or multiloop extremum seeking, and the shape of attractors, which become very complex in 3-D. We present two control schemes that address these questions. The first scheme focuses on vehicles with a constant forward velocity and the ability to actuate pitch and yaw velocities. The second scheme employs vehicles with constant forward and pitch velocities and actuate only the roll velocity. Our results include convergence analysis and simulation results.

AB Internet of Vehicle (IoV) has become a hot topic in the last years due to its significant benefits in transportation systems in terms of quality, costs, and traffic management capability. Indeed, accurate and real-time information acquisition and diffusion are required to reach an efficient traffic management system according to the smart city paradigm. In this context, this article provides a novel IoV-based distributed double layer control architecture to address the coordination control problem of connected autonomous vehicles (CAVs) multiple platoons negotiating the access to a road section restriction in the presence of heterogeneous communication time-varying delays. To this aim, leveraging the IoV paradigm and the equivalent virtual formation concept, we propose a novel distributed diffusive longitudinal protocol and a distributed lateral potential-function-based control strategy, where both of them are able to cope with communication delays and ensuring the multiplatoon coordination in finite time, i.e., before accessing the road section restrictions, so to avoid vehicles collisions. The finite-time stability of both the cooperative controllers is analytically proved by exploiting the Lyapunov-Krasovskii theory and the derived delay-dependent stability conditions, expressed as a set of linear matrix inequalities (LMIs), allows the proper tuning of the controllers gains. Numerical analysis confirms the theoretical derivation and discloses the effectiveness and the robustness of the proposed cooperative multiplatoon control in ensuring the safe crossing of the road section restriction in finite time.

AB Traffic accidents are one main cause of human fatalities in modern society. With the fast development of con-nected and autonomous vehicles (CAVs), there comes both challenges and opportunities in improving traffic safety on the roads. While on-road tests are limited due to their high cost and hardware requirements, simulation has been widely used to study traffic safety. To make the simulation as realistic as possible, real-world crash data such as crash reports could be leveraged in the creation of the simulation. In addition, to enable such simulations to capture the complexity of traffic, especially when both CAVs and human-driven vehicles co-exist on the road, careful consideration needs to be given to the depiction of human behaviors and control algorithms of CAVs and their interactions. In this paper, the authors reviewed literature that is closely related to crash analysis based on crash reports and to simulation of mixed traffic when CAVs and human-driven vehicles co-exist, for studying traffic safety. Three main aspects are examined based on our literature review: data source, simulation methods, and human factors. It was found that there is an abundance of research in the respective areas, namely, crash report analysis, crash simulation studies (including vehicle simulation, traffic simulation, and driving simula-tion), and human factors. However, there is a lack of integration between them. Future research is recommended to integrate and leverage different state-of-the-art transportation-related technologies to contribute to road safety by developing an all-in-one-step crash analysis system.

AB A hierarchical vehicle collision avoidance control method based on model predictive control is presented in this study. In the upper level of the controller, a spatial-based two-degree-of-freedom vehicle model is used for dynamic path planning to decrease the computational burden of the algorithm. Obstacles and road boundaries are translated into spatial-based constraints on system states. An objective function that considers tire adhesion margin is introduced to the path tracking controller to enhance vehicle safety. Meanwhile, the dynamic constraints of vehicle lateral acceleration, sideslip, and tire slip angles are designed in accordance with the tire-road adhesion coefficient. A time-based nonlinear model predictive controller is also designed and compared with the proposed method to verify the effectiveness and superiority of the latter. Theoretical analyses and simulation results indicate that the proposed collision avoidance control system has good collision avoidance effect.

AB As the technological advancement in the automotive field increases and the complexity of vehicle and infrastructure applications is extremely high, new directions and approaches are needed in this field. Supporting and developing vehicular applications dedicated to road safety by analyzing the current behavior of existing networks in various forms is imperative. This paper studies and implements a DSRC-type communications infrastructure that receives a set of controllable and adjustable indicators, which can provide messages to network drivers in a timely manner. The implementation is based on the 802.11p protocol and initially addresses pedestrian infrastructure or pedestrian safety, controlled areas, and perimeters that allow intelligent communications. The design and setting of the communication parameters in the lower layer of the DSRC stack for vehicle applications are part of this work, aspects that are also relevant in the case of autonomous vehicles.

AB This paper proposes a method to detect abnormal motions in real vehicle situations based on trajectory data. Our approach uses a Gaussian process (GP) regression that facilitates to approximate expected vehicle's movements over a whole environment based on sparse observed data. The main contribution of this paper consists in decomposing the GP regression into spatial zones, where quasi-constant velocity models are valid. Such obtained models are employed to build a set of Kalman filters that encode observed vehicle's dynamics. This paper shows how proposed filters enable the online identification of abnormal motions. Detected abnormalities can be modeled and learned incrementally, automatically by intelligent systems. The proposed methodology is tested on real data produced by a vehicle that interacts with pedestrians in a closed environment. Automatic detection of abnormal motions benefits the traffic scene understanding and facilitates to close the gap between human driving and autonomous vehicle awareness.

AB This paper presents our solution for enabling a quadrotor helicopter, equipped with a laser rangefinder sensor, to autonomously explore and map unstructured and unknown indoor environments. While these capabilities are already commodities on ground vehicles, air vehicles seeking the same performance face unique challenges. In this paper, we describe the difficulties in achieving fully autonomous helicopter flight, highlighting the differences between ground and helicopter robots that make it difficult to use algorithms that have been developed for ground robots. We then provide an overview of our solution to the key problems, including a multilevel sensing and control hierarchy, a high-speed laser scan-matching algorithm, an EKF for data fusion, a high-level SLAM implementation, and an exploration planner.(1) Finally, we show experimental results demonstrating the helicopter's ability to navigate accurately and autonomously in unknown environments.

AB With the rapid development of wireless technologies and the growing emphasis on vehicle safety, many vehicular ad hoc network applications have been extensively used. This study attempts to use vehicular ad hoc network technologies for autonomous driving to improve and reduce traffic congestion and vehicle waiting time. Therefore, this study proposes an adaptively intelligent routing system, which uses V2V communications to increase vehicle speed, allows vehicles to communicate with traffic control systems, arranges appropriate vehicle routes based on queuing theory, and uses traffic signals for information exchange. The timing of traffic signals is decided according to road traffic density. To decrease vehicle waiting time at intersections, every vehicle's speed is adjusted based on the distance between the vehicle and the traffic signals. In the simulation, automated vehicles and a more realistic car-following model are taken into consideration and vehicle speeds are regulated based on speed limits and safe following distance on most roads. The simulation result reveals that our proposed adaptively intelligent routing system outperforms periodic system in average vehicle speed and average waiting time at both single and double cross intersections.

AB Partially automated battery electric vehicles (BEVs) are already being sold to and used by consumers. Estimates indicate that as of the end of 2019, there were over 1.2 million Partially Automated Tesla Vehicles-the subject of this study-on the roads globally. Despite this, little research has been done to understand how partially automated vehicles may be changing travel behaviour. In this study we conduct qualitative interviews with 35 owners of Tesla BEVs with Autopilot. The focus was to determine whether partially automated BEVs could cause or are causing an increase in travel. Results show that partial automation and electrification leads to interviewees driving more and choosing to drive rather than fly. These changes are due to increased comfort and reduced stress due to the partial automation system, and because of the lower running costs of a BEV. The results show how partially automated BEVs could increase vehicle miles travelled.

AB In this paper, we attempt to address the issue of controlling the sensitivity parameters (or control gains) of automated driving vehicles in an open heterogeneous traffic flow system. The automated driving vehicles are supposedly equipped with adaptive cruise control and connectivity while the conventional vehicles are characterized by a stochastic safe time headway. To optimize the sensitivity parameters, the natural policy gradient reinforcement learning algorithm has been used for the best policy search. In this context, two performance indices were considered: the traffic breakdown probability and fuel consumption. After extensive simulations, it is found that the sensitivity parameters should depend on both the flow and the penetration rate for maximum performance. In particular, a low-penetration rate of 5% can improve traffic performance. A comparison with other algorithms suggests that natural policy gradient and Q-learning yield a good approximation and reduce significantly the computational cost.

AB Vehicular communication networks have emerged to enable numerous vehicular data services and applications. Conventional vehicular ad hoc networks (VANETs) are often operated in the ad hoc mode and mainly focus on road safety applications based on the connection between vehicles and roadside units (RSUs). To support vehicular communications, dedicated shortrange communication (DSRC) and car-to-car communication consortium (C2C-CC) have been initiated in the United States and Europe, respectively. With the new era of the Internet of Things (IoT), the conventional VANETs have evolved to the Internet of Vehicles (IoV). In IoV, each vehicle is envisioned as an intelligent object, equipped with sensing platforms, computing facilities, control units, and storages and is connected to any entity (other vehicles, RSUs, charging/gas stations, cloud, and so on) via vehicle-to-everything (V2X) communications. Intelligent vehicles can take different roles, i.e., being both a client and a server, taking and providing big data services, leading to numerous new IoV applications, from assisted/autonomous driving and platooning, secure information sharing and learning to traffic control and optimization.

AB A multipoint potential field method (MPPF) for path planning of autonomous underwater vehicles (AUV) in 3D space is presented in this paper. The algorithm is developed based on potential field method by incorporating a directed search method for sampling the potential field. In this approach, the analytical gradient of the total potential function is not computed, as it is not essentially required for moving the vehicle to the next position. Rather, a hemispherical region in the direction of motion around the AUV's bow is discretized into equiangular points with center as the current position. By determining the point at which the minimum potential exists, the vehicle can be moved towards that point in 3D space. This method is very simple and applicable for real-time implementation. The problem of local minima is also analyzed and found that the local minima in 2D space can be easily overcome with the MPPF. A simple strategy to avoid the local minima in 3D space is also proposed. The proposed method reduces the burden of fine-tuning the positive scaling factors of potential functions to avoid local minimum. The algorithm development and the simulation results are presented.

AB Both emergency braking and active steering are possible choices for collision avoidance manoeuvres, and any obstacle avoidance strategy aims to design a control algorithm preventing accidents. However, the real-time path needs to consider the motion state of surrounding participants on the road. This work presents a collision avoidance algorithm containing the path-planning and the tracking controller. Firstly, the lateral lane-changing spacing model and the longitudinal braking distance model are presented, describing the vehicle to reactively process dynamic scenarios in real environments. Then, we introduce the safety distance into the artificial potential field algorithm (APF), thereby generating a safe path in a simulated traffic scene. Redesigning the influence range of obstacles based on the collision areas and corresponding safety distance compared with the classic APF. Besides, based on the threat level, the repulsion is divided into the force of the position repulsion and the speed repulsion. The former is related to the relative position and prevents the vehicle from approaching the obstacle. The latter is opposite to the relative speed vector and decelerates the ego vehicle. Simultaneously, the attraction is improved to apply a dynamic environment. Finally, we design a model predictive control (MPC) to track the lateral motion through steering angle and a Fuzzy-PID control to track the longitudinal speed, turning the planned path into an actual trajectory with stable vehicle dynamics. To verify the performance of the proposed method, three cases are simulated to obtain the vehicle responding curves. The simulation results prove that the active collision avoidance algorithm can generate a safe path with comfort and stability.

AB Intelligent vehicles are expected to perform emergency lane change maneuvers to avoid a collision. During this aggressive maneuver, a high jerk may occur, which reduces the comfort level and may be harmful to vehicle occupants. The present paper addresses autonomous collision avoidance in the context of minimum jerk. First, the desired trajectory described by the desired path and desired velocity profile is generated using quintic polynomials. These quintic polynomials are derived using the Euler-Lagrange equations for the functional defined as the time integral of the squared resultant jerk. The generation of the trajectory depends on the essential parameters, which are the initial longitudinal vehicle velocity, the desired final lateral position, and the tire-road friction coefficient. As a result of nondimensionalization and algebraic manipulations, the collision avoidance problem reduces to a nondimensionalized equation that is an implicit equation in one unknown, which is the lane change aspect ratio, and an input capturing the essential parameters. The plot of the lane change aspect ratio with respect to the input yields a curve that indicates the last point at which a collision can be avoided. The sliding mode control method is used to translate the trajectory tracking errors into the reference values of the total longitudinal force and the centers of percussion lateral accelerations that are the inputs to the tire force distributor. This distributor allocates these reference values to the tires by reducing the tire force usage. Numerical simulations at different initial longitudinal vehicle velocities demonstrate the effectiveness of the controller in avoiding the obstacle and keeping the vehicle motion stable.

AB In this paper, a review on the three most important communication techniques (ground, aerial, and underwater vehicles) has been presented that throws light on trajectory planning, its optimization, and various issues in a summarized way. This kind of extensive research is not often seen in the literature, so an effort has been made for readers interested in path planning to fill the gap. Moreover, optimization techniques suitable for implementing ground, aerial, and underwater vehicles are also a part of this review. This paper covers the numerical, bio-inspired techniques and their hybridization with each other for each of the dimensions mentioned. The paper provides a consolidated platform, where plenty of available research on-ground autonomous vehicle and their trajectory optimization with the extension for aerial and underwater vehicles are documented.

AB The Internet of Vehicles (IoV), whereby interconnected vehicles that communicate with each other and with road infrastructure on a common network, has promising socio-economic benefits but also poses new cyber-physical threats. To protect these entities and learn about adversaries, data on attackers can be realistically gathered using decoy systems like honeypots. Admittedly, honeypots introduces a trade-off between the level of honeypot-attacker interactions and incurred overheads and costs for implementing and monitoring these systems. Deception through honeypots can be achieved by strategically configuring the honeypots to represent components of the IoV to engage attackers and collect cyber threat intelligence. Here, we present HoneyCar, a novel decision support framework for honeypot deception in IoV. HoneyCar benefits from the repository of known vulnerabilities of the autonomous and connected vehicles found in the Common Vulnerabilities and Exposure (CVE) database to compute optimal honeypot configuration strategies. The adversarial interaction is modelled as a repeated imperfect-information zero-sum game where the IoV network administrator strategically chooses a set of vulnerabilities to offer in a honeypot and a strategic attacker chooses a vulnerability to exploit under uncertainty. Our investigation examines two different versions of the game, with and without the re-configuration cost, to empower the network administrator to determine optimal honeypot investment strategies given a budget. We show the feasibility of this approach in a case study that consists of the vulnerabilities in autonomous and connected vehicles gathered from the CVE database and data extracted from the Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS).

AB Precise localization is a key requirement for the success of highly assisted or autonomous vehicles. The diminishing cost of hardware has resulted in a proliferation of the number of sensors in the environment. Cooperative localization (CL) presents itself as a feasible and effective solution for localizing the ego-vehicle and its neighboring vehicles. However, one of the major challenges to fully realize the effective use of infrastructure sensors for jointly estimating the state of a vehicle in cooperative vehicle-infrastructure localization is an effective data association. In this paper, we propose a method which implements symmetric measurement equations within factor graphs in order to overcome the data association challenge with a reduced bandwidth overhead. Simulated results demonstrate the benefits of the proposed approach in comparison with our previously proposed approach of topology factors.

ID INTERNET
AB With the increasing number of Connected and Autonomous Vehicles (CAVs), the heterogeneous traffic flow on highways now consists of a mix of CAVs and Non-networked Autonomous Vehicles (NAVs). The current deployment of Roadside Units (RSUs) on highways is mostly based on uniform or hotspot locations. However, when the permeability of CAVs on the road varies, the communication network may face challenges such as excessive energy consumption due to closely spaced RSU deployments at high CAV permeability or communication interruptions due to widely spaced RSU deployments at low CAV permeability. To address this issue, this paper proposes an improved D-LEACH clustering algorithm based on vehicle clustering; analyzes the impact of RSU and vehicle communication radius, mixed traffic density, and different CAV permeabilities in the heterogeneous traffic flow on the RSU deployment interval; and calculates the rational and effective RSU deployment interval schemes under different CAV permeabilities on highways in the heterogeneous traffic flow. When the heterogeneous traffic flow density is stable and CAV continues to penetrate, the RSU communication radius and deployment interval can be adjusted to ensure that the network connectivity is maintained at a high level. When the RSU and vehicle communication radius are stable, the mixed traffic density is 0.05, and the CAV permeability is 0.2, the RSU deployment interval can be set to 1235 m; when the mixed traffic density is 0.08 and the CAV penetration rate is 0.7, the RSU deployment interval can be set to 1669 m to ensure that the network connectivity is maintained at a high level.

AB This paper presents a Vehicle-Platoon-Aware Bi-Level Optimization Algorithm for Autonomous Intersection Management (VPA-AIM) to coordinate the merging of Connected and Automated Vehicles at unsignalized intersections. The constraint-coupled bi-level optimization is operated within a rolling horizon to balance traffic performance and computational efficiency. In each decision step, the platoon formation scheme is incorporated into an upper-level traffic scheduling model as decision variables to pursue an optimal schedule from a systemic view. Meanwhile, the passing sequence and timeslots of vehicles are jointly optimized with the platoon configuration scheme by virtue of real-time traffic states to improve operational efficiency and fairness. After that, a lower-level trajectory planning model will generate dynamically-feasible and energy-efficient trajectories according to the given schedule and coupling constraints with the objective of improving space utilization to prevent spillbacks. Moreover, the quantifiable connection between the makespan of traffic scheduling schemes and the occurrence of spillbacks is established, demonstrating that the cooperative platoon formation strategy is effective in avoiding and mitigating spillbacks in normal and saturated traffic states. Additionally, the proposed algorithm can be extended to mixed traffic scenarios. Numerical experiments are conducted on extensive scenarios with different arrival flows, where the Constraint Programming technique is employed to produce the optimal schedule. Experimental results indicate the superiority of the proposed approach in optimality and stability with reasonable sub-second computation time for real-life applications.

AB Vehicle-to-everything communication (V2X) and mobile edge computing (MEC) have introduced significant technological innovations for autonomous ground vehicles (AGVs), enabling most driving task computations to be performed with edge servers with higher quality and effectively reducing computational power consumption for AGVs. For reducing more computational power consumption which can reach hundreds of watts, sending more offloading tasks to edge servers can result in high latency and congestion when the network resources are finite and even cause serious traffic accidents. Besides, in V2X network, multiple transmission paths, including vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) links and vehicle-to-infrastructure (V2I) links, can provide more valuable resources for sending offloading tasks, but they increase the complexity of resource management. To improve the utilization efficiency of network resources and ensure low power consumption for AGVs, first, this paper analyzes mathematical models of bandwidth, delay and power consumption based on different computing modes and transmission paths. Second, we propose an allocation algorithm for network resource allocation, transmission paths and computing modes to minimize power consumption according to the states of the V2X-MEC network measured and predicted by the navigation and positioning system. Third, a traversal approach simplified by a road segmentation method is adopted to solve for the optimal parameters. Through simulations, we compare our solution against an allocation approach based on the shortest path method, minimum average delay method and game theory method to illustrate the effectiveness of our proposed method in reducing the power consumption and transmission delay of uplinks.

AB With autonomous driving developing in a booming stage, accurate object detection in complex scenarios attract wide attention to ensure the safety of autonomous driving. Millimeter wave (mmWave) radar and vision fusion is a mainstream solution for accurate obstacle detection. This article presents a detailed survey on mmWave radar and vision fusion based obstacle detection methods. First, we introduce the tasks, evaluation criteria, and datasets of object detection for autonomous driving. The process of mmWave radar and vision fusion is then divided into three parts: sensor deployment, sensor calibration, and sensor fusion, which are reviewed comprehensively. Specifically, we classify the fusion methods into data level, decision level, and feature level fusion methods. In addition, we introduce three-dimensional(3D) object detection, the fusion of lidar and vision in autonomous driving and multimodal information fusion, which are promising for the future. Finally, we summarize this article.

AB The micro-scale and meso-scale ocean dynamic processes which are nonlinear and have large variability, have a significant impact on the fisheries, natural resources, and marine climatology. A rapid, refined and sophisticated observation system is therefore needed in marine scientific research. The maneuverability and controllability of mobile sensor platforms make them a preferred choice to establish ocean observing networks, compared to the static sensor observing platform. In this study, marine vehicles are utilized as the nodes of mobile sensor networks for coverage sampling of a regional ocean area and ocean feature tracking. A synoptic analysis about marine vehicle dynamic control, multi vehicles mission assignment and path planning methods, and ocean feature tracking and observing techniques is given. Combined with the observation plan in the South China Sea, we provide an overview of the mobile sensor networks established with marine vehicles, and the corresponding simulation results.

AB In order to overcome the problems of low control accuracy and control efficiency of traditional vehicle collision avoidance trajectory tracking control method, this paper proposes a multi constraint MPC based automatic driving vehicle collision avoidance trajectory tracking control method. The vehicle dynamics model and tyre dynamics model were constructed, and the relationship between tyre slip angle and force was analysed from three degrees of freedom directions. The road adhesion coefficient of tyre is calculated, and the relationship between adhesion coefficient and tyre lateral force is studied. Combined with the dynamic model and the analysis results, a multi constraint MPC model is constructed, and the model is solved by EMPC to realise the trajectory tracking control of automatic driving vehicle. The experimental results show that the proposed method can accurately predict the vehicle lateral position and yaw angle, and the control accuracy is high.

AB An adaptive-prediction-horizon model prediction control-based path tracking controller for a four-wheel independent control electric vehicle is designed. Unlike traditional model prediction control with fixed prediction horizon, this paper devotes to satisfy the varied path tracking demand by adjusting online the prediction horizon of model prediction control according to its effect on vehicle dynamic characteristics. Vehicle dynamic stability quantized with the vehicle sideslip-feature phase plane is preferentially considered in the prediction horizon adjustment. For stability during switching prediction horizon and for robustness during path tracking, the numerical problem inherent in the adaptive-prediction-horizon model prediction control is analysed and solved by introducing exponentially decreasing weight. Subsequently, the desired motion for path tracking with the four-wheel independent control electric vehicle is realized with a hierarchical control structure. Simulation results finally illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.

AB The environmental impact of the driving behaviour of autonomous vehicles (AVs) is not yet well-understood due to the scarcity of empirical mixed autonomy trajectory data. This study utilizes the Waymo Open Dataset to assess the environmental impact of mixed autonomy traffic considering different vehicle arrangements in a platoon: Human-driven Vehicle (HV) following AV, AV following HV, and HV following HV. Findings suggest that vehicle arrangements in a platoon have a significant impact on the AVs' driving behavior and, consequently, on traffic emissions. The largest environmental benefits were found when an AV is in the lead position. However, when an AV is following an HV, the AVs were observed to drive more conservatively for safety purposes, with a larger time gap and deceleration, resulting in higher emissions compared to when an HV is following another HV. The results provide insights into the complexity of the environmental assessment of AVs in mixed autonomy traffic.

AB The paper proposes a novel learning-based coordination strategy for lateral control systems of automated vehicles. The motivation of the research is to improve the performance level of the coordinated system compared to the conventional model-based reconfigurable solutions. During vehicle maneuvers, the coordinated control system provides torque vectoring and front-wheel steering angle in order to guarantee the various lateral dynamical performances. The performance specifications are guaranteed on two levels, i.e., primary performances are guaranteed by Linear Parameter Varying (LPV) controllers, while secondary performances (e.g., economy and comfort) are maintained by a reinforcement-learning-based (RL) controller. The coordination of the control systems is carried out by a supervisor. The effectiveness of the proposed coordinated control system is illustrated through high velocity vehicle maneuvers.

AB In this paper, a surge-heading guidance-based finitetime path-following control (SHG-FPC) scheme is created for an underactuated marine vehicle with complex unknowns. In lieu of line-of-sight guidance, both surge and heading can be guided by adapting to path-following errors and this can greatly enhance the decision-making autonomy pertaining to guidance of kinematics and dynamics, simultaneously. Complex unknowns can be exactly identified by virtue of the devised finite-time uncertainty observer (FUO), by which FUO-based nonsmooth control laws are able to achieve accurate guidance tracking, and thereby, contributing to entire finite-time path-following performance with strong robustness. Simulation results demonstrate the remarkable performance of the proposed SHG-FPC scheme.

AB Adoption of connected and autonomous vehicles (CAVs) is viewed as one of the vital factors by public and private agencies as benefits are slowly getting quantified with further advancement in technology. From a wide variety of CAV perception and demand estimation studies, the literature lacks the impact of adoption based on an individual's social network and values. In this paper, we utilize an integrated choice and latent variable model to capture individuals' likelihood to adopt level 4 CAVs based on their social values in their peer network using an institutional survey dataset. The model results suggest that households with high income and frequent car buyers are more likely to adopt CAVs. CAV adoption will have a positive influence on an individual's social values among his peers. The proposed framework can be used to provide useful insights for policymakers to quantify consumers' preferences about CAV adoption based on their social values.

AB This paper presents a hierarchical controller for an autonomous vehicle to track a reference path in the presence of uncertainties in both tire-road condition and external disturbance. The hierarchical control architecture consists of three layers: high, low, and intermediate levels. The upper-layer module deals with the vehicle motion control objective, which generates the desired longitudinal/lateral forces and yaw moment. The low-level module handles the braking control for each wheel based on the wheel slip dynamics. The intermediate-level controller generates the longitudinal slip reference for the low-level brake control module and the front-wheel steering angles. To cope with the unknown and nonuniform road condition parameters appearing in the actuator models, an adaptive law is designed for each wheel, and the convergence of the adaptive parameters is guaranteed under a certain persistency-of-excitation condition. The stability of the integrated control system is analyzed by utilizing a Lyapunov function approach. Simulation results are included to illustrate the proposed control scheme.

ID DISTRIBUTED APPROACH
AB This paper describes a multi-agent coordination mechanism applied to intersection simulation situations. In a goal of urban traffic simulation, we must consider the dynamic interactions between autonomous vehicles. The field of multi-agent systems provides us some studies for such systems, in particular on the coordination mechanisms. Conflicts between vehicles (i.e. agents) are very frequent in such applications, and they may cause deadlocks, particularly at intersections such as crossroads. Our approach is based on the solving of two player games/decision matrices which characterize three basic situations. An aggregation method generalizes to n-player games for complex crossroads. The objective of this approach consists in searching basic two-player matrices for solving n-agent problems. To explain the principle, we describe our approach for a particular case of crossroad with three agents. Finally, the obtained results have been examined via a tool of road traffic simulation, ARCHISIM. We assume also that the global traffic replicates the behavior of agents in different situations.

AB The ever-burgeoning growth of autonomous unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) has demonstrated a promising platform for utilization in real-world applications. In particular, a UAV equipped with a vision system could be leveraged for surveillance applications. This paper proposes a learning-based UAV system for achieving autonomous surveillance, in which the UAV can be of assistance in autonomously detecting, tracking, and following a target object without human intervention. Specifically, we adopted the YOLOv4-Tiny algorithm for semantic object detection and then consolidated it with a 3D object pose estimation method and Kalman filter to enhance the perception performance. In addition, UAV path planning for a surveillance maneuver is integrated to complete the fully autonomous system. The perception module is assessed on a quadrotor UAV, while the whole system is validated through flight experiments. The experiment results verified the robustness, effectiveness, and reliability of the autonomous object tracking UAV system in performing surveillance tasks. The source code is released to the research community for future reference.

ID VEHICLE DETECTION
AB Object detection is becoming increasingly significant for autonomous-driving system. However, poor accuracy or low inference performance limits current object detectors in applying to autonomous driving. In this work, a fast and accurate object detector termed as SA-YOLOv3, is proposed by introducing dilated convolution and self-attention module (SAM) into the architecture of YOLOv3. Furthermore, loss function based on GIoU and focal loss is reconstructed to further optimize detection performance. With an input size of 512 x 512, our proposed SA-YOLOv3 improves YOLOv3 by 2.58 mAP and 2.63 mAP on KITTI and BDD100K benchmarks, with real-time inference (more than 40 FPS). When compared with other state-of-the-art detectors, it reports better trade-off in terms of detection accuracy and speed, indicating the suitability for autonomous-driving application. To our hest knowledge, it is the first method that incorporates YOLOv3 with attention mechanism, and we expect this work would guide for autonomous-driving research in the future.

However, it is impossible to detect lane markers when the curvature of the lane the vehicle is travelling on is large or when there is another car in front of the vehicle with short distance. For lane marker detection, it is desirable to set a preview point close to the vehicle. Therefore, by analyzing the block diagram of driver-vehicle system, we propose a method to reduce preview distance without lane tracking performance deterioration by increasing preview points from the conventional one point to two points. Furthermore, it is revealed that driving along a corner with constant curvature without steady-state deviation and arbitrary design of tracking dynamic characteristics become possible by increasing preview points.

AB Autonomous car travel planning is increasingly gaining attention from scientists and professionals, who are addressing the integration of autonomous cars into the general urban transportation system. Autonomous car travel planning depends on the transport system infrastructure, the dynamic data, and their quality. The efficient development of travel depends on the development level of the Intelligent Transport Systems (ITS) and the Cooperative Intelligent Transport Systems (C-ITS). Today, most cities around the world are competing with each other to become the smartest cities possible, using and integrating the most advanced ITS and C-ITS that are available. It is clear that ITS and C-ITS are occupying an increasing share of urban transport infrastructure, so the complex challenges of ITS and C-ITS development will inevitably need to be addressed, in the near future, by integrating them into the overall urban transport system. With this in mind, the authors proposed three autonomous car travel development concepts that should become a conceptual tool in the development of ITS and C-ITS.

AB Underwater energy supplements for autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) are significant for ocean exploitation owing to energy storage and data communication limitations. Aiming at the energy supplement for bionic robotic fish, an autonomous recharging-oriented docking approach is proposed in this article. First, an omnidirectional docking system containing a supporting robotic fish capable of visual recognition and wireless charging and a docking platform is presented. Next, five locomotive modes are designed and analyzed based on the hybrid swimming and gliding patterns for the robot fish. Utilizing the five modes, a docking procedure is planned, and an onboard-visual-based autonomous docking control strategy is presented. Aquatic experiments, including docking with the platform and refloating a small robot, are performed to verify the effectiveness of the proposed approach. The obtained results offer valuable insights into the development of autonomous docking of bionic robots, laying a solid foundation for the permanent operation of various underwater devices and robots.

AB With the development of autonomous vehicles, localization and mapping technologies have become crucial to equip the vehicle with the appropriate knowledge for its operation. In this paper, we extend our previous work by prepossessing a localization and mapping architecture for autonomous vehicles that do not rely on GPS, particularly in environments such as tunnels, under bridges, urban canyons, and dense tree canopies. The proposed approach is of two parts. Firstly, a K-means algorithm is employed to extract features from LiDAR scenes to create a local map of each scan. Then, we concatenate the local maps to create a global map of the environment and facilitate data association between frames. Secondly, the main localization task is performed by an adaptive particle filter that works in four steps: (a) generation of particles around an initial state (provided by the GPS); (b) updating the particle positions by providing the motion (translation and rotation) of the vehicle using an inertial measurement device; (c) selection of the best candidate particles by observing at each timestamp the match rate (also called particle weight) of the local map (with the real-time distances to the objects) and the distances of the particles to the corresponding chunks of the global map; (d) averaging the selected particles to derive the estimated position, and, finally, using a resampling method on the particles to ensure the reliability of the position estimation. The performance of the newly proposed technique is investigated on different sequences of the Kitti and Pandaset raw data with different environmental setups, weather conditions, and seasonal changes. The obtained results validate the performance of the proposed approach in terms of speed and representativeness of the feature extraction for real-time localization in comparison with other state-of-the-art methods.

ID ADAPTIVE CRUISE CONTROL; GENETIC ALGORITHM; DESIGN; MODEL; MANEUVERS
AB The development of speed controllers under execution in autonomous vehicles within their dynamic driving task (DDT) is a traditional research area from the point of view of control techniques. In this regard, Proportional - Integral - Derivative (PID) controllers are the most widely used in order to meet the requirements of cruise control. However, fine tuning of the parameters associated with this type of controller can be complex, especially if it is intended to optimize them and reduce their characteristic errors. The objective of the work described in this paper is to evaluate the capacity of several metaheuristics for the adjustment of the parameters Kp, 1/Ti, and 1/Td of a PID controller to regulate the speed of a vehicle. To do this, an adjustment error function has been established from a linear combination of classic estimators of the goodness of the controller, such as overshoot, settling time (ts), steady-state error (ess), and the number of changes of sign of the signal (d). The error obtained when applying the controller has also been compared to a computational model of the vehicle after estimating the parameters Kp, Ki, and Kd, both for a setpoint sequence used in the adjustment of the system parameters and for a sequence not used during the adjustment, and therefore unknown by the system. The main novelty of the paper is to propose a new global error function, a function that enables the use of heuristic optimization methods for PID tuning. This optimization has been carried out by using three methods: genetic algorithms (GA), memetics algorithms (MA), and mesh adaptive direct search (MADS). The results of the application of the optimization methods using the proposed metric show that the accuracy of the PID controller is improved, compared with the classical optimization based on classical methods like the integral absolute error (IAE) or similar metrics, reducing oscillatory behaviours as well as minimizing the analysed performance indexes.

AB This paper focuses on a special path following task arising from the needs of vision-based autonomous guidance: a given front point of a car-like vehicle that is within the look-ahead range of a stereo vision system must follow a prespecified Cartesian path. A solution to this path following problem is provided by a new feedforward/feedback control strategy where the feedforward is determined by a dynamic generator based on exact dynamic inversion over the nominal vehicle model and the feedback is mainly issued by correcting terms proportional to the tangential and normal errors determined with respect to the vehicle's ideal trajectory. A convergence analysis of the resulting dynamic inversion based controller is established versus a vehicle's uncertain model defined via equation errors. Simulation examples highlighting the controller's performances are included.

AB The emergence of Autonomous Vehicles (AVs) could provoke unexpected challenges in urban traffic environments. One such crucial challenge is the conflicts between pedestrians and AVs, particularly on unsignalized mid-block crosswalks (UMC), where pedestrians are exposed to the AV flow. This study investigates the efficiency and safety performance of a UMC in the presence of both AVs and pedestrians considering the diversities in their behaviors. Through empirical analyses, two pedestrians' crossing decision models are built and four groups of speed profiles are classified. Meanwhile, based on previous literature, defensive and competitive driving strategies are assumed for AVs. The simulation is implemented on an agent-based framework that can dynamically reproduce the kinematic interactions between pedestrians and vehicles. Results indicated that with a reasonable safety margin (2.5 s), percentages of low post encroachment time events for competitive AVs with different pedestrian types are smaller than defensive AVs with differences of 0.2% to 2.9%. The average delays of competitive AVs for all pedestrian types are smaller than defensive AVs with a maximum estimated difference of 39 s. Moreover, the analysis showed that lowering the speed limit may reduce the crash rate of competitive AV up to 0%. It is also found that the pedestrians who make reckless crossing decisions and change their speed drastically during the crossing process are more likely to incur crashes with competitive AVs. Therefore, if pedestrian behaviors can be regulated reasonably, competitive AVs with appropriate parameter settings are most suitable for UMC in the future.(c) 2022 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Automatic navigation of agricultural machinery is an important aspect of Smart Farming. Intelligent agricultural machinery applications increasingly rely on machine vision algorithms to guarantee enhanced in-field navigation accuracy by precisely locating the crop lines and mapping the navigation routes of vehicles in real-time. This work presents an overview of vision-based tractor systems. More specifically, this work deals with (1) the system architecture, (2) the safety of usage, (3) the most commonly faced navigation errors, (4) the navigation control system of tractors and presents (5) state-of-the-art image processing algorithms for in-field navigation route mapping. In recent research, stereovision systems emerge as superior to monocular systems for real-time in-field navigation, demonstrating higher stability and control accuracy, especially in extensive crops such as cotton, sunflower, maize, etc. A detailed overview is provided for each topic with illustrative examples that focus on specific agricultural applications. Several computer vision algorithms based on different optical sensors have been developed for autonomous navigation in structured or semi-structured environments, such as orchards, yet are affected by illumination variations. The usage of multispectral imaging can overcome the encountered limitations of noise in images and successfully extract navigation paths in orchards by using a combination of the trees' foliage with the background of the sky. Concisely, this work reviews the current status of self-steering agricultural vehicles and presents all basic guidelines for adapting computer vision in autonomous in-field navigation.

ID AGGRESSIVE FLIGHT; QUADROTOR; STEREO; CAMERA; GPS
AB High-speed flight in GPS-denied environments is currently an important frontier in the research on autonomous flight of micro air vehicles. Autonomous drone races stimulate the advances in this area by representing a very challenging case with tight turns, texture-less floors, and dynamic spectators around the track. These properties hamper the use of standard visual odometry approaches and imply that the micro air vehicles will have to bridge considerable time intervals without position feedback. To this end, we propose an approach to trajectory estimation for drone racing that is computationally efficient and yet able to accurately estimate a micro air vehicle's state (including biases) and parameters based on sparse, noisy observations of racing gates. The key concept of the approach is to optimize unknown and difficult-to-observe state variables so that the observations of the racing gates best fit with the known control inputs, estimated attitudes, and the quadrotor dynamics and aerodynamics during a time window. It is shown that a gradient-descent implementation of the proposed approach converges similar to 4 times quicker to (approximately) correct bias values than a state-of-the-art 15-state extended Kalman filter. Moreover, it reaches a higher accuracy, as the predicted end-point of an open-loop turn is on average only similar to 20 cm away from the actual end-point, while the extended Kalman filter and the gradient descent method with kinematic model only reach an accuracy of similar to 50 cm. Although the approach is applied here to drone racing, it generalizes to other settings in which a micro air vehicle may only have sparse access to velocity and/or position measurements.

AB This paper presents a novel probabilistic approach for improving the motion planning performance of autonomous driving. The proposed approach is based on the sampling-based planning algorithm, which generates an optimal trajectory from a set of trajectory candidates. In order to treat the uncertainty in the perception data and the vehicle system, the particle filter framework is applied to the motion planning algorithm with four main steps: the time update of the trajectory candidates, the perception measurement update, the trajectory selection and the motion goal resampling. Since the proposed planning algorithm recursively generates an optimal trajectory, the time update of the trajectory candidate updates the motion goals of the trajectory candidates in the previous step using the vehicle model, and it also generates a new set of candidates. In order to evaluate the optimality of each candidate with regard to the safety and the reliability, a perception measurement update is performed. In this step, the importance weight of each candidate is computed using perception data and its adaptive likelihood function. Based on the candidates with updated importance weights, an optimal trajectory is determined in the trajectory selection. Then, the motion goal resampling modifies the set of motion goals based on the importance weights for efficient management of the motion goals in the iterative planning algorithm. The developed algorithm is validated using various types of test. The results show that the proposed method not only provides an integrated probabilistic interface between the perception and the planning but also results in an excellent performance in terms of the computation efficiency.

AB Despite the fact that semi-autonomous vehicles will become more and more prevalent in the coming decades, recent studies have highlighted that traffic accidents will persist as a core issue for road users, insurers, and policy makers alike. Researchers and industry players see potential in the technology embedded in semi-autonomous vehicles to combat this challenge by reliably predicting locations with a high likelihood of traffic accidents. This technology can be leveraged to detect accidents and 'near miss incidents', such as heavy braking and evasive manoeuvres, otherwise known as Critical Driving Events (CDEs). The locations of CDEs could identify areas of high accident exposure, offering automotive insurers a unique opportunity to reduce traffic accidents through the adoption of active loss prevention business models, such as providing safe routing services and in-vehicle warnings. To date, there is limited empirical evidence on whether the Crash Frequency and Crash Rate of locations can be accurately identified through CDEs. To address this research gap, an 18-week naturalistic driving field study of 72 vehicles was conducted in Switzerland, covering over 690,000 km. Data collected from the CAN Bus of these vehicles indicate that there is a proportional relationship between the CDEs of the fleet, and the Crash Frequency and Crash Rate of a location. Furthermore, a nationwide spatial regression analysis was applied to determine Crash Frequency across the majority of the Swiss road network. We identify the relationship between Crash Frequency, and the CDEs and Trip Frequency of the fleet, along with additional explanatory variables for urban and highway locations. These insights provide first evidence that insurance companies and other industry players with access to a nationwide semi-autonomous fleet can determine existing and emerging locations of high accident probability, enabling more proactive business models and safety focused services.

AB Locating the surrounding vehicles is an important environment perception task for autonomous vehicles and advanced driver assistance systems. This task is usually explored based on the sensors' pre-calibration (e.g. height or pitch angle), but can be challenging when the calibration fails (e.g. on the sloping and uneven roads). In this work, we propose a calibrated feature-point based (CFPB) method to estimate the car-following distance adaptive to rough roads, using a single camera. Instead of using the pre-calibrated parameters, CFPB method is based on the surrounding vehicles' feature points. It benefits from the fixed coordinate relations among these points, which enables the algorithm to be adaptive to rough roads. These fixed coordinate relations can be calibrated during driving. Namely, after a few seconds of observation to a surrounding vehicle, the CFPB method can start working for more accurate estimation. Furthermore, the proposed algorithm takes the perspective-n-point method as the framework. YOLO V3 and scale-invariant feature transform are applied as the vehicle detector and feature point extractor. The feature point calibration is dynamically updated and the results are smoothened by a Kalman filter. The camera is chosen because of the good performance on objects detection and feature extraction. The proposed algorithm is evaluated on a real-world road with dynamic traffic flow. Mobileye, a widely used car-following distance estimator on AV, is installed during the tests as the benchmark. The results indicate that the proposed method achieves decimeter-level accuracy and outperforms the Mobileye system in cases where the road slope changes significantly.

AB The goal of adaptive sampling in the ocean is to predict the types and locations of additional ocean measurements that would be most useful to collect. Quantitatively, what is most useful is defined by an objective function and the goal is then to optimize this objective under the constraints of the available observing network. Examples of objectives are better oceanic understanding, to improve forecast quality, or to sample regions of high interest. This work provides a new path-planning scheme for the adaptive sampling problem. We define the path-planning problem in terms of an optimization framework and propose a method based on mixed integer linear programming (MILP). The mathematical goal is to find the vehicle path that maximizes the line integral of the uncertainty of field estimates along this path. Sampling this path can improve the accuracy of the field estimates the most. While achieving this objective, several constraints must be satisfied and are implemented. They relate to vehicle motion, intervehicle coordination, communication, collision avoidance, etc. The MILP formulation is quite powerful to handle different problem constraints and flexible enough to allow easy extensions of the problem. The formulation covers single- and multiple-vehicle cases as well as single- and multiple-day formulations. The need for a multiple-day formulation arises when the ocean sampling mission is optimized for several days ahead. We first introduce the details of the formulation, then elaborate on the objective function and constraints, and finally, present a varied set of examples to illustrate the applicability of the proposed method.

AB With the development of society, technological progress, and new needs, autonomous driving has become a trendy topic in smart cities. Due to technological limitations, autonomous driving is used mainly in limited and low-speed scenarios such as logistics and distribution, shared transport, unmanned retail, and other systems. On the other hand, the natural driving environment is complicated and unpredictable. As a result, to achieve all-weather and robust autonomous driving, the vehicle must precisely understand its environment. The self-driving cars are outfitted with a plethora of sensors to detect their environment. In order to provide researchers with a better understanding of the technical solutions for multi-sensor fusion, this paper provides a comprehensive review of multi-sensor fusion 3D object detection networks according to the fusion location, focusing on the most popular LiDAR and cameras currently in use. Furthermore, we describe the popular datasets and assessment metrics used for 3D object detection, as well as the problems and future prospects of 3D object detection in autonomous driving.

Albeit mobility and signal-propagation impede quality-of-service (QoS), existing research, however, ignores the impact of practical mobility that reshapes the behaviour pattern UAVs would learn to conduct. This letter proposes a deep reinforcement learning (DRL) algorithm with proximal policy optimization (PPO) to guarantee the UAV-supported QoS through trajectory optimization online. Under various setups of speed limitation of vehicles and QoS requirements, our numerical results demonstrate the effectiveness and robustness of the herein proposed algorithm.

ID MODEL-PREDICTIVE CONTROL
AB In this paper, we analyse the performance of a model predictive controller for coordination of connected, automated vehicles at intersections. The problem has combinatorial complexity, and we propose to solve it approximately by using a two stage procedure where (1) the vehicle crossing order in which the vehicles cross the intersection is found by solving a mixed integer quadratic program and (2) the control commands are subsequently found by solving a nonlinear program. We show that the controller is persistently safe and compare its performance against traffic lights and two simpler optimisation-based coordination schemes. The results show that our approach outperforms the considered alternatives in terms of both energy consumption and travel-time delay, especially for medium to high traffic loads.

This system allows the provision of an accurate positioning of the followers relative to the leader using information received with a low frequency only from their onboard video cameras. To improve the accuracy of the created system it proposes a method of estimation of the parameters of the movement of the AUV-leader (its speeds and accelerations) to predict its movement relative to the AUV-follower in the time intervals between the updates of information received from video cameras.

AB Considering that it is quite different for underwater and ground situation, ocean current and obstacles are the important issues need to be solved for autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) path planning. To deal with these problem, an integrated AUV path planning algorithm is presented through combination of velocity synthesis (VS) and artificial potential field (APF) methods. First, an enhanced APF algorithm is adopted to deal with obstacle avoidance. Then, to improve the moving character, the VS method is presented to generate an optimized path. Finally, through simulation result, it can be confirmed that the proposed integrated method can solve the AUV path planning problem very well.

AB Mixed traffic composed of human-driven vehicles (HDVs) and CAVs will exist for an extended period before connected and autonomous vehicles (CAVs) are fully employed on the road. There is a consensus that dense fog can cause serious traffic accidents and reduce traffic efficiency. In order to enhance the safety, mobility, and efficiency of highway networks in adverse weather conditions, it is necessary to explore the characteristics of mixed traffic. Therefore, we develop a novel cellular automata model for mixed traffic considering the limited visual distance and exploring the influence of visibility levels and CAV market penetration on traffic efficiency. We design acceleration, deceleration, and randomization rules for different car-following scenes. For lane-changing, considering the interaction of CAVs and surrounding vehicles, we introduce game theory (GT) to lane-changing policies for CAVs. This paper presents the following main findings. In reduced visibility conditions, the introduction of CAVs is beneficial to improve mixed traffic efficiency on metrics such as free-flow speed and traffic capacity (e.g., 100% CAVs could increase the traffic capacity up to around 182% in environments of dense fog). In addition, the critical density increases as the proportion of CAVs increases, which is more pronounced in conditions of dense fog according to the simulation results. In addition, we compared the proposed GT-based lane-changing strategy to the traditional STCA lane-changing strategy. The results showed that the average speed is significantly improved under the proposed lane-changing strategy. The model presented in this paper can evaluate the overall performance and provide a reference for future management and control of mixed traffic flow in fog conditions.

ID LOCALIZATION; NAVIGATION
AB A graph-based particle filter bathymetric simultaneous localization and mapping (BSLAM) method is proposed to solve the oscillation problem of the trajectories estimated by particles when using a low precise vehicle motion model and obtain accurate navigation results for autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs). A graph-based trajectory update method is proposed to update the trajectories stored in particles before particle weighting to weaken the influence of the low precise odometer model on the particle trajectories. A particle weighting method based on submap matching is proposed to improve the robustness of the particle filter. Besides, a graph-based map generation method is proposed to solve the map selection problem of the particle filtering theory. The performance of the proposed method is demonstrated using a simulated dataset and a field dataset collected from a sea trial. The results show that the proposed method is more accurate and effective compared with a state-of-art particle filter BSLAM method.

ID CONTROL-SYSTEM; MODEL; DESIGN
AB Hybrid autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) use internal actuators, e.g., tunnel thruster, moving mass, and ballast chamber, for yaw and pitch steering. Unlike control surfaces, internal actuators perform independently of relative flows around AUVs, thus suitable for missions which require excellent low-speed maneuverability. This research focuses on an investigation into the control design of an REMUS AUV using internal actuators to steer its heading direction. It has been shown that an internal moving mass together with a tunnel thruster is capable of providing actuations to serve the purpose. However, our analysis indicates that a coupling between roll and pitch motion causes the internal actuators to oscillate if depth-plane motion is neglected when deriving control laws for the internal actuators. We present a novel control strategy by taking advantage of the cross-coupling effect when designing the heading autopilot system with internal actuators. The effectiveness and robustness of the proposed design are validated by simulation results.

AB In this paper, adaptive control of low speed bio-robotic autonomous underwater vehicles (BAUVs) in the dive plane using dorsal fins is considered. It is assumed that the model parameters are completely unknown and only the depth of the vehicle is measured for feedback. Two dorsal fins are mounted in the horizontal plane on either side of the BAUV. The normal force produced by the fins, when cambered, is used for the maneuvering. The BAUV model considered here is non-minimum phase. An indirect adaptive control system is designed for the depth control using the dorsal fins. The control system consists of a gradient based identifier for online parameter estimation, an observer for state estimation, and an optimal controller. Simulation results are presented which show that the adaptive control system accomplishes precise depth control of the BAUV using dorsal fins in spite of large uncertainties in the system parameters.

AB Horizontal profiles of the microstructure of velocity and temperature were obtained with a large autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) using two piezoelectric shear probes, an FF07 thermistor, and three orthogonal accelerometers mounted on a sting at the forward end of the vehicle. A winter field trial in Narragansett Bay provided a run in the midwater pycnocline at 8-m depth that contained a thermal front, an ascending profile to 3-m depth, and a run in the weakly stratified surface layer at this depth. Although shear spectra were strongly contaminated by narrowband vibrations produced by the motor and actuators, this contamination was highly coherent with the measured acceleration and was removed with standard signal processing techniques. The corrected spectra agreed well with the Nasmyth universal spectrum for wavenumbers up to 40 cpm. The estimated rate of dissipation of kinetic energy varied from 0.8 to 250 X 10(-8) W kg(-1) and was consistent with the rate of production of turbulence by surface wind forcing and bottom stress.

AB One of the new technologies for a production system is an autonomous decentralized Flexible Manufacturing System (FMS). The autonomous decentralized FMS aims at high production efficiency by giving self-control or decentralizing the plan, design and operation of FMS. This paper discusses the research necessary for realizing an autonomous decentralized FMS with Automatic Guided Vehicles (AGVs) and Machining Centers (MCs). This research develops a real-time production control method based on the predictions that grasp not only current production situations but also anticipate future ones. From the developed system it can be seen that multi-production that keeps the target production ratio is possible even though neither AGV actions' plans nor parts input schedules are given beforehand. Especially, it can be shown that the method will operate a FMS without influencing the production ratio even when unpredicted troubles happen, which is often seen in an. actual factory.

AB In recent years, unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) have been confirmed as a powerful tool for countless applications in nearly every industry, in which collision avoidance plays a vital role for micro aerial vehicles (MAVs) performing autonomous missions. The complexity of collision avoidance systems is directly related to the complexity of the navigation environment, the avoidance of highly uncertain obstacles being a more thoroughly researched critical aspect. The non-cooperative collision avoidance strategy is necessary when communication between the agents is unavailable, under the case with many existing passive obstacles and non-cooperative flying objects. In this article, we review the topic of non-cooperative collision avoidance for MAVs in dynamic environments by covering two main issues: onboard sensing and obstacle description algorithms. A detailed discussion of these two topics is provided to face non-cooperative collision avoidance technology for MAVs. Finally, the paper summarizes the open challenges and foreseen future directions in this field.

AB When an oil spill occurs, a prompt response reduces significantly the impact. The preparedness and contingency plans are essential to identify the most appropriate technologies. Unmanned and autonomous vehicles (UAVs) is emerging as a powerful tool of strategic potential in the observation, oil tracking and damage assessment of an oil spill.
   The SpilLess project explored the suitability of these devices to be the first-line response to an oil spill. This work analyses the operational requirements related to environmental parameters following a two steps approach: 1) Environmental characterization from long wind and waves time series and modelling; 2) Definition of the optimal periods for operating each UAVs.
   We have defined the periods in which each of these facilities acts best, confirming that the operational limits of UAVs are not significantly more restrictive than the traditional operations. UAVs should be included in contingency plans as available tools to fight against oil spills.

AB The issue of fixed-time trajectory tracking control for the autonomous surface vehicles (ASVs) system with model uncertainties and external disturbances is investigated in this paper. Particularly, convergence time does not depend on initial conditions. The major contributions include the following: (1) An integral sliding mode controller (ISMC) via integral sliding mode surface is first proposed, which can ensure that the system states can follow the desired trajectory within a fixed time. (2) Unknown external disturbances are absolutely estimated by means of designing a fixed-time disturbance observer (FTDO). By combining the FTDO and ISMC techniques, a new control scheme (FTDO-ISMC) is developed, which can achieve both disturbance compensation and chattering-free condition. (3) Aiming at reconstructing the unknown nonlinear dynamics and external disturbances, a fixed-time unknown observer (FTUO) is proposed, thus providing the FTUO-ISMC scheme that finally achieves trajectory tracking of ASVs with unknown parameters. Finally, simulation tests and detailed comparisons indicate the effectiveness of the proposed control scheme.

AB In this paper, we consider depth control problems of an autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) for tracking the desired depth trajectories. Due to the unknown dynamical model and the coupling between surge and yaw motions of the AUV, the problems cannot be effectively solved by most of the model-based or proportional-integral-derivative like controllers. To this purpose, we formulate the depth control problems of the AUV as continuous-state, continuous-action Markov decision processes under unknown transition probabilities. Based on the deterministic policy gradient theorem and neural network approximation, we propose a model-free reinforcement learning (RL) algorithm that learns a state-feedback controller from sampled trajectories of the AUV. To improve the performance of the RL algorithm, we further propose a batch-learning scheme through replaying previous prioritized trajectories. We illustrate with simulations that our model-free method is even comparable to the model-based controllers. Moreover, we validate the effectiveness of the proposed RL algorithm on a seafloor data set sampled from the South China Sea.

AB Autonomous vehicles are taking a leap forward by performing operations without human intervention through continuous monitoring of their surroundings using multiple sensors. Images gathered through vehicle mounted cameras can be large, requiring specialized storage such as cloud. However, cloud data centres can be prone to security and privacy challenges. A partial image-based, homomorphic searchable encryption scheme is proposed, which uses pixel-level encryption to identify objects within encrypted images. The scheme provides Object-Trapdoor and Trapdoor-Image indistinguishability - as the trapdoors are probabilistic. The proposed scheme is deployed on a cloud data centre and tested over a real data set. The proposed scheme reduces storage overhead by approximately 20 times, and is 33 times more efficient compared to the generic Paillier homomorphic searchable encryption scheme. Security analysis demonstrates that the scheme maintains high levels of security and privacy.

AB The ability to effectively process large amounts of information in reasonable time will be important for robust deliberative collision avoidance (COLAV) planning algorithms. Failure to do so can lead to collision, and can be compared to lack of proper supervision from officers on watch (OOW). The main contribution in this article is a parallelized implementation of the Probabilistic Scenario-Based Model Predictive Control (PSB-MPC) on a Graphical Processing Unit (GPU) platform which incorporates both dynamic obstacle avoidance and anti-grounding. Simulation results demonstrate that the COLAV planner can produce collision-free trajectories with respect to grounding hazards and nearby vessels at relatively low computational cost, and which also comply to the COLREGS when deemed possible. Corresponding run-time results show that the algorithm utilizing parallel processing performs better than the alternative for increasing numbers of own-ship control behaviours, nearby static and dynamic obstacles, and dynamic obstacle prediction scenarios considered.

AB This work establishes a robocentric framework around a non-linear Model Predictive Control (NMPC) for autonomous navigation of quadrotors in tunnel-like environments. The proposed framework enables obstacle free navigation capabilities for resource constraint platforms in areas with critical challenges including darkness, textureless surfaces as well as areas with self-similar geometries, without any prior knowledge. The core contribution of the proposed framework stems from the merging of perception dynamics in a model-based optimization approach, aligning the vehicles heading to the tunnels' open space expressed in the x axis coordinate in the image frame of the most distant area. Moreover, the aerial vehicle is considered as a free-flying object that plans its actions using egocentric onboard sensors. The proposed method can be deployed in both fully illuminated indoor corridors or featureless dark tunnels, leveraging visual processing from either RGB-D or monocular sensors for generating direction commands to keep flying in the proper direction. Multiple experimental field trials demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method in challenging environments.

AB Strong electromagnetic fields such as those generated by power stations and transmission lines cause disturbances that affect the on-board sensors of an autonomous unmanned aerial vehicles (AUAVs) and may lead to aircraft instability. To mitigate this effect, we use an extended Kalman filter with colored noise. In addition to the traditional aircraft dynamics, this approach considers the electromagnetic fields of transmission lines and their position, electrical current, and tower topology. In this way, the filter can predict and correct the interference in the aircraft sensors, thereby guaranteeing flight stability even when the AUAV is very close to the electromagnetic sources. This approach enables the AUAV to operate closer to the transformers and transmission lines, thereby paving the way for better autonomous inspection performed by electrical companies and further development of new technologies. To prove the effectiveness of this approach, theoretical and practical results involving a survey of transmission lines are demonstrated. (C) 2019 ISA. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The ionic polymer-metal composite (IPMC) for flexible hydrodynamic propulsor blades can provide many new opportunities in navy platforms, especially in unmanned, robotic vehicles used in surveillance and combat. When in operation, the IPMC materials are very quiet since they have no vibration causing components, i.e., gears, motors, shafts, etc. For small autonomous underwater vehicles (AUV), this feature is truly attractive. IPMCs are friendly to solid-state electronics and have digital programming capabilities; thus, active control is possible. Another advantage of these materials is that they can be operational in a self-oscillatory manner. However, there are several issues that still need to be addressed: propulsor design, testing, robotic control, and the theoretical modeling of the appropriate design. Currently, the IPMC is being investigated for propulsor blade applications and a propulsor model with a robust control scheme. An analytical model of a segmented IPMC propulsor was formulated to be a building block for accommodating the relaxation behavior of IPMCs and for describing the dynamics of the flexible IPMC bending actuator.

AB Recent technological advancements bring the Connected and Autonomous Vehicles (CAVs) era closer to reality. CAVs have the potential to vastly improve road safety by taking the human driver out of the driving task. However, the evaluation of their safety impacts has been a major challenge due to the lack of real-world CAV exposure data. Studies that attempt to simulate CAVs by using either a single or integrating multiple simulation platforms have limitations, and in most cases, consider a small element of a network (e.g. a junction) and do not perform safety evaluations due to inherent complexity. This paper addresses this problem by developing a decision-making CAV control algorithm in the simulation software VISSIM, using its External Driver Model Application Programming Interface. More specifically, the developed CAV control algorithm allows a CAV, for the first time, to have longitudinal control, search adjacent vehicles, identify nearby CAVs and make lateral decisions based on a ruleset associated with motorway traffic operations. A motorway corridor within M1 in England is designed in VISSIM and employed to implement the CAV control algorithm. Five simulation models are created, one for each weekday. The baseline models (i.e. CAV market penetration: 0%) are calibrated and validated using real-world minute-level inductive loop detector data and also data collected from a radar-equipped vehicle. The safety evaluation of the proposed algorithm is conducted using the Surrogate Safety Assessment Model (SSAM). The results show that CAVs bring about compelling benefit to road safety as traffic conflicts significantly reduce even at relatively low market penetration rates. Specifically, estimated traffic conflicts were reduced by 12-47%, 50-80%, 82-92% and 90-94% for 25%, 50%, 75% and 100% CAV penetration rates respectively. Finally, the results indicate that the presence of CAVs ensured efficient traffic flow.

TI A Fuzzy Logic-Based Approach for Humanized Driver Modelling
SO JOURNAL OF ADVANCED TRANSPORTATION
LA English
DT Article
ID CAR-FOLLOWING MODEL; DRIVING STYLE; BEHAVIOR; RISK; SYSTEMS
AB All human drivers can be characterised by their habitual choice of driving behaviours, which results in a wide range of observed driving patterns and manoeuvres. Developing control strategies for autonomous vehicles that address this feature would increase the public acceptance of such vehicles. Therefore, this paper proposes a novel approach to developing rule-based fuzzy logic driver models that simulate different driving styles in the car-following regimes. These driver models were trained with the collected on-road driving data to capture corresponding human drivers' characteristics. The proposed approach consists of three main components: collecting on-road driving data, developing a vehicle model, and establishing the car-following driver models. Firstly, an instrumented vehicle was used to collect driving data over the same route for three consecutive months. Car-following scenarios during these journeys were extracted, and related data were processed accordingly. Afterwards, a representative model of the instrumented vehicle was created and evaluated. Finally, a fuzzy logic driver model that uses humanized inputs was developed and calibrated with the recorded data. The developed driver model's performance was assessed using the collected driving data and a baseline PID driver model. With the performance validated, models representing more aggressive and more defensive driving styles were derived following the same procedure. A cross-driver analysis was then implemented in a normalized car-following scenario with the established vehicle model to investigate the impacts of different driving styles further. The developed driver model can introduce driving styles into drive cycle experiments and replicate on-road real driving emission tests in the laboratory. Moreover, as the proposed method has high robustness to incomplete datasets, it can be a more cost-effective option to facilitate the development of humanized and customized vehicle control strategies for autonomous driving.

AB Autonomous driving is delightedly an innovative and revolutionary paradigm for future intelligent transport systems. To be fully functional and efficient, vehicles will use hundreds of sensors and generate terabytes of data that will be used and shared for safety, infotainment and allied services. Communication among vehicles or between vehicle and infrastructure thus requires data rate, latency and reliability far beyond what the legacy dedicated short-range communication (DSRC) and long-term evolution-advanced (LTE-A) systems can support. In this work, the authors motivate the use of millimetre-wave (mmWave) massive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) technology to facilitate gigabits-per-second (Gbps) communication for cellular vehicle-to-infrastructure scenarios. As a fundamental component, the authors characterise the mmWave massive MIMO vehicular channel using metrics such as path loss, root-mean-square delay spread, Rician K-factor, cluster and ray distribution, power delay profile, channel rank and condition number as well as data rate. They compare the mmWave performance with the DSRC and LTE-A capabilities, and offer useful insights on vehicular channels. The results show that mmWave massive MIMO can deliver Gbps data rates for next-generation vehicular networks.

AB with the development of camera imaging techniques, object detection studies are becoming popular for unmanned aerial vehicles and autonomous systems. However, in these systems, it is extremely important to be able to identify objects effectively and with minimum error in detection for tracking. In this study, an effective human detection system is proposed based on the use of support vector machine, histogram oriented gradient features, and aggregate channel features with AdaBoost classifier. In this proposed system, an adaptive attention system based on the convolutional neural network GoogleNet architecture is developed. Hence efficiency in human detection and monitoring is increased and the central processing unit works faster. Using different data (UAV123, UAV123@10fps, COCO, OpenImagesV6) the most efficient performance is obtained with 97.4% accuracy. In addition, up to 75% savings are achieved with efficient use of the central processing unit. The model in this study is a suitable model for unmanned aerial vehicles, autonomous systems that carry out search and rescue activities, especially close-range target tracking in defense systems.

AB Precise localization in map-changing environments is a major challenge faced in the case of autonomous vehicles. In such environments. map-matching-based localization can result in an incorrect vehicle pose because the High-Definition map (HD map) and the sensor measurements from the real environments are different. In order to solve this problem, this paper proposes robust localization in map-changing environments based on a hierarchical approach of sliding window optimization and filtering. The changing environments arc explicitly modeled by a sub map from the sliding-window-based graph optimization, and the generated sub-map is used for the map matching of the real-time filter. Since the optimized sub-map includes sensor measurement from both the changed and unchanged regions, it reduces the proportion of the changed region in the total matching region, thereby increasing the robustness of the map matching. The proposed hierarchical localization algorithm is verified and evaluated via simulation and experiments. The results show that the proposed algorithm provides a robust vehicle pose in map-changing environments.

AB This paper addresses the problem of trajectory tracking control of an underactuated surface vessel moving in a two-dimensional space in the presence of unknown disturbances. In a preliminary stage, a couple of nonlinear observers is derived to obtain an estimate of the perturbations, which are assumed to originate from unmodeled time-varying dynamics and/or exogenous disturbances. Secondly, we resort to the Lyapunov-based backstepping technique to design two stabilizing control laws, governing the thrust force and torque actuations, that are proved to render the overall control system error globally uniformly bounded. Each control law yields an actuator signal which is implicitly bounded with respect to the position error, and the resulting estimation and tracking errors can be made arbitrarily small by tweaking the control parameters. A set of realistic simulations results is presented to validate our strategy. Experimental trials using an autonomous surface vehicle are also showcased to further demonstrate the efficacy and robustness of the proposed controller.

AB Three-dimensional (3D) trajectory tracking of the underactuated autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) is a challenging task due to the coupled nonlinear system dynamics, imprecise model parameters and time-varying currents. First, a double-loop framework incorporating the backstepping strategy is developed to decouple the tracking error for position into tracking error for controllable orientation. Second, three adaptive robust control (ARC) strategies are generated using desired compensation ARC, indirect ARC and direct/indirect ARC as controllers in the framework, respectively. Among these three strategies, two parameter adaptation laws are used to deal with the uncertainty of the model parameters, based on desired regressor and physical model, respectively. In addition, the three control strategies under this framework also show strong robustness to unknown timevarying ocean currents. Finally, the stability analysis and numerical simulation are presented. Under the numerical simulation of imprecise model parameters and unknown ocean currents, the transient and stable tracking performance of the three proposed control strategies is demonstrated.

AB This work investigates the fault-tolerant control problem for underactuated autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV), in which the actuator fault is addressed, that is the sophisticated and challenging problem. A single critic network based adaptive dynamic programming (ADP) is employed to construct a novel fault-tolerant control scheme combined with the backstepping method. Firstly, a virtual velocity control vector is designed based on the kinematic model of underactuated AUV using backstepping approach. The virtual velocity control vector is taken as the virtual velocity of the dynamic model of underactuated AUV. Secondly, an error tracking system is constructed to transform the fault-tolerant tracking control problem into the optimal control problem. Then an online policy iteration algorithm is designed based on the estimated system states. Based on Lyapunov approach, the stability of the error tracking system is guaranteed by the proposed controller. Finally, the simulation results are shown to verify the effectiveness of the proposed method in this work.

AB The research and development efforts presented in this paper address the flight dynamics of a flapping-wing air vehicle (ornithopter). The 74-cm-wing-span ornithopter was equipped with an automatic flight control system that provides stability augmentation and navigation of the vehicle and flight data acquisition. Wind tunnel tests were conducted with the control surfaces fixed in the trimmed position and flapping motion of the wings activated by a motor at a constant throttle setting. Coefficients of vertical and horizontal force, and pitching moment were determined at a free stream velocity of 7.25 m/sec, and the angle of the stroke plane varied from 0 to 40 degrees. A series of flight tests were conducted with fixed controls, demonstrating ornithopter stability in all axes. Proportional control laws were programmed into the autopilot for the closed-loop controls. A number of flights of the autonomous ornithopter were conducted with the telemetry acquisition. During the autonomous flights, the ornithopter performed waypoint and altitude navigation, demonstrating stable performance.

AB A basic problem in the development of an intelligent vehicle/highway system (IVHS), or an autonomous mobile robot system (AMRS) is to find suitable input controls which can be used to drive the vehicle between any two configurations. In this paper a trajectory generation problem for a four-wheel-steering tractor/semi-trailer system is investigated, and it is shown that this nonholonomic constraint problem can be converted into one of finding fitting-functions satisfying certain necessary boundary conditions. Proposals for control laws are presented and simulation results for a lane change manoeuvre are given.

AB This paper presents a survey of controller design techniques aimed at autonomous navigation and control of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs), focusing on the challenge of aerodynamic uncertainty. Although many roadblocks exist, the most significant and challenging task for UAV navigation and control is the one of aerodynamic/model uncertainty. Current autopilots and controller designs for autonomous airplanes are mainly concerned with the feature of constant, unknown aerodynamic parameters, i.e., control and stability derivatives of the platform. This research focuses on a thorough investigation of the related theory and its applicability, centering on specific techniques that are able to control UAVs with rapidly changing, time-varying aerodynamic characteristics during flight. The scientific merit of this work is the comprehensive overview provided and the technical study that is performed, highlighting the advantages and disadvantages for each technique with respect to its efficiency and performance.

AB This paper describes the design and use of two new autonomous underwater vehicles, Jaguar and Puma, which were deployed in the summer of 2007 at sites at 85 degrees N latitude in the ice-covered Arctic Ocean to search for hydrothermal vents. These robots are the first to be deployed and recovered through ice to the deep ocean (>3,500 m) for scientific research. We examine the mechanical design, software architecture, navigation considerations, sensor suite, and issues with deployment and recovery in the ice based on the missions they carried out. Successful recoveries of vehicles deployed under the ice require two-way acoustic communication, flexible navigation strategies, redundant localization hardware, and software that can cope with several different kinds of failure. The ability to direct an autonomous underwater vehicle via the low-bandwidth and intermittently functional acoustic channel is of particular importance. On the basis of our experiences, we also discuss the applicability of the technology and operational approaches of this expedition to the exploration of Jupiter's ice-covered moon Europa.

AB This paper investigates the adaptive fuzzy trajectory tracking control of under-actuated AUVs in the presence of state constraints, input saturations, and time-varying ocean currents. By proposing a double-loop control scheme, the control problem is divided into kinematic and dynamic control. In kinematic control, an observed-based guidance law and kinematic control law are designed to regulate the vehicle toward the desired trajectory despite the drift caused by unknown ocean currents. Then adaptive fuzzy dynamic surface controllers are introduced in dynamic control which utilizes the barrier Lyapunov function (BLF) to address the system constraints. The stability analysis demonstrates that under the proposed control, all closed-loop signals are uniformly ultimately bounded, and the system constraints are never violated. Finally, extensive numerical simulations are provided to illustrate the effectiveness, feasibility, and robustness of the proposed method.

AB Millimeter-wave radars are being increasingly integrated into commercial vehicles to support advanced driver-assistance system features. A key shortcoming for present-day vehicular radar imaging is poor azimuth resolution (for side-looking operation) due to the form factor limits on antenna size and placement. In this paper, we propose a solution via a new multiple-input and multiple-output synthetic aperture radar (MIMO-SAR) imaging technique, that applies coherent SAR principles to vehicular MIMO radar to improve the side-view (angular) resolution. The proposed 2-stage hierarchical MIMO-SAR processing workflow drastically reduces the computation load while preserving image resolution. To enable coherent processing over the synthetic aperture, we integrate a radar odometry algorithm that estimates the trajectory of ego-radar. The MIMO-SAR algorithm is validated by both simulations and real experiment data collected by a vehicle-mounted radar platform.

AB The autonomous mobility field is changing worldwide, mainly due to new technologies developed by different actors. However, there are still open challenges related to vehicle-to-vehicle communication (V2V) and vehicle-to-infrastructure communication (V2I), as well as vehicle localization, a crucial topic in navigation. In this scope, this document reports the study of visible light positioning and communication techniques (VLP and VLC, respectively) to trace the state of the art of these technologies. It seeks their applicability in the field of intelligent mobility to integrate Advanced Driver Assistance Systems (ADAS) with them. Moreover, we present the current challenges of these technologies in the intelligent vehicles field, mainly in the urban environment. The literature cataloged results justify the application proposal and provide an important resource for those interested in this subject.

TI Robust Communication for Cooperative Driving Maneuvers
SO IEEE INTELLIGENT TRANSPORTATION SYSTEMS MAGAZINE
LA English
DT Article
AB The proposed benefits of enabling automated and autonomous vehicles to cooperate are manifold - however, these functions introduce a new level of uncertainty and unreliability inherent of wireless communication into a realm of safety-critical decisions. Since vehicle-to-vehicle communication in either ad hoc or managed environments can be inherently unreliable, it is of highest importance to critically evaluate the level and design of integration of cooperative information into the decision making process of automated functions. Thus, a robust integration of communication as a sensor has to take into account key issues such as penetration rate, reliability of communication and trust and develop appropriate methods of handling these issues to provide fail-safety. In this paper we present an approach to cooperative maneuvers in automated vehicles with emphasis on handling potential hazards introduced by communication. In this regard we propose the complimentary Collaborative Maneuver ProtocOl (CM P), combining novel approaches to enable robust, functionally safe collaboration between vehicles in vehicle-to-vehicle communication.

AB This article develops, evaluates, and verifies a supervisory controller (SC) to transfer from the grid-connected mode and operate a battery-enhanced electric vehicles' (EVs) dc fast charging (DCFC) station in the autonomous mode, when the supply grid is not available. The SC is designed based on the supervisory control theory (SCT) of discrete event systems and is based on a rigorous mathematical process; nonblocking, i.e., avoids entering an operational deadlock scenario that leads to the system collapse; minimally restrictive with respect to the station's discrete behavior; modular; and scalable. The SC also operates the station in the grid-connected mode and provides a seamless transition between the two modes and thus the DCFC station is also synonymous with a dc-microgrid. The SC is implemented on an industrial programmable logic controller and its performance is verified in a real-time hardware-in-the-loop environment using an OPAL-RT testbed.

AB This article addresses the outcomes of the nine myths about sustainable transportation proposed by William R. Black in "An unpopular essay on transportation" (2001) and finds those predictions to have been largely accurate. Five have become myths by 2019, and four have some potential, though this is due to significant changes in transportation technology and the worldwide economy. The three revolutions of transportation are then considered, as potential new myths in that they will contribute to the sustainability of transportation. They are assessed in a utopia/dystopia dichotomy for their potential positive and negative impacts on sustainability. The role of the public sector is also considered. Their impact on sustainability is then discussed, with long-term possibilities of extreme benefits to sustainability in transport, but with the implication that any road to sustainability with these technologies may make things worse before they get better.

AB Reliable power supply, precise position determination and effective communication are the key requirements for strategic autonomous underwater vehicles (AUV) involved in long duration scientific missions, search operations and when operated as a swarm. The paper presents the challenging range of AUV developed for deep water, Polar and intervention applications; demanding technical requirements for strategic AUV; reliability modeling done on the lithium-ion batteries to identify the redundancy requirements for achieving near-zero failures; navigation model to estimate the achievable level of position accuracies using the state-of-the-art navigation system; limitations in underwater communication; and their importance in realizing vehicle autonomy and swarm intelligence. It is identified that a strategic grade Doppler velocity- aided inertial navigation system could provide position accuracies of about 0.5% of the distance travelled when navigated using sea bottom or ice reference, and a 38 kWh lithium-ion battery pack requires about 7% redundant battery capacity to achieve a failure probability of < 1% in a period of 1 year.

AB We demonstrate the feasibility of the strain energy harvesting from the automobile tires, powering wireless data transfer with enhanced frame rates, and self-powered strain sensing. For this, we used a flexible organic piezoelectric material for continuous power generation and monitoring of the variable strain experienced by a tire under different driving conditions. Power output of similar to 580 mu W at 16 Hz (similar to 112 km/h) from the energy-harvester and mounted on a section of a tire, is sufficient to power 78 LEDs. We further demonstrate that the stored energy was sufficient to power the wireless system that transmits tire deformation data with an enhanced frame rate to control system of a vehicle. Using sensors mounted on a tire of a mobile test rig, measurements were conducted on different terrains with varying normal loads and speeds to quantify the sensitivity and self-powered sensing operation. These results provide a foundation for self-powered real-time sensing and energy efficient data transfer in autonomous vehicles.

AB A real-time road-direction point detection model is developed based on convolutional neural network architecture which can adapt to complex environment. Firstly, the concept of road-direction point is defined for either single road or crossroad. For single road, the predicted road-direction point can serve as a guiding point for a self-driving vehicle to go ahead. In the situation of crossroad, multiple road-direction points can also be detected which will help this vehicle to make a choice from possible directions. Meanwhile, different types of road surface can be classified by this model for both paved roads and unpaved roads. This information will be beneficial for a self-driving vehicle to speed up or slow down according to various road conditions. Finally, the performance of this model is evaluated on different platforms including Jetson TX1. The processing speed can reach 12 FPS on this portable embedded system so that it provides an effective and economic solution of road-direction estimation in the applications of autonomous navigation.

AB This study addresses the input-output feedback linearisation and the internal dynamics stability of an underactuated autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) in three-dimensional space. By taking the coordinates of a virtual reference point in front of AUV system as the output equation, the input-output feedback linearisability of AUV kinematics and dynamics is guaranteed. A non-linear controller is designed to make the reference point track a desired trajectory which is generated by an open-loop path planner. Then, it is shown that the resulting internal dynamics of the system is stable. Neural network approximation capabilities and adaptive techniques are also adopted to compensate for unknown vehicle parameters, and constant or time-varying disturbances induced by waves and ocean currents. A Lyapunov-based stability analysis is used to show uniform ultimate boundedness of tracking errors. Finally, simulation results are provided to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed control system as a qualified candidate for real implementations in offshore applications.

AB This paper compares two prevalent charging strategies for electric vehicles, plug-in charging and battery swapping, to investigate which charging strategy is superior for electric autonomous mobility-on-demand (AMoD) systems. To this end, we use a queueing-theoretic model to characterize the vehicle waiting time at charging stations and battery swapping stations, respectively. The model is integrated into an economic analysis of the electric AMoD system operated by a transportation network company (TNC), where the incentives of passengers, the charging/operating shift of TNC vehicles, the operational decisions of the platform, and the planning decisions of the government are captured. Overall, a bi-level optimization framework is proposed for charging infrastructure planning of the electric AMoD system. Based on the proposed framework, we compare the socio-economic performance of plug-in charging and battery swapping, and investigate how this comparison depends on the evolving charging technologies (such as charging speed, battery capacity, and infrastructure cost). At the planning level, we find that when choosing plug-in charging, increased charging speed leads to a transformation of infrastructure from sparsely distributed large stations to densely distributed small stations, while enlarged battery capacity transforms the infrastructure from densely distributed small stations to sparsely distributed large stations. On the other hand, when choosing battery swapping, both increased charging speed and enlarged battery capacity will lead to a smaller number of battery swapping stations. At the operational level, we find that improved charging speed leads to increased TNC profit when choosing plug-in charging, whereas improved charging speed may lead to smaller TNC profit under battery swapping. The above insights are validated through realistic numerical studies.

AB A highly accurate reference vehicle state is a requisite for the evaluation and validation of Autonomous Driving (AD) and Advanced Driver Assistance Systems (ADASs). This highly accurate vehicle state is usually obtained by means of Inertial Navigation Systems (INSs) that obtain position, velocity, and Course Over Ground (COG) correction data from Satellite Navigation (SatNav). However, SatNav is not always available, as is the case of roofed places, such as parking structures, tunnels, or urban canyons. This leads to a degradation over time of the estimated vehicle state. In the present paper, a methodology is proposed that consists on the use of a Machine Learning (ML)-method (Transformer Neural Network-TNN) with the objective of generating highly accurate velocity correction data from On-Board Diagnostics (OBD) data. The TNN obtains OBD data as input and measurements from state-of-the-art reference sensors as a learning target. The results show that the TNN is able to infer the velocity over ground with a Mean Absolute Error (MAE) of 0.167 km/h (0.046 (m)/ (s)) when a database of 3,428,099 OBD measurements is considered. The accuracy decreases to 0.863 km/h (0.24 m/s) when only 5000 OBD measurements are used. Given that the obtained accuracy closely resembles that of state-of-the-art reference sensors, it allows INSs to be provided with accurate velocity correction data. An inference time of less than 40 ms for the generation of new correction data is achieved, which suggests the possibility of online implementation. This supports a highly accurate estimation of the vehicle state for the evaluation and validation of AD and ADAS, even in SatNav-deprived environments.

AB Platooning and coordination are two implementation strategies that are frequently proposed for traffic control of connected and autonomous vehicles (CAVs) at signal-free intersections instead of using conventional traffic signals. However, few studies have attempted to integrate both strategies to better facilitate the CAV control at signal-free intersections. To this end, this study proposes a hierarchical control model, named COOR-PLT, to coordinate adaptive CAV platoons at a signal-free intersection based on deep reinforcement learning (DRL). COOR-PLT has a two-layer framework. The first layer uses a centralized control strategy to form adaptive platoons. The optimal size of each platoon is determined by considering multiple objectives (i.e., efficiency, fairness and energy saving). The second layer employs a decentralized control strategy to coordinate multiple platoons passing through the intersection. Each platoon is labeled with coordinated status or independent status, upon which its passing priority is determined. As an efficient DRL algorithm, Deep Q-network (DQN) is adopted to determine platoon sizes and passing priorities respectively in the two layers. The model is validated and examined on the simulator Simulation of Urban Mobility (SUMO). The simulation results demonstrate that the model is able to: (1) achieve satisfactory convergence performances; (2) adaptively determine platoon size in response to varying traffic conditions; and (3) completely avoid deadlocks at the intersection. By comparison with other control methods, the model manifests its superiority of adopting adaptive platooning and DRL-based coordination strategies. Also, the model outperforms several state-of-the-art methods on reducing travel time and fuel consumption in different traffic conditions.

AB Automation technology is emerging, but the adoption rate of autonomous vehicles (AV) will depend upon how policymakers and the government address various challenges such as public acceptance and infrastructure development. This study follows a five-stage method to understand these barriers to AV adoption. First, based on a literature review followed by discussions with experts, ten barriers are identified. Second, the opinions of eighteen experts from industry and academia regarding inter-relations between these barriers are recorded. Third, a multicriteria decision making technique, the grey-based Decision-making Trial and Evaluation Laboratory (Grey-DEMATEL), is applied to characterize the structure of relationships between the barriers, Fourth, robustness of the results is tested using sensitivity analysis. Fifth, the key results are depicted in a causal loop diagram (CLD), a systems thinking approach, to comprehend cause-and-effect relationships between the barriers. The results indicate that the lack of customer acceptance (LCA) is the most prominent barrier, the one which should be addressed at the highest priority. The CLD suggests that LCA can be mitigated by addressing two other prominent and more tangible barriers - lack of industry standards and the absence of regulations and certifications. The study's contribution lies in demonstrating that the barriers to AV adoption do not exist in isolation but are linked with each other in overlapping loops of cause and effect relationships. These insights can help different stakeholders in prioritizing their endeavors to expedite AV adoption. From the methodological perspective, this is the first study in the transportation literature that integrates Grey-DEMATEL with systems thinking.

AB Introduction: The safe freeway merging operation for fully Autonomous Vehicles (AVs) in mixed traffic (i.e., the presence of AVs and non-AVs in a traffic stream) is a challenging task. Under a mixed traffic envi-ronment, an AV merging operation could significantly increase conflict risks and reduce operational effi-ciency. Method: This study quantifies the freeway merging conflict risk and develops a freeway merging decision strategy based on conflict risk assessment for an AV attempting to merge to a traffic stream with non-AVs on the freeway. The performance of the risk-based merging decision strategy is evaluated in uncongested, near-congested, and congested traffic conditions. Results: The analyses show that the risk-based merging strategy causes less abrupt deceleration of an AV's immediate upstream vehicle in the target lane on the freeway compared to the based models (i.e., two models based on gap acceptance concepts and a safe gap model based on a surrogate measure, 'Time-to-Collision (TTC)'). The risk-based merging strategy meets the minimum safe gap between an AV intending to merge and its immediate downstream vehicle in the target lane. The risk-based merging strategy produces lower conflict risk in terms of 'Time Exposed Time-to-Collision (TET)' and 'Time Integrated Time-to-Collision (TIT)' compared to the base models. Moreover, the risk-based merging strategy has a lower impact on the average speed of traffic in the target lane compared to the base models considered in this study. Conclusions: The risk -based merging strategy shows higher safety benefits for an AV's merging operation compared to base models. Practical Applications: The findings of this research would help design AV controllers for improv-ing the safety of an AV merging operation in a mixed traffic stream.(c) 2022 National Safety Council and Elsevier Ltd.

AB This article describes an automated sensor-based system to detect pedestrians in an autonomous vehicle application. Although the vehicle is equipped with a broad set of sensors, the article focuses on the processing of the information generated by a Velodyne HDL-64E LIDAR sensor. The cloud of points generated by the sensor (more than 1 million points per revolution) is processed to detect pedestrians, by selecting cubic shapes and applying machine vision and machine learning algorithms to the XY, XZ, and YZ projections of the points contained in the cube. The work relates an exhaustive analysis of the performance of three different machine learning algorithms: k-Nearest Neighbours (kNN), Naive Bayes classifier (NBC), and Support Vector Machine (SVM). These algorithms have been trained with 1931 samples. The final performance of the method, measured a real traffic scenery, which contained 16 pedestrians and 469 samples of non-pedestrians, shows sensitivity (81.2%), accuracy (96.2%) and specificity (96.8%).

AB Global Navigation Satellite Systems provide autonomous vehicles with precise position information through the process of position augmentation. This paper presents a series of performance tests aimed to compare the position accuracy of augmentation techniques such as classical Differential Global Navigation Satellite System, Real-time Kinematic and Real-time eXtended. The aim is to understand the limitations and choose the best position augmentation technique in order to obtain accurate, trustworthy position estimates of a vehicle in urban environments. The tests are performed in and around the German cities of Wuppertal and Duesseldorf, using a vehicle fitted with the navigation system POS-LV 220, developed by Applanix Corporation. In order to evaluate the real-time performance of position augmentation techniques in a highly challenging environment, a total of four test regions are selected. The four test regions are characterized mainly by uneven terrain with tall buildings around the University of Wuppertal, flat terrain with roads of varying width in the city centre of Wuppertal and Duesseldorf and flat terrain in a tunnel section located in the city of Wuppertal. The performances of the different position augmentation are compared using a Root Mean Square (RMS) error estimate obtained as an output from the Applanix system. Furthermore, a High-Definition map of the environment is used for the purpose of model validation, which justifies the use of RMS error estimate as an evaluation metric for the performance analysis tests. According to the performance tests carried out as per the conditions specified in this paper, the Real-time eXtended (RTX) position augmentation method enables to obtain a more robust position information of the vehicle than Real-time Kinematic (RTK) method, with a typical accuracy of a few centimeter in an urban environment.

ID IMAGE ENCRYPTION; EFFICIENT
AB There is a high demand for secure and reliable communications for Connected Autonomous Vehicles (CAVs) in the automotive industry. Privacy and security are key issues in CAVs, where network attacks can result in fatal accidents. The computational time, cost, and robustness of encryption algorithms are important factors in low latency 5G-enabled secure CAV networks. The presented chaotic Tangent-Delay Ellipse Reflecting Cavity-Map system and PieceWise Linear Chaotic Map-based encryption on short messages exchanged in a CAV network provide both robustness and high speed encryption. In this work, we propose a 5G radio network architecture, which leverages multiple radio access technologies and utilizes Cloud Radio Access Network functionalities for privacy preserved and secure CAV networks. The proposed Vehicular Safety Message identifier algorithm meets transmission requirements with a high probability of 85% for low round trip delay of <= 50 milliseconds. The proposed chaos-based encryption algorithm exhibits faster speeds with a computational time of 2 to 3 milliseconds, showcasing its lightweight properties ideal for time critical applications.

DE Marine robotics; motion and path planning
AB This paper studies the problem of autonomous data collection where an underwater vehicle is required to reach several target regions within a specified time limit. The proposed approach takes into account the vehicle dynamics, the time-varying ocean currents, and the obstacles in the region in order to effectively plan a collision-free and dynamically feasible trajectory whose time duration does not exceed the time limit. When the time limit makes it impossible to reach every target, the approach seeks to reduce the penalty accrued by the target regions that are not visited. The approach combines sampling-based motion planning with constraint-based solvers. In fact, a constraint-based solver searches a navigation roadmap to compute bounded tours which minimize the accrued penalty. Sampling-based motion planning is then used to expand a motion tree along these tours. Unsuccessful tour expansions are penalized to promote exploration of alternative tours. Simulation and field experiments demonstrate the efficiency of the approach in planning collision-free and dynamically feasible trajectories that reduce the accrued penalty.

AB This study examined the effects of system reliability and task uncertainty on unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) operator performance for the patrol and target recognition tasks. The primary task was image processing that entailed differentiating between targets and distracters, making necessary changes to the identifications provided by the automation, and processing images accurately within a 5-s window. There were also 3 secondary tasks that are typical of UAV operations to which the participants had to respond as quickly as possible. Operator performance was measured as target image processing accuracy and image processing time as in the primary task and three secondary tasks. A 2 x 2 within-subject design was used to assess the effects of reliability and target uncertainty. Both factors were found to be significant for primary task image processing time. In contrast, accuracy was not found to be significantly affected by either one of the independent variables. (C) 2014 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

AB Compared to human-driven vehicles (HDVs), connected and autonomous vehicles (CAVs) can drive closer to each other to enhance link capacity. Thereby, they have great potential to mitigate traffic congestion. However, the presence of HDVs in mixed traffic can significantly reduce the effects of CAVs on link capacity, especially when the proportion of HDVs is high. To address this problem, this study seeks to control the HDV flow using the autonomous vehicle/toll (AVT) lanes introduced by Liu and Song (2019). The AVT lanes grant free access to CAVs while allowing HDVs to access by paying a toll. To find the optimal toll rates for the AVT lanes to improve the network performance, first, this study proposes a multiclass traffic assignment problem with elastic demand (MTA-ED problem) to estimate the impacts of link tolls on equilibrium flows. It not only enhances behavioral realism for modeling the route choices of HDV and CAV travelers by considering their knowledge level of traffic conditions but also captures the elasticity of both HDV and CAV demand in response to the changes in the level of service induced by the tolls on AVT lanes. Thereby, it better estimate the equilibrium network flows after the tolls are deployed. Then, two categories of optimal toll design problems are formulated according to whether the solution of the HDV route flows, CAV link flows and corresponding origin?destination demand of the proposed MTA-ED problem is unique or not. To solve these optimal toll design problems, this study proposes a revised method of feasible direction. It linearizes the anonymous terms in the upper-level problem by leveraging the analytical sensitivity analysis results of the lower-level MTA-ED problem. This algorithm is globally convergent on the condition that the MTA-ED problem has a unique solution. It can also be leveraged to solve optimal toll design problems when the MTA-ED problem has multiple solutions. Numerical application found that due to disruptive effects on link capacity, using HDVs may significantly reduce the network performance such as customer surplus and total travel demand. The proposed method can assist different stakeholders to find the optimal toll rates for HDVs on AVT lanes to maximize the network performance under mixed traffic environments.

AB We tackle the problem of achieving real-world autonomous driving for buses, where the task is to perceive nearby obstacles and predict their motion in the time ahead, given current and past information of the object. In this paper, we present the development of a modular pipeline for the long-term prediction of dynamic obstacles' trajectories for an autonomous bus. The pipeline consists of three main tasks, which are the obstacle detection task, tracking task, and trajectory prediction task. Unlike most of the existing literature that performs experiments in the laboratory, our pipeline's modules are dependent on the introductory modules in the pipeline-it uses the output of previous modules. This best emulates real-world autonomous driving and reflects the errors that may accumulate and cascade from previous modules with less than 100% accuracy. For the trajectory prediction task, we propose a training method to improve the module's performance and attain a run-time of 10 Hz. We present the practical problems that arise from realising ready-to-deploy autonomous buses and propose methods to overcome these problems for each task. Our Singapore autonomous bus (SGAB) dataset evaluated the pipeline's performance. The dataset is publicly available online.

ID FOLLOWER FORMATION CONTROL
AB In this paper, we present a 3D formation control scheme for a group of torpedo-type underactuated autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs). These multiple AUVs combined with an unmanned surface vessel (USV) construct a sort of star-topology acoustic communication network where the USV is at the center point. Due to this kind of topological feature, this paper applies a virtual school concept. This is a geometric graph where each node is taken as a virtual leader for each specific AUV and assigned its own reference trajectory. For each individual vehicle, its formation strategy is simple: just follow the trajectory of its corresponding virtual leader so as for multiple AUVs to compose the given formation. As for the formation subject, this paper mainly focuses on the formation tracking problem rather than the formation producing. For the torpedo-type vehicle considered in this paper, there are only three control inputs (surge force, pitch, and yaw moments) available for its underwater 3D motion and therefore this is a typical underactuated system. For the following vehicle's trajectory, a sort of potential field method is used for obstacle avoidance, and a neural network-based adaptive scheme is applied to on-line approximate the vehicle's unknown nonlinear dynamics, and the uncertainty terms including modeling errors, measurement noises, and external disturbances are handled by the properly designed robust scheme. The proposed formation method can guarantee the uniform ultimate boundedness (UUB) of the closed-loop system. Numerical studies are also carried out to verify the effectiveness of the proposed scheme.

AB The automotive industry is currently facing an automated driving revolution. This technology is tightly linked to societal and economic challenges: minimisation of traffic accidents, fuel consumption, traffic congestion, parking demand, and providing mobility for an ageing population, as well as to customer needs toward more personalised services. This study aims at the analysis and presentation of the current state of the art and prospects of automated vehicles (AVs) from various perspectives. This study concentrates on revision of the critical technologies, estimation of the impact on social aspects, identification of legal issues, consideration of factors in commercial success through user acceptance, and foresight carried out by other researchers. The primary material was prepared by review and analysis of research papers, standards, regulations, roadmaps, and projects in the field of AVs technology and its implementation worldwide. A SWOT analysis was performed, and it was found that for rapid AV spread, technological solutions need to be made taking into account law and regulation; user acceptance and human-robot interaction need to be solved together as part of one system.

DT Article
DE Autonomous driving; real-time scheduling
AB The rapid development of autonomous driving poses new research challenges for on-vehicle computing system. The execution time of autonomous driving tasks heavily depends on the driving environment. As the scene becomes complex, task execution time increases significantly, leading to end-to-end deadline misses and potential accidents. Hence, a framework that can effectively schedule tasks according to the driving environment in order to guarantee end-to-end deadlines is critical for autonomous driving. In this article, we propose AutoRS, an environment-dependent real-time scheduling framework for end-to-end autonomous driving. AutoRS consists of two nested control loops. The inner control loop schedules tasks based on the driving environment to help them meet end-to-end deadlines while prioritizing the responsiveness and throughput of control commands. The outer control loop tunes task rates based on schedulability to efficiently utilize system resources with an RL-based design. We conduct extensive experiments on both simulation and hardware testbeds using representative autonomous driving applications. The results demonstrate that AutoRS effectively improves the driving performance by 7.95%-56.9% in different driving environments. AutoRS can significantly enhance the safety and reliability of autonomous driving systems by providing timely control commands in complex and dynamic driving environments while guaranteeing task deadlines.

AB Although swarms of unmanned aerial vehicles have received much attention in the last few years, adversarial swarms (that is, competitive swarm-versus-swarm games) have been less well studied. In this paper, we demonstrate a deep reinforcement learning method to train a policy of fixed-wing aircraft agents to leverage hand-scripted tactics to exploit force concentration advantage and within-team coordination opportunities to destroy, or destroy, as many opponent team members as possible while preventing teammates from being attrited. The efficacy of agents using the policy network trained using the proposed method outperform teams utilizing only one of the handcrafted baseline tactics in N-vs-N engagements for N as small as two and as large as 64 as well as learner teams trained to vary their yaw rate actions, even when the trained team's agents' sensor range and teammate partnership possibility is constrained.

AB Lately, nonlinear model predictive control (NMPC) has been successfully applied to (semi-) autonomous driving problems and has proven to be a very promising technique. However, accurate control models for real vehicles could require costly and time-demanding specific measurements. To address this problem, the exploitation of system data to complement or derive the prediction model of the NMPC has been explored, employing learning dynamics approaches within learning-based NMPC (LbNMPC). Its application to the automotive field has focused on discrete gray-box modeling, in which a nominal dynamics model is enhanced by the data-driven component. In this manuscript, we present an LbNMPC controller for a real go-kart based on a continuous black-box model of the accelerations obtained by Gaussian processes (GP). We show the effectiveness of the proposed approach by testing the controller on a real go-kart vehicle, highlighting the approximation steps required to get an exploitable GP model on a real-time application.

AB Autonomous vehicles are the latest engineering research sensations. The development of these needs the collaboration of studies in the automotive and artificial intelligence domains. Selfdriving cars face a slew of security issues when left on their own without human supervision. However, the massive volumes of data required for vehicle operation can't be processed rationally by humans. This is where modern intelligence systems can help. They can facilitate clear decision-making regarding the state of the systems. A unique technique based on Machine Learning (ML) procedures is proposed in this paper. Two cluster models have been constructed and coupled with three Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) models based on Demand-Side Management (DSM). These models are integrated to determine the optimal operating time, stability, and management model. Data from the previous three years have been used in this study. The results show that the proposed CNN and cluster 2 models are the best for energy optimization. The best thing is that this real-time model can meet the demands of large traffic.

ID VEHICLE LOCALIZATION; RANGE; NAVIGATION; CONTROLLABILITY
AB This paper addresses the observability analysis for the single beacon localization problem of an Autonomous Underwater Vehicle (AUV) modeled as a double integrator where its input is the acceleration in an inertial reference frame and its output (measurement) is its range to a stationary beacon. The nonlinear map between range and position makes the range-based observability problem inherently nonlinear. The observability analysis here proposed addresses two complementary issues: the local weak observability for the nonlinear system, and the global observability for a linear time varying representation of the system derived through a state augmentation method. The proposed methods for observability analysis are discussed in different case studies (e.g. 2D/3D, absence/presence of current, and presence of additional sensors like a Doppler Velocity Logger or a depth gauge). Two different state observers, i.e., an Extended Kalman Filter for the nonlinear system, and a Kalman Filter for the system with augmented state are designed: their performances are analyzed through numerical simulations while validating the derived observability properties.

AB The most lateral vehicle guidance controllers proposed in the literature require a continuous reference trajectory. However, the controller performance can be deteriorated when the use of discontinuous reference trajectory in terms of position is unavoidable. In fact, this last leads to a large tracking error generating a large steering angle decreasing the vehicle manoeuvrability. To address this problem, a unified lateral guidance controller combining both dynamic and geometric approaches is presented. The main advantage of this controller is the use of few tuning parameters to modify the lateral guidance dynamic performance and to reduce the impact of the discontinuous reference trajectory. The effectiveness of the developed approach is evaluated through several simulations with a realistic vehicle model using CarMaker IPG.

AB This paper reports on a fast multiresolution scan matcher for local vehicle localization of self-driving cars. State-of-theart approaches to vehicle localization rely on observing road surface reflectivity with a 3D light detection and ranging (LIDAR) scanner to achieve centimeter-level accuracy. However, these approaches can often fail when faced with adverse weather conditions that obscure the view of the road paint (e.g. puddles and snowdrifts), poor road surface texture, or when road appearance degrades over time. We present a generic probabilistic method for localizing an autonomous vehicle equipped with a three-dimensional (3D) LIDAR scanner. This proposed algorithm models the world as a mixture of several Gaussians, characterizing the z-height and reflectivity distribution of the environment-which we rasterize to facilitate fast and exact multiresolution inference. Results are shown on a collection of datasets totaling over 500 km of road data covering highway, rural, residential, and urban roadways, in which we demonstrate our method to be robust through heavy snowfall and roadway repavements.

Novel contributions of the work include the real-time use of model-predictive control, specifically nonlinear model predictive tracking control, for predictions of the vehicle under control, as well as predictions for the adversarial aircraft. In addition to this inclusion, the evasive controller is a hybrid system, providing switching criteria to change modes to become a pursuer based on the current and future state of the vehicle under control, and that of the adversarial aircraft. Results of the controller for equally matched platforms in actual flight tests against a US Air Force trained F-15 test pilot are given. Extensive simulation analysis of the symmetric games is provided, including regressive analysis based on initial conditions of height advantage, and relative velocity vectors, and in particular the effect of allowing the evading aircraft to switch modes between "evader" and "pursuer" during the game.

AB Operational safety and health monitoring are critical matters for autonomous planetary rovers operating on remote and challenging terrain. This paper describes rover safety issues and presents an approximate reasoning approach to maintaining vehicle safety in a navigational context. The proposed rover safety module is composed of two distinct behaviors: safe attitude (pitch and roll) management and safe traction management. Fuzzy logic implementations of these behaviors on outdoor terrain are presented. Sensing of vehicle safety coupled with visual neural network-based perception of terrain quality are used to infer safe speeds during rover traversal. In addition, approximate reasoning for self-regulation of internal operating conditions is briefly discussed. The core theoretical foundations of the applied soft computing techniques are presented and supported by descriptions of field tests and laboratory experimental results. For autonomous rovers, the approach provides intrinsic safety cognizance and a capacity for reactive mitigation of navigation risks. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

AB This paper focuses on the path following control problems for autonomous driving vehicles. Aiming at enhancing the robustness and attenuating the chattering phenomenon, a super-twisting sliding mode control algorithm (STA) is developed based on Lyapunov theory, where the proof of the stability of the control system is presented by applying the backstepping technique. Moreover, co-simulation between Matlab/Simulink and Carsim is carried out to verify the path following control performance. In this research, Stanley controller, conventional sliding mode control (SMC), and model predictive control (MPC) are used as the benchmark controllers for evaluating the proposed STA performance. Two driving scenarios are considered in the simulations, including normal driving and flerce driving. To comprehensively assess the control performance and control effort (i.e. magnitude of steering), an integrated and weighted performance evaluation index (IWPEI) is novelly provided. Simulation results show that the IWPEI of the proposed STA can be reduced by 40.5%, 25.8%, 10.9% in the normal driving scenario; and 62.5%, 24%, 6.8% in the flerce driving scenario as compared with Stanley controller, conventional SMC, and MPC, respectively. The results also indicate that the proposed STA outperforms the conventional SMC in terms of the chattering attenuation, resulting in a smoother front steering wheel angle input and a smoother yaw rate performance. As compared with MPC, the advantage of the proposed STAlies in its much lower computational complexity. Furthermore, the robustness of the controllers is verified by changing the vehicle mass and tire parameters. The proposed STA can reduce the fluctuation of the IWPEI by 22.6%, 22.3%, and 5.9% compared with the benchmark approaches. These results imply that the consideration of system perturbations is very critical in the design of the super-twisting sliding mode controller which can improve the robustness of the autonomous vehicle path following system.

AB Traffic safety has always been a hot topic for human-driven (HDV) and autonomous vehicles (AV) mixed flow. The conflict between permitted right-turn vehicles (PRT) and opposing through vehicles (TH) at signalized intersections (left-handed traffic) is extraordinarily critical. AVs with aggressive behaviors are able to accept short gap time without losing safety. However, such a turning maneuver may lead to dangerous feelings and cause unexpected reactions of approaching drivers. This study aims to investigate and model drivers' reactions in TH movements to PRT AVs considering the trust degree of drivers to AVs. Questionnaire surveys and driving simulator ex-periments were conducted for 41 participants. Results reveal that the right turn timing of PRT AV will significantly influence drivers' reactions. Basically, TH drivers will brake with a high prob-ability under the situation of small expected post encroachment time (PET). It is also found that female drivers and drivers with low trust in AVs are more vigilant to PRT AVs than other drivers. Based on this finding a two-layer model for reproducing TH drivers' reactions to PRT AVs is proposed. The first layer is to determine the braking decision and the second layer is to calculate the parameters of braking behaviors (brake lag, braking time, and speed drop). The significance and coefficients variables in these models proved that the trust in AV will influence drivers' decisions and braking behaviors (brake lag and braking time). The more the drivers trust AVs, the smaller the expected PET to AVs they can accept for passing without braking, and the more gently they will brake (longer brake lag and shorter braking time) due to the cutting in of PRT AVs. This effect will become significant after drivers have experienced several interactions with AVs.

DT Article
DE Model-based diagnosis; Multi-agent systems
ID COORDINATION; COMPLEXITY; TEAMS
AB In the not-so-far future, autonomous vehicles will be ubiquitous and, consequently, need to be coordinated to avoid traffic jams and car accidents. A failure in one or more autonomous vehicles may break this coordination, resulting in reduced efficiency (due to traffic load) or even bodily harm (due to accidents). The challenge we address in this paper is to identify the root cause of such failures. Identifying the faulty vehicles in such cases is crucial in order to know which vehicles to repair to avoid future failures as well as for determining accountability (e.g., for legal purposes). More generally, this paper discusses multi-agent systems (MAS) in which the agents use a shared pool of resources and they coordinate to avoid resource contention by agreeing on a temporal resource allocation. The problem we address, called the Temporal Multi-Agent Resource Allocation (TMARA) diagnosis problem (TMARA-Diag), is to find the root cause of failures in such MAS that are caused by malfunctioning agents that use resources not allocated to them. As in the autonomous vehicles example, such failures may cause the MAS to perform suboptimally or even fail, potentially causing a chain reaction of failures, and we aim to identify the root cause. of such failures, i.e., which agents did not follow the planned resource allocation. We show how to formalize TMARA-Diag as a model-based diagnosis problem and how to compile it to a set of logical constraints that can be compiled to Boolean satisfiability (SAT) and solved efficiently with modern SAT solvers. Importantly, the proposed solution does not require the agents to share their actual plans, only the agreed upon temporal resource allocation and the resources used at the time of failure. Such solutions are key in the development and success of intelligent, large, and security-aware MAS. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB This study discusses the application of fuzzy adaptive PID and improved genetic algorithm (IGA) in motion control and path optimization of autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV). The fuzzy adaptive PID method is selected because it is considered to be a strongly nonlinear and coupled system. First, this study creates the basic coordinate system of the AUV, and then analyzes the spatial force from the AUV to obtain the control model of the heading angle, climb angle, and depth. Next, the knowledge of fuzzy adaptive PID and IGA technology on AVU are investigated, then fuzzy adaptive PID controllers and path optimization are established, and experimental simulations are carried out to compare and analyze the simulation results. The research results show that controllers and IGA can be used for the motion control and path optimization of AUV. The advantages of fuzzy adaptive PID control are less overload, enhanced system stability, and more suitable for motion control and path optimization of AUV.

AB We present a range-based solution for indoor relative localization by micro air vehicles (MAVs), achieving sufficient accuracy for leader-follower flight. Moving forward from previous work, we removed the dependency on a common heading measurement by the MAVs, making the relative localization accuracy independent of magnetometer readings. We found that this restricts the relative maneuvers that guarantee observability, and also that higher accuracy range measurements are required to rectify the missing heading information, yet both disadvantages can be tackled. Our implementation uses ultra wideband, for both range measurements between MAVs and sharing their velocities, accelerations, yaw rates, and height with each other. We showcased our implementation on a total of three Parrot Bebop 2.0 MAVs and performed leader-follower flight in a real-world indoor environment. The follower MAVs were autonomous and used only on-board sensors to track the same trajectory as the leader. They could follow the leader MAV in close proximity for the entire durations of the flights.

AB Designing efficient warehouse management systems is essential to improve business performance. The use of autonomous guided vehicles (AGVs) in logistic processes and material handling systems (MHS) improves productivity and reduces costs. However, determining the appropriateness and financial feasibility of acquiring a fleet of AGVs, together with the definition of their path layout, routing schemes, operation tasks, and network flow, becomes a complex problem when designing flexible manufacturing systems (FMS). This study aids the design of a fleet of AGVs by means of a fuzzy-set qualitative comparative analysis (fsQCA), which makes it possible to measure the level of satisfaction of managerial decision makers. It enables us to identify a combination of factors that lead to stakeholders' satisfaction while dealing with uncertain environments due to the heterogeneous nature of decision makers and factors. Our methodology has been applied to multi-criteria decision-making analysis, resulting in greater transparency, fairness, social equity, and consensus among stakeholders.

ID DRIVER BEHAVIOR; VEHICLE
AB This research assessed the impact of vehicle automation on a driver's ability to anticipate latent threats and to detect materialized hazards on the forward roadway. In particular, the minimum alert time before transfer of control was determined. This was the minimum time required after an autonomous driving suite (ADS) had been in full control of a vehicle for the driver to reacquire the same level of situation awareness that he or she had when in full control of the vehicle. This simulator study included five treatment conditions during which drivers either were always in complete control of their own vehicle (control) or were required to resume control at 4 s, 6 s, 8 s, or 12 s before the appearance of a latent hazard (transfer). While the vehicle was in autonomous mode, the drivers performed an in-vehicle task for more than a minute and were told not to glance at the forward roadway. Analysis of eye movements showed that drivers in the control condition detected nearly 40% more hazards compared with drivers in the shortest transfer condition. The results indicated how long before control was transferred from the ADS back to a driver that the driver should be told that a transfer would occur, if the driver were to have full situation awareness. Unlike previous studies, this study both ensured that the driver was not watching for hazards while the ADS was in control and used a measure of situation awareness (hazard anticipation) that was closely linked to the actual understanding a driver had of the threats present in a given scenario.

AB Inter-vehicle communications may have many reasons to be, but improving road safety and efficiency is arguably the only reason that may differentiate them from other communication infrastructures and justify a special effort in their study and deployment. This work overviews (some of) the past research on the topic to draw some lessons for the future, and tries to dissipate some of the fog that still veils the future of cooperative and autonomous vehicles: Can communications improve mobility or selfish-autonomous vehicles will dominate roads in the future? The paper is not a survey, but rather a critical analysis of what Cooperative Driving (CD) means and how communication is essential for some functions and useful for others, never detrimental. We dedicate a special part to platooning, as iconic application of CD, one of the most studied and also closer to be market ready, at least technologically. A final section discusses the potentialities of CD and what threatens its adoption.

ID DESIGN
AB As human drivers, we instinctively employ our understanding of other road users' behaviour for enhanced efficiency of our drive and safety of the traffic. In recent years, different aspects of assisted and autonomous driving have gotten a lot of attention from the research and industrial community, including the aspects of behaviour modelling and prediction of future state. In this paper, we address the problem of modelling and predicting agent behaviour and state in a roundabout traffic scenario. We present three ways of modelling traffic in a roundabout based on: (i) the roundabout geometry; (ii) mean path taken by vehicles inside the roundabout; and (iii) a set of reference trajectories traversed by vehicles inside the roundabout. The roundabout models are compared in terms of exit-direction classification and state (i.e., position inside the roundabout) prediction of query vehicles inside the roundabout. The exit-direction classification and state prediction are based on a particle-filter classifier algorithm. The results show that the roundabout model based on set of reference trajectories is better suited for both the exit-direction and state prediction.

AB This paper proposes a fault-tolerant control based on a virtual thruster approach for autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) with four horizontal and two vertical thrusters. This methodology defines that, in case of partial fault or complete fault (failure) in horizontal thrusters located in different action planes (which defines the axis or plane where component(s) of forces are actuating in this plane), horizontal propelling forces are calculated through the allocation matrix, used in the pseudo-inverse method, without any change, and a modified weighted matrix. Then, the resultant forces of the remaining working thrusters are calculated by using virtual forces. These forces correspond to the failing thruster forces projection into the forces of the remaining thrusters located in the same action plane. Additionally, we use a bank of controllers to reconfigure the controller against the fault, which improves the performance. Simulation results of a real vehicle show that this is an effective method to cope with the problem of fault tolerant control of AUVs. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The spatial path following control problem of autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) is addressed in this paper. In order to realize AUVs' spatial path following control under systemic variations and ocean current, three adaptive neural network controllers which are based on the Lyapunov stability theorem are introduced to estimate uncertain parameters of the vehicle's model and unknown current disturbances. These controllers are designed to guarantee that all the error states in the path following system are asymptotically stable. Simulation results demonstrated that the proposed controller was effective in reducing the path following error and was robust against the disturbances caused by vehicle's uncertainty and ocean currents.

AB Trajectory planning for autonomous vehicles (AVs) by considering conflicting moving objects (CMOs) is a challenging problem to AV operations. This paper investigates an AV trajectory planning problem where the AV follows a given spatial path, and the trajectories of CMOs are predictable. With the spatial path fixed, the two-dimensional trajectory planning problem is reduced to a one-dimensional speed planning problem that decides the optimal speeds and accelerations of the AV along the spatial path. This paper first analyzes the conflict area caused by a single CMO in the space-time diagram, which reveals upper and lower bounds to the conflict area. Then a multi-area fusion algorithm is proposed to extend the upper and lower bound analyses to a relatively complex traffic scenario with multiple CMOs. To facilitate the computation of the investigated problem, a customized dynamic programming (DP) algorithm is developed, which employs the revealed upper and lower bounds and arriving time constraints to cut invalid trajectories at each stage. With this, the number of stages and states, as well as the computational time for solving the proposed problem, are largely reduced. A set of numerical experiments are conducted to evaluate the performance of the customized DP-based algorithm. The results show that the proposed customized DP-based algorithm can solve the investigated problem within milliseconds, which enables applications to real-time AV control. This much outperforms a stateof-the-art commercial solver, Gurobi, especially for complex traffic scenarios. We further implemented the proposed method in a real-world case study, and the results show that the trajectory generated by the proposed model has a great potential to enhance the future traffic system.

AB Autonomous vehicles are currently regarded as an interesting topic in the AI field. For such vehicles, the lane where they are traveling should be detected. Most lane detection methods identify the whole road area with all the lanes built on it. In addition to having a low accuracy rate and slow processing time, these methods require costly hardware and training datasets, and they fail under critical conditions. In this study, a novel detection algo-rithm for a lane where a car is currently traveling is proposed by combining simple traditional image processing with lightweight machine learning (ML) methods. First, a preparation phase removes all unwanted information to preserve the topographical representations of virtual edges within a one-pixel width around expected lanes. Then, a simple feature extraction phase obtains only the intersection point position and angle degree of each candidate edge. Subsequently, a proposed scheme that comprises consecutive lightweight ML models is applied to detect the correct lane by using the extracted features. This scheme is based on the density-based spatial clustering of applications with noise, random forest trees, a neural network, and rule-based methods. To increase accuracy and reduce processing time, each model supports the next one during detection. When a model detects a lane, the subsequent models are skipped. The models are trained on the Karlsruhe Institute of Technology and Toyota Technological Institute datasets. Results show that the proposed method is faster and achieves higher accuracy than state-of-the-art methods. This method is simple, can handle degradation conditions, and requires low-cost hardware and training datasets.

AB Autonomous vehicles (AVs) need to share the road with multiple, heterogeneous road users in a variety of driving scenarios. It is overwhelming and unnecessary to carefully interact with all observed agents, and AVs need to determine whether and when to interact with each surrounding agent. In order to facilitate the design and testing of prediction and planning modules of AVs, in-depth understanding of interactive behavior is expected with proper representation, and events in behavior data need to be extracted and categorized automatically. Answers to what are the essential patterns of interactions are also crucial for these motivations in addition to answering whether and when. Thus, learning to extract interactive driving events and patterns from human data for tackling the whether-when-what tasks is of critical importance for AVs. There is, however, no clear definition and taxonomy of interactive behavior, and most of the existing works are based on either manual labelling or hand-crafted rules and features. In this letter, we propose the Interactive Driving event and pattern Extraction Network (IDE-Net), which is a deep learning framework to automatically extract interaction events and patterns directly from vehicle trajectories. In IDE-Net, we leverage the power of multi-task learning and proposed three auxiliary tasks to assist the pattern extraction in an unsupervised fashion. We also design a unique spatial-temporal block to encode the trajectory data. Experimental results on the INTERACTION dataset verified the effectiveness of such designs in terms of better generalizability and effective pattern extraction. We find three interpretable patterns of interactions, bringing insights for driver behavior representation, modeling and comprehension. Both objective and subjective evaluation metrics are adopted in our analysis of the learned patterns.

AB This study analyzes pedestrian receptivity toward fully autonomous vehicles (FAVs) by developing and validating a pedestrian receptivity questionnaire for FAVs (PRQF). The questionnaire included sixteen survey items based on attitude, social norms, trust, compatibility, and system effectiveness. 482 Participants from the United States (273 males and 209 females, age range: 18-71 years) responded to an online survey. A principal component analysis determined three subscales describing pedestrians' receptivity toward FAVs: safety, interaction, and compatibility. This factor structure was verified by a confirmatory factor analysis and reliability of each subscale was confirmed (0.7 < Cronbach's alpha < 0.9). Regression analyses investigated associations with scenario-based responses to the three PRQF subscale scores. Pedestrians' intention to cross the road in front of FAVs was significantly predicted by both safety and interaction scores, but not by the compatibility score. Accepting FAVs in the existing traffic system was predicted by all three subscale scores. Demographic influence on the receptivity revealed that males and younger respondents were more receptive toward FAVs. Similarly, those from urban areas and people with higher personal innovativeness showed higher receptivity. Finally, a significant effect of pedestrian behavior (as measured by the pedestrian behavior questionnaire) on receptivity is explored. People who show positive behavior believed that the addition of FAVs will improve overall traffic safety. Those who show higher violation, lapse and aggression scores, were found to feel more confident about crossing the road in front of a FAV. This questionnaire can be a potential research tool for designing and improving FAVs for road-users outside the vehicles. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB This paper considers motion control for a cooperative system of automated passenger vehicles. It develops a cooperative scheme based on a decentralized planning algorithm which considers the vehicles in an initial open chain configuration. In this scheme the trajectories are intersections-free, and each trajectory is planned independently of the others. To ensure the stabilization of each vehicle in the planned trajectory, a fuzzy closed loop motion control is presented, where, based on the properties of the Fuzzy maps. the Lyapunov's stability of the motion errors is demonstrated for all the vehicles. Based on the ISO 2631-1 standard, the saturation property of the Fuzzy maps guarantees low values of longitudinal and lateral accelerations, to ensure comfort of the human body during the motion. The validity of this control algorithm is supported by simulation experiments. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB In this paper, a novel disturbance observer-based fixed-time formation control method is proposed for autono-mous underwater vehicles with actuator faults, model uncertainties and unknown disturbances. Firstly, a fast fixed-time stable system is improved, which has a faster convergence rate than existing stable system. Then, the leader-follower formation control strategy is combined with the path planning strategy based on the artificial potential field to obtain a collision-free formation configuration. Besides, a fast fixed-time disturbance observer is designed to compensate for unknown composite disturbances, which enhances the robustness of the system. Further, based on the disturbance estimation information and the improved nonsingular fast fixed-time terminal sliding-mode surface, a robust fast fixed-time formation control method is presented, which achieves the desired formation configuration. Finally, simulation and comparison results show the effectiveness of the proposed control strategy.

AB Tile-based reservation intersection control for autonomous vehicles has the potential to reduce intersection delays beyond optimized traffic signals. A major question in implementing reservations is the underdetermined problem of resolving conflicting reservation requests. Previous work studied prioritizing requests by first come first served or holding auctions at intersections, but the possibilities are infinite. Furthermore, although selfish routing behavior could affect the benefits of the reservation prioritization, reservation control has not been studied with user equilibrium routing due to its microsimulation definition. This paper addresses these issues by presenting an integer program formulation of the conflict point simplification of reservations. The feasible region is transformed, resulting in a more tractable integer program on conflict regions for dynamic traffic assignment. Because the integer program is NP-hard we present a polynomial-time heuristic. Finally, we demonstrate the potential utility of this heuristic by demonstrating objective functions that reduce travel time and energy consumption on a city network.

AB With the emergence of research on Shared autonomous electric vehicles (SAEVs) as a futuristic transportation option, it becomes important to explore the environmental implications of these types of vehicles before being implemented on a large scale. This work aims to investigate some of the environmental implications of SAEVs compared to privately owned electric vehicles (EVs) through a set of assessment criteria consisting of their life cycle global warming potential (GWP), water footprint and energy demand. In addition, this work examines how different circular economy (CE) practices and energy mixes influence the SAEV's environmental implica-tions. The analysis conducted shows that SAEVs have higher negative environmental effects than private conven-tional EVs. However, circularity practices were found to decrease these effects. CE practices reduced the GWP, water footprint, and energy demands of SAEVs by 21.4 %, 18.2 %, and 17.3 % respectively. Results have also shown that utilizing the projected 2050 U.S. energy mix and incorporating CE practices throughout the life cycle of an SAEV will decrease the GWP, water footprint, and energy demand by 46 %, 36.2 %, and 39.3 % respec-tively. In contrast, by utilizing an energy mix that only consists of the clean energy sources of the 2050 U.S. energy mix in the same proportions but forming 100 % of the mix, the GWP, water footprint and energy demand decrease by 73.2 %, 51.2 %, and 29.1 % respectively. The analysis shows that an SAEV will always have higher GWP, water footprint, and energy demand compared to an EV utilizing the same battery due to deadheading and the increased power consumption caused by the additional automation enabling components.(c) 2023 Institution of Chemical Engineers.

AB Robotic systems are becoming more ubiquitous, whether on land, in the air, or in water. In the aquatic realm, aquatic drones including ROVs (remotely operated vehicles) and AUVs (autonomous underwater vehicles) have opened new opportunities to investigate the ocean depths. However, these technologies have limitations related to shipboard support, programing, and functionality in complex marine environments. A new form of AUV is being developed to become operational. These drones are based on animal designs and capabilities. Biological AUVs (BAUVs) promise to improve performance in the varied environments of the ocean. Comparison of animal swimming performance with conventional AUVs and BAUVs demonstrates that natural systems still have swimming capabilities beyond the current state of AUV technology. However, the performances of aquatic animals with respect to swimming speed, efficiency, maneuverability, and stealth can serve as benchmarks to direct the development of bio-inspired AUV technology with enhanced capabilities.

AB This study proposes a new car-following model considering the effect of electronic throttle opening angle to capture the characteristics of connected autonomous vehicular traffic flow. The proposed model incorporates the opening angle of electronic throttle into the full velocity difference (FVD) model by assuming that the information of electronic throttle dynamics is shared by vehicles through vehicle-to-vehicle communications. The stability condition of the proposed car-following model is obtained using the perturbation method. Numerical experiments are constructed on three scenarios, start, stop, and evolution processes, to analyze the vehicular traffic flow characteristics of the proposed model. The results of numerical experiments illustrate that the proposed car-following model has a larger stable region compared with FVD model. Also, it demonstrates that the proposed car-following model can better present the characteristics of connected and autonomous vehicular flow in terms of the smoothness and stability with respect to the space headway, position, velocity, and acceleration/deceleration profiles.

AB This paper is about the allocation of tours of m targets to n vehicles. The motion of the vehicles satisfies a nonholonomic constraint (i.e., the yaw rate of the vehicle is bounded). Each target is to be visited by one and only one vehicle. Given a set of targets and the yaw rate constraints on the vehicles, the problem addressed in this paper is 1) to assign each vehicle a sequence of targets to visit, and 2) to find a feasible path for each vehicle that passes through the assigned targets with a requirement that the vehicle returns to its initial position. The heading angle at each target location may not be specified. The objective function is to minimize the sum of the distances traveled by all vehicles. A constant factor approximation algorithm is presented for the above resource allocation problem for both the single and the multiple vehicle case.
   Note to Practitioners-The motivation for this paper stems from the need to develop resource allocation algorithms for unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs). Small autonomous UAVs are seen as ideal platforms for many applications, such as searching for targets, mapping a given area, traffic surveillance, fire monitoring, etc. The main advantage of using these small autonomous vehicles is that they, can be used in situations where a manned mission is dangerous or not possible. Resource allocation problems naturally arise in these applications where one would want to optimally assign a given set of vehicles to the tasks at hand. The feature that differentiates these resource allocation problems from similar problems previously studied in the literature is that there are constraints on the motion of the vehicle. This paper addresses the constraint that captures the inability of a fixed wing aircraft to turn at any arbitrary yaw rate. The basic problem addressed in this paper is as follows: Given n vehicles and m targets, find a path for each vehicle satisfying yaw rate contraints such that each target is visited exactly once by a vehicle and the total distance traveled by all vehicles is minimized. We assume that the targets are at least 2r apart, where r is the minimum turning radius of the vehicle. This is a reasonable assumption because the sensors on these vehicles can map or see an area whose width is at least 2r. We give an algorithm to solve this problem by combining ideas from the traveling salesman problem and the path planning literature. We also show how these algorithms perform in the worst-case scenario.

AB Accurate estimation of 3D geometry and camera motion enables a wide range of tasks in robotics and autonomous vehicles. However, the lack of semantics and the performance degradation due to dynamic objects hinder its application to real-world scenarios. To overcome these limitations, we design a novel neural semantic visual odometry (VO) architecture on top of the simultaneous VO, object detection and instance segmentation (SimVODIS) network. Next, we propose an attentive pose estimation architecture with a multi-task learning formulation for handling dynamic objects and VO performance enhancement. The extensive experiments conducted in our work attest that the proposed SimVODIS++ improves the VO performance in dynamic environments. Further, SimVODIS++ focuses on salient regions while excluding feature-less regions. Performing the experiments, we have discovered and fixed the data leakage problem in the conventional experiment setting followed by numerous previous works-which we claim as one of our contributions. We make the source code public.

AB Unmanned surface vehicles (USV) is the development trend of future ships, and it will be widely used in various kinds of marine tasks. Obstacle avoidance is one key technology for autonomous navigation of USV. Convolutional neural network based obstacle classification and detection method is applied to USV visual images in environment sensing task. To solve the problem of low detection and classification accuracy of obstacles in the visual inspection of USV, a bidirectional feature pyramid networks is proposed combining hybrid network architecture of ResNet and improved DenseNet. The proposed method can further enhance the detection and classification some types of obstacles by using the underlying multi-layer detail features and high-level strong semantic features in the network architecture. The detection and classification performance of the proposed method is evaluated on a self built dataset. Ablation experiments and performance tests on open datasets are also employed. The experimental results show that the proposed algorithm has best performance for obstacles detection, and it is more suitable for autonomous navigation of USV.

AB Steer-by-Wire (SbW) systems gain new importance with regard to autonomous driving since a permanently rotating steering wheel is undesired in such a vehicle. Furthermore, redundancies in the vehicle's steering system must be provided for autonomous vehicles, which have been seen as an obstacle for SbW systems until now. In this article, a control concept for redundantly actuated SbW systems is presented. For this purpose, the mechanical model of a redundantly actuated SbW is presented, in which the actuators of the steering are elastically connected to each other. The mechanical modell is simplified. Using an inner coupling speed controller reduces the system order of the redundant system to the system order without redundancy. With an algebraically designed model-matching controller, the speed controlled system is regulated to the dynamics of a generic steering model. Finally, the system characteristics of the controlled system are analysed. The controlled system matches the reference system in the relevant frequency range. Furthermore passivity can be achieved over the entire frequency range, which ensures the stability of the controlled system when connected to a passive environment.

TI Autonomous detection and anticipation of jam fronts from messages

SO TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH RECORD

DT Article
ID INFORMATION PROPAGATION; TRAFFIC STATES; VEHICLE
AB A minimalist, completely distributed freeway traffic information system is introduced. It involves autonomous, vehicle-based jam-front detection, information transmission via intervehicle communication, and forecast of the spatial position of jam fronts by reconstructing the spatiotemporal traffic situation on the basis of the transmitted information. The whole system is simulated with an integrated traffic simulator, which is based on a realistic microscopic traffic model for longitudinal movements and lane changes. The function of its communication module has been explicitly validated by comparing the simulation results with analytical calculations. By means of simulations, it is shown that the algorithms for congestion-front recognition, message transmission, and processing reliably predict the existence and position of jam fronts for vehicle equipment rates as low as 3%. A reliable mode of operation for small market penetrations is crucial for successful introduction of intervehicle communication. The short-term prediction of jam fronts is not only useful for the driver but also essential for enhancing road safety and road capacity by intelligent adaptive cruise control systems.

ID ACCEPTANCE
AB The advent of road transport automation is suggested to be one of four key technological transitions that could amount to a major transformation in mobility practices. Specifically, fully Automated Vehicles (AVs) might replace the current private car owner user model with fleets of on-demand synchronously-shared automated taxis. However, significant barriers to this vision becoming the norm remain. This paper examines two critical user-acceptance aspects of the transition: willingness to adopt AVs, and willingness to share an AV with others, particularly strangers. Our novel survey (n = 899) included a choice experiment featuring four future full automation transport services (private, synchronously/asynchronously shared, and public). Cluster analysis examined respondents' preferences and their demographic and psycho-social characteristics. We uncover significant uncertainty about willingness to adopt automation and sharing, and important differences between clusters within our sample. For example, under 50% of participants report willingness to use an AV over their normal mode, or would prefer an automated option to a current human-driven option. Our findings raise critical questions for policymakers and transport authorities. Not least, how can AV technologies help realise the environmental and social benefits of widespread vehicle sharing in a context of a travelling public that still prefers its privacy on-the-move?

AB Autonomous vehicles (AVs) are paving a way to reshape the operation and management of urban transportation systems by improving travel mobility. In this study, we propose to use AVs for solving the first-mile (FM) problem that aims to transport passengers from their homes to metro stations. Passengers submit travel requests in advance and a fleet operator dispatches AVs and arranges ridesharing in a rolling horizon framework. The ridesharing is implemented by assigning one AV to serve several requests subject to the vehicle capacity, the maximum travel time, and the accessibility constraints. A mixed integer linear programming (MILP) model is formulated to determine the AV dispatch and ridesharing schemes for the minimum operational costs. Then, another MILP model with the objective of the maximum user satisfaction is formulated for the purpose of comparison. A cluster-based solution method is designed to deal with the large-scale FM problem. Extensive numerical experiments are conducted to demonstrate the application of the proposed method. Results show that ridesharing can reduce both required AV fleet size and vehicle traveled miles. The proposed solution method is able to solve the problem efficiently and fulfil the requirement of online computation.

AB This paper presents a neural network adaptive controller for diving control of an autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV). In general, while deriving the diving equations of an AUV, the pitch angle of the vehicle is often assumed to be small in the diving motion. This is a somewhat strong restricting condition in many practical applications, and would be broken in this paper. Furthermore, because the dynamics of AUVs are highly nonlinear and the hydrodynamic coefficients of the vehicles are difficult to be accurately estimated a priori, the smooth unknown dynamics in the pitch motion of an AUV is approximated by a neural network, and the remaining unstructured uncertainties, such as disturbances and unmodeled dynamics, are assumed to be unbounded, although they still satisfy certain growth conditions. Under a certain relaxed assumptions on the control gain functions, proposed control scheme can guarantee that all the signals in the closed-loop system satisfy to be uniformly ultimately bounded (UUB). Simulation studies are included to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed control scheme, and some practical features of the control laws are also discussed. (C) 2005 Elsevier B.V.

AB Human-robot interaction is inevitable due to the increase of the autonomous intelligent machines in the human vicinity. The autonomous machines should synchronize with the interacting human. The key factor for synchronized Human-Robot Interaction (HRI) is a human intention. The interacting machine must have the clue about the intention of the interacting human for a useful interaction. In this review paper, recently proposed intention-based approaches for human-robot interaction are discussed. The approaches are categorized concerning different aspects, e.g., application area, specialized and generalized estimation techniques, etc. The review categorized the recently proposed approaches into five categories. The categorization is mainly based on the application areas of the intention recognition approaches. The type of approaches includes general and application-specific approaches. The application areas include synchronized physical human-assistance, human-synchronized vehicles, etc. The vehicles are synchronized with the driver and the pedestrian. The study highlighted the currently active as well as the dormant areas of the intention-based human-robot interaction and indicated new directions.

AB Autonomous marine vehicles (AMVs) are typically deployed for long periods of time in the ocean to monitor different physical, chemical, and biological processes. Given their limited energy budgets, it makes sense to consider motion plans that leverage the dynamics of the surrounding flow field so as to minimize energy usage for these vehicles. In this letter, we present a graph-search based method to compute energy optimal paths for AMVs in 2-D time-varying flows. The novelty of the proposed algorithm lies in the use of an adaptive discretization scheme to construct the search graph. We demonstrate the proposed algorithm by computing optimal energy paths using an analytical time-varying flow model and using time-varying ocean flow data provided by the Regional Ocean Model System. We compare the output paths with those computed via an optimal control formulation and numerically demonstrate that the proposed method can overcome problems inherent in existing fixed discretization schemes.

AB In the underwater environment, installation of a proper scheme to cope with unexpected situations is essential for Autonomous Underwater Vehicles (AUVs) to carry out their mission out of human reach. This paper proposes a model-based approach of self-diagnosis for AUVs in order to supervise whether the vehicle operates itself in an appropriate way. The proposed self-diagnosis is carried out based on a dynamics model of an AUV and an active mechanism to obtain desirable information. The dynamics model is constructed by an artificial neural network taking advantage of its flexible learning capability. When a sensor is found to be defective, dead reckoning using its corresponding output of the dynamics model can be introduced in an attempt to cope with the defect. The performance of the proposed system was examined by implementing it on the 'Twin-Burger', a test-bed AUV. It is shown that the system without the introduction of extra sensors detects failures of onboard sensors and actuators, and then selects a proper action scheme to minimize the damage to the AUV.

This study presents a simulative evaluation of the theoretical allocation methods developed in Selmair and Maurer (2020) combined with either hard or dynamic availability rules to ascertain the most efficient parameters of an Autonomous Mobile Robot System. In order to quantify this efficiency, the following Key Performance Indicator (KPI) were considered: number of delayed orders, driven fleet metres and the percentage of available Autonomous Mobile Robot as determined by their state of charge. Additionally, as an alternative energy source, a fast-charging battery developed by Battery Streak Inc. was included in this study. The results show that, in comparison to a conventional and commonly used trivial strategy, our developed strategies provide superior results in terms of the relevant KPI.

ID ALGORITHM
AB Advanced Driver Assistance Systems (ADAS) are becoming more and more important in recent years. All relevant manufacturers equip their cars with various safety features and in some locations it is even mandatory to do so. One of such systems is Automatic Headlight Control (AHC) algorithm that prevents from accidental dazzling of other road users. Recognizing vehicle lights with high accuracy is crucial in this algorithm. Any improvement can result in the limitation of car accidents and dangerous situations on the road. The paper introduces a novel visual descriptor that describes previously binarized blob shapes of the analyzed objects. We also present our referenced AHC system that operates not only on the images but also on the set of other visual features. Adding new feature leads to the improvement of around 1.5 percentage point of vehicle lights classification accuracy (21% reduction of incorrectly classified light sources). It can also replace the already used features (four-time reduction from 32 to 8 feature values) and keep the classification accuracy at the similar level. The proposed solution has been tested with an extensive set of video sequences (total duration exceeding ten hours) under diverse weather conditions and from different types of roads. The proposed descriptor is shown to be far less computationally complex, and it is proved that it can outperform other state-of-the-art descriptors when analyzed individually.

AB A fundamental problem in traffic networks is driving under safety and limited physical space constraints. In this paper, we design longitudinal vehicle controllers and study the dynamics of a system of homogeneous vehicles on a single-lane ring road in order to understand the interplay of limited space, speed, and safety. Each vehicle in the system either operates in the cruise control mode or follows a vehicle ahead by keeping a safe time headway. We show that if the number of vehicles is less than a certain critical threshold, vehicles can occupy the limited space in many different configurations, i.e., different platoons of different sizes, and they converge to a uniform maximum speed while attenuating errors in the relative spacing upstream a platoon. If the number of vehicles exceeds the threshold, vehicles converge to a unique symmetric configuration and the equilibrium speed decreases as the number of vehicles increases. Next, we consider vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) communication and show that it increases the critical number of vehicles that can travel with the maximum speed. Finally, we consider vehicle coordination and show that the proposed controllers can force vehicles to converge to a desired configuration specified by the coordinator while maintaining safety and comfort. We demonstrate the performance of the proposed controllers via simulation.

AB article presents a new nonlinear observer-based method to detect the faults of both steering and torque actuators of autonomous ground vehicles. To this end, the nonlinear vehicle system is reformulated in a Takagi-Sugeno (TS) fuzzy model with both measured and unmeasured nonlinear consequents, called N-TS fuzzy model. Differently from the classical TS fuzzy technique with linear consequents, this N-TS fuzzy reformulation enables an effective use of differential mean value theorem to deal with unmeasured nonlinearities, which is known as a major challenge in TS fuzzy observer design. Moreover, the N-TS fuzzy form also allows reducing not only the design conservatism but also the nu-merical complexity of the design conditions as well as the observer structure, which is crucial for real-time vehicle application. To minimize the disturbance effect with an H-8 performance and maximize the fault sensibility with an H- performance, the a priori information on the disturbance/fault frequency ranges is taken into account in the N-TS fuzzy observer design via the generalized Kalman-Yakubovich-Popov (KYP) lemma. Based on Lyapunov stability theory, the design of the proposed multiobjective H-/H-8 N-TS fuzzy fault detector is recast as an optimization problem with strict linear matrix inequality (LMI) constraints, which can be effectively solved with numerical solvers. Both numerical and experiments are performed under realistic driving conditions to demonstrate the theoretical and practical interests of the new finite-frequency fuzzy fault detection method.

AB Preceding vehicle recognition is an important enabling technology for developing a driver assistance system and an autonomous vehicle system. However. this is difficult for computer vision to achieve because of the variety of shapes and colors in which vehicles are made. In this paper, we propose a novel vision-based preceding vehicle recognition method, which has the capability of recognizing a wide selection of vehicles. In the proposed method, classifiers learned from "vehicle" training samples and "nonvehicle' training samples are used to enable recognition. We also propose a novel classification method, the "multiclustered modified quadratic discriminant function" (NIC-MQDF). The MC-MQDF is capable of estimating the complex distribution due to the variety of different possible appearances for preceding vehicles. In order to confirm the feasibility of recognizing various vehicles, and to demonstrate the advantage of the MC-MQDF over the MQDF, classification experiments were carried out using the images of various vehicles. In a complex distribution test including a variety of vehicles the classification rate for the MC-MQDF was approximately 98%, whereas the classification rate for the, ordinary MQDF technique was approximately 93%. This supports the superiority of the MC-MQDF technique over the MQDF technique, and demonstrates the feasibility of recognizing a variety of different vehicles.

AB In general, the strap-down inertial navigation system (SINS)/Doppler velocity log (DVL)-integrated navigation method can provide continuous and accurate navigation information for autonomous underwater vehicles (AUV). This SINS/DVL fusion is the loosely integrated method, in which DVL may contain large error or does not work when some beam measurements are inaccurate or outages for complex underwater environment. To solve these problems, in this article, a novel tightly integrated navigation method composed of an SINS, a DVL, and a pressure sensor (PS) is proposed, in which beam measurements are used without transforming them to 3-D velocity. The simulation and vehicle test show that the proposed method can significantly outperform the traditional loosely integrated method in providing estimation continuously with higher accuracy when DVL data are inaccurate or unavailable for a complex environment. Compared with loosely integrated method, the position accuracy of the proposed method has improved by 32.5%y.

AB A novel strategy to enhance string stability of autonomous vehicles with sensor delay and actuator lag is proposed based on a model predictive control framework. To compensate sensor delay, the approach entails estimating the (unknown) system state at the current time using the system state in a previous time, the applied control history and a system dynamics model. The actuator lag is compensated by including the lag in the state prediction model. The mathematical framework shows that without the anticipation strategy, sensor delay leads to a worse estimate of the initial condition for the optimal control problem and actuator lag increases the mismatch between the system state prediction model and the actual system behaviour. Simulation verified that sensor delay and actuator lag degrade string stability of platoons. The proposed anticipatory control strategy shows clear benefits in improving autonomous vehicle string stability and hence has potential to enhance traffic flow stability.

TI TRANSIENT ANALYSIS OF HYDRODYNAMIC INTERACTION EFFECTS ON AN AUTONOMOUS
   UNDERWATER VEHICLE IN PROXIMITY OF A MOVING SUBMARINE
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MARITIME ENGINEERING
LA English
DT Article
AB When an Autonomous Underwater Vehicle (AUV) is operating close to a moving submarine, the hydrodynamic interaction between the two vehicles can prevent the AUV from maintaining its desired trajectory. This can lead to mission failure and, in extreme cases, collision with the submarine. This paper outlines the transient interaction influence on the hydrodynamic coefficients of an AUV operating in close proximity and in relative motion to a larger moving submarine. The effects of relative motion on the interaction behaviour were investigated via two manoeuvres, i.e. the AUV overtaking and being overtaken by the submarine at different relative forward velocities and lateral distances. The results presented are from a series of Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) simulations on axisymmetric AUV and submarine hull forms, with validation of the CFD model carried out through scaled captive model experiments. The results showed that an AUV becomes less susceptible to the interaction influence when overtaking at speeds higher than the submarine. The implications of the interaction influence on the AUV's ability to safely manoeuvre around the submarine are also discussed.

AB Dedicated lanes for autonomous vehicles (AV) are introduced as an effective strategy to improve mobility in mixed traffic of AVs and heterogeneous drivers. However, adding a new lane is costly, and dedicating an existing lane may increase traffic congestion in other lanes. Previous studies investigated the impacts of AV dedicated lanes on throughput at the segment level and/or assumed a fixed route choice. However, AV dedicated lanes change route choice behavior, which affects traffic distribution over the network. Therefore, this study explores the impacts of AV dedicated lanes on the traffic performance of large-scale networks by conducting a network-level cost-benefit analysis on the implementation of AV dedicated lanes under different demand and AV market penetration rate (MPR) scenarios. This study examines the impacts of implementing AV dedicated lanes to freeway links on traffic congestion at corridor and network levels. Various factors are explored: changes in aggregate flow-density relationships, throughput, and average travel times. To this end, DYNASMART-P software is updated to consider AV dedicated lanes and is used to simulate the mixed traffic. Traffic simulation analyses on the large-scale network of Chicago indicate that these impacts depend on the AV MPR, demand level, and AV dedicated lane implementation approach. Dedicated lanes for AVs are beneficial for a high demand level scenario at all AV MPRs. However, for the base demand scenario, (760,000 vehicles during a.m. peak), deploying such lanes is only justified for low AV MPRs. Furthermore, the impacts of AV dedicated lanes on traffic at the network level are different from those on single segments.

AB This paper presents comprehensive testing and analysis of a particle filter (PF) framework for real-time terrain navigation on an autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV). The goal is to obtain georeferenced localization for an AUV navigation system using reference bathymetry maps and bathymetric measurements in lieu of Global Positioning System (GPS) updates or acoustic localization methods such as long baseline (LBL). The algorithms are tested using navigation and sensor data collected during a long-distance run of the midsize autonomous reconfigurable vehicle (MARV) AUV, during which the Inertial Navigation System (INS) accumulated significant horizontal position error (>100 m). Run data sets over areas of both high and low bathymetric relief are used to compare performance with different altitude sensors, including multibeam and single-beam sonar, and four-beam Doppler velocity logger (DVL) sonar. A comparison of established techniques for dealing with tide levels is also presented. The technique of adding a third dimension to the PF state vector to compensate for changing water levels allowed the estimator to work consistently in areas of low bathymetric relief, where relative terrain profiling methods broke down and even slight errors in tide prediction models otherwise caused significant position errors. The effects of decreased vertical resolution and accuracy of the reference map is also investigated. To address problems of insufficient sample size, a novel PF resampling technique is presented in which jittering noise added to duplicate samples is scaled based on the particle cloud volume. This technique allows the PF to consistently recover a position fix over a search area of several kilometers without needing to significantly increase the number of particles used.

AB Bottleneck areas are prone to severe traffic congestion due to the sudden drop in capacity. To improve traffic efficiency in the bottleneck area, this paper proposes a multi-agent deep reinforcement learning framework integrating collision avoidance strategies to improve traffic efficiency in a mandatory lane change scenario. The proposed method considers distance-keeping and lane-changing coordination in a connected autonomous vehicle (CAV) environment, by controlling vehicles' longitudinal and lateral movement to effectively reduce traffic congestion in a mandatory lane change scenario. This framework was trained and tested in a simulation environment that is the same as the natural driving environment. Compared with real-world data and the benchmark model (a Dueling Double Deep Q-Network-based model), the proposed model shows better performance in terms of average speed, travel time, throughput, and safety in the bottleneck area. The results show that the proposed model can effectively reduce traffic congestion and improve traffic efficiency in a mandatory lane change scenario.

AB Rural areas often face communication challenges due to limited mobile coverage on remote roads, posing significant difficulties in reporting emergencies and accidents. This study presented an autonomous vehicle tracking system using low-cost radar sensors to detect possible emergencies in the sections of roads with low cell coverage. The radar sensor system could determine the number of vehicles that passed through the nodes and classify them based on the vehicle type. Each node within the system is equipped with ten radars, a processor unit, and a radio transmitter to communicate with the network in real-time, achieving a rapid response time of just 0.2 s. To ensure seamless connectivity, two distinct wireless communication networks are employed, one for the connection between the towers in the same node and the other for the connection between nodes and a center with cellular coverage. The results of this study can be useful in conveying emergency messages, as well as traffic management.

AB This paper addresses the distributed dynamic rendezvous control problem of the AUV-USV heterogeneous joint system in the presence of unknown external disturbances using nonlinear model predictive control. By utilizing the nonlinear model predictive control framework, the rendezvous problem can be solved without constructing explicit error dynamics of the heterogeneous system. The inputs and states constraints such as spatial and ve-locity constraints can also be considered simultaneously in an intuitive way. To facilitate distributed imple-mentations, distributed optimization problems with incorporated moving suppression are then constructed to guarantee nominal stability. Considering unknown external disturbances, a practical disturbance compensating method is finally proposed, ensuring the satisfaction of state constraints. The nominal recursive feasibility and stability are proved in this paper. Compared with existing works, the proposed scheme improves the applicability and robustness against external disturbances for dynamic rendezvous between two heterogeneous robots. Sim-ulations and comparisons are conducted to demonstrate the effectiveness and advantages of the proposed method.

DT Article; Data Paper
ID STATISTICAL-ANALYSIS; SAFETY
AB Autonomous Vehicles (AVs) are being widely tested on public roads in several countries such as the USA, Canada, France, Germany, and Australia. For the transparent deployment of AVs in California, the California Department of Motor Vehicles (CA DMV) commissioned AV manufacturers to draft and publish reports on disengagements and crashes. These reports must be processed before any statistical analysis, which is cumbersome and time-consuming. Our dataset presents the processed disengagement data from 2014 to 2019, crash data till the 10th of March 2020 and supplementary road network and land-use data extracted from OpenStreetMap. Primary data are manually assessed and converted into an easily processed format. Our processed data will be advantageous to the research community and enable accelerated research in this domain. For example, the data can be utilised to discern trends in disengagement, observe the distribution of disengagement causes, and investigate the contributory factors of the crashes. Such investigations can subsequently improve the reporting protocols and make policies and laws for the smooth deployment of this disruptive technology.

AB The present study proposes a method that numerically quantifies automotive safety integrity level (ASIL). Additionally, the method reduces the uncertainty in the risk estimation step by subdividing the ASIL step by applying fuzzy theory to reduce the ambiguity of ASIL with an extremely wide step. The conventional risk-based design concept is adopted to quantify ASIL, and fuzzy modeling is used to express the vehicle safety integrity ratings of uncertain automotive electrical equipment. To overcome the uncertainty, we fuzzify the variable using the mean expected value method and select the trapezoidal fuzzy number. The final fuzzy output is generated using Mamdani's method with 25 fuzzy rules combined with variables to obtain risk. This theory provides a useful approach for overcoming the inherent uncertainty in ASIL. We attempt to establish the effectiveness of the proposed method by utilizing it to quantify the automatic emergency-braking device scenario, which is a typical target system.

AB We propose an autonomous blockchain-based federated learning (BFL) design for privacy-aware and efficient vehicular communication networking, where local on-vehicle machine learning (oVML) model updates are exchanged and verified in a distributed fashion. BFL enables oVML without any centralized training data or coordination by utilizing the consensus mechanism of the blockchain. Relying on a renewal reward approach, we develop a mathematical framework that features the controllable network and BFL parameters (e.g., the retransmission limit, block size, block arrival rate, and the frame sizes) so as to capture their impact on the system-level performance. More importantly, our rigorous analysis of oVML system dynamics quantifies the end-to-end delay with BFL, which provides important insights into deriving optimal block arrival rate by considering communication and consensus delays. We present a variety of numerical and simulation results highlighting various non-trivial findings and insights for adaptive BFL design. In particular, based on analytical results, we minimize the system delay by exploiting the channel dynamics and demonstrate that the proposed idea of tuning the block arrival rate is provably online and capable of driving the system dynamics to the desired operating point. It also identifies the improved dependency on other blockchain parameters for a given set of channel conditions, retransmission limits, and frame sizes. (1) However, a number of challenges (gaps in knowledge) need to be resolved in order to realise these changes. In particular, we identify key bottleneck challenges requiring further investigations, and provide potential future reserach directions. (1) An early version of this work has been accepted for presentation in IEEE WCNC Wksps 2020 [1].

AB This paper proposes a framework for obstacle-avoiding autonomous unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) systems with a new obstacle avoidance method (OAM) and localization method for autonomous UAVs for structural health monitoring (SHM) in GPS-denied areas. There are high possibilities of obstacles in the planned trajectory of autonomous UAVs used for monitoring purposes. A traditional UAV localization method with an ultrasonic beacon is limited to the scope of the monitoring and vulnerable to both depleted battery and environmental electromagnetic fields. To overcome these critical problems, a deep learning-based OAM with the integration of You Only Look Once version 3 (YOLOv3) and a fiducial marker-based UAV localization method are proposed. These new obstacle avoidance and localization methods are integrated with a real-time damage segmentation method as an autonomous UAV system for SHM. In indoor testing and outdoor tests in a large parking structure, the proposed methods showed superior performances in obstacle avoidance and UAV localization compared to traditional approaches.

AB Electric motors play a pivotal role in the functioning of autonomous vehicles, necessitating accurate fault diagnosis to ensure vehicle safety and reliability. In this paper, a novel motor fault diagnosis approach grounded in vibration signals to enhance fault detection performance is presented. The method involves capturing vibration signals from the motor across various operational states and frequencies using vibration sensors. Subsequently, the signals undergo transformation into frequency domain representations through fast Fourier transform. This includes normalizing and concatenating the amplitude frequency and phase frequency signals into comprehensive frequency domain information. Leveraging Gramian image-encoding attributes, cross-domain fusion of time-domain and frequency-domain data is achieved. Finally, the fused Gram angle field map is fed into the ConvMixer deep learning model, augmented by the ECA mechanism to facilitate precise motor fault identification. Experimental outcomes underscore the efficacy of cross-domain data fusion, showcasing improved pattern recognition and recognition rates for the models compared to traditional time-domain methods. Additionally, a comparative analysis of various deep learning models highlights the superior performance of the ECA-ConvMixer model. This study makes significant contributions by introducing a cross-domain data fusion method, merging time-domain and frequency-domain information to enhance motor vibration signal analysis. Additionally, the incorporation of the ECA-ConvMixer deep learning model, equipped with attention mechanisms, effectively captures critical features, thus serving as a robust tool for motor fault diagnosis. These innovations not only enhance diagnostic accuracy but also have broad applications in areas like autonomous vehicles and industry, leading to reduced maintenance expenses and enhanced equipment reliability.

ID PIPELINE
AB Binocular vision target detection algorithms generally require selection of a large number of keypoints, which result in a heavy computational effort for online calculation and the lack of ability to utilize spatial semantic information to full advantage. This paper proposed a stereo priori RCNN based car detection method on point level for autonomous driving. The algorithm combines traditional Region Proposal Network (RPN) with a Mask-branch mechanism, which improves the accuracy of 3D target detection through minimizing luminosity errors, and employs RGB images to provide semantic information for spatial point-clouds. Firstly, the proposed algorithm obtains bounding boxes of left and right images through RPN and classification networks. Then, the prior information of vehicles and branched convolutional neural networks are used to extract wheel features from a feature map. Therefore, the coordinates and orientation of vehicles on bird eye map can be fitted. Afterward, by predicting the keypoints, a 3D bounding box of each vehicle is roughly restored. Then Region of Interest (ROI) is applied on both sides of left and right cameras to minimize the photometric error, so that the precise position and the size of the detection frame are obtained. In the meantime, a Mask-branch mechanism is adopted to achieve a precise semantic segmentation of each ROI. Finally, a 3D bounding box of vehicles is used for point-cloud segmentation, and the semantic information provided by the Mask-branch is exploited to improve the segmentation accuracy. Extensive numerical experiments are conducted on the Kitti dataset and nuScenes dataset to demonstrate the efficiency and effectiveness of the proposed algorithm. (C) 2021 Elsevier B.V.

AB To demonstrate the expected performance of an advanced driver assistance system (ADAS) in an intelligent or a highly automated vehicle test approaches should include a combination of simulations, track tests, and road tests. The main objective of our work was to propose a new evaluation approach conducted by an external entity where the vehicle is treated as a black box. This approach allowed for the identification of a set of worst-case scenarios for a given ADAS application and combined the three test approaches mentioned earlier. Our proposed evaluation approach is broken down into three parts: (1) Scenarios synthesis, sampling strategy, and simulations, (2) Risk assessment and classification, and (3) Validation. In this article, we present our proposed approach for the validation portion. The validation portion can be further broken down into three parts. The first step included a description of the studied autonomous emergency braking (AEB), physical track tests, and of the different machines and ensemble learning techniques employed to create the predictive model. The second part utilized the Field Operational Tests database (SPMD), to implement the new sampling strategy based on the original, modified, and multivariate Metropolis-Hastings algorithm. The third part focused on collecting the prediction results, then assess the risk of each test, to classify them using a non-supervised technique (k-Means clustering). This allowed us to build a set of worst-case scenarios to make a final selection. Finally, two web applications were developed and deployed.

AB In the future, autonomous vehicles are expected to safely move people and cargo around. However, as of now, automated entities do not necessarily outperform human drivers under all circumstances, particularly under certain road and environmental factors such as bright light, heavy rain, poor quality of road and traffic signs, etc. Therefore, in certain conditions it is safer for the driver to take over the control of the vehicle. However, switching control back and forth between the human driver and the automated driving entity may itself pose a short-term, elevated risk, particularly because of the out of the loop (OOTL) issue for humans. In this study, we develop a mathematical framework to determine the optimal driving-entity switching policy between the automated driving entity and the human driver. Specifically, we develop a Markov decision process (MDP) model to prescribe the entity in charge to minimize the expected safety cost of a trip, considering the dynamic changes of the road/environment during the trip. In addition, we develop a partially observable Markov decision process (POMDP) model to accommodate the fact that the risk posed by the immediate road/environment may only be partially observed. We conduct extensive numerical experiments and thorough sensitivity and robustness analyses, where we also compare the expected safety cost of trips under the optimal and single driving entity policies. In addition, we quantify the risks associated with the policies, as well as the impact of miss-estimating road/environment condition risk level by the driving entities, and provide insights. The proposed frameworks can be used as a policy tool to identify factors that can render a region suitable for level four autonomy.

AB Recently, autonomous driving has become one of the most popular topics for smart vehicles. However, traditional control strategies are mostly rule-based, which have poor adaptability to the time-varying traffic conditions. Similarly, they have difficulty coping with unexpected situations that may occur any time in the real-world environment. Hence, in this paper, we exploited Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) to enhance the quality and safety of autonomous driving control. Based on the road scenes and self-driving simulation modules provided by AirSim, we used the Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (DDPG) and Recurrent Deterministic Policy Gradient (RDPG) algorithms, combined with the Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), to realize the autonomous driving control of self-driving cars. In particular, by using the real-time images of the road provided by AirSim as the training data, we carefully formulated an appropriate reward-generation method to improve the convergence speed of the adopted DDPG and RDPG models and the control performance of moving driverless cars.

   CURVATURE; ONLINE ESTIMATION
AB There are many efforts being made toward the visual navigation system for the autonomous vehicle. When the highway road is considered, where the constraint for the road structure can be utilized, it is effective to extract the white line (lane marker), which is enforced to be drawn as the borderline of the lane.
   This paper considers the automatic extraction of the road edge from the white line in the road image taken by the vehicle camera. There is already proposed a technique which assumes that the road edge image is extracted from the white line, and estimates the horizontal curvature of the, road and the vibration component of the vehicle (dynamic angle of the vehicle). It is adequate to use the break (end point) of the white dashed line as the feature point for estimation of the vehicle angle. To extract the road edge from the dashed line, however, it is required to trace the dashed line which moves between consecutive frames.
   From such a viewpoint, this paper utilizes the result obtained by the already proposed estimation method for the vehicle angle, and predicts the motion of the end-point of the dashed line on the image due to the motion of a vehicle. By restricting the range of search based on the result, the end-point is tracked. An experiment was conducted, for the sequence of the image taken for the actual road. It is verified that a sufficient accuracy is obtained for the position prediction, so that the restricted range of search contains the end-point, which will help the automatic extraction of the road edge. Then, a system is constructed as a cooperative system, which estimates the vehicle angle the road shape from the real image, using the automatically extracted road edge.
   It is verified by an on-line experiment for the real image that the vehicle angle and the horizontal curvature of the road can effectively be estimated. Those results are reported in this paper.

AB As the major transportation infrastructure, roads play an important role in intelligent transportation system. However, the intelligent level of roads is insufficient currently, which does not match the development needs of autonomous vehicles in the near future. In order to improve the intelligence level of road infrastructures, a distributed acceleration sensing node array was embedded in the pavement to collect pavement vibration signals under the action of vehicle moving load to sense the traffic information. A complete set of processing algorithms, including raw data preprocessing algorithm, same vehicle judgment algorithm and vehicle information analysis algorithm, is proposed to extract the traffic information from the monitored vibration data. The traffic information such as vehicle speed, axle numbers, wheelbases, load position, and traffic flows are obtained. The acquired traffic information can support intelligent traffic control as well as scientific road maintenance.

AB Autonomous vehicles and robots require increasingly more robustness and reliability to meet the demands of modern tasks. These requirements specially apply to cameras onboard such vehicles because they are the predominant sensors to acquire information about the environment and support actions. Cameras must maintain proper functionality and take automatic countermeasures if necessary. Existing solutions are typically tailored to specific problems or detached from the downstream computer vision tasks of the machines, which, however, determine the requirements on the quality of the produced camera images. We propose a generic and task-oriented self-health-maintenance framework for cameras based on data-and physically-grounded models. To this end, we determine two reliable, real-time capable estimators for typical image effects of a camera in poor condition (blur, noise phenomena and most common combinations) by evaluating traditional and customized machine learning-based approaches in extensive experiments. Furthermore, we implement the framework on a real-world ground vehicle and demonstrate how a camera can adjust its parameters to counter an identified poor condition to achieve optimal application capability based on experimental (non-linear and non-monotonic) input-output performance curves. Object detection is chosen as target application, and the image effects motion blur and sensor noise as conditioning examples. Our framework not only provides a practical ready-to-use solution to monitor and maintain the health of cameras, but can also serve as a basis for extensions to tackle more sophisticated problems that combine additional data sources (e.g., sensor or environment parameters) empirically in order to attain fully reliable and robust machines.

AB Sight distance is an important indicator of vehicle safety at intersections. Traditional intersection design methods might be not suitable for the autonomous vehicle (AV) because its perception differs from that of the human driver, on which AASHTO Greenbook 2018 are based. Since, to guarantee future operational safety, intersection design needs to consider the impact of the AV, this study investigates and quantifies the relationships between intersection angle on skewed intersections. The operational design domain (ODD) is defined as the required detecting angle and distance within the skewed intersection's speed range. Calculations for acute-side detecting angle, obtuse-side detecting angle, and obtuse-side detecting distance formulae were developed based on sine theorem and inverse trigonometric function; leg length of the sight triangle along an intersection's major road was calculated by multiplying the design speed by the time gap. Calculation results show that the current design criteria cannot provide sufficient sight distance for the AV if the approach speed is not controlled. The AV's higher approach speed, even when controlled, can improve both intersection safety and efficiency. The ODD requires different detecting angles and distances for the intersection angles of 55, 60, 65, 70, 75, 80 degrees. Intersection angle was found to have greater influence on the detecting angle when the road design speed was higher than 40 km/h, and the obtuse-side detecting distance increased rapidly when speed on the major road reached 50 km/h. For AV safety performance, engineers should incorporate the AV's detecting angle, distance, and time gap into the skewed intersection design criteria. AVs technology needs to comply with the ODD defined by the intersection geometrics.

AB One of the recent developments in safety systems is an external airbag installed on the front bumper of a vehicle and autonomous emergency braking system. In this paper, we propose a framework for a cost-benefit analysis of the external airbag and autonomous emergency braking system in order to validate its commercialization. Road traffic crash data obtained from the National Automotive Sampling System/Crashworthiness Data System (NASS/CDS) was used, and three different crash types related to frontal damage in vehicles were extracted to estimate the safety performance of an external airbag. An ordinal logistic regression model was applied to estimate the safety performance in terms of the reduced maximum abbreviated injury scale (MAIS) based on a reduction in the total delta-v following the installation of an external airbag. Given the estimated safety performance of the external airbag, a cost-benefit analysis is conducted. According to the results, the external airbag system saves 46% of occupants with MAIS 3+ injuries and prevents 40% of fatalities. Moreover, the benefit/cost ratios of the external airbag system range from 0.496 to 0.509 depending on the scenario. Lastly, sensitivity analyses were performed with important parameters, including the initial and maximum market penetration ratio and the price of the system. This study aims to evaluate the technology of safety devices by analyzing the effectiveness of a new safety device using real-world vehicle accident data. We also statistically estimated its effectiveness and analyzed its societal value. We expect that our comprehensive findings will be helpful in evaluating the effectiveness of safety devices.

AB Green Connected and Autonomous Vehicles (CAVs) are the future of next-generation Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS) that will help humans to improve road safety and reduce pollution, energy consumption, and travel delays. To increase the performance of green CAV, the data generated by Autonomous Vehicles (AVs) and associated infrastructure needs to be processed in real-time. Mobile Edge Computing (MEC) is a promising paradigm that can be integrated with green CAV to save energy and to improve the network performance in terms of low latency for data processing. However, MEC servers and other communication entities in green CAV environment cannot be fully trusted and may bring vulnerabilities related to data privacy and security. Motivated by the above challenges, we design a blockchain and Deep-Learning (DL)-enabled secure data processing framework for an edge-envisioned green CAV environment (hereafter referred to as BDEdge). In blockchain-based scheme, all communication entities are registered, verified and thereafter validated using smart contract-based Practical Byzantine Fault Tolerance (PBFT) consensus algorithm. The authenticated data is forwarded to DL scheme. In DL-based scheme, an Intrusion Detection System (IDS) based on a hybrid model of Sparse Auto-Encoder-enabled Attention Bidirectional Gated Recurrent Unit (SAE-ABIGRU) is designed by analyzing the link load behaviors of the MEC-enabled Road Side Unit (RSU) server. The security analysis and comparative simulation findings shows that the proposed BDEdge framework can significantly reduce false alarm rate and increase accuracy close to 99%.

AB This paper discusses the navigation, guidance and control (NGC) of the Hammerhead autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV). The navigation system is based on the integrated use of the global positioning system (GPS) and several inertial navigation system (INS) sensors. A simple Kalman filter (SKF) and an extended Kalman filter (EKF) are proposed to be used subsequently to fuse the data from the INS sensors and to integrate them with that of the GPS. This paper highlights the use of soft computing techniques, with an emphasis on fuzzy logic and genetic algorithms (GAs), both in single- and multiobjective modes to the adaptation of the initial statistical assumption of both the SKF and EKF caused by possible changes in sensor noise characteristics. It will be shown how the adaptation made by the proposed techniques is able to enhance the accuracy of the navigation system and hence it is considered as a major contribution of this particular study in relation to AUV technology.
   The guidance and control system is based on a model predictive controller (MPC). The conventional MPC assumes a quadratic cost function and an optimization method such as quadratic programming (QP) to determine the optimum input to the process. For vehicle implementation, two modifications arc proposed to the standard MPC problem. The first involves the replacement of the conventional optimizer with a GA in single objective mode whilst the quadratic cost function is replaced by a fuzzy performance index. The advantages of both schemes are outlined and simulation results are presented to evaluate the performance of the proposed techniques, Copyright (c) 2006 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB The human factor plays a key role in the automotive field since most accidents are due to drivers' unsafe and risky behaviors. The industry is now pursuing two main solutions to deal with this concern: in the short term, there is the development of systems monitoring drivers' psychophysical states, such as inattention and fatigue, and in the medium-long term, there is the development of fully autonomous driving. This second solution is promoted by recent technological progress in terms of Artificial Intelligence and sensing systems aimed at making vehicles more and more accurately aware of their "surroundings." However, even with an autonomous vehicle, the driver should be able to take control of the vehicle when needed, especially during the current transition from the lower (SAE < 3) to the highest level (SAE = 5) of autonomous driving. In this scenario, the vehicle has to be aware not only of its "surroundings" but also of the driver's psychophysical state, i.e., a user-centered Artificial Intelligence. The neurophysiological approach is one the most effective in detecting improper mental states. This is particularly true if considering that the more automatic the driving will be, the less available the vehicular data related to the driver's driving style. The present study aimed at employing a holistic approach, considering simultaneously several neurophysiological parameters, in particular, electroencephalographic, electrooculographic, photopletismographic, and electrodermal activity data to assess the driver's mental fatigue in real time and to detect the onset of fatigue increasing. This would ideally work as an information/trigger channel for the vehicle AI. In all, 26 professional drivers were engaged in a 45-min-lasting realistic driving task in simulated conditions, during which the previously listed biosignals were recorded. Behavioral (reaction times) and subjective measures were also collected to validate the experimental design and to support the neurophysiological results discussion. Results showed that the most sensitive and timely parameters were those related to brain activity. To a lesser extent, those related to ocular parameters were also sensitive to the onset of mental fatigue, but with a delayed effect. The other investigated parameters did not significantly change during the experimental session.

AB Problem definition: Autonomous vehicles (AVs) are predicted to enter the consumer market in less than a decade. There is currently no consensus on whether their presence will have a positive impact on users and society. The skeptics of automation foresee increased congestion, whereas the advocates envision smoother traffic with shorter travel times. We study the automation controversy and advise policymakers on how and when to promote AVs. Academic/practical relevance: The AV technology is advancing rapidly and there is a need to study its impact on social welfare and the likelihood of its adoption by the public. Methodology: We use supply-demand theory to find the equilibrium number of trips for autonomous and regular households. We develop a simulation model of peer-to-peer AV sharing. We compare the socially optimal level of automation with the selfish adoption patterns where households independently choose their vehicle type. Results: We establish that the optimal social welfare is influenced by: (i) the network connectivity, that is, the ability of the infrastructure to serve AVs, (ii) the additional comfort provided by AVs that allows passengers to engage in other productive activities instead of driving, and (iii) the AV sharing patterns that reduce ownership costs, but create empty vehicle trips that increase congestion. Managerial implications: We investigate the impact of AVs in a case study of Toronto and show that partial automation maximizes social welfare. We show that the comfort of AVs may add traffic that compromises social welfare. Moreover, although traffic increases with automation, travel times may decrease because of significant improvements in traffic flow caused by AV connectivity in the network.

AB On 31 December 2012, an instrumented autonomous surface vehicle (ASV; Wave Glider) transiting across the Pacific from Hawaii to Australia as part of the Pacific Crossing (PacX) project came very close (46 km) to the center of a category 3 Tropical Cyclone (TC), Freda, experiencing winds of up to 37 ms(-1) and significant wave heights close to 10 m. The Wave Glider was instrumented for surface ocean-lower atmosphere (SOLA) measurements, including atmospheric pressure, surface winds and temperature, sea surface temperature, salinity, dissolved oxygen, fluorescence (chlorophyll-a and turbidity), and surface-wave directional spectra. Such measurements in close proximity to a tropical cyclone are rare. This study presents novel observations of the ocean's response in three quadrants of TC Freda, collected from the instrumented glider. Evolution of the wind, the directional wave field, the sea surface temperature, and the Stokes drift profile (calculated from the wave directional spectrum) as Freda passed near the vehicle are examined. Results are discussed in the context of the recent coupled wind-wave modeling and large eddy simulation (LES) modeling of the marine boundary layer in Hurricane Frances (Sullivan et al. 2012). Processes by which cold nutrient-rich waters are entrained and mixed from below into the mixed layer as the TC passes near the Wave Glider are presented and discussed. The results of this encounter of an autonomous surface vehicle with TC Freda supports the use of ASVs for regular TC (hurricane) monitoring to complement remote sensing and "hurricane hunter" aircraft missions.

AB CAVs (Connected Autonomous Vehicles) can be effective in improving the efficiency of transportation, but heterogeneous multi-modal traffic flows may hinder this efficiency. This paper addresses the issue of heterogeneous traffic flows affecting the efficiency of transportation when CAVs enter the market and proposes a joint dedicated lane for CAVs and buses. In the bi-level program model for the joint dedicated lane, the lower-level is aimed at the multi-modal traffic assignment problem, while the upper-level is aimed at system optimality. For the lower-level, the paper examines the characteristics of various traffic flows in a mixed traffic flow, investigates the impact of CAV mixing on the road link's capacity, calculates the travel time of various traffic modes accordingly, and generates a generalized travel cost function for each mode, which is solved using the diagonalized weighted successive averaging method (MSWA) algorithm. The upper-level issue considers the continuity of dedicated and non-dedicated road segments, and the goal is to reduce the overall cost for all travelers by utilizing the dedicated road deployment scheme as the decision variable, which is addressed using a genetic algorithm. Finally, numerical examples and sensitivity analyses are designed accordingly. The numerical example demonstrates that the joint dedicated lane not only lowers the overall cost of the system, but also enhances the efficiency of CAV and bus travel, optimizing the road network and promoting bus and CAV travel modes. The sensitivity analysis shows that in order to set up a joint dedicated lane, the frequency of bus departures and the penetration of CAVs are conditions that must be considered, and that the benefits of a joint dedicated lane can only be fully realized if the frequency of bus departures and the penetration of CAVs are appropriate.

AB The introduction of Autonomous Vehicles (AVs) into cities may fundamentally transform the design and use of cities. On one hand, AVs offer the potential to reduce the urban space requirements for roads and parking, creating more space for high-quality, liveable areas. On the other hand, greater motorisation and the availability to perform leisure or work activities while travelling in AVs could increase the number of trips and travel distances, encouraging urban traffic congestion and sprawl. These diverse, and sometimes conflicting, estimates and opinions give rise to considerable uncertainty among urban policy decision-makers, sometimes leading to planning inaction. This paper aims to shed light on the opportunities that AVs offer in delivering attractive, healthy and sustainable urbanisation patterns. This paper employs a backcasting approach to investigate whether and how the potential impacts of AV implementation can support or threaten a range of urban development policy goals. This approach enables conflicts between policy goals to be identified. The findings point to the need for mixed-use development policy, the clustering of urban facilities and services, the restriction of motorized access in cities and the adoption of shared high-quality multimodal transport.

DE wireless power transfer (WPT); autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV);

AB When the wireless power transfer (WPT) system is installed on the autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV), there is a non-negligible eddy current loss around the coupler. The existence of the ferrite core causes the nonlinear distortion of the magnetic field, which makes the design of the WPT coupler more complicated and difficult. In this paper, the key parameters that affect the performance of the coupler were obtained through calculation and finite element analysis (FEA). Then, the coupler was parametrically modeled in Maxwell, and the Non-dominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm (NSGA-II) was used to optimize its design, considering two objective functions: mutual inductance and equivalent coupler loss impedance (ECLI). Finally, twenty groups of Pareto optimal points were evaluated using the Technique for Ordering Preferences by Similarity to Ideal Solution (TOPSIS) method. Five groups of design points with different weights were screened out. The effectiveness of the optimization process was verified by comparing the optimization results with the initial results.

DE Platoon control via autonomous vehicles (AVs) the number of HDVs that

ID CONTROLLABILITY ANALYSIS; COMPLEX NETWORKS; PLATOON CONTROL
AB The emergence of autonomous vehicles (AVs) is expected to revolutionize road transportation and it has been demonstrated that AVs can be employed as mobile actuators to effectively dissipate stop and go waves. This paper proposes a comprehensive theoretical framework including stability and implementation considerations for analyzing traffic platoon control via sparse AVs and discussing the number of HDVs that can be stabilized by one AV. Considering multiple disturbance sources, we first discuss the output error composition and analyze traffic dynamics in a platoon system. Then we discuss the Lyapunov asymptotic stability (LAS) of the system based on eigenvalue analysis and propose a novel ring string stability (RSS), which ensures the boundedness of disturbance error and guarantees that the effect of disturbance will not be amplified over a lap. The proposed RSS is flexible and applicable to mixed traffic, since the string instability for predecessor-follower pairs are allowed, provided they can be compensated by AVs. In addition, the practical constraints including driving safety and vehicle physical limitations are modeled. The worst-case evaluation of constraints is conducted to reproduce the critical scenarios in real life. Finally, we conduct numerical experiments and analyze the traffic platoon control from the aspects of both stability and practical implementations. New findings include: (1) The introduction of AVs is beneficial to dampen the waves and stabilize the HDV flow. (2) Considering the implementation issues, there is an upper bound of HDVs that can be stabilized by one single AV. (3) As the number and amplitudes of exogenous disturbances increase, it will be more challenging for sparse AVs to ensure stability and meanwhile satisfy the practical constraints.

AB Low communication delay is crucial for the effectiveness of connected-autonomous-vehicle-based (CAV-based) intersection control strategies. To achieve low vehicle-to-road-side-unit (V2R) communication delay and support the implementation of CAV-based intersection control strategies, this study addresses the problem of road side unit (RSU) location optimization at a single intersection. Considering the uncertainty of the selection of intersection control strategies, the problem is formulated as a two-stage stochastic mixed-integer nonlinear program. The model aims to minimize the sum of the cost associated with RSU investment and the expectation of the penalty cost associated with V2R communication delay exceeding a pre-determined threshold. The first stage of the program determines the number and location of RSUs, when the intersection control strategy to be implemented is unknown. Given the first stage decision and the implemented intersection control strategy, the second stage model optimizes the detection area allocation among RSUs to minimize the penalty cost. The model is linearized using the piecewise linearization technique. Then an integer L-Shaped algorithm is proposed to find a global optimal solution to the linearized program. In the numerical example, the proposed model is compared with a deterministic model. The results demonstrate that the V2R communication reduction per cost obtained by the proposed model is 28.95 larger than that obtained by the deterministic model, in the scenario that a CAV-based control strategy is implemented in the second stage. This indicates that the proposed model provides cost-effective low V2R communication delay for intersection control in CAV environment.

AB Underwater docking greatly facilitates and extends operation of an autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) without the support of a surface vessel. Robust and accurate control is critically important for docking an AUV into a small underwater funnel-type dock station. In this paper, a docking system with an under-actuated AUV is presented, with special attention paid to control algorithm design and implementation. For an under-actuated AUV, the cross-track error can be controlled only via vehicle heading modulation, so both the cross-track error and heading error have to be constrained to achieve successful docking operations, while the control problem can be even more complicated in practical scenarios with the presence of unknown ocean currents. To cope with the above issues, a control scheme of a three-hierarchy structure of control loops is developed, which has been embedded with online current estimator/compensator and effective control parameter tuning. The current estimator can evaluate both horizontal and vertical current velocity components, based only on the measurement of AUV's velocity relative to the ground; in contrast, most existing methods use the measurements of both AUV's velocities respectively relative to the ground and the water column. In addition to numerical simulation, the proposed docking scheme is fully implemented in a prototype AUV using MOOS-IvP architecture. Simulation results show that the current estimator/compensator works well even in the presence of lateral current disturbance. Finally, a series of sea trials are conducted to validate the current estimator/compensator and the whole docking system. The sea trial results show that our control methods can drive the AUV into the dock station effectively and robustly.

AB Anthropogenic input of carbon dioxide (CO2) into the atmosphere and its uptake by the ocean with associated changes in ocean chemistry have created an urgent need to expand coverage of sea surface and atmospheric carbon dioxide observations. Conventional sampling platforms (e.g. ships and moorings) do not provide the spatial and temporal resolution needed to assess the effects of rapidly changing carbon dioxide conditions and are expensive to operate. Through a series of deployments beginning in March 2012, two versions of the Wave Glider autonomous surface vehicles from Liquid Robotics, Inc. have been instrumented with sensors to measure pH, partial pressure of CO2 (pCO(2)) of the atmosphere and sea surface, and wind speed and direction, from which instantaneous sea-air fluxes of CO2 can be calculated. These deployments, most near Monterey Bay, California, were highly correlated with Delta pCO(2) measurements obtained from the Monterey Bay Aquarium Research Institute's (MBARI) long-term mooring station M1, as well as from shipboard observations. In the central California upwelling system with highly variable pCO(2 )levels, the gliders captured large spatial gradients associated with upwelling fronts. Differences in sea surface pCO(2) as large as 470 mu atm over < 0.5 km were observed. Unlike traditional ship sampling methods, however, this new generation of sampling platforms is capable of continuous long-term (months) deployments at a fraction of the cost. The vehicles thus have the potential of filling important gaps in present understanding of the effects of global change on ocean chemistry.

AB This study examines the potential abatement of environmental pollutant emissions with the adoption of autonomous vessels in future maritime transportation using Bayesian probabilistic forecasting algorithm. The emission reductions can be attributed to the related technological advancement, including particularly the improvements in navigational performance and berthing in port, which can achieve better efficiencies and lower fluctuations in sailing speeds. The scenario modeling approach is first established based on the foreseeable development of energy policies and usage as well as ship operations. Subsequently, assessment is performed in five major ports worldwide, namely Shanghai, Singapore, Long Beach, Hamburg, Tokyo from Year 2020 to 2050. The results are compared to the corresponding projections with manned shipping to determine the probabilistic emission abatements with the gradual adoption of autonomous ships into the fleet. Overall, the results provide a better understanding of the future environmental benefits with autonomous shipping to the policymakers, shipowners, and shipping industry.

AB With growing concerns about air pollution and congestion, getting more people to move around cities by bicycle is gaining more attention than at any point over the past 50 years. At the same time, the spread of autonomous vehicles (AVs) is being positioned by some as a solution to these same problems. This raises interesting questions about the possible trajectories AVs could take when they become part of the traffic landscape of a street. Will they entrench existing hierarchies of use? Or will they help facilitate the expansion of cycling and other non-motorised forms of mobility? To begin to think about this question, the paper considers what a street is and how different users within a street environment share and cooperate. It then moves on to explore the technologies involved in the development of AVs and the challenges involved in their use on environmentally complex urban streets. With rules being central to how AVs operate, the fact that rules can mean different things to different people, and that they are both formal and informal, matters. To show why this matters, examples from an ethnography of infrastructure involving 81 adult road users are used to illustrate the ambiguities involved in making sense of the appropriate way to make a right-hand turn when cycling in a country that travels on the left. How AVs are programmed to deal with such ambiguities will have profound effects on the kind of infrastructural settlements that come to dominate how people share the street. These are judgements that will have important consequences for the development of cycling in the many places with car-dominated transport environments.

TI Bandit-based data poisoning attack against federated learning for
   autonomous driving models
SO EXPERT SYSTEMS WITH APPLICATIONS
LA English
DT Article
DE Poisoning attack; Federated learning; Model security; Autonomous driving
AB In Internet of Things (IoT) applications, federated learning is commonly used for distributedly training models in a privacy-preserving manner. Recently, federated learning is broadly applied to autonomous driving for training intelligent decision models without disseminating local data remotely. Although federated learning provides a safer training manner for protecting data privacy in autonomous driving, the model training process is still vulnerable to poisoning attacks from vehicle client ends. It is beneficial to study poisoning attacks for enhancing the robustness of the training process to generate reliable decisions for safe driving. Until now, a few researches on poisoning attacks against classification models under federated learning scenarios have been proposed. However, those poisoning attacks against classification tasks cannot be directly applied to regression tasks in a federated learning framework, especially autonomous driving tasks such as steering angle control and brake control. The biggest challenge is that the output of non-linear regression models in federated learning is a dy-namic sequential value decided by an online updated non-linear function. Thus, minor attacks can affect the overall non-linear function inference outputs leading to a failed stealthy attack. Based on existing challenges, this paper proposes an ATTack against Federated Learning based Autonomous Vehicle framework(ATT_FLAV) to evaluate and enhance the robustness of the federated learning-based autonomous driving models and take the steering angle control task as a representative non-linear regression task to illustrate the methodology. In the proposed framework, a bandit-based AttackRegion-UCB (AR-UCB) algorithm is designed for dynamic data poisoning attacks against the non-linear regression model. This is a black-box attack strategy that chooses the target attack label region dynamically in each federated learning round based on historical attack experiences. Compared with the attack performance of baseline poisoning attacks and the robustness under defense schemas, the proposed poisoning attack strategy can achieve superior attack performance via continuous data poisoning attacks against the federated learning framework.

AB This paper addresses the safe cooperative path following for multiple autonomous surface vehicles (ASVs) in the presence of static and dynamic obstacles. The positions and velocities of the obstacles are unknown, and only the relative angle is measured. The ASVs are subject to uncertain kinetics and unknown disturbances induced by wind, waves and currents. Switching cooperative guidance laws with collision avoidance are designed at the kinematic level, and a collision avoidance strategy based on the relative angle is introduced into the desired yaw rate design. A smooth switch between the cooperative path following and the collision avoidance is achieved by using an exponential-function-based weighted coefficient. At the kinetic level, nonlinear switching extended state observers (NSESOs) based on fractional power functions are developed to estimate the model uncertainties and environmental disturbances. Anti-disturbance kinetic control laws are designed based on the nonlinear switching extended state observers and finite-time convergent differentiators. A salient feature of the proposed cooperative path following method is that both the static and dynamic obstacles can be avoided by using the relative angle only. Through theoretical analysis, it is proven that the closed-loop system is input-to-state stable, and a safe distance can be maintained between the ASVs and the obstacles. Simulation and hardware-in-loop (HIL) experiment results are given to substantiate the effectiveness of the proposed safe cooperative path following control method for multiple ASVs based on relative angles.

AB Measuring biodiversity simultaneously in different locations, at different temporal scales, and over wide spatial scales is of strategic importance for the improvement of our understanding of the functioning of marine ecosystems and for the conservation of their biodiversity. Monitoring networks of cabled observatories, along with other docked autonomous systems (e.g., Remotely Operated Vehicles [ROVs], Autonomous Underwater Vehicles [AUVs], and crawlers), are being conceived and established at a spatial scale capable of tracking energy fluxes across benthic and pelagic compartments, as well as across geographic ecotones. At the same time, optoacoustic imaging is sustaining an unprecedented expansion in marine ecological monitoring, enabling the acquisition of new biological and environmental data at an appropriate spatiotemporal scale. At this stage, one of the main problems for an effective application of these technologies is the processing, storage, and treatment of the acquired complex ecological information. Here, we provide a conceptual overview on the technological developments in the multiparametric generation, storage, and automated hierarchic treatment of biological and environmental information required to capture the spatiotemporal complexity of a marine ecosystem. In doing so, we present a pipeline of ecological data acquisition and processing in different steps and prone to automation. We also give an example of population biomass, community richness and biodiversity data computation (as indicators for ecosystem functionality) with an Internet Operated Vehicle (a mobile crawler). Finally, we discuss the software requirements for that automated data processing at the level of cyber-infrastructures with sensor calibration and control, data banking, and ingestion into large data portals.

AB This paper investigates the intention to use private autonomous vehicles (PAVs) in developed (i.e., the United States, Belgium, the United Kingdom, Italy, Portugal, and Hungary) and developing countries (i.e., Egypt, Iraq, Jordan, Lebanon, and Saudi Arabia). Self-efficacy, the attitude toward using PAV technology, and the trust in PAV constructs are integrated into an extended Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology (UTAUT2) model to increase the understanding of users' perceptions of PAVs in developed and developing countries. The results of partial least squares structural equation modeling show the attitude toward using PAV technology to be the strongest predictor of the intention to use PAVs in developed and developing countries. Performance expectancy and trust in PAV are the strongest predictors of attitude toward using PAV technology in developed and developing countries, respectively. Effort-related constructs (i.e., effort expectancy and self-efficacy) do not directly affect the behavioral intention of the respondents from the developed countries while significantly affecting the behavioral intention of the respondents from the developing countries. The results of the mediation analysis show that the relationship between effort expectancy and behavioral intention is fully mediated by the attitude toward using PAV technology and performance expectancy for the respondents of the developed countries. Furthermore, the results of the multi-group moderation analysis show the relationship between performance expectancy and behavioral intention as well as social influence and the trust in PAV is not moderated by any of the moderators (i.e., age, gender, educational level, employment status, income level, car ownership status, and driving license status), neither for the developed countries nor for the developing countries.

AB With the increasing use of electric vehicles (EVs) and the development of emerging transportation network services, autonomous EVs (AEVs) may play an important role in the future of transportation. AEVs can automatically plan their route, park in the charging station, and support the vehicle-to-grid (V2G) services. However, V2G services may influence user dissatisfaction due to the task delays. There is a tradeoff between the optimization of electricity cost and user dissatisfaction. In this article, we formulate the problem to minimize the electricity cost of AEVs and the degradation cost of the charging station batteries with the constraint of V2G services and user dissatisfaction, which is a nonconvex problem and is difficult to solve. To solve the nonconvex optimization problem, we design a suboptimal charging algorithm with some constraints (SCAC) based on the Lyapunov optimization technique to find a tradeoff between the total cost and user dissatisfaction. This algorithm cannot find the optimal solution but can give a selection criterion. Furthermore, in order to get a global charging schedule, we use the criterion from the SCAC algorithm as a priori knowledge to design the charging scheduling reinforcement-learning-based (CSRL) algorithm, which is more efficient than the reinforcement learning (RL) method without any particular criterion. We do simulations by using day-ahead price and practical profiles of AEVs to evaluate the proposed algorithms. The numerical results show that the CSRL algorithm has a better performance 5.12% than the SCAC algorithm and both algorithms are 12.66% and 17.14% better than the benchmark algorithm which is the shortest path (SP)-based algorithm. The CSRL algorithm has more efficiency epsilon(1 - Pr(Lambda(t) = 0)) than the SCAC algorithm, where Pr(Lambda(t) = 0) is a selection criterion calculated from the SCAC algorithm.

AB Many environmental incidents affect large areas, often in rough terrain constrained by natural obstacles, which makes intervention difficult. New technologies, such as unmanned aerial vehicles, may help address this issue due to their suitability to reach and easily cover large areas. Thus, unmanned aerial vehicles may be used to inspect the terrain and make a first assessment of the affected areas; however, nowadays they do not have the capability to act. On the other hand, ground vehicles rely on enough power to perform the intervention but exhibit more mobility constraints. This paper proposes a multi-robot sense-act system, composed of aerial and ground vehicles. This combination allows performing autonomous tasks in large outdoor areas by integrating both types of platforms in a fully automated manner. Aerial units are used to easily obtain relevant data from the environment and ground units use this information to carry out interventions more efficiently. This paper describes the platforms and sensors required by this multi-robot sense-act system as well as proposes a software system to automatically handle the workflow for any generic environmental task. The proposed system has proved to be suitable to reduce the amount of herbicide applied in agricultural treatments. Although herbicides are very polluting, they are massively deployed on complete agricultural fields to remove weeds. Nevertheless, the amount of herbicide required for treatment is radically reduced when it is accurately applied on patches by the proposed multi-robot system. Thus, the aerial units were employed to scout the crop and build an accurate weed distribution map which was subsequently used to plan the task of the ground units. The whole workflow was executed in a fully autonomous way, without human intervention except when required by Spanish law due to safety reasons.

AB In the study of obstacle avoidance for autonomous vehicle (AV), the moving direction of obstacle is generally the same as that of AV. But in actual situation, the moving direction of obstacle is various, which may lead to collision phenomenon of AV. To solve this problem, a dynamic estimation-based obstacle avoidance system (DEOAS) which includes two parts, a dynamic estimation module (DEM) and a multiple-constraint model predictive controller (MCMPC), is presented in this work. To adapt to the obstacle with various moving direction, the DEM combines the driver's experience and vehicle model to obtain the ranges of acceleration and steering angle. The MCMPC is designed to deal with the constraints of distance, acceleration and yaw angle simultaneously to obtain the optimal velocity and steering angle. The simulation is carried on the Carsim-Matlab co-simulation platform, and the simulation results indicate that the proposed DMOAS can achieve adaptive obstacle avoidance with the obstacle moving in various direction.

AB The advent of mobile robots in agriculture has signaled a digital transformation with new automation technologies optimize a range of labor-intensive, resources-demanding, and time-consuming agri-field operations. To that end a generally accepted technical lexicon for mobile robots is lacking as pertinent terms are often used interchangeably. This creates confusion among research and practice stakeholders. In addition, a consistent definition of planning attributes in automated agricultural operations is still missing as relevant research is sparse. In this regard, a "narrative" review was adopted (1) to provide the basic terminology over technical aspects of mobile robots used in autonomous operations and (2) assess fundamental planning aspects of mobile robots in agricultural environments. Based on the synthesized evidence from extant studies, seven planning attributes have been included: (i) high-level control-specific attributes, which include reasoning architecture, the world model, and planning level, (ii) operation-specific attributes, which include locomotion-task connection and capacity constraints, and (iii) physical robot-specific attributes, which include vehicle configuration and vehicle kinematics.

AB Uphill and downhill roads are prevalent in mountainous areas and freeways. Despite the advancements of vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) communication technology, the driving field of vision could be still largely limited under such a complex road environment, which hinders the sensors from accurately perceiving the speed of front vehicles. As such, a fundamental question for autonomous traffic management is how to control traffic flow associated with the velocity uncertainty of preceding vehicles? This paper aims to answer this question by devising a cooperative control method for autonomous traffic to stabilize the traffic flow under such a complex road environment. To this end, this paper first develops a traffic flow model accounting for the uncertainty of preceding vehicle's velocity on gradient roads and further devises a new self-delayed feedback controller based on the velocity and headway differences between the current time step and historical time step. The sufficient condition where traffic jams do not occur is derived from the perspective of the frequency domain via Hurwitz criteria and H-infinity norm of transfer functions. The Bode diagram reveals that the robustness of the closed-loop traffic flow model can be significantly enhanced. Simulation results show that the key parameters (control gain coefficient and delay time) of the designed controller contribute to the stability of traffic flow, which is consistent with the theoretical analysis conclusion.

AB This paper proposes the trajectory tracking problem between an autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) and a mobile surface ship, both equipped with optical communication transceivers. The challenging issue is to maintain stable connectivity between the two autonomous vehicles within an optical communication range. We define a directed optical line-of-sight (LoS) link between the two vehicle systems. The transmitter is mounted on the AUV, while the surface ship is equipped with an optical receiver. However, this optical communication channel needs to preserve a stable transmitter-receiver position to reinforce service quality, which typically includes a bit rate and bit error rates. A cone-shaped beam region of the optical receiver is approximated based on the channel model; then, a minimum bit rate is ensured if the AUV transmitter remains inside of this region. Additionally, we design two control algorithms for the transmitter to drive the AUV to the angle of the maximum achievable data rate and maintain it in the cone-shaped beam region and under an uncertain oceanic environment. Lyapunov function-based analysis that ensures asymptotic stability of the resulting closed-loop tracking error is used to design the proposed Non-linear Proportional and Derivative (NLPD) controller. Numerical simulations are performed using MATLAB/Simulink to show the controllers' ability to achieve favorable tracking in the presence of the solar background noise within competitive times. Finally, results demonstrate the proposed NLPD controller improves the tracking error performance more than 70% under nominal conditions and 35% with model uncertainties and disturbances compared to the original Proportional and Derivative (PD) strategy.

AB Autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) navigating on the sea surface are usually required to complete the communication tasks in complex sea conditions. The movement forms and flow field characteristics of a multi-moving state AUV navigating in head sea at high speed were studied. The mathematical model on longitudinal motion of the high-speed AUV in head sea was established with considering the hydrodynamic lift based on strip theory, which was solved to get the heave and pitch of the AUV by Gaussian elimination method. Based on this, computational fluid dynamics (CFD) method was used to establish the mathematical model of the unsteady viscous flow around the AUV with considering free surface effort by using the Reynolds-averaged Navier-Stokes (RANS) equations, shear-stress transport (SST) k-w model and volume of fluid (VOF) model. The three-dimensional numerical wave in the computational field was realized through defining the unsteady inlet boundary condition. The motion forms of the AUV navigating in head sea at high speed were carried out by the program source code of user-defined function (UDF) based on dynamic mesh. The hydrodynamic parameters of the AUV such as drag, lift, pitch torque, velocity, pressure, and wave profile were got, which reflect well the real ambient flow field of the AUV navigating in head sea at high speed. The computational wave profile agrees well with the experimental phenomenon of a wave-piercing surface vehicle. The force law of the AUV under the impacts of waves was analyzed qualitatively and quantitatively, which provides an effective theoretical guidance and technical support for the dynamics research and shape design of the AUV in real complex environment.

AB Purpose - This paper aims to present a new vision-based approach for both the identification and the estimation of the relative distance between the unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) and power pylon. Autonomous power line inspection using small UAVs, has been the focus of many research works over the past couple of decades. Automatic detection of power pylons is a primary requirement to achieve such autonomous systems. It is still a challenging task due to the complex geometry and cluttered background of these structures.
   Design/methodology/approach - The identification solution proposed, avoids the complexity of classic object recognition techniques. Instead of searching the whole image for the pylon template, low-level geometric priors with robust colour attributes are combined to remove the pylon background. The depth estimation, on the other hand, is based on a new concept which exploits the ego-motion of the inspection UAV to estimate its distance from the pylon using just a monocular camera.
   Findings - An algorithm is tested on a quadrotor UAV, using different kinds of metallic power pylons. Both simulation and real-world experiments, conducted in different backgrounds and illumination conditions, show very promising results.
   Research limitations/implications - In the real tests carried out, the Inertial Navigation System (INS) of the vehicle was used to estimate its ego-motion. A more reliable solution should be considered for longer distances, by either fusing INS and global positioning system data or using visual navigation techniques such as visual odometry.
   Originality/value - A simple yet efficient solution is proposed that allows the UAV to reliably identify the pylon, with still a low processing cost. Considering a monocular solution is a major advantage, given the limited payload and processing power of such small vehicles.

AB Effective simulation and testing environment is a vital part in the research of self-driving vehicles. It is capable of testing self-driving software and hardware quickly in a variety of virtual environments at low cost. However, as for the current mainstream simulation platforms, a considerable gap exists between the constructed virtual environment and the actual self-driving platform, which decreases the efficiency of development and makes it difficult to complete the migration from the virtual scenario to the real environment. Therefore, in this paper, we proposed a novel hardware-in-the-loop (HiL) simulation system. It takes the real hardware electronic control unit (ECU) of the self-driving vehicle as a part of the simulation platform, which improves the efficiency of development and testing, and also, the verified algorithms can be implemented into self-driving cars faster than ever before. The proposed HiL simulation system mainly consists of four parts: the vehicle kinematic model simulation, the multi-sensor simulation, the environment simulation, and the ECU hardware. Simulation experiments on applying the HiL system are used to verify the validity of self-driving algorithms in virtual scenes, including perception, planning, decision making, and control. Furthermore, algorithms that are tested in the simulation environment can be rapidly deployed into the real self-driving vehicles. In this paper, we also presented the verification processes of various algorithms, such as planning and control. These algorithms are implemented in the HiL system, and the experimental results show the validity of our proposed platform.

AB Precise control is a key factor in enabling Unmanned Underwater Vehicles (UUVs) to complete various underwater activities. The development of UUV control rules is mostly based on UUV dynamic models. However, such dynamic models contain unknown hydrodynamic parameters that need to be identified. This paper presents a new method. Laser Line Scanning for Hydrodynamic Parameter Identification (LSHPI), which integrates laser line scanning, decoupled dynamics, and evolutionary optimisation to identify the hydrodynamic parameters of an Autonomous Underwater Vehicle (AUV). In this research, laser images, seen from an on board camera's perspective and created using Open Graphics Library (OpenGL), were used to validate LSHPI's feasibility. The accuracy of the AUV positions and Euler angles obtained by the laser image-based methods were investigated for each decoupled One-Dimensional (1D) motion and the influence of other motion disturbances on the accuracy of the obtained AUV positions or Euler angles was also evaluated. In addition, the accuracy of the surge-related hydrodynamic parameters obtained by LSHPI was investigated under different motion disturbances. Based on the hydrodynamic parameter identification results under different motion disturbances, LSHPI's feasibility was successfully validated.

AB It is hard to find the global optimum of general nonlinear and nonconvex optimization problems in a reasonable time. This article presents a method to transfer the receding horizon control approach, where nonlinear, nonconvex optimization problems are considered, into graph-search problems. Specifically, systems with symmetries are considered to transfer system dynamics into a finite-state automaton. In contrast to traditional graph-search approaches where the search continues until the goal vertex is found, the transfer of a receding horizon control approach to graph-search problems presented in this article allows to solve them in real time. We prove that the solutions are recursively feasible by restricting the graph search to end in accepting states of the underlying finite-state automaton. The approach is applied to trajectory planning for multiple networked and autonomous vehicles. We evaluate its effectiveness in simulation and experiments in the Cyber-Physical Mobility Lab, an open-source platform for networked and autonomous vehicles. We show real-time capable trajectory planning with collision avoidance in experiments on off-the-shelf hardware and code in MATLAB for two vehicles.

DE Over-actuated underwater vehicle; robust sliding mode controller;
   station-keeping control; experimental result
AB Nowadays, underwater vehicles (UVs) are applied to various tasks such as carrying objects or maintenance of underwater structures. To carry out well these tasks, UVs should keep the position and orientation in the water to perform the specified tasks. However, the systems used in underwater operations are always under the influence of disturbance such as ocean currents and model uncertainties. In this paper, the robust station-keeping (SK) control algorithm based on a sliding mode control (SMC) theory is designed to guarantee stability and better performance of a hovering over-actuated autonomous underwater vehicle (HAUV) despite the existence of model uncertainties and ocean current disturbance in the horizontal plane (HP). Using the Lyapunov theorem, the stability of the proposed controller is demonstrated. Besides, an optimal allocation control (AC) algorithm is also designed to keep the linear position and Euler angles of the HAUV in the presence of model uncertainties as well as ocean currents and to minimize the energy consumption of the system. Finally, a series of simulations and experiments for the HAUV system is conducted to demonstrate the superior performance of the proposed method.

AB When manually steering a car, the driver's visual perception of the driving scene and his or her motor actions to control the vehicle are closely linked. Since motor behaviour is no longer required in an automated vehicle, the sampling of the visual scene is affected. Autonomous driving typically results in less gaze being directed towards the road centre and a broader exploration of the driving scene, compared to manual driving. To examine the corollary of this situation, this study estimated the state of automation (manual or automated) on the basis of gaze behaviour. To do so, models based on partial least square regressions were computed by considering the gaze behaviour in multiple ways, using static indicators (percentage of time spent gazing at 13 areas of interests), dynamic indicators (transition matrices between areas) or both together. Analysis of the quality of predictions for the different models showed that the best result was obtained by considering both static and dynamic indicators. However, gaze dynamics played the most important role in distinguishing between manual and automated driving. This study may be relevant to the issue of driver monitoring in autonomous vehicles.

AB This study is about how lay persons perceive and represent artificial intelligence in general as well as its use in weaponised autonomous ground vehicles in the military context. We analysed the discourse of six focus groups in Estonia, using an automatic text analysis tool and complemented the results by a qualitative thematic content analysis. The findings show that representations of artificial intelligence-driven machines are anchored in the image of man. A cluster analysis revealed five dominant themes: artificial intelligence as programmed machines, artificial intelligence and the problem of control, artificial intelligence and its relation to human life, artificial intelligence used in wars and ethical problems in developing autonomous weaponised machines. The findings are discussed with regard to people's tendency to anthropomorphise robots despite their lack of emotions, which can be seen as a last resort when confronting an autonomous machine where the usual interpersonal understanding of intentions does not apply.

AB Vehicle trajectory prediction is a key technology in autonomous driving, one of the aims of which is to ensure the safety of vehicle travelling and lane changing. Especially in complex traffic scenarios, it is critical to accurately predict the vehicle trajectory so that the automated driving system can make appropriate response actions to help the vehicle driver avoid accidents to the greatest extent possible. Some studies on vehicle trajectory prediction have used recurrent networks (LSTMs) to extract temporal correlations and additional convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to capture spatial correlations. This hybrid model can be added more operations, so we propose a new CNN-LSTM hybrid model containing multi-module, interaction regions and spatial-temporal attention mechanisms (IA-CSTM). In this paper, the traffic scene is divided into multiple interaction regions, and vehicles in different regions have different impacts on the predicted vehicles. The model has multiple modules that deal with vehicle information in different interaction regions. The model will cross-fuse vehicle information in important interaction regions to enhance the model's perception of vehicle information. Multiple modules are linked through a spatial-temporal attention mechanism and capture the relevance of the vehicle in the interaction region to predicted vehicle.

AB With the development of intelligent and connected vehicles, RSU (roadside unit) sensors are playing an increasingly important role for environment perception. For vehicle detection in autonomous mine, lack of diversity data on RSU LiDAR limits the application of deep learning based methods. To solve this issue, a voxel-based background filtering module is introduced into 3D object detectors for vehicle detection with RSU LiDAR in mine environments. The proposed background filtering method models average height and the number of points for each voxel as Gaussian distribution to generate a background table. To address the impact of the false negative points of the background filtering module, we also propose a multivariate Gaussian loss to model bounding box uncertainty. The predicted covariances between variates help to learn the relationship between the missed parts and the visible ones. Besides, a background filtering based data augmentation method for vehicle detection is also proposed in this paper. Three RSU LiDAR datasets with different terrains in the BaoLi mine area are used for comprehensive experiment evaluations. Experiments show that the proposed background filtering module and multivariate Gaussian loss can significantly improve the generalization ability and performance of several state-of-the-art 3D detectors on different terrain data. Moreover, most background voxels are filtered out, the inference time of the 3D detectors is about 2x faster. Besides, the effectiveness of the proposed data augmentation method is also demonstrated.

AB Highly automated vehicles (AV) are in the early stages of deployment and are likely to have significant impacts on the United States transportation system. In particular, a broad deployment of shared, on-demand AVs might significantly impact vehicle ownership and transportation energy consumption; projecting these impacts is essential for climate, infrastructure, and policy planning. However, it seems increasingly likely that AVs will be deployed gradually over a period of decades, in which case there may be geographic or functional variation in their availability. This might occur for a combination of technological, policy, and economic reasons. This manuscript seeks to advance a new framework for projecting AV impacts, with a particular focus on energy consumption impacts. Specifically, we introduce a framework for AV impacts that allows for AVs catering to specific operating environments or ride types. As a demonstration of this framework, we use the 2009 National Household Transportation Survey (NHTS) to segment US household travel demand based on built environment and ride length. Our framework allows us to specify AV "availability" for each population segment and ride type and use that information to predict the impact of AVs. We analyze a case scenario where shared, ondemand AVs are mostly suited for short trips in highly urbanized environments. We project the impact on household relocation, private vehicle ownership, induced travel demand, and fuel consumption. Utilization of this framework would help identify policy levers for sustainable deployment of AVs.

AB Precise localization is essential but also challenging for autonomous vehicles. In this article, A novel visual localization method is proposed. Specifically, a semantic local map describing the local environment is built with images sequence and wheel-inertial ego-motion results. Then the local semantic map is matched with the online map database for camera position estimation. The key novelty of the method lies in using a supervised neural network to simplify the map-matching problem, which avoids the complex data association and optimization processes. The network encodes the maps, infers the feature similarity, and predicts the camera position. The visual localization results are then loosely integrated with other onboard sensors by an invariant Kalman filter. We evaluate the map-matching module and the overall fusion system on scenario tests. The experiment results validate the effectiveness of the learning-based map-matching method. And the accuracy of the overall system is satisfactory, with mean absolute errors of 0.039 m and 0.167 m in the lateral and longitudinal directions, respectively.

AB Vision-based pedestrian detection has become an active topic in computer vision and autonomous vehicles. It aims at detecting pedestrians appearing ahead of the vehicle using a camera so that autonomous vehicles can assess the danger and take action. Due to varied illumination and appearance, complex background and occlusion pedestrian detection in outdoor environments is a difficult problem. In this paper, we propose a novel hierarchical feature extraction and weighted kernel sparse representation model for pedestrian classification. Initially, hierarchical feature extraction based on a CENTRIST descriptor is used to capture discriminative structures. A max pooling operation is used to enhance the invariance of varying appearance. Then, a kernel sparse representation model is proposed to fully exploit the discrimination information embedded in the hierarchical local features, and a Gaussian weight function as the measure to effectively handle the occlusion in pedestrian images. Extensive experiments are conducted on benchmark databases, including INRIA, Daimler, an artificially generated dataset and a real occluded dataset, demonstrating the more robust performance of the proposed method compared to state-of-the-art pedestrian classification methods.

AB Reducing the number of traffic accidents is a declared target of most governments. Since dependence on driver reaction is the main cause of road accidents, it would be advisable to replace the human factor in some driving-related tasks with automated solutions. To automate a vehicle, it is necessary to control the actuators of a car, i.e., the steering wheel, accelerator, and brake. This paper presents the design and implementation of an electro-hydraulic braking system consisting of a pump and various valves, allowing the control computer to stop the car. It is assembled in conjunction with the original circuit for the sake of robustness and to permit the two systems to halt the car independently. This system was developed for installation in a commercial Citroen C3 Pluriel of the AUTOPIA program. Various tests were carried out to verify its correct operation, and an experiment showing the integration of the system into the longitudinal control of the car is described.

AB Autonomous vehicles (AVs) may have significant environmental impacts although there are still few studies focusing solely on these effects. A vast majority of articles address environmental issues as a secondary outcome and, above all, emissions are the main topic. As the notion of environmental impacts concerns many aspects than just air pollution, this paper aims to explore and show the findings and flaws of current research with a wider vision. For that purpose, a systematic review of the scientific literature was carried out broadening the scope to land, water, noise, and light pollution in addition to air. The results reveal potential benefits of AVs due to technical improvements, new possibilities in design and traffic flow enhancement, but the benefits depend on penetration levels, shared mobility acceptance and the interaction with other modes of transport. On the other hand, negative effects are also identified related to the decrease in the value of trip time and user tendencies. Among other potential impacts, changes in land use are increasingly being studied. These changes can lead to significative impacts on emissions as well as on soil and water although the latter have not yet been considered. Lastly, the likely improvements in noise and light pollution are scarcely explored. Given the lack of study of some of the environmental outcomes of AVs, it is not possible to draw a precise conclusion on their overall impact, calling for more comprehensive studies that enable to identify all the measures to be taken to achieve a sustainable future.

AB This study aims to enrich autonomous vehicle (AV) adoption research and practice by being the first study to systematically review empirical studies on behavioural intention to use AVs, a key element in the adoption process. This review of the extant literature provides a synthesized overview of the current state of knowledge, develops a meta-framework to reconcile past research, identifies inconsistencies in prior results, and suggests areas for future research. To address these future directions, this study empirically extends the proposed meta-framework by testing impactful new variables. Structural equation modelling of survey data from 992 respondents in Hungary shows that drivers of behavioural intention to use AVs significantly differ among users with high and with low personal information technology innovativeness. The behavioural intention of innovative users is influenced by utilitarian and hedonic motivations, whereas laggards are driven by hedonic motivation, and a utilitarian motivation does not play a role. Innovative users' behavioural intention to use AVs is affected by specific technological fears (i.e., data privacy concerns), whereas those lagging are not influenced by specific, only by general concerns (i.e., overall technological anxiety). The study also shows how individual-level behavioural intention to use AVs interacts with expected societal-level outcomes (e.g., equal opportunity for mobility). The results shed light on the need for more research on the role of moderating variables, which are relatively unexplored in the extant literature yet can contribute to a better understanding of the differences in patterns between various groups of future users, offering important managerial implications.

AB Intelligent connected vehicles (ICVs) constitute a transformative technology attracting immense research effort and holding great promise in providing road safety, transport efficiency, driving comfort, and eco-friendly mobility. As the driving environment becomes more and more "connected", the manner in which an ICV is driven (driving style) can dynamically vary from time to time, due to the change in several parameters associated with personal traits and with the ICV's surroundings. This necessitates fast and effective decisions to be made for a priori identifying the most appropriate driving style for an ICV. Accordingly, the main goal of this study is to present a novel, in-vehicle autonomous decision-making functionality, which enables ICVs to dynamically, transparently, and securely utilize the best available driving style (DS). The proposed functionality takes as input several parameters related to the driver's personal characteristics and preferences, as well as the changing driving environment. A Naive Bayes learning classifier is applied for the cognitive nature of the presented functionality. Three scenarios, with regards to drivers with different personal preferences and to driving scenes with changing environment situations, are illustrated, showcasing the effectiveness of the proposed functionality.

AB Traditionally, time spent travelling has been seen as a 'cost' to the traveller. Autonomous or fully automated vehicles (FAVs) can free the driver of the driving task and allow engagement in other worthwhile activities inside the FAVs, which can transform how people travel. However, there is little understanding about how travel time can be used and how worthwhile this time can be in FAVs; and whether this is related to the intention to use FAVs. This paper addresses these questions through a multi-country questionnaire survey, with a sub-sample of chauffeur-driven car users to mimic time use in FAVs. Responses show that users are likely to engage in other non-driving activities while riding in FAVs, and these differ according to trip purpose and direction. Time spent travelling in FAVs is perceived to be more useful than in current modes of transport. Interest in using FAVs is directly correlated with perceived usefulness of time in autonomous vehicles. There is a strong correlation between intended activities in FAVs and current activities by primary car users in chauffeur-driven cars, providing some validation to the stated intention responses. Results have important implications for policy-making, time use and value-of-time research, as well as vehicle interior design.

AB Road networks are one of important surveillance areas in military scenarios. In these road networks, sensors will be sparsely deployed (hundreds of meters apart) for the cost-effective deployment. This makes the existing localization solutions based on the ranging ineffective. To address this issue, this paper introduces a novel approach based on the passive vehicular traffic measurement, called Autonomous Passive Localization (APL). Our work is inspired by the fact that vehicles move along routes with a known map. Using binary vehicle-detection time stamps, we can obtain distance estimates between any pair of sensors on roadways to construct a virtual graph composed of sensor identifications (i.e., vertices) and distance estimates (i.e., edges). The virtual graph is then matched with the topology of the road map, in order to identify where sensors are located on roadways. We evaluate our design outdoors on Minnesota roadways and show that our distance estimate method works well despite traffic noises. In addition, we show that our localization scheme is effective in a road network with 18 intersections, where we found no location matching error, even with a maximum sensor time synchronization error of 0.07 sec and a vehicle speed deviation of 10 km/h.

AB A parallel neural network-based controller (PNNC) is presented for the motion control of underwater vehicles in this paper. It consists of a real-time part, a self-teaming part and a desired-state programmer, and it is different from normal adaptive neural network controller in structure. Owing to the introduction of the self-leaning part, on-line learning can be performed without sample data in several sample periods, resulting in high teaming speed of the controller and good control performance. The desired-state programmer is utilized to obtain better teaming samples of the neural network to keep the stability of the controller. The developed controller is applied to the 4-degree of freedom control of the AUV "IUV-IV" and is successful on the simulation platform. The control performance is also compared with that of neural network controller with different structures such as normal adaptive neural network and different teaming methods. Current effects and surge velocity control are also included to demonstrate the controller's performance. It is shown that the PNNC has a great possibility to solve the problems in the control system design of underwater vehicles.

AB Shared Mobility Systems (SMS) facilitate on-demand journeys using one or more transportation modes such as car-sharing, bike-sharing, or ride-sharing. As a result, SMS often face challenges such as finding suitable facility locations, efficient routing of shared vehicles, matching and re-distributing available resources with dynamic demands. Most existing surveys study how a particular challenge is addressed using artificial intelligence, machine learning, and optimisation techniques. However, these surveys fail to address the crucial "Whole System Design" point of view, which includes the "whole system" of interconnected stakeholders, entities, and subsystems that participate in, impact, and influence the success of each other and system a whole. Such a survey is highly required with the growing demand for flexible SMS that supports autonomous decision-making and offers multi-modal and inter-operable transportation services catered for highly dynamic traffic conditions in urban areas. This paper attempts to fill this gap by categorising the SMS' interconnected challenges in different transportation modes and reviewing how offered solutions across all modes address these challenges as a unified system.

TI Management of a Shared Autonomous Electric Vehicle Fleet Implications of
   Pricing Schemes
SO TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH RECORD
LA English
DT Article
ID SYSTEMS
AB The market potential of a fleet of shared autonomous electric vehicles (SAEVs) is explored by using a multinomial logit mode choice model in an agent-based framework and different fare settings. The mode share of SAEVs in the simulated midsize city (modeled roughly after Austin, Texas) is predicted to lie between 14% and 39% when the SAEVs compete with privately owned, manually driven vehicles and city bus service. The underlying assumptions are that SAEVs are priced between $0.75/mi and $1.00/mi, which delivers significant net revenues to the fleet owner operator under all modeled scenarios; that they have an 80-mi range and that Level 2 charging infrastructure is available; and that automation costs are up to $25,000 per vehicle. Various dynamic pricing schemes for SAEV fares indicate that specific fleet metrics can be improved with targeted strategies. For example, pricing strategies that attempt to balance available SAEV supply with anticipated trip demand can decrease average wait times by 19% to 23%. However, trade-offs exist within this price setting: fare structures that favor higher revenue-to-cost ratios by targeting travelers with a high value of travel time (VOTT) reduce SAEV mode shares, while those that favor larger mode shares by appealing to a wider VOTT range produce lower payback.

AB In this paper, we propose a data-gathering scheme for hierarchical underwater sensor networks, where multiple Autonomous Underwater Vehicles (AUVs) are deployed over large-scale coverage areas. The deployed AUVs constitute an intermittently connected multihop network through inter-AUV synchronization (in this paper, synchronization means an interconnection between nodes for communication) for forwarding data to the designated sink. In such a scenario, the performance of the multihop communication depends upon the synchronization among the vehicles. The mobility parameters of the vehicles vary continuously because of the constantly changing underwater currents. The variations in the AUV mobility parameters reduce the inter-AUV synchronization frequency contributing to delays in the multihop communication. The proposed scheme improves the AUV synchronization frequency by permitting neighboring AUVs to share their status information via a pre-selected node called an agent-node at the static layer of the network. We evaluate the proposed scheme in terms of the AUV synchronization frequency, vertical delay (node -> AUV), horizontal delay (AUV -> AUV), end-to-end delay, and the packet loss ratio. Simulation results show that the proposed scheme significantly reduces the aforementioned delays without the synchronization time-out process employed in conventional works.

AB Middleware designed to describe sensing, control, and computational communications of components within unmanned systems enables the creation of clean interfaces between the low-level mechanics of such systems and the higher-level logic designed to control them. This paper presents a modeling environment with a domain-specific ontology for autonomous systems, capable of generating software necessary for intercomputer communications according to existing autonomous systems middleware standards. Metamodels are used to specify the domain-specific modeling language to model the messages used, the interfaces between components, and some of the functionality of the components that transmit and receive messages. The generated code supports the high data rates expected in autonomous systems that use lossy message compression. Tests for the messaging infrastructure are also generated for the messages. Also, using this research, this code generation process can be extended to any component-based platform with a similar ontology. The case study and test environment for the software generated by this project is an autonomous ground vehicle, modeled on a Ford Escape Hybrid and used in laboratory experiments.

ID PERFORMANCE; ISSUES
AB Technological, social and economic forces are changing the notion of mobility as culture is exerting strong pressure on demand for a "shared," "reliable" and "on-demand" economy. In an era of the next mobility revolution, autonomous vehicles (AV) still fail to overcome edge cases that can stop an AV in their tracks. Remote driving has, however, emerged as a practical and promising solution to help AV in edge cases, such as AVs passing through bad weather or near a construction site. Remote driving relies on communication network infrastructure, which presents many challenges, both in terms of latency and performance, in connectivity between road vehicles and the remote driver. In addition, governments are passing laws to test AV technology without a safety driver, which has sparked the need for a remote driver who can take vehicle control if it encounters an edge case. In this paper, we enhance our previous work and present algorithms to select multiple remote drivers under user-defined objectives, to minimize the distance between the vehicle and remoter drivers. To evaluate the performance of the proposed algorithm, we perform extensive simulations both in a simulated environment using synthetic data and in a real environment with real-world data. We compare the performance of our proposed algorithms with baseline algorithms. The results show that the proposed heuristic algorithms perform similar to the optimal baseline line algorithms with much shorter computation time. (C) 2019 Published by Elsevier B.V.

AB This paper presents a technique for adaptively tracking bathymetric contours using an autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) equipped with a single altimeter sonar. An adaptive feature mapping behavior is developed to address the problem of how to locate and track features of unknown extent in an environment where a priori information is unavailable, This behavior is implemented as part of the layered control architecture used by the AUV Odyssey II, The new adaptive feature mapping behavior builds on previous work in layered control by incorporating planning and mapping capabilities that allow the vehicle to alter its trajectory online in response to sensor data in order to track contour features. New waypoints are selected by evaluating the expected utility of visiting a given location balanced against the expected cost of traveling to a particular cell. The technique is developed assuming sensor input in the form of a single, narrow-beam altimeter sensor attached to a non-holonomic, dynamically controlled survey-class AUV such as the Odyssey II. Simulations of the Charles River basin which have been constructed from real bathymetry data are used as test missions. The 7-m contour line of a prominent trench in the river serves as the target feature, The adaptive contour following behavior tracks the contour despite navigation error and environmental disturbances, supplying the capability of autonomously detecting and following distinctive bathymetric features using a point sensor. This behavior provides a foundation for future research in tracking of dynamic features in the water-column and for concurrent mapping and localization over natural terrain using a point sensor.

AB A major challenge for autonomous vehicles is handling interactions with human-driven vehicles-for example, in highway merging. A better understanding and computational modelling of human interactive behaviour could help address this challenge. However, existing modelling approaches predominantly neglect communication between drivers and assume that one modelled driver in the interaction responds to the other, but does not actively influence their behaviour. Here, we argue that addressing these two limitations is crucial for the accurate modelling of interactions. We propose a new computational framework addressing these limitations. Similar to game-theoretic approaches, we model a joint interactive system rather than an isolated driver who only responds to their environment. Contrary to game theory, our framework explicitly incorporates communication between two drivers and bounded rationality in each driver's behaviours. We demonstrate our model's potential in a simplified merging scenario of two vehicles, illustrating that it generates plausible interactive behaviour (e.g. aggressive and conservative merging). Furthermore, human-like gap-keeping behaviour emerged in a car-following scenario directly from risk perception without the explicit implementation of time or distance gaps in the model's decision-making. These results suggest that our framework is a promising approach to interaction modelling that can support the development of interaction-aware autonomous vehicles.

AB A novel adaptive trajectory tracking control method is proposed in this paper for au- tonomous underwater vehicle systems with external disturbances. The control action is composed of sliding mode control and action-depended heuristic dynamic programming (ADHDP) controller to track the expected sailing position and angle in the horizontal co- ordinate system with fixed depth. As an auxiliary control of sliding mode control, the AD- HDP controller observes the difference between the actual sailing position/angle and the expected sailing position/angle, and adaptively provides corresponding supplementary con- trol actions using a data-driven fashion. At the same time, we design a weight-related pri- ority experience replay (PER) technology to update the online weight network by using the relevant historical data stored in the database to improve the learning rate. The proposed algorithm can adjust parameters online under various conditions. Furthermore, it is very suitable for underwater vehicle systems with parameter uncertainties and external distur- bances. Based on Lyapunov stability method, the stability of closed-loop system state and network weight error is analyzed. Finally, the validity of our control strategy is verified by simulation.(c) 2022 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB This paper presents the latest Ethernet standardization of in-vehicle network and the future trends of automotive Ethernet technology. The proposed system provides design and optimization algorithms for automotive networking technology related to AVB (Audio Video Bridge) technology. We present a design of in-vehicle network system as well as the optimization of AVB for automotive. A proposal of Reduced Latency of Machine to Machine (RLMM) plays an outstanding role in reducing the latency among devices. RLMM's approach to real-world experimental cases indicates a reduction in latency of around 41.2%. The setup optimized for the automotive network environment is expected to significantly reduce the time in the development and design process. The results obtained in the study of image transmission latency are trustworthy because average values were collected over a long period of time. It is necessary to analyze a latency between multimedia devices within limited time which will be of considerable benefit to the industry. Furthermore, the proposed reliable camera and video streaming through optimized AVB device settings would provide a high level of support in the real-time comprehension and analysis of images with AI (Artificial Intelligence) algorithms in autonomous driving.

AB This manuscript proposes an efficient and novel method for the leader-follower formation control of multiple autonomous underwater vehicles. The goal is to efficiently allow the follower to follow the desired formation that the leader has presented. It is noteworthy how the model-dependent and model-free control schemes are combined to achieve this goal. The dynamical model of the system always contains inherent uncertainties, so the model-based control technique is incapable to manage these systems. Due to uncertainties and external disturbances, it is impossible to have complete knowledge of the system's dynamic model in real-world applications. Therefore, whatever the partial information about the dynamic model is available has been used in the design of the controller. The approximation ability of the neural network is used to enhance the inefficiency of the model-based control strategy. The unknown dynamics of the system is estimated via a radial basis function neural network. An adaptive compensator is introduced to the controller's part to counteract the effects of neural network reconstruction errors as well as those of external disturbances. After that, a Lyapunov function makes use of the online adaptive laws for the parameter vector as well as for the weights of neural network which ensures that the system is stable. As a result, by Barbalat's lemma, formation errors not only stay inside the desired levels but also converge to a small neighbourhood of zero asymptotically. At long last, contrastive MATLAB simulations are conducted to affirm the capability and superiority of the suggested technique.

AB It is well established that the transport sector is not an equalitarian sector. To develop a sustainable society, a more equalitarian and safe transport system for both users and transport sector employees is needed. This work prioritizes the needs and barriers previously identified as relevant among transport system users and employees for four different transport scenarios (railways, autonomous vehicles (AVs), bicycle-sharing services (BSSs), and employment). The aim of this paper is to prioritize the factors affecting women in these four transport scenarios with the help of a survey followed by the application of mathematical and computational algorithms based on the analytic hierarchy process (AHP) methodology. The identification of factors with higher influence in the fair participation of women in the transport sector will help transport planners, bike-sharing system owners, decision-makers, transport companies, and regulatory professionals to develop measures that could plausibly increase the proportion of women as users of BSSs, users of rail public transport, and AVs, as well as employees in the transport sector for a sustainable society. The results indicated that safety and security were the most challenging factors for railways. Weather, topography, and family responsibilities were shown to have a high influence on the use of BSSs. In the case of autonomous vehicles, the simultaneity and trust in the technology are the main opportunities to influence the acceptance of such vehicles. Finally, for transport employment, caring and parenting responsibilities were the factors that had the largest effect. Some differences in priorities were found for different profiles of women.

AB Amongst collisions, rear-end collisions are the deadliest. Several rear-end collision avoidance solutions have been proposed recently in the literature. A key problem with existing solutions is their dependence on precise mathematical models. However, real world driving is influenced by a number of nonlinear factors. These include road surface conditions, driver reaction time, pedestrian flow, and vehicle dynamics. These factors involve so many different variations that precise mathematical solutions are hard to obtain, if not impossible. This problem with precise control-based rear-end collision avoidance schemes has also previously been addressed using fuzzy logic, but the excessive number of fuzzy rules straightforwardly prejudices their efficiency. Furthermore, such fuzzy logic-based controllers have been proposed without the use of an appropriate modeling technique. One such modeling technique is agent-based modeling. This technique is suitable because it allows for mimicking the functions of an artificial human driver executing fuzzy rules. Keeping in view these limitations, we propose an enhanced emotion enabled cognitive agent (EEEC_Agent)-based controller. The proposed EEEC_Agent helps autonomous vehicles (AVs) avoid rear-end collisions with fewer rules. One key innovation in its design is to use the human emotion of fear. The resultant agent is very efficient and also uses the Ortony-Clore-Collins (OCC) model. The fear generation mechanism of EEEC_Agent is verified through NetLogo simulation. Furthermore, practical validation of EEEC_Agent functions is performed by using a specially built prototype AV platform. Finally, a qualitative comparison with existing state-of-the-art research works reflects that the proposed model outperforms recent research proposals.

AB The Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) recognizes a need for cost-effective and practical structural health monitoring (SHM) techniques to manage the bridge network. System identification (SI) techniques are the first step in developing SHM frameworks to extract bridge dynamic properties (natural frequencies, damp-ing ratios, and mode shapes). One promising indirect SI technique uses accelerometer-instrumented vehicles to measure the dynamic properties of bridges, such that a few instrumented vehicles could economically monitor a large network of bridges. This study proposes an autonomous framework called autonomous peak picking variational mode decomposition (APPVMD), which leverages an ensemble of signal processing techniques and heuristic models to autonomously extract bridge frequencies from instrumented vehicles. The proposed framework does not require prior information or model-informed training. The framework is tested on four vehicles and 39 unique bridge classes using finite element (FE) models to assess the feasibility of deploying it into practice. The results of this study indicate that the algorithm can make successful bridge frequency extractions in more than 69.2% of the bridge cases using any vehicle and a maximum value of 97.4% using an SUV, while considering the effects of road surface roughness. The influence of bridge stiffness, mass, and span length on the algorithm's success rate is discussed. It is concluded that flexural rigidity and span length play a significant role in the accuracy of APPVMD. The combined effects of bridge inertia and damping cause heavier bridges to have a higher amplitude signal for a longer duration, increasing the algorithm's successful detection rate of bridge frequency. Next, the authors examine the effect of reducing the tire stiffness in the truck model on the success of the APPVMD algorithm. The customized truck outperformed the original truck and the SUV by successfully extracting the bridge frequencies of 97.4% of the bridge cases and by having more bridge frequencies predicted in a higher confidence region than the SUV. In addition, the customized truck model is used to verify the APPVMD's robustness to large levels of sensor noise. Even at significant levels of white noise (1% SNR), as the success rate for bridge frequency extraction using the customized truck only drops to 84.6%. Finally, the influence of vehicle speed on the APPVMD algorithm's effectiveness is studied. Generally, slower speeds resulted in more successful predictions of bridge frequency, but minor improvements in the accuracy of the frequency predictions were observed at slightly increased velocities, 13.4 m/s (30 mph) and 17.9 m/s (40 mph), but a reduction in accuracy was observed at higher velocities, 22.3 m/s (50 mph).

AB The introduction of autonomous vehicles has been considered as a possible option for reducing traffic congestion in many transport studies. Many types of models, in particular car-following microsimulation models have been adopted in most studies. The impacts of autonomous vehicles (AVs) on congestion, however, have not yet been concluded. This could be because different researchers use different forms of car-following models to assess these impacts, or because the utilised modelling approaches and their parameters are different in different studies. In particular, two of the important parameters that are associated with car-following models are the used values for maximum acceleration and the average desired time gaps. While the values of these parameters can be adjusted and controlled by the ACC controllers in the AV, they can also be controlled by the users. Therefore, assigning unrealistic values to these parameters could well result in unrealistic conclusions. This paper investigated the impacts of the maximum acceleration and the average desired time gaps on congestion levels using the loss-time indicator. The analysis was carried out on the Hanshin expressway in Japan and was tested and assessed using the Helly (FACC) car-following microsimulation model. This includes estimating the values of the desired time gap from real traffic time-gap distributions. The Hanshin expressway is an urban toll highway of 273 km that extends from Osaka to Kobe, representing the Hanshin area in Japan. The Hanshin highway serves a huge traffic volume that consists of private and freight vehicles that operate within the Hanshin area. This area represents one of three major municipal areas in Japan including Tokyo and Nagoya. A total of 740,000 vehicles per day travel on the expressway. As a result, there is significant congestion on the Hanshin expressway. There have been various plans put in place to ease congestion ranging from building new roads to the implementation of traffic-demand-management measures. However, the predictions of the impacts of such measures do not provide any evidence that they would ease traffic congestion. Other possible measures that could be investigated for easing traffic congestion include technology-based solutions such as autonomous vehicles. The modelling results recommend that the results obtained from microsimulation models should be taken with care, and good attention should be paid to the parameters used and their values in the model. The values assigned to driving-behaviour parameters, the maximum values of acceleration, and the time-gap settings, for example, control the final outcomes of the models.

AB Path planning plays a major role in autonomous vehicle navigation. Among different kinds of intersections, roundabouts are far more difficult to plot a course than other intersections due to their special design. Different curve fitting methods such as circles, clothoid curves, Bezier curves are utilized for path planning inside a roundabout. Among those Bezier curves are widely used as they can generate a possible number of paths. However, the major drawback when adopting a Bezier curve is locating its control points. Control points need to be placed correctly for the path to generate. Roundabouts have varying shapes and sizes, there is no one-size-fits-all strategy for locating the control points in a roundabout. Moreover, the circulating path of a roundabout is generally formed based on the radius of the circular path, but this method cannot be applied in all roundabouts since the roundabout can have variable shapes depending on the available space. Therefore, this paper introduces a new method called the triangular-based point selection approach for locating the control points for a Bezier curve traversing a path. The triangular-based point selection approach is used to find points on the road to calculate the control points of a Bezier curve passing through these points. The circular path is likewise created using Bezier curve allowing the path to follow the contour of the roundabout. The proposed method is demonstrated in an oval-shaped roundabout and tested using a vehicle model also the proposed path generation algorithm is compared with other path planning methods.

AB The adapting of lateral deviation during the change of road curvature with less error, system settling time, and overshoot is the main challenge against the steering angle control of autonomous vehicles (AVs). In this regard, this paper introduces new learning techniques defined opposition-based learning (OBL) and quasi OBL (QOBL) to improve the exploration as well as exploitation manner of the grey wolf optimizer (GWO). The involved approach can enhance the searching behavior of the original GWO against the trapping in local optima. The proposed modified GWO (MGWO) is applied to detect the optimal factors of the adaptive model predictive control (AMPC) for AVs. The suggested MGWO-based AMPC is evaluated with the classical MPC and the adaptive fuzzy logic controller. Furthermore, the inspired MGWO is compared with the original GWO, neural network algorithm (NNA), heap-based optimizer, and equilibrium optimizer in literature. The performance of the introduced technique is tested to follow different road curvatures. Moreover, the presented method is approved against the time delay of the vision system and the produced uncertainty of system variables from the change of vehicle speed and look-ahead distance. Furthermore, the introduced MGWO-based AMPC can tackle the system settling time and overshoot to be less than 1 s and 1.696% respectively for the response of lateral deviation compared to other techniques. The attained results emphasize that the proposed MGWO-based AMPC controller has high damped and effective performance evaluated with other controllers.

AB The complex traffic conditions and high traffic flow are big challenges to the perception of autonomous vehicles. As the basis of environmental perception technology, object detection based on point cloud is of great significance for the normal operations of autonomous vehicles. Considering the complex traffic conditions, in this work, we use the One millioN sCenEs (ONCE) dataset to train an effective 3-D object detector, namely Voxel-region convolution neural network (RCNN)-Complex. This is accomplished by modifying the Voxel RCNN to make it suitable for complex traffic conditions. We add the residual structures in the 3-D backbone and design a heavy 3-D feature extractor, which is conducive to extracting high-dimensional information. We also design a 2-D backbone composed of residual structures, self-calibration convolution, and spatial attention and channel attention mechanism; this expands the receptive field and captures more context information. As compared with the Voxel RCNN, the proposed Voxel-RCNN-Complex significantly improves the detection performance for long-distance and small objects. In order to further increase the robustness of the proposed model and alleviate category imbalance, we use a class-balanced sampling strategy (CBSS). We evaluate the proposed model using the ONCE dataset. The results show that the proposed model achieves an mAP of 65.34% and an inference speed of 13.8 FPS. The experiments show that the proposed model performs better than other methods on the ONCE dataset. This demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed Voxel-RCNN-Complex. Moreover, we also test the proposed model in an intelligent vehicle platform on real roads.

AB This paper presents a comprehensive analysis of people-s attitudes toward shared mobility options and autonomous vehicles (AVs), with a focus on the underlying patterns and potential determinants. A stated preference (SP) survey was designed and implemented in the U.S. Four sets of questions were included in the questionnaire, each focused on one unique aspect of user attitudes, including a) preferences for mobility options and lifestyle (such as overall view of driving, factors in mode choice decisions and technology engagement), b) perceived benefits and concerns of shared mobility option, c) reasons toward or against private vehicle ownership, and d) motivations for and desired features of AVs. A structural equations model was developed to identify latent attitudinal factors and examine the correlations between the latent attitudes (as the endogenous variables) and the observed covariates (including the socio-economic and demographic characteristics, and users- current mobility profile, such as mode use frequency, travel distance, and trip fare). The model identified eleven latent factors that represent various aspects of attitudes toward AVs and shared mobility options. The findings could be used by policymakers and Transportation Network Companies (TNCs) to a) recognize the users- latent attitudes, b) understand the underlying patterns of attitudes, c) implement plans and policies more efficiently, d) guide or influence users- perceptions, and e) enhance travel behavior models. This study lays the foundation for further analysis on understanding user acceptance and adoption of these emerging mobility options, which is essential to estimate the likelihood and magnitude of behavior shifts in the era of automated, connected and shared mobility.

AB Autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) are unmanned submersibles that can be preprogrammed to navigate in three dimensions under water. The technological advances required for reliable deployment, mission control, performance, and recovery of AUVs have developed considerably over the past 10 years. Currently, there are several vehicles operating successfully in the offshore industries as well as in the applied and academic oceanographic sciences. This article reviews the application of AUVs to fisheries- and plankton-acoustics research. Specifications of the main AUVs currently in operation are given. Compared to traditional platforms for acoustic instruments, AUVs can sample previously impenetrable environments such as the sea surface, the deep sea, and under-sea ice. Furthermore, AUVs are typically small, quiet, and have the potential to operate at low cost and be unconstrained by the vagaries of weather. Examples of how these traits may be utilized in fisheries-acoustics science are given with reference to previous work in the North Sea and Southern Ocean and to potential future applications. Concurrent advances in multi-beam sonar technology and species identification, using multi-frequency and broadband sonars, will further enhance the utility of AUVs for fisheries acoustics. However, before many of the more prospective applications can be accomplished, advances in power-source technology are required to increase the range of operation. The paper ends by considering developments that may turn AUVs from objects sometimes perceived as science fiction into instruments used routinely to gather scientific facts.

ID LATERAL CONTROL; DESIGN
AB Several works have proposed longitudinal control strategies enabling a vehicle to operate adaptive cruise control and collision avoidance functions. However, no integration with lateral control has been proposed in the current state of the art, which motivates the developments of this work. This study presents an integrated control strategy for adaptive cruise control with auto-steering for highway driving. An appropriate logic-based control strategy is used to create synergies and safe interaction between longitudinal and lateral controllers to obtain both lateral stability and advanced adaptive cruise control functionalities. In particular, an index is proposed to evaluate lateral motion of the vehicle based on previously published experimental studies on human driving. In order to handle unstable lateral motion of the vehicle, the desired acceleration is determined based on physical limitation in braking with cornering situations. Simulation results show that the proposed integrated controller satisfies the performance in terms of autonomous driving, path tracking and collision avoidance for various driving situations.

ID DESIGN
AB This work proposes a fault tolerant aerial manipulator based on a standard hexarotor vehicle, which is able to maintain independent control of torque and vertical thrust in case of motor failure by adequately changing the manipulator configuration and therefore modifying the position of the system's center of mass. By analyzing the disturbance torque that the manipulator exerts on the vehicle, conditions to achieve stable flight and operation limits are established. To provide an experimental proof of concept, several flights are performed, both in indoor and outdoor environments, for different size and weight of manipulators.

AB Driving video is available from in-car camera for road detection and collision avoidance. However, consecutive video frames in a large volume have redundant scene coverage during vehicle motion, which hampers real-time perception in autonomous driving. This work utilizes compact road profiles (RP) and motion profiles (MP) to identify path regions and dynamic objects, which drastically reduces video data to a lower dimension and increases sensing rate. To avoid collision in a close range and navigate a vehicle in middle and far ranges, several RP/MPs are scanned continuously from different depths for vehicle path planning. We train deep network to implement semantic segmentation of RP in the spatial-temporal domain, in which we further propose a temporally shifting memory for online testing. It sequentially segments every incoming line without latency by referring to a temporal window. In streaming-mode, our method generates real-time output of road, roadsides, vehicles, pedestrians, etc. at discrete depths for path planning and speed control. We have experimented our method on naturalistic driving videos under various weather and illumination conditions. It reached the highest efficiency with the least amount of data.

AB Velocity planning serves as an important issue in motion planning for autonomous vehicles. The presented paper proposes a novel velocity planning method with minimum moving time on the basis of path curvature which is accomplished in three steps. First, the assigned path is divided into some elementary parts based on the path curvature. Second, the velocity planning is transformed into an unconstrained optimization problem by assuming the velocity of vehicle to be a specific cubic polynomial on every elementary part to avoid a sudden acceleration in path switching. Finally, we use a modified projection particle swarm optimization (PPSO) algorithm to obtain the time-optimal velocity profile. The proposed method can generate a smooth time-optimal velocity profile while considering all possible relevant constraints. Three examples are provided on different types of path to demonstrate that the final velocity profile is efficient to avoid the sudden acceleration change. Furthermore, the modified PPSO algorithm in this paper is used to solve the optimization problem with high dimensional variables when its upper bound is known, which can not be achieved by the general PPSO algorithm.

AB Controller tuning and state estimation both benefit from knowledge about the dynamic parameters of the marine vessel. However, identifying these parameters can be a daunting task requiring precise open-loop measurements or collection of many output data samples induced by persistently exciting inputs. Performing these experiments in real-life conditions, every time payload of the vehicle changes, can be troublesome. Additional problems appear if the vessel is overactuated. This paper focuses on thruster modelling, actuator allocation and dynamic model identification for an overactuated marine vehicle. Firstly, we demonstrate a practical approach to mapping thrusters of an overactuated marine vehicle that in practice can generate different thrusts at identical inputs. Secondly, we address the issue of inverse actuator allocation for an overactuated surface marine platform and demonstrate a daisy-chain approach for achieving proper thrust distribution during simultaneous motion in all controllable degrees of freedom (DoF). Finally, we describe the application of a robust identification by use of self-oscillations (IS-O) method to identify actuated DoF. While previous work focused on using IS-O for identifying yaw DoF of a rudder-actuated autonomous catamaran and thruster-actuated micro-remotely operated underwater vehicle, in this paper, we extend the approach to identifying surge and sway DoF. This closed-loop identification procedure requires one experiment with four to five oscillations to completely identify inertial and nonlinear drag parameters of a marine vessel. Surge, sway and yaw DoFs of an overactuated autonomous surface marine vehicle PlaDyPos (developed at the Laboratory for Underwater Systems and Technologies) were identified using the IS-O method during sea trials in real-life conditions. Multiple experiments with varying initial settings were performed showing reproducibility of the identification procedure. Comparison of the results with the ordinary least squares identification procedure shows that root mean square error increase is negligible, especially if simplicity (explicit formulae for calculation of unknown parameters) and time parsimony of the IS-O method are taken into account.

AB The correctness of autonomous driving software is of utmost importance, as incorrect behavior may have catastrophic consequences. Formal model-based engineering techniques can help guarantee correctness and thereby allow the safe deployment of autonomous vehicles. However, challenges exist for widespread industrial adoption of formal methods. One of these challenges is the model construction problem. Manual construction of formal models is time-consuming, error-prone, and intractable for large systems. Automating model construction would be a big step towards widespread industrial adoption of formal methods for system development, re-engineering, and reverse engineering. This article applies active learning techniques to obtain formal models of an existing (under development) autonomous driving software module implemented in MATLAB. This demonstrates the feasibility of automated learning for automotive industrial use. Additionally, practical challenges in applying automata learning, and possible directions for integrating automata learning into the automotive software development workflow, are discussed.

AB The arrival of autonomous vehicles (AVs) promises many great benefits, including increased safety and reduced energy consumption, pollution, and congestion. However, these engines have many security and privacy issues that could undermine the expected benefits if not addressed. AVs will provide new opportunities for hackers to carry out malicious attacks, posing a great threat to the future of mobility and data protection. The research trend in this field indicates that combining Blockchain and AI could bring strong protection for AVs against malicious attacks. Blockchain and AI have different working paradigms, but when merged, they can empower each other, and solve many security and privacy issues of AVs. AI can optimise the construction of the Blockchain to make it more efficient, secure and energy-saving, where Blockchain provides data immutability and trust mechanism for AI-based solutions and makes them more transparent, trustful, and explainable. Although some research is being conducted on this area, the topic of applying Blockchain and AI for securing AVs is not deeply investigated. In this paper, we explore the possible application of an amalgamation of Blockchain and AI solutions for securing AVs. We first introduce a classification of security and privacy threats that may arise from the application of AVs. Then, we provide an overview of recent literature regarding Blockchain and AI usage for securing AVs. Finally, we highlight limitations and challenges that may face the integration of Blockchain and AI with AVs based on our systemic review and suggest potential future directions for research in this field.

AB Introduction: Autonomous vehicles (AVs) are expected to be a major world trend. They are predicted to enhance safety, flexibility, inclusiveness and sustainability in travel. However, the multitude of benefits from AVs is likely to be overshadowed by their disruptive effects on active transport use. Unless mitigated, the decline in active transport use will produce a significant burden on health, businesses, productivity, congestion, and well-being. However, planners are unsure of how to define long-term visions and identify transition pathways to achieve a desired driverless city.Methods: This paper presents a scoping review of studies in the nexus between AVs (levels 4 and 5) and active transport. Based on an understanding of the mechanism by which AVs are likely to affect active transport, a conceptual framework is developed by identifying and categorising specific variables and mapping their relationships. Finally, suggestions are made for future research to inform planning for driverless cities that promote active transport use.Results: Findings show that AVs will affect active transport through 35 different pathways. The pathways are different for private AVs and shared AVs. The review shows that both private-and shared-AVs would not only disrupt active transport but also create opportunities encouraging people to use active transport.Conclusion: The findings from this study: a) present a foundation in understanding the disruptive effects of AVs on active transport; b) provide insights into how policy pathways can be developed to encourage active transport in driverless cities; c) act as a basis to operationalise future research within an established framework; d) indicate how future research might advance knowledge on the topic; and e) provide a reference point for interpretation of findings.

AB A randomized kinodynamic path planning algorithm based on the incremental sampling-based method is proposed here as the state-of-the-art in this field applicable in an autonomous underwater vehicle. Designing a feasible path for this vehicle from an initial position and velocity to a target position and velocity in three-dimensional spaces by considering the kinematic constraints such as obstacles avoidance and dynamic constraints such as hard bounds and non-holonomic characteristic of AUV are the main motivation of this research. For this purpose, a closed-loop rapidly-exploring random tree (CL-RRT) algorithm is presented. This CL-RRT consists of three tightly coupled components: a RRT algorithm, three fuzzy proportional-derivative controllers for heading and diving control and a six degree-of-freedom nonlinear AUV model. The branches of CL-RRT are expanded in the configuration space by considering the kinodynamic constraints of AUV. The feasibility of each branch and random offspring vertex in the CL-RRT is checked against the mentioned constraints of AUV. Next, if the planned branch is feasible by the AUV, then the control signals and related vertex are recorded through the path planner to design the final path. This proposed algorithm is implemented on a single board computer (SBC) through the xPC Target and then four test-cases are designed in 3D space. The results of the processor-in-the-loop tests are compared by the conventional RRT and indicate that the proposed CL-RRT not only in a rapid manner plans an initial path, but also the planned path is feasible by the AUV.

AB Autonomous vehicles (AVs) are expected to bring various changes in people's lives. Such expected changes in life may affect people's decisions on the ownership of privately-owned AVs (PAVs) and even future travel demand structure. However, such effects remained unclear due to the lack of relevant studies. By targeting young people, this study fills this research gap by implementing a nation-wide expectation and stated preference (SP) survey in Japan, by comparing with older people. In the survey, respondents first reported their expected changes in life caused by AVs and then chose the most preferred vehicle from a choice set with three types of PAVs (conditional, high, and full automation) and a conventional car. The survey was implemented in 2016 and 3,006 valid SP responses were collected from 1,002 respondents (417 are young people). It is found that young people expected more changes in life and are more likely to choose PAVs with high and full automation than older people, which is consistent with the reported willingness-to-pay. By estimating a mixed logit model with panel data, it is revealed that expected changes in life affect the two age groups' choices of PAVs. There are more inconsistent influences of expected changes in life between the two groups than consistent influences, suggesting the presence of age-related structural differences of responses to future expectations. Diverse responses to future expectations are revealed, which policy implications are discussed. The findings support a life-oriented paradigm shift of travel behavior research and cross-sectoral transport policymaking and future sustainable society design.

ID MODEL-PREDICTIVE CONTROL; STEERING CONTROL; GROUND VEHICLES
AB A novel nonlinear model predictive control (NMPC) strategy for path tracking of autonomous vehicles with stable limit handling is proposed in this article. To improve the path tracking performance under complex driving maneuvers, a tire lateral force model, which treats road adhesion coefficient and vertical load as variable parameters, is discussed first. It has the advantage that the dynamics model can be applied under different driving conditions. In addition, the stability properties of the dynamics system with the front tire lateral force as the virtual control input are analyzed. The global asymptotical stability with zero input and local input-to-state stability with nonzero input of the dynamics system are proved respectively. To perform path tracking within the handling limits, both constraints of front tire lateral force and rear tire slip angle are included in the NMPC controller. The constraint of front tire lateral force is considered as peak limits related to load transfer and adhesion coefficient. And for the rear tire slip angle, a combining constraint scheme is proposed, where the indirect constraint is implemented by a penalty term that predicts the saturation of rear tire lateral force, while the direct constraint is implemented by a dead-zone exponential penalty function. The Continuation/Generalized Minimum Residual (C/GMRES) algorithm is applied to improve the computation efficiency of the NMPC. The performance of the controller is evaluated in simulations and hardware-in-the-loop (HIL) tests, and the results show that the controller is able to track the reference path with high precision in real-time.

AB Autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) have been widely used to perform underwater tasks. Due to the environmental disturbances, underactuated problems, system constraints, and system coupling, AUV trajectory tracking control is challenging. Thus, further investigation of dynamic characteristics and trajectory tracking control methods of the AUV motion system will be of great importance to improve underwater task performance. An AUV controller must be able to cope with various challenges with the underwater vehicle, adaptively update the reference model, and overcome unexpected deviations. In order to identify modeling strategies and the best control practices, this paper presents an overview of the main factors of control-oriented models and control strategies for AUVs. In modeling, two fields are considered: (i) models that come from simplifications of Fossen's equations; and (ii) system identification models. For each category, a brief description of the control-oriented modeling strategies is given. In the control field, three relevant aspects are considered: (i) significance of AUV trajectory tracking control, (ii) control strategies; and (iii) control performance. For each aspect, the most important features are explained. Furthermore, in the aspect of control strategies, mathematical modeling study and physical experiment study are introduced in detail. Finally, with the aim of establishing the acceptability of the reported modeling and control techniques, as well as challenges that remain open, a discussion and a case study are presented. The literature review shows the development of new control-oriented models, the research in the estimation of unknown inputs, and the development of more innovative control strategies for AUV trajectory tracking systems are still open problems that must be addressed in the short term.

AB The emerging technology of autonomous vehicles (AVs) is envisaged to substantially alter transport systems and travel behaviour. However, this impact is conditional on the level and rate of AV market penetration. This study examines consumers' consideration to adopt AVs, with a particular focus on the impact of informational cues from different communication channels. Data for our analysis is collected through an online survey conducted in December 2019, and our sample comprises 862 residents from Sydney, Australia. The survey asks respondents about their social networks, and their use of different mass and social media platforms. Respondents are subsequently presented a discrete choice experiment where we systematically vary informational cues about AVs from each of these communication channels, and respondents are asked to indicate their willingness to consider AVs under each scenario. This data is used to develop a latent class choice model of AV consideration as a function of the informational cues received from different communication channels. Our model also considers the level of trust that respondents associate with their social contacts when modelling the effect of word-of-mouth from these social contacts. The results reveal eleven segments in the sample that differ from one another in terms of sociodemographic attributes, evaluation of social contact trust, and the relative importance they attach to different communication channels. The findings show social media sentiment has the highest effect on AV consideration for 90 per cent of the sample. Also 3.8 per cent of the sample never consider adopting AVs, regardless of the informational cues.

AB Platoon services are being driven by the development of Internet of things, prompting changes in existing businesses and the generation of new businesses. In this paper, a business model and business model canvas related to platoon services are proposed, and the cost analysis of heavy freight transport platoon services from the perspective of platoon leaders and followers is conducted. In addition, the fuel consumption saving brought about by platoon services in freight transport of 28 European Union countries is estimated. The results indicate that the providers of the autonomous driving package, Internet of things devices and the platoon service platform are new stakeholders in the business model. The business model canvas shows the value propositions of platoon services, such as increased traffic efficiency, decreased energy consumption, and the opportunity of involvement in other activities. In addition, the analysis of cost structures for platoon leaders and followers shows that the autonomous driving package has the highest percentage of cost in the first year of a vehicle's lifespan and decreases rapidly in the years that follow. The platoon services ease the financial burden of the leaders due to decreased fuel consumption and income from the leading service, with the highest value up to 4.7%. As for the fuel consumption reductions benefited from platoon services, Germany may have the largest potential of national annual fuel saving, followed by France, Spain and the United Kingdom, while the countries that may benefit the most from fuel savings in international freight transport are Poland and Spain.

AB We developed an automated cable-laying system operated through a remotely operated vehicle (ROV). This system can automatically install a thin optical-fiber submarine cable at a rate that matches the ground speed of the ROV and adjust the amount of cable slack. The use of an ROV allows accurate and safe deployment of a thin optical-fiber submarine cable on the deep seafloor. The automated cable-laying system has been successfully used in installing the dense oceanfloor network system for earthquakes and tsunamis (DONET2) off the Kii peninsula in Japan. In our previous paper, we described the development process of the automated cable-laying system in detail. The current study focuses on the application in DONET2 installation and shows the practical advantages produced through automation. First, we overview the automated cable-laying system and then report on the successful application in DONET2 installation. The operating time and number of operators were distinctly reduced. Moreover, the physical and mental burden on the operators was relieved. In addition, several lessons learned during DONET2 installation are presented, and the unmanned cable-laying using an autonomous underwater vehicle is briefly discussed.

AB For successful autonomous valet parking, accurate knowledge of vehicle location in the global map is crucial. Using sensors and maps can be an alternative method for the indoor parking localization to compensate for lack of GPS coverage. However, maps only have static elements such as walls and pillars and semi-static elements such as parked vehicles are not included. Thus, sensor data rarely match with the map data due to the semi-static elements. We developed a robust localization algorithm using a laser scanner, a static map and a feature extraction algorithm. Overall map features consisted of the center positions of parking slots and pillars. Parking slot measurements were extracted from parked vehicles. Position estimation errors occur when matching the vehicle center positions to the parking slot center positions. This error can be reduced by detecting pillars and giving more weight to the observation of these static elements. The contribution of this approach is that we can use not only static objects but also semi-static objects and that position estimation error is reduced. The algorithm was evaluated in the scaled down indoor parking model. The average position errors of this algorithm are compared with errors of odometry data and SIS particle filter.

AB Driverless vehicles are expected to improve traffic safety and efficiency in the future. If the autonomous driving technologies are successfully developed, they are anticipated to be applied not only to private vehicles but also public buses, taxis (including ride-pooling services). Such driverless vehicles may cause passengers to be concerned about crimes on such driverless public transportation. Thus, this study explores users' acceptance of driverless public buses and ride-pooling services and how the individual characteristics affect their perceived risks of crime occurrence and victimization, and willingness to use these modes. To achieve this objective, 1,090 questionnaires were collected from China. The survey shows that approximately 43% of the respondents answered that the possibility of crime is high, 39% stated they do not want to use driverless public buses or ride pooling cars, and 30% think that the possibility of being a victim is high. Three random parameters ordered probit models are estimated. The results show that: (1) people believe a driverless vehicle is more dangerous than a conventional one in terms of crime; (2) females are more concerned about crime occurrence; (3) respondents are more concerned about crime occurrence at night; (4) people have significant concerns about crime occurrence on a driverless public bus than on a ride-pooling car; and (5) region, travel time, income, education level, and safety measures have significant effects on the perceived risk of crime.

AB The platooning of autonomous vehicles has the potential to significantly improve traffic capacity, enhance highway safety, and reduce fuel consumption. This paper studies the scalability limitations of large-scale vehicular platoons moving in rigid formation, and proposes two basic ways to improve stability margins, i.e., enlarging information topology and employing asymmetric control. A vehicular platoon is considered as a combination of four components: 1) node dynamics; 2) decentralized controller; 3) information flow topology; and 4) formation geometry. Tools, such as the algebraic graph theory and matrix factorization technique, are employed to model and analyze scalability limitations. The major findings include: 1) under linear identical decentralized controllers, the stability thresholds of control gains are explicitly established for platoons under undirected topologies. It is proved that the stability margins decay to zero as the platoon size increases unless there is a large number of following vehicles pinned to the leader and 2) the stability margins of vehicular platoons under bidirectional topologies using asymmetric controllers are always bounded away from zero and independent of the platoon size. Simulations with a platoon of passenger cars are used to demonstrate the findings.

TI Generalised steering strategy for vehicle navigation on sloping ground
SO BIOSYSTEMS ENGINEERING
LA English
DT Article
ID AUTOMATIC GUIDANCE
AB An autonomous tractor guidance system for vehicle navigation on sloping ground was developed by extending a previous study in which navigation was limited to a specific gradient. A previously developed neural network vehicle model was trained along the contour lines of 0, 5, 11 and 15degrees sloping terrain. Using the trained models and a cost function, optimal steering angles for different ranges of deviations were sought by genetic algorithm and the optimal values were arranged in separate matrix-form reference table for each slope. The optimal steering values of the four reference tables were expressed by a third-order polynomial equation so that the equation can provide an optimal steering value for any inclination. The coefficients of the equations were tabulated in a matrix form, which is designated as a 'general reference table'. If the slope inclination and vehicle attitude can be determined, real-time navigation of the tractor is possible using this table. An autonomous travel test was conducted on inclined surface. It was found that the developed guidance system could precisely navigate the tractor along a rectilinear contour path on 20degrees sloping terrain, where the mean offset was 0.05 m and its standard deviation was 0.044 m.

AB Autonomous vehicle technologies have evolved quickly over the last few years, with safety being one of the key requirements for their full deployment. However, ensuring their safety while navigating through highly interactive and complex scenarios remains a critical challenge. To tackle this problem, intention estimation and motion prediction are fundamental. In this work, a method to infer the intentions, based on a Dynamic Bayesian Network (DBN), and predict the motion, using Markov Chains, of the nearby vehicles at unsignalized intersections is proposed. This approach considers all possible corridors of the surrounding traffic participants and takes into account their interactions to infer the probabilities of stopping or crossing the intersection, as well as the probability of being in each of the possible navigable corridors. To achieve this, the DBN is used to model the relationships between the observed states and the unobserved intentions of the nearby agents. The Markov Chain model, obtained from a kinematic model, is used to predict the future motions of the vehicles, taking into account their current state, their inferred intentions, and the uncertainty associated with the prediction. The resulting multi-modal motion predictions are sent to the ego vehicle to navigate through the scene. The proposed method is evaluated in 6 real situations extracted from publicly available datasets and is compared with a model-based and a learn-based baseline models. The results showed that the proposed method outperformed both baselines in terms of accuracy considering the metrics ADE and FDE.

AB As autonomous driving technology advances, the possibility of using vehicles as sleeping environments becomes increasingly relevant. To investigate the feasibility of this concept, a sleep study was conducted with twelve participants who were given a 4-h opportunity window to sleep in both reclined and flat seat configurations. The evaluation involved both objective measures, including polysomnographic (PSG) data analysis, and subjective measures through questionnaires, assessing sleep quality and comfort. While the sleep quantity results were comparable between the two sleeping positions, the reclined position showed a slight advantage in sleep quantity (TST and WASO). Interestingly, a trend highlighting a possible difference was found between the seat positions regarding non-rapid eye movement stage 3 (NREM 3). NREM 3 tended to be in a higher proportion of total sleep time in the flat seat position. Sleep onset latency (SOL) also showed a trend of a shorter latency by participants in the flat position. Additionally, most participants reported a preference for the flat position over the reclined position. These findings suggest that a flat seat configuration could offer a more comfortable and restful sleep environment for passengers in autonomous vehicles.

AB Mesobot, an autonomous underwater vehicle, addresses specific unmet needs for observing and sampling a variety of phenomena in the ocean's midwaters. The midwater hosts a vast biomass, has a role in regulating climate, and may soon be exploited commercially, yet our scientific understanding of it is incomplete. Mesobot has the ability to survey and track slow-moving animals and to correlate the animals' movements with critical environmental measurements. Mesobot will complement existing oceanographic assets such as towed, remotely operated, and autonomous vehicles; shipboard acoustic sensors; and net tows. Its potential to perform behavioral studies unobtrusively over long periods with substantial autonomy provides a capability that is not presently available to midwater researchers. The 250-kilogram marine robot can be teleoperated through a lightweight fiber optic tether and can also operate untethered with full autonomy while minimizing environmental disturbance. We present recent results illustrating the vehicle's ability to automatically track free-swimming hydromedusae (Solmissus sp.) and larvaceans (Bathochordaeus stygius) at depths of 200 meters in Monterey Bay, USA. In addition to these tracking missions, the vehicle can execute preprogrammed missions collecting image and sensor data while also carrying substantial auxiliary payloads such as cameras, sonars, and samplers.

TI Little Ben: The Ben Franklin Racing Team's entry in the 2007 DARPA Urban

AB This paper describes "Little Ben," an autonomous ground vehicle constructed by the Ben Franklin Racing Team for the 2007 DARPA Urban Challenge in under a year and for less than $250,000. The sensing, planning, navigation, and actuation systems for Little Ben were carefully designed to meet the performance demands required of an autonomous vehicle traveling in an uncertain urban environment. We incorporated an array of a global positioning system (GPS)/inertial navigation system, LIDARs, and stereo cameras to provide timely information about the surrounding environment at the appropriate ranges. This sensor information was integrated into a dynamic map that could robustly handle GPS dropouts and errors. Our planning algorithms consisted of a high-level mission planner that used information from the provided route network definition and mission data files to select routes, whereas the lower level planner used the latest dynamic map information to optimize a feasible trajectory to the next waypoint. The vehicle was actuated by a cost-based controller that efficiently handled steering, throttle, and braking maneuvers in both forward and reverse directions. Our software modules were integrated within a hierarchical architecture that allowed rapid development and testing of the system performance. The resulting vehicle was one of six to successfully finish the Urban Challenge. (c) 2008 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

AB As autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) are becoming routinely used in an exploratory context for ocean science, the goal of visually augmented navigation (VAN) is to improve the near-seafloor navigation precision of such vehicles without imposing the burden of having to deploy additional infrastructure. This is in contrast to traditional acoustic long baseline navigation techniques, which require the deployment, calibration, and eventual recovery of. a transponder network. To achieve this goal, VAN is formulated within a vision-based simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) framework that exploits the systems-level complementary aspects of a camera and strap-down sensor suite. The result is an environmentally based navigation technique robust to the peculiarities of low-overlap underwater imagery. The method employs a view-based representation where camera-derived relative-pose measurements provide spatial constraints, which enforce trajectory consistency and also serve as a mechanism for loop closure, allowing for error growth to be independent of time for revisited imagery. This article outlines the multisensor VAN framework and demonstrates it to have compelling advantages over a purely vision-only approach by: 1) improving the robustness of low-overlap underwater image registration; 2) setting the free gauge scale; and 3) allowing for a disconnected camera-constraint topology.

AB This article presents a novel adaptive-event-trigger-based fuzzy nonlinear lateral dynamic control algorithm for autonomous electric vehicles under insecure communication networks. The integration of path following control and direct yaw moment control is considered to acquire a better lateral dynamic performance. To effectively tackle inherent nonlinearities of lateral dynamics, the Takagi-Sugeno fuzzy model approach is employed to approximate the nonlinear lateral dynamics. To avoid the infeasibility of state-feedback control due to the immeasurability of sideslip angle, a fuzzy output feedback control strategy is proposed via a useful transformation. To improve resource utilization of the band-limited communication networks, an adaptive event-triggered communication mechanism is proposed to save communication resource. Moreover, to enhance the robustness of the proposed controller, the insecure communication link is considered, which is described by the Bernoulli random distributed process. Finally, simulation results show the proposed adaptive-event-trigger-based fuzzy controller not only can save communication resource, but also achieve the perfect control performance.

AB This paper proposes a new reinforcement learning approach for executing combat unmanned aerial vehicle (CUAV) missions. We consider missions with the following goals: guided missile avoidance, shortest-path flight and formation flight. For reinforcement learning, the representation of the current agent state is important. We propose a novel method of using the coordinates and angle of a CUAV to effectively represent its state. Furthermore, we develop a reinforcement learning algorithm with enhanced exploration through amplification of the imitation effect (AIE). This algorithm consists of self-imitation learning and random network distillation algorithms. We assert that these two algorithms complement each other and that combining them amplifies the imitation effect for exploration. Empirical results show that the proposed AIE approach is highly effective at finding a CUAV's shortest-flight path while avoiding enemy missiles. Test results confirm that with our method, a single CUAV reaches its target from its starting point 95% of the time and a squadron of four simultaneously operating CUAVs reaches the target 70% of the time.

DT Article
DE robotics; flight operations; motion
AB To demonstrate proof-of-concept of the Griffon man-portable hybrid unmanned ground vehicle/unmanned aerial vehicle (UGV/UAV) based on the iRobot PackBot we developed the Griffon air mobility system consisting of a gasoline-powered propeller engine, a steerable parafoil, and a radio-controlled servo system. We integrated the AMS with a PackBot prototype, and we conducted ground and flight tests to validate this concept. The Griffon prototype was capable of remote-controlled flight, take-off, and landing. The Griffon achieved speeds of over 20 mph and altitudes of up to 200 feet. We demonstrated the feasibility of developing a man-portable hybrid UGV/UAV. Future work may explore the possibilities for teleoperated, semi-autonomous, and fully autonomous control using the Griffon concept. The parafoil wing limits the usability of this vehicle in windy conditions, but this could be addressed using a lightweight fixed wing instead. Man-portable hybrid UGV/UAVs may be used by the military to perform reconnaissance and strike missions in urban environments, and by civilian teams to conduct search-and-rescue operations in hazardous terrain. This research provides the first demonstration of a man-portable unmanned vehicle capable of both flight and ground locomotion, and it does so using a combat-tested UGV platform.

AB Most of the vehicle manufacturers aim to deploy level-5 fully autonomous ground vehicles (FAGVs) on city roads in 2021 by leveraging extensive existing knowledge about sensors, actuators, telematics and Artificial Intelligence (AI) gained from the level-3 and level-4 autonomy. FAGVs by executing non-trivial sequences of events with decimetre-level accuracy live in Smart City (SC) and their integration with all the SC components and domains using real-time data analytics is urgent to establish better swarm intelligent systems and a safer and optimised harmonious smart environment enabling cooperative FAGVs-SC automation systems. The challenges of urbanisation, if unmet urgently, would entail severe economic and environmental impacts. The integration of FAGVs with SC helps improve the sustainability of a city and the functional and efficient deployment of hand over wheels on robotized city roads with behaviour coordination. SC can enable the exploitation of the full potential of FAGVs with embedded centralised systems within SC with highly distributed systems in a concept of Automation of Everything (AoE). This article proposes a synergistic integrated FAGV-SC holistic framework - FAGVinSCF in which all the components of SC and FAGVs involving recent and impending technological advancements are moulded to make the transformation from today's driving society to future's next-generation driverless society smoother and truly make self-driving technology a harmonious part of our cities with sustainable urban development. Based on FAGVinSCF, a simulation platform is built both to model the varying penetration levels of FAGV into mixed traffic and to perform the optimal self-driving behaviours of FAGV swarms. The results show that FAGVinSCF improves the urban traffic flow significantly without huge changes to the traffic infrastructure. With this framework, the concept of Cooperative Intelligent Transportation Systems (C-ITS) is transformed into the concept of Automated ITS (A-ITS). Cities currently designed for cars can turn into cities developed for citizens using FAGVinSCF enabling more sustainable cities.

AB The technological advancements involving information and communication technologies (ICT), such as Connected and Automated Vehicles (CAVs) and the Intelligent Transport Systems (ITS), have enabled new efficient traffic control and management strategies to mitigate traffic congestion. Specifically, the combined traffic flow-speed advisory systems based on CAVs and ITS technologies could provide the individual vehicle with the optimal speed to reduce the fuel consumption, the number of stops, simultaneously reduce the network-wide traffic congestion and improve road safety. This article develops a novel bi-level control framework underpinned by the mutual interaction between a system optimal traffic flow control strategy at a network level and a speed control policy for an individual vehicle at a link level within a connected traffic environment. Our framework proposes the novel group-based method to guarantee the consistency and interaction between the macroscopic and microscopic models. To this end, it efficiently optimizes vehicular trajectories while meeting the network-wide objectives which have not been investigated previously in the literature. We propose an efficient algorithm for this problem that iteratively solves mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) models for each upper and lower level. Numerical results indicate the effectiveness of the proposed speed advisory method in vehicular emission reduction, favorable network queue formation, and its positive influence on traffic flow patterns over the network.

AB Presently, technology innovations are disrupting the status quo and changing the way people travel. In an effort to enhance safety, ease driving tasks, and attract car buyers, automobile manufacturers are offering new vehicle automation technologies. As these vehicle technologies become more automated, navigation around and interactions with pedestrians and bicyclists in complex travel environments becomes more challenging. With people being less predictable and less identifiable than other machines, these technologies can pose safety concerns for all users. In light of this, there is a need to further study the interaction between cyclists, pedestrians, and automated vehicles. In 2019, Bike Pittsburgh (BikePGH) conducted a survey of autonomous vehicles (AVs) in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania to understand the perception of bicyclists and pedestrians when sharing the road with AVs. This study used the data collected by BikePGH to understand various factors associated with bicyclists' and pedestrians' perception of safety when sharing the road with AVs. Bayesian Networks (BNs) were used to learn the probabilistic interrelationship among AVs' aspects. BN results revealed that familiarity with the technology behind AVs, feeling safe while sharing the road with AVs, and using Pittsburgh's public streets as a proving ground for AVs were associated with higher likelihood of AVs' safety potential to reduce traffic injuries and fatalities. On the other hand, feeling safe while sharing the road with human-driven cars was associated with lower likelihood of AVs' safety potential to reduce traffic injuries and fatalities. Furthermore, the BN model predicted that the experience of sharing the road with AVs while riding a bicycle or walking, familiarity with the technology behind AVs, and using Pittsburgh's public streets as a proving ground for AVs were associated with higher likelihood of feeling safe sharing the road with AVs. The joint analysis of the variable showed the highest predicted probabilities of 95% and 86%, respectively for AVs' potential to reduce traffic injuries and fatalities and for feeling safe sharing the road with AVs. The practical application of this study is presented along with recommendations to operators, city engineers, and planner.

AB Variabilities in the coastal ocean environment span a wide range of spatial and temporal scales. From an acoustic viewpoint, the limited oceanographic measurements and today's ocean computational capabilities are not always able to provide oceanic-acoustic predictions in high-resolution and with enough accuracy. Adaptive Rapid Environmental Assessment (AREA) is an adaptive sampling concept being developed in connection with the emergence of Autonomous Ocean Sampling Networks and interdisciplinary ensemble predictions and adaptive sampling via Error Subspace Statistical Estimation (ESSE). By adaptively and optimally deploying in situ sampling resources and assimilating these data into coupled nested ocean and acoustic models, AREA can dramatically improve the estimation of ocean fields that matter for acoustic predictions. These concepts are outlined and a methodology is developed and illustrated based on the Focused Acoustic Forecasting-05 (FAF05) exercise in the northern Tyrrhenian sea. The methodology first couples the data-assimilative environmental and acoustic propagation ensemble modeling. An adaptive sampling plan is then predicted, using the uncertainty of the acoustic predictions as input to an optimization scheme which finds the parameter values of autonomous sampling behaviors that optimally reduce this forecast of the acoustic uncertainty. To compute this reduction, the expected statistics of unknown data to be sampled by different candidate sampling behaviors are assimilated. The predicted-optimal parameter values are then fed to the sampling vehicles. A second adaptation of these parameters is ultimately carried out in the water by the sampling vehicles using onboard routing, in response to the real ocean data that they acquire. The autonomy architecture and algorithms used to implement this methodology are also described. Results from a number of real-time AREA simulations using data collected during the Focused Acoustic Forecasting (FAF05) exercise are presented and discussed for the case of a single Autonomous Underwater Vehicle (AUV). For FAF05, the main AREA-ESSE application was the optimal tracking of the ocean thermocline based on ocean-acoustic ensemble prediction, adaptive sampling plans for vertical Yo-Yo behaviors and subsequent onboard Yo-Yo routing.

AB Autonomous vehicles have been highlighted as a major growth area for future transportation systems and the deployment of large numbers of these vehicles is expected when safety and legal challenges are overcome. To meet the necessary safety standards, effective collision avoidance technologies are required to ensure that the number of accidents are kept to a minimum. As large numbers of autonomous vehicles, operating together on roads, can be regarded as a swarm system, we propose a bio-inspired collision avoidance strategy using virtual pheromones; an approach that has evolved effectively in nature over many millions of years. Previous research using virtual pheromones showed the potential of pheromone-based systems to maneuver a swarm of robots. However, designing an individual controller to maximise the performance of the entire swarm is a major challenge. In this paper, we propose a novel deep reinforcement learning (DRL) based approach that is able to train a controller that introduces collision avoidance behaviour. To accelerate training, we propose a novel sampling strategy called Highlight Experience Replay and integrate it with a Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient algorithm with noise added to the weights and biases of the artificial neural network to improve exploration. To evaluate the performance of the proposed DRL-based controller, we applied it to navigation and collision avoidance tasks in three different traffic scenarios. The experimental results showed that the proposed DRL-based controller outperformed the manually-tuned controller in terms of stability, effectiveness, robustness and ease of tuning process. Furthermore, the proposed Highlight Experience Replay method outperformed than the popular Prioritized Experience Replay sampling strategy by taking 27% of training time average over three stages.

DE Autonomous public transport vehicles; Real-time strategies; Schedule
   adjustments; Fluctuated passenger demand; Energy efficiency
ID PASSENGER DEMAND; SERVICE; SYSTEM
AB New advanced technologies have made it possible to deal with real-time schedule adjustments of public transport (PT) service. Indeed, using autonomous public transport vehicles (APTVs) prudently can result in significant improvements in the reliability, efficiency, and attractiveness of PT. The lack of human drivers and the feasible control strategies of the APTVs make it possible to offer a reliable, efficient and attractive service that can handle, in real time, the fluctuations in passenger demand. This work assumes that the APTVs of a single line are controlled centrally and are responsive to real-time requests from passengers. As the result, a real-time schedule can be constructed and communicated to the passengers. However, during the actual operations, the real-time demand will be fluctuated entailing schedule adjustments. These adjustments are optimized in this work using two operational strategies for the APTVs: holding and speed changing. The solution methodology proposed is based on time-space graphical techniques using multicriteria decision analysis to minimize schedule changes as the primary objective, as well as to reduce travel time and active energy consumption. Two multi-objective models are developed for not-considered and considered vehicle capacity and then examined using a simulation framework. A case study from Auckland, New Zealand, is selected, which assumes that ordinary buses are replaced with APTVs. The results indicate that the strategy-based optimal schedule adjustments achieve a 100% elimination of schedule deviations compared with 33-minute and 13-minute deviations for the low-demand and high-demand scenarios of the ordinary PT service, respectively. The results of the simulated case study indicate that the incorporation of APTVs, along with prudent control, can result in a more attractive PT service.

AB This paper takes autonomous exploration in unknown environments on a small co-axial twin-rotor unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) platform as the task. The study of the fully autonomous positioning in unknown environments and navigation system without global navigation satellite system (GNSS) and other auxiliary positioning means is carried out. Algorithms that are based on the machine vision/proximity detection/inertial measurement unit, namely the combined navigation algorithm and indoor simultaneous location and mapping (SLAM) algorithm, are not only designed theoretically but also realized and verified in real surroundings. Additionally, obstacle detection, the decision-making of avoidance motion and motion planning methods such as Octree are also proposed, which are characterized by randomness and symmetry. The demonstration of the positioning and navigation system in the unknown environment and the verification of the indoor obstacle-avoidance flight were both completed through building an autonomous navigation and obstacle avoidance simulation system.

AB To reduce human risk and maintenance costs, Autonomous Underwater Vehicles (AUVs) are involved in subsea inspections and measurements for a wide range of marine industries such as offshore wind farms and other underwater infrastructure. Most of these inspections may require levels of manoeuvrability similar to what can be achieved by tethered vehicles, called Remotely Operated Vehicles (ROVs). To extend AUV intervention time and perform closer inspection in constrained spaces, AUVs need to be more efficient and flexible by being able to undulate around physical constraints. A biomimetic fish-like AUV known as RoboFish has been designed to mimic propulsion techniques observed in nature to provide high thrust efficiency and agility to navigate its way autonomously around complex underwater structures. Building upon advances in acoustic communications, computer vision, electronics and autonomy technologies, RoboFish aims to provide a solution to such critical inspections. This paper introduces the first RoboFish prototype that comprises cost-effective 3D printed modules joined together with innovative magnetic coupling joints and a modular software framework. Initial testing shows that the preliminary working prototype is functional in terms of water-tightness, propulsion, body control and communication using acoustics, with visual localisation and mapping capability.

AB Gliders are autonomous underwater vehicles that achieve long operating range by moving at speeds comparable to those of, or slower than, typical ocean currents. This paper addresses routing gliders to rapidly reach a specified waypoint or to maximize the ability to map a measured field, both in the presence of significant currents. For rapid transit in a frozen velocity field, direct minimization of travel time provides a trajectory "ray" equation. A simpler routing algorithm that requires less information is also discussed. Two approaches are developed to maximize the mapping ability, as measured by objective mapping error, of arrays of vehicles. In order to produce data sets that are readily interpretable, both approaches focus sampling near predetermined "ideal tracks" by measuring mapping skill only on those tracks, which are laid out with overall mapping skill in mind. One approach directly selects each vehicle's headings to maximize instantaneous mapping skill integrated over the entire array. Because mapping skill decreases when measurements are clustered, this method automatically coordinates glider arrays to maintain spacing. A simpler method that relies on manual control for array coordination employs a first-order control loop to balance staying close to the ideal track and maintaining vehicle speed to maximize mapping skill. While the various techniques discussed help in dealing with the slow speed of gliders, nothing can keep performance from being degraded when current speeds are comparable to vehicle speed. This suggests that glider utility could be greatly enhanced by the ability to operate high speeds for short periods when currents are strong. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB In addition to the fuel-efficient design of vehicles, eco-driving technologies can further reduce the fuel consumption and carbon emissions of road transportation. One of the major issues in eco-driving technologies is how to determine the fuel savings or fuel-optimised operating strategies of the power train. We examine the periodic operation of autonomous vehicles in free-driving scenarios with the purpose of maximising fuel economy. The design of such strategies can be considered to be an optimal control problem, which is proved by -test to have singular arcs because of the S-shaped engine fueling rate. The optimal operations are solved numerically by using the Legendre pseudospectral method, and many are found to demonstrate periodic behaviours, that is, pulse and gliding. In periodic operation, the engine switches between the minimum break specific fuel consumption point and the idling point, while the vehicle speed oscillates between its upper and lower bounds. The formation of periodic operation, as well as some key properties, is analysed and presented.

AB With the increasing number of automated vehicles (AVs) being tested and operating on roads, external Human-Machine Interfaces (eHMIs) are proposed to facilitate interactions between AVs and other road users. Considering the need to protect vulnerable road users, this paper addresses the issue by providing research evidence on various designs of eHMIs. Ninety participants took part in this experiment. Six sets of eHMI prototypes-Text, Arrowed (Dynamic), Text and Symbol, Symbol only, Tick and Cross and Traffic Lights, including two sub-designs (Cross and Do Not Cross)-were designed. The results showed that 65.1% of participants agreed that external communication would have a positive effect on pedestrians' crossing decisions. Among all the prototypes, Text, and Text and Symbol, eHMIs were the most widely accepted. In particular, for elderly people and those unfamiliar with traffic rules, Text, and Text and Symbol, eHMIs would lead to faster comprehension. The results confirmed that 68.5% of participants would feel safer crossing if the eHMI had the following features: 'Green', 'Text', 'Symbol', or 'Dynamic'. These features are suggested in the design of future systems. This research concluded that eHMIs have a positive effect on V2X communication and that textual eHMIs were clear to pedestrians.

   multi-semantic description; confidence fusion
AB With the rise of autonomous vehicles, drivers are gradually being liberated from the traditional roles behind steering wheels. Driver behavior cognition is significant for improving safety, comfort, and human-vehicle interaction. Existing research mostly analyzes driver behaviors relying on the movements of upper-body parts, which may lead to false positives and missed detections due to the subtle changes among similar behaviors. In this paper, an end-to-end model is proposed to tackle the problem of the accurate classification of similar driver actions in real-time, known as MSRNet. The proposed architecture is made up of two major branches: the action detection network and the object detection network, which can extract spatiotemporal and key-object features, respectively. Then, the confidence fusion mechanism is introduced to aggregate the predictions from both branches based on the semantic relationships between actions and key objects. Experiments implemented on the modified version of the public dataset Drive&Act demonstrate that the MSRNet can recognize 11 different behaviors with 64.18% accuracy and a 20 fps inference time on an 8-frame input clip. Compared to the state-of-the-art action recognition model, our approach obtains higher accuracy, especially for behaviors with similar movements.

TI Effects of Autonomous Vehicle Ownership on Trip, Mode, and Route Choice
SO TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH RECORD
LA English
DT Article
ID MULTICLASS; IMPACT
AB Autonomous vehicles (AVs) may significantly change traveler behavior and network congestion. Empty repositioning trips allow travelers to avoid parking fees or share the vehicle with other household members. Computer precision and reaction times may also increase road and intersection capacities. AVs are currently being test driven on public roads and may be publicly available within the next two decades; they therefore may be within the span of 20- to 30-year planning analyses. Despite this time scale, AV behavior has yet to be incorporated into planning models. This paper presents a multiclass, four-step model that includes AV repositioning to avoid parking fees (although incurring additional fuel costs) and increases in link capacity as a function of the proportion of AVs on the link. Demand is divided into classes by value of time and AV ownership. Mode choice-parking, repositioning, or transit-is determined through a nested logit model. Traffic assignment is based on a generalized cost function of time, fuel, and tolls. The results on a city network show that transit ridership decreases and the number of personal vehicle trips sharply increases as a result of repositioning. However, increases in link capacity offset the additional congestion. Although link volume increases significantly, only modest decreases in average link speeds are observed.

A mesoscopic traffic modeling framework is proposed, and closed loop String Stability is achieved by exploiting Input-to-State Stability (ISS) for the analysis of the platoon. Examples of mesoscopic control laws are illustrated and simulations show the effectiveness of our approach in ensuring String Stability and improving the platoon behavior.

Our algorithm consists of autonomous processes that create heterogeneous evolutionary environments, perform evolution on separate populations of chromosomes, and communicate asynchronously through occasional migrations of chromosomes. The paper also presents experiments where the algorithm has been tested on some benchmark problem instances. By measuring the effects of distribution on solution quality and on computing time, the experiments confirm that the algorithm achieves a superlinear speedup.

AB Driver assist technologies have reached the tipping point and are poised to take control of most, if not all, aspects of the driving task. Proponents of automated driving (AD) are enthusiastic about its promise to transform mobility and realize impressive societal benefits. This paper is an attempt to carefully examine the potential of AD to realize safety benefits, to challenge widely-held assumptions and to delve more deeply into the barriers that are hitherto largely overlooked. As automated vehicle (AV) technologies advance and emerge within a ubiquitous cyber-physical world they raise additional issues that have not yet been adequately defined, let alone researched. Issues around automation, sociotechnical complexity and systems resilience are well known in the context of aviation and space. There are important lessons that could be drawn from these applications to help inform the development of automated driving. This paper argues that for the foreseeable future, regardless of the level of automation, a driver will continue to have a role. It seems clear that the benefits of automated driving, safety and otherwise, will accrue only if these technologies are designed in accordance with sound cybernetics principles, promote effective human-systems integration and gain the trust by operators and the public.

AB This paper addresses the problem of multi-sensor data fusion in the navigation of a steerable four-wheeled industrial autonomous vehicle, which experiences substantial load variations of up to twice its weight. The practical considerations in the implementation of the filter an discussed. Tt aims to achieve a robust fusion algorithm with increased system tolerance against prolonged periods when absolute position updates are missing by improving estimation accuracy during dead-reckoning. The main contributions of this paper include the development of an adaptive estimator based on the extended Kalman filler to realise the multi-model filtering; the representation of the vehicle plant using a modified kinematic model to effectively describe the side-slip bias; the processing of redundant measurements to improve system immunity against noisy observations; and the ability to cope with periodically available odometry measurements and temporary position corrections from a landmark-based local reference system. To allow better adaptation to tyre wear and the wheels' deflections under varying loads, the wheel encoder's resolution is constantly calibrated. The filter performance is evaluated at different speeds, loading patterns and maneuvers. Statistical tests are carried out to verify the filter consistency.

AB Autonomous vehicle (AV) technology is likely to bring unprecedented change to existing trans-port systems due to its potential to enhance safety and efficiency. Nevertheless, before entering a fully AV era, human-driven vehicles (HVs) and AVs are expected to coexist for a long time, during which HVs and AVs could behave differently in route choice. On the one hand, compared with HVs, AVs can acquire more comprehensive traffic information and also process the information more swiftly. On the other hand, HV users may habitually maintain a satisfactory path but not necessarily choose the optimal one to the same destination to save cognitive during daily trips. AV users, however, may not show such behavior on account of the advantages of AVs. To capture these features in the coexistent period, understand their effects on the evolution of daily traffic flow, and provide managerial insights, this study presents a deterministic discrete time day-to-day dynamic assignment model for the mixed HV and AV traffic flows. In which both AV users and HV users choose their path according to their perception, AV users have better perceptual ability than HV users, and bounded behavioral inertia is first introduced to depict the travel behavior that HV users habitually maintain a satisfactory path during daily trips. The existence and uniqueness of the fixed-point and the convergence conditions of the proposed dynamic model are demonstrated and given. Theoretical results are verified in a simple two-path network, the Nguyen-Dupuis network, and the Sioux Falls network, respectively. The interactions between AVs and HVs are explored in the three numerical examples. Our research indicates that the introduction of AVs can reduce the overall travel time of a transport system and increase road capacity. Bounded behavioral inertia of HV users can maintain more HV flows on a better route, brings a more balanced distribution of travel flow on different paths, and facilitate the stability of a whole transport system.

AB Cellular localization has received marked attention in academia and in industry, as indicated by a rapidly expanding volume of literature specific to vehicular environments. Impressive results have been shown for a number of problems as measured by metrics such as accuracy and latency. This article identifies five important requirements for cellular localization for safety-critical systems with a particular focus on autonomous driving (AD) and puts them in the context of industrial and academic trends and standardization. We show why autonomous operation requires special consideration and suggest research directions toward novel and practically implementable solutions, drawing lessons from decades of work on satellite-based localization for aviation landing systems. In addition, we highlight the benefit of cellular localization technology for safety-critical autonomous systems, showing the utility of a satellite-navigation independent absolute localization sensor with error overbounding.

ID FORMAL VERIFICATION
AB To cater for the scenario of coordinated transportation of multiple trucks on the highway, a platoon system for autonomous driving has been extensively explored in the industry. Before such a platoon is deployed, it is necessary to ensure the safety of its driving behavior, whereby each vehicle's behavior is commanded by the decision-making function whose decision is based on the observed driving scenario. However, there is currently a lack of verification methods to ensure the reliability of the scenario-based decision-making process in the platoon system. In this paper, we focus on the platoon driving scenario, whereby the platoon is composed of intelligent heavy trucks driving on cross-sea highways. We propose a formal modeling and verification approach to provide safety assurance for platoon vehicles' cooperative driving behaviors. The existing Multi-Lane Spatial Logic (MLSL) with a dedicated abstract model can express driving scene spatial properties and prove the safety of multi-lane traffic maneuvers under the single-vehicle perspective. To cater for the platoon system's multi-vehicle perspective, we modify the existing abstract model and propose a Multi-Agent Spatial Logic (MASL) that extends MLSL by relative orientation and multi-agent observation. We then utilize a timed automata type supporting MASL formulas to model vehicles' decision controllers for platoon driving. Taking the behavior of a human-driven vehicle (HDV) joining the platoon as a case study, we have implemented the model and verified safety properties on the UPPAAL tool to illustrate the viability of our framework.

AB Strokesurvivorsor patients suffering from paralyses face a lot of challenges when it comes to mobility. Autonomous vehicle technologies can help to increase the accessibility for persons having limited mobility. The design of such vehicle requires a network of sensors along with sensor fusion system to accurately map the surrounding environment necessary for its safe driving. This study proposes a brain-actuated intelligent vehicle with network of sonars and vision-based sensors which can be controlled by either using Steady-State Visual Evoked Potential brain signals or joystick. For electroencephalogram signal detection, four frequencies were flickered and displayed using a GUI on LCD screen and signals were recorded having 1000 Hz sampling frequency. These signals were segmented into 2-second window size with 50% overlap and features were extracted by using canonical correlation analysis. In addition, a low-level navigation control system consisting of smart sensor network was also implemented to maximize safety of the user. Data from various sensors was sent to the intelligent control unit for sensor fusion in order to improve the performance and robustness of the designed vehicle. The results were evaluated for both offline and online classification. For offline control, the accuracy of 96% was achieved with 104.48 bits/min while 95% accuracy was achieved for run-time control. The results show that the proposed system has improved accuracy as well as information transfer rate is concerned as compared to the existing systems.

DT Article
AB Many young urbanites don't want to own a car, and unlike earlier generations, they don't have to rely on mass transit. Instead they treat mobility as a service: When they need to travel significant distances, say, more than 5 miles (8 kilometers), they use their phones to summon an Uber (or a car from a similar ride-sharing company). If they have less than a mile or so to go, they either walk or use various "micromobility" services, such as the increasingly ubiquitous Lime and Bird scooters or, in some cities, bike sharing. The problem is that today's mobility-as-a-service ecosystem often doesn't do a good job covering intermediate distances, say a few miles. Hiring an Uber or Lyft for such short trips proves frustratingly expensive, and riding a scooter or bike more than a mile or so can be taxing to many people. So getting yourself to a destination that is from 1 to 5 miles away can be a challenge. Yet such trips account for about half of the total passenger miles traveled. Many of these intermediate-distance trips take place in environments with limited traffic, such as university campuses and industrial parks, where it is now both economically reasonable and technologically possible to deploy small, low-speed autonomous vehicles powered by electricity. We've been involved with a startup that intends to make this form of transportation popular. The company, PerceptIn, has autonomous vehicles operating at tourist sites in Nara and Fukuoka, Japan; at an industrial park in Shenzhen, China; and is just now arranging for its vehicles to shuttle people around Fishers, Ind., the location of the company's headquarters.

AB Autonomous vehicles (AVs) are envisioned to reduce road fatalities by switching control of safety-critical tasks from humans to machines. Realizing safety benefits on the ground depends on technological advancement as well as the scale and rate of AV adoption, which are influenced by public perceptions. Employing multilevel structural equation modeling, this paper explores differences in perceptions of AV safety across 33,958 individuals in 51 countries. At the individual level, young males report higher perceptions of current AV safety and predict fewer years until AVs are safe enough for them to use. Since young males are more likely to undertake risky driving behavior, their positivity towards AV safety could lead to more rapid manifestations of safety benefits. Urban, fully employed individuals with higher incomes and education levels also report fewer years until AVs are safe to use. The multilevel model identifies country-level effects after controlling for individual characteristics. Developed countries with greater motorization rates and lower road death rates tend to have greater awareness of AVs but are more pessimistic about their present and future safety. Individuals in developing countries that face greater road safety challenges, particularly involving 2- and 3-wheeled vehicles, predict fewer years until AVs will be safe enough for them to use. Higher AV safety perception among the most risk-taking road users and in developing countries coincide with sociodemographic groups and geographic areas facing the greatest road safety challenges and most in need of improvement, highlighting a potential opportunity to reduce the global disparity in road safety.

AB Vehicle detection plays a critical role in autonomous driving, where two central sensing modalities are lidar and radar. Although many deep neural network (DNN)-based methods have been proposed to solve this task, a systematic and methodological examination on the influence of the data on those methods is still missing. In this work, we examine the effects of resolution on the performance of vehicle detection for both lidar and radar sensors. We propose subsampling methods that can improve the performance and efficiency of DNN-based solutions and offer an alternative approach to traditional sensor-design trade-offs.

AB This note examines the distributed free-will arbitrary time (FwAT) fault-tolerant formation control for heterogeneous multiple autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) operating under actuator faults, uncertainties, and exogenous disturbances. The established formation control protocol is free from initial conditions and provides higher tracking accuracy, singularity-free and smooth control signal, while the convergence time of the system is non-conservative. An adaptive nonsingular sliding mode is then developed in which the bound of lumped uncertainty is not necessary to know in advance. Due to the need for a rapid and immediate response in fixed-time control, the actuators are prone to saturation as a result of the high control torque required and to overcome this issue, an input saturation compensator is designed and incorporated into the control framework. Stability analysis under the developed control law is thoroughly performed using the Lyapunov stability theory. Finally, simulations and comparisons are demonstrated in order to verify the effectiveness of the proposed distributed formation control algorithm for a group of AUVs.

AB This paper addresses the problem of control design for a nonlinear maneuvering model of an autonomous underwater vehicle. The control algorithm is based on an iteration technique that approximates the original nonlinear model by a sequence of linear time-varying equations equivalent to the original nonlinear problem and a self-tuning control method so that the controller is designed at each time point on the interval for trajectory tracking and heading angle control. This work makes use of self-tuning minimum variance principles. The benefit of this approach is that the nonlinearities and couplings of the system are preserved, unlike in the cases of control design based on linearized systems, reducing in this manner the uncertainty in the model and increasing the robustness of the controller. The simulations here presented use a torpedo-shaped underwater vehicle model and show the good performance of the controller and accurate tracking for certain maneuvering cases.

AB Based on active disturbance rejection control technique and characteristics of electric power steering, a steering angle tracking controller is designed, which consists of an aligning moment estimator to deal with modeling error and nonlinearity of electric power steering. The aligning moment estimator is based on an extended state observer and takes steering system friction and differential drive steering torque, which is a unique phenomenon in a distributed drive electric vehicle, into consideration. According to the estimated aligning moment and tracking differentiator, the steering angle tracking controller is designed based on a nonlinear state feedback control and feedforward compensation control laws. Results of various simulations and experiments, including pivot steering, step input steering, and sinusoidal input steering, show that the proposed controller has good performance in tracking reference steering angle and is convenient to implement. With the aligning moment estimator, the proposed controller shows better results in comparative experiments than a conditional integral-based steering angle tracking controller.

AB In this paper, we propose the use of fault-tolerant techniques for an autonomous lane keeping system (LKS) under sensor failure of the camera vision sensor. When the output of the vision sensor is not available to the LKS due to malfunction and/or environmental conditions, it is necessary for the lateral control system to maintain its stability before the driver takes over control authority. We propose a method for fault-tolerant control using the lateral kinematic vehicle motion model. The kinematic motion model-based lane estimation scheme covers possible camera vision sensor failure that occurs in the presence of unreliable or unavailable data from the vision sensor due to complex shadowing, incomplete lane marks, and lighting changes. The proposed lane estimation method enables the LKS to maintain its performance in the presence of sensor failures. The developed algorithm was validated via computational simulation results with CarSim and MATLAB/Simulink. We also included experimental results with a test vehicle equipped with an AutoBox from dSPACE.

TI Artificial Situation Awareness for Increased Autonomy of Unmanned Aerial

DT Article
DE Unmammed aerial system; Autonomy; Situation awareness
AB Situation awareness is the human function of perceiving, comprehending and projecting the state of the environment which is of critical importance to the safe operation of aircraft. A highly autonomous Unmanned Aerial System (UAS) must replicate this behaviour in order to maintain an acceptable level of safety verses a manned vehicle. Nowhere in the flight is situation awareness more critical than during operation in the terminal area. Of primary concern during this stage of flight is the awareness of other traffic heading for the same airfield. This paper presents of a novel method of spatial projection of traffic vehicles encountered by an autonomous UAS in the terminal stage of flight. This projection method relies on a cooperative means of traffic perception, such as Automated Dependant Surveillance - Broadcast (ADS-B) and assumes there is a predefined route which vehicles follow through the terminal region. Whilst this is the case at the majority of airfield, traffic vehicles will not follow this path perfectly. This uncertainty in path following accuracy is captured by utilising a curvilinear reference frame and dealing with discrete transitions (such as the initiation of a turn) separately. It is shown that whilst this technique increases the computational complexity of the problem it can offer significant performance benefit.

Since many tasks generated by vehicles are delay sensitive, it is of great importance to ensure the transmission rate and stability. However, signals transmitted with high-frequency bands, even the terahertz, in 6G are seriously affected by physical obstacles, while the vehicle mobility can cause the dynamic channel conditions.

ID LOCALIZATION
AB Autonomous navigation of an indoor mobile robot, using the global ultrasonic system, is presented in this paper. Since the trajectory error of the dead-reckoning navigation increases significantly with time and distance, the autonomous navigation system of a mobile robot requires self-localization capability in order to compensate for trajectory error. The global ultrasonic system, consisting of four ultrasonic generators fixed at a priori known positions in the work space and two receivers mounted on the mobile robot, has a similar structure to the well-known satellite GPS(Global Positioning System), which is used for the localization of ground vehicles. The EKF (Extended Kalman Filter) algorithm is utilized for self-localization and autonomous navigation, based on the self-localization algorithm is verified by experiments performed in this study. Since the self-localization algorithm is efficient and fast, it is appropriate for an embedded controller of a mobile robot.

AB The boom in the electronics industry has made a variety of credit card-sized computer systems and plenty of accompanying sensing and acting elements widely available, at continuously diminishing cost and size levels. The benefits of this situation for agriculture are not left unexploited and thus, more accurate, efficient and environmentally-friendly systems are making the scene. In this context, there is an increasing interest in affordable, small-scale agricultural robots. A key factor for success is the balanced selection of innovative hardware and software components, among the plethora being available. This work describes exactly the steps for designing, implementing and testing a small autonomous electric vehicle, able to follow the farmer during the harvesting activities and to carry the fruits/vegetables from the plant area to the truck location. Quite inexpensive GPS and IMU units, assisted by hardware-accelerated machine vision, speech recognition and networking techniques can assure the fluent operation of a prototype vehicle exhibiting elementary automatic control functionality. The whole approach also highlights the challenges for achieving a truly working solution and provides directions for future exploitation and improvements.

TI Updating our understanding of situation awareness in relation to remote
   operators of autonomous vehicles
SO COGNITIVE RESEARCH-PRINCIPLES AND IMPLICATIONS
LA English
DT Review
ID EXPLICIT
AB The introduction of autonomous vehicles (AVs) could prevent many accidents attributable to human driver error. However, even entirely driverless vehicles will sometimes require remote human intervention. Current taxonomies of automated driving do not acknowledge the possibility of remote control of AVs or the challenges that are unique to such a driver in charge of a vehicle that they are not physically occupying. Yet there are significant differences between situation awareness (SA) in normal driving contexts and SA in these remote driving operations. We argue that the established understanding of automated driving requires updating to include the context of remote operation that is likely to come in to play at higher levels of automation. It is imperative to integrate the role of the remote operator within industry standard taxonomies, so that regulatory frameworks can be established with regards to the training required for remote operation, the necessary equipment and technology, and a comprehensive inventory of the use cases under which we could expect remote operation to be carried out. We emphasise the importance of designing control interfaces in a way that will maximise remote operator (RO) SA and we identify some principles for designing systems aimed at increasing an RO's sense of embodiment in the AV that requires temporary control.

AB The technological development of autonomous vehicles (AVs) challenges their economic relevancy. Are AVs worth it? We adapted the cost-benefit analysis framework to the case of AV services. The appraisal methodology was applied to the introduction of an on-demand AV service in Berlin, simulated through MATSim, an agent-based model. The introduction of AVs in a dense urban environment would generate more pressure on the road network. This would cause private car users to experience longer travel times, resulting in a consumer surplus loss that would not offset the new AV users' benefits. In one configuration, a stop-based routing service appeared to generate fewer externalities (e.g., congestion, emissions, accidents) and would be cheaper to operate than door-to-door routing. Another configuration assumed that private cars were banned. In that case, the consumer surplus significantly decreased, AV services were not able to absorb the entire demand, and the shares of other modes increased. However, the externalities were significantly reduced. Finally, in an urban environment where on-demand AVs were added to the available modes, the social impact was negative for all economic agents, with heterogeneity apparent on the impacts of the different externalities. This would benefit some travelers but would also involve additional congestion. In that case, a stop-based routing seemed preferable (but still negative) to a door-to-door one. Further works discussing the introduction of AVs into an urban environment should focus on line-based options such as automated bus services.

ID AUTOMATED EXTRACTION; HD MAPS; LIDAR
AB Autonomous vehicle technology has been advancing over the past decade with many challenges and obstacles. One obstacle to achieving fully autonomous driving is the feasibility of efficiently producing robust high definition (HD) maps of existing road infrastructure in a sustainable manner. HD maps are digital twins of road infrastructure that include 3-D representation of road features critical to a vehicle's ability to navigate a road and maintain a consistent trajectory. This includes lane markings, barriers, and road edges. HD maps are often produced by first surveying roads using remote sensing technology. The collected data are then segmented using computer vision and machine learning algorithms to produce an HD map of the features of concern. One common challenge that is specific to extracting lane marking information is that the markings are occasionally occluded or degraded by high traffic volumes. This results in failure to detect lane markings and the existence of significant gaps in the extracted information. These gaps are manually filled in by quality control staff in a tedious and time-consuming process. To help overcome such challenges, this paper proposes a novel algorithm through which Kalman filtering is combined with Bezier curve fitting to automatically refine lane marking information. The proposed algorithm is tested on multiple roads where mobile lidar data were collected and segmentation was first applied using deep learning technology. The proposed algorithm was then used to refine the lane marking information which helped close all the gaps and recreate missing portions of the extracted lane markings.

ID CRITERIA
AB Autonomous vehicles (AVs) are the newest products in the intelligent transportation system that can move around with minimal human intervention. These products continue their path with all kinds of sensors with different parts. Effective use of these technologies in the logistics industry can create a competitive advantage. Nowadays, there are many AVs, some of which are superior to others in terms of build quality, variety of features, and design. Choosing an efficient, optimal, and reliable vehicle is one of the most important challenges in lo-gistics planning. Therefore, choosing an AV based on a series of criteria can be considered a multi-criteria de-cision-making (MCDM) problem. Due to the complication of decision-making issues, criteria are usually not independent of each other and there are relationships between them. Therefore, this study develop an extended MCDM framework based on Choquet integral (CI) under group decision-making with a Spherical fuzzy set (SFS) for assessing logistics AVs. The CI technique is expanded with SFS to increase the power of CI. Furthermore, the combination of CI with SFS leads to greater freedom for decision makers to express opinions and use three in-dependent membership functions. Accordingly, the interactions between the criteria are considered and the skepticism and uncertainty present during the decision are controlled. The proposed approach is implemented in selecting the best AVs in the logistics industry, and the results are compared with Pythagorean fuzzy CI and Intuitionistic fuzzy CI. Moreover, sensitivity analysis is done by changing the weights and creating different scenarios to confirm and check the robustness of the proposed approach results. The results indicate the sug-gested approach's efficiency and the ranking's stability in different scenarios.

ID AUTONOMOUS VEHICLES; TRAFFIC FLOW
AB Fundamental diagrams (FDs) present the relationship between flow, speed, and density, and give some valuable information about traffic features such as capacity, congested and uncongested situations, and so forth. On the other hand, high accuracy speed-density models can produce more efficient FDs. Although numerous speed-density models are presented in the literature, there are very few models for connected and autonomous vehicles (CAVs). One of the recent spend-density models that takes into account the penetration rate of CAVs is provided by Lu et al. However, the estimation power of this model has not been tested against other speed-density models, and it has not been applied to high-speed networks such as freeways. Thus, this paper made a comparison between the Lu speed-density model and a well-known speed-density model (Papageorgiou) in freeway and grid networks. Different CAV behaviors (aggressive, normal, and conservative) are evaluated in this comparison. The comparison has been made between two speed-density models using the mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) and a t-test. The MAPE and t-test results show that differences between the two speed-density models are not significant in two case studies and that Lu is a powerful speed-density model to estimate speed compared with a well-known speed-density model. For the sake of comparing the above-mentioned models, this paper investigates the impact of CAVs on capacity based on FDs. The results suggest that the magnitude of the impacts of CAVs on road capacity (capacity increment percentage) which are obtained from two speed-density models are very close to each other. Also, the extent to which CAVs affect road capacity is highly dependent on their behavior.

TI Experimental Evaluation of an Autonomous Surface Craft for Shallow-Water

DE autonomous surface craft; shallow bathymetry; real-time kinematics
AB Vast coastal water bodies such as mangroves and wetlands, despite their enormous importance, are inaccessible to even the smallest aquatic vehicles, which are not capable of navigating the extremely shallow environments. To understand their behavior and the transport and exchange processes with both sea and land, it is crucial to study local hydrodynamics, which are highly dependent on bathymetric configuration. In order to obtain accurate and high spatial resolution bathymetric samples, an existing small surface vehicle instrumented with GPS and echosounder was implemented with an autopilot system to achieve autonomy. A description of the autonomous system together with the evaluation of the whole vehicle's performance in a natural coastal environment (e.g., affected by the wind, waves, and currents that exist in coastal regions) is presented. The navigation system is based on an autopilot system, which follows a set of user selected waypoints to drive the vehicle through a previously designed path. The trajectory is self-corrected to achieve sufficient accuracy (the limits are also defined by the user) using real-time kinematics. The tracking is performed by two independent proportional-integral-derivative (PID) control systems: the boat's displacement speed and the bearing control. A simple experimental procedure to tune the low-level PID control parameters is presented. Comparisons between the bathymetric maps obtained with the system and with other standard bathymetric surveys from a selected coastal site (ship-towed echosounder) are presented to test both the precision of the boat's navigation and the fine structure of the bottom topography. The results confirm the system's capability as a valuable tool for surveying large and very shallow environments.

TI Assessment of the effect of motorcycle autonomous emergency braking

SO TRAFFIC INJURY PREVENTION

DE Motorcycle; active safety; motorcycle autonomous braking system; PTW;
   crash in-depth investigation
AB Objective: Vehicles are increasingly being equipped with Autonomous Emergency Braking (AEB) and literature highlights the utility to fit a similar active safety system in Powered Two-Wheelers (PTWs). This research attempts to analyze the efficacy of PTW Autonomous Emergency Braking (MAEB) when functioning solely, and in the case where both the PTW and Opponent Vehicle (OV) have AEB installed. Methods: 23 crashes involving motorcyclists that occurred in metropolitan areas of Italy between 2009 and 2017 were selected. The "In-depth Study of road Accidents in FlorencE (InSAFE)" provides data for the study. Each crash was reconstructed in PC-Crash 12.1 software. The obtained simulation of the crash dynamics was then used to create the dataset of cases fitted with AEB and MAEB systems. A custom MAEB system was implemented with specifications based on literature. Results: The majority of crashes occurred on urban roads, at intersections, on dry asphalt, with clear visibility, and in daylight. The passenger vehicle was the most frequent opponent vehicle (70%). Almost half the sample involved the PTW rider traveling beyond the speed limit permitted on urban roads. MAEB was found to be applicable in 19 out of 23 real-world crashes allowing the avoidance of two crashes with the progressive triggering criteria (Time to Collision (TTC) - 1.0 s) and one crash in the case where both the PTW and OV have AEB installed with more conservative setups. MAEB simulations show important trends in the reduction of the PTW impact speed (ISR) from the conservative (TTC-0.6s) to standard (TTC-0.8s) to progressive (TTC-1.0s) triggering criteria. The mean impact speed reduction (ISR) becomes 8.6 km/h, 13.8 km/h, 19.1 km/h, respectively. Conclusions: The results suggested that MAEB may be extremely effective in the PTW impact speed reduction and that an earlier MAEB intervention is beneficial in achieving higher reductions in the PTW impact speed. Further, the effect of opponent vehicles also possessing AEB was studied, and it was found that this increased the likelihood of crash avoidance and greater reduction in crash severity in unavoidable circumstances.

AB We have developed and successfully collected data with a unique, bottom-transecting vehicle (ROVER) that permits the first long time-series measurements of sediment community oxygen consumption (SCOC). This instrument has the following capabilities: (1) it operates as an autonomous, free vehicle on the sea floor to 6,000-m depth for periods up to 6 months; (2) it transits across the sea floor, minimizing the impact that a long-term, free-vehicle structure would have on measurement sites; (3) it measures SCOC by using duplicate benthic chambers at up to 30 different sites over a single deployment period; (4) it measures sediment porewater oxygen concentration as an independent measure of SCOC by using a microprofiler at up to 30 different sites over a single deployment period; (5) it has an incubation period of programmable duration for each SCOC measurement; (6) it monitors operation of instruments and the surrounding area with time-lapse still and video cameras; (7) it has the flexibility to be used as an autonomous programmable platform for a wide variety of benthic boundary-layer measurements; and (8) it collects a water sample for oxygen and other analyses at the end of the deployment. The ROVER resembles a small forklift with a forward-mounted instrument assembly, a current meter, double-tread propulsion system, central battery and controller electronics, flotation, acoustic releases, and disposable ballast. The ROVER was deployed for a 4-month period (January-May 1996) to measure SCOC at 4,100-m depth in the eastern North Pacific. During this deployment the ROVER occupied 17 sites with each benthic chamber incubation lasting 152.3 h and a 17-h interval between incubations for repositioning and transit. SCOC ranged from 0.50 to 0.91 mmol O-2 m(-2) d(-1), generally declining from January until the end of February and then increasing irregularly to the end of the deployment in late May. These measurements show good agreement with those made at the same site with another autonomous instrument, the free-vehicle grab respirometer, at the beginning and end of the ROVER deployment.

AB This paper presents a priority-based coordination system that provides preferential treatment to vehicles traveling along a coordinated route. A mixed-integer linear program model is enhanced to consider coordination as a form of priority along with the multi-modal priority for eligible emergency, transit, and freight connected vehicles and provides dilemma zone protection to freight vehicles in a connected vehicle environment. The optimization model generates an optimal signal timing schedule that minimizes the total weighted delay of the coordination requests, priority requests, and dilemma zone requests, and maximizes the flexible implementation of the optimal signal timing schedule. The optimal signal timing schedule allows real-time vehicle actuation using traditional vehicle detection. The simulation experiments and statistical analysis show that priority-based coordination can achieve performance equivalent to a traditional coordination system. The priority-based coordination method is integrated into the priority control Multi-modal Intelligent Traffic Signal System and is implemented in the Maricopa County SMARTDrive Program(SM) test bed in Anthem, Arizona, and in Portland, Oregon.

TI Autonomous Driving Motion Planning With Constrained Iterative LQR

DT Article
DE Autonomous driving; motion planning; constraints; iterative LQR
AB Motion planning is a core technique for autonomous driving. Nowadays, there still exists a lot of challenges in motion planning for autonomous driving in complicated environments due to: 1) the need of both spatial and temporal planning in highly dynamic environments; 2) nonlinear vehicle dynamic models and non-convex collision avoidance constraints; and 3) the need of high computation efficiency for real-time implementation. Iterative linear quadratic regulator (ILQR) is an algorithm to solve the optimal control problem with nonlinear system very efficiently. However, it can not deal with constraints. In this paper, the constrained iterative LQR (CILQR) is proposed to efficiently solve the optimal control problem with nonlinear system dynamics and general form of constraints. An autonomous driving motion planning problem is then formulated and solved using CILQR. Simulation case studies show the capability of the CILQR algorithm to solve these kind of problems and the computation efficiency of CILQR is shown to be much higher than the standard SQP solver.

AB Accurate and reliable localization in urban environments is critical for high-level autonomous driving systems. In comparison to other localization strategies, map-based methods are more reliable and have higher localization accuracy. However, due to higher storage and update costs, dense map-based localization methods are inefficient for widespread use. In urban road environments, structural features, such as road curbs that limit the road passable area, and pole-like features, such as streetlights, tree trunks, and traffic lights, exhibit exceptional long-term stability and extraction consistency. The maps based on road curbs and pole-like features are unaffected by dynamic obstacles, such as vehicles and pedestrians, making them ideal for vehicle localization in urban environments. In this article, we design a lightweight feature map for LiDAR localization in urban environments based on road curbs and pole-like features, and propose a novel, fast, and accurate extraction strategy for these features, implementing the entire pipeline of feature extraction, map construction, and localization. We combine the orderliness of 2-D range images with the spatial properties of 3-D point clouds to extract road curbs and poles quickly and accurately. The proposed feature extraction methods and localization system are evaluated on datasets collected in multiple environments and times. The experimental results demonstrate that the method proposed in this article is more efficient and robust at features' extraction and vehicle localization compared with other state-of-the-art approaches.

AB This study presents a system identification algorithm to determine the linear and nonlinear parameters of an autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) motion response prediction mathematical model, utilising the recursive least squares optimisation method. The key objective of the model, which relies solely on propeller thrust, gyro measurements and parameters representing the vehicle hydrodynamic, hydrostatic and mass properties, is to calculate the linear velocities of the AUV in the x, y and z directions. Initially, a baseline mathematical model that represents the dynamics of a Gavia class AUV in a calm water environment was developed. Using a novel technique developed in this study, the parameters within the baseline model were calibrated to provide the motion response in different environmental conditions by conducting a calibration mission in the new environment. The accuracy of the velocity measurements from the calibrated model was substantially greater than those from the baseline model for the tested scenarios with a minimum velocity prediction improvement of 50%. The determined velocities will be used to aid the inertial navigation system (INS) position estimate using a Kalman filter data fusion algorithm when external aiding is unavailable. When an INS is not externally aided or constrained by a mathematical model such as that presented here, the positioning uncertainty can be more than 4% of the distance travelled (assuming a forward speed of 1.6 m s. The calibrated model is able to compute the position of the AUV within an uncertainty range of around 1.5% of the distance travelled, significantly improving the localisation accuracy.

AB Path planning is a challenging task to achieve vehicle autonomy, and it becomes even more difficult in handling dynamic situations and big vehicle sizes. Its performance is affected by the accuracy of mapping and vehicle localization. Many path planning algorithms have been developed to address static environments, however, these do not accurately reflect real-world scenarios which are dynamic in nature. This paper introduces a new planning architecture consisting of a global planner that plans a path in an occupancy grid map generated using LIDAR and odometry data. The local planner uses this global plan and plans a local plan on a section of the map that takes into consideration dynamic obstacles. Both the local and global plans are used to calculate the optimum velocity profile, providing a feasible and comfortable trajectory. The trajectory is then fed to a predictive Stanley controller, and both the calculated steering angle and the optimum velocity are achieved by low-level controllers. The performance of the proposed architecture was tested on a golf bus in a constrained environment and compared to different manual driving attitudes using a key performance indicator. The results of the proposed architecture show that it has a better KPI, with an average of 37% better than manual driving.

AB Autonomous unmanned systems have become an attractive vehicle for a myriad of military and civilian applications. This can be partly attributed to their ability to bring payloads for utility, sensing, and other uses for various applications autonomously. However, a key challenge in realizing autonomous unmanned systems is the ability to perform complex group missions, which require coordination and collaboration among multiple platforms. This paper presents a cooperative navigating task approach that enables multiple unmanned surface vehicles (multi-USV) to autonomously capture a maneuvering target while avoiding both static and dynamic obstacles. The approach adopts a hybrid multi-agent deep reinforcement learning framework that leverages heuristic mechanisms to guide the group mission learning of the vehicles. Specifically, the proposed framework consists of two stages. In the first stage, navigation subgoal sets are generated based on expert knowledge, and a goal selection heuristic model based on the immune network model is used to select navigation targets during training. Next, the selected goals' executions are learned using actor-critic proximal policy optimization. The simulation results with multi-USV target capture show that the proposed approach is capable of abstracting and guiding the unmanned vehicle group coordination learning and achieving a generally optimized mission execution.

AB Nowadays autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) are employed as unmanned machines in ocean industries. For instance AUVs play an important role in coastal area monitoring and investigating underwater pipe line in deep seas. In this paper, navigation of an AUV near free surface and the effect of wave disturbance and un-modeled hydrodynamics as uncertain terms in control system are addressed. To stabilize the roll motion of the vehicle a practical control mode in mini-UVs is applied. Firstly, a 6-DOF nonlinear dynamic simulator is developed and dynamic stability of the vehicle is investigated. Then, a feedback linearization method is applied to turn the nonlinear system into a convenient linear one, and then a robust technique is applied to guarantee the stability and performance of the system. In addition, a genetic algorithm method is employed for achieving the best gains in feedback linearization control law. Three constraints are considered for optimization including amplitude of sway, yaw and roll motions. Final results show an effective motion control of the AUV in horizontal plane. Meanwhile a reasonable performance of robust control in presence of wave disturbance and un-modeled hydrodynamics is achieved.

AB Recent advancements in the field of machine learning (ML) provide opportunity to conduct research on autonomous devices for a variety of applications. Intelligent decision-making is a critical task for self-driving systems. An attempt is made in this study to use a deep learning (DL) approach for the early detection of road cracks, potholes, and the yellow lane. The accuracy is not sufficient after training with the default model. To enhance accuracy, a convolutional neural network (CNN) model with 13 convolutional layers, a softmax layer as an output layer, and two fully connected layers (FCN) are constructed. In order to achieve the deeper propagation and to prevent saturation in the training phase, mish activation is employed in the first 12 layers with a rectified linear unit (ReLU) activation function. The upgraded CNN model performs better than the default CNN model in terms of accuracy. For the varied situation, a revised and enriched dataset for road cracks, potholes, and the yellow lane is created. The yellow lane is detected and tracked in order to move the unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) autonomously by following yellow lane. After identifying a yellow lane, the UAV performs autonomous navigation while concurrently detecting road cracks and potholes using the robot operating system within the UAV. The performance model is benchmarked using performance measures, such as accuracy, sensitivity, F1-score, F2-score, and dice-coefficient, which demonstrate that the suggested technique produces better outcomes.

AB In this article, we face the reference tracking control problem for a system of heterogeneous multiple unmanned vehicles (MUVs) moving in a 2-D planar environment. We consider a scenario, where each vehicle follows a trajectory imposed by a local planner and where each unmanned vehicle can have different linear dynamics as well as different constraints and disturbances. In this contest, we design a novel control architecture, where a centralized traffic manager, in conjunction with ad-hoc designed local vehicle controllers, is capable of ensuring the absence of collisions. The proposed solution is obtained by exploiting, for the local vehicles' controllers, a dual-mode model-predictive controller and, for the traffic manager, set-theoretic and controllability properties. Moreover, after modeling the potential vehicle collisions with a graph, connectivity arguments are used to obtain an optimal collision resolution, which minimizes the number of vehicles that need to be stopped. The resulting control scheme ensures collision-free signal tracking. Results of the simulation conducted on an MUV system are shown to provide tangible evidence of the features of the proposed framework.

AB We present a neural network based Takagi-Sugeno (TS) fuzzy observer to estimate the lateral speed (or sideslip angle) of nonlinear vehicle dynamics subject to modeling uncertainties and unknown inputs. To this end, we first propose a TS fuzzy reduced-order observer design, which can be implemented with low computation effort, for nonlinear systems. The stability and robustness of the observer scheme against the modeling uncertainty is guaranteed by the H-infinity filtering method. A data-driven approach is proposed to construct feedforward neural networks (NNs) for uncertainty approximation. This data-driven approach exploits a specific sliding mode observer (SMO) to identify the model uncertainty data from the collected training data. The NN-based uncertainty approximation is incorporated into the TS fuzzy observer structure to mitigate the effect of uncertainty and improve the estimation quality. Via Lyapunov's stability theory, design conditions of both the TS fuzzy reduced-order observer for dynamics estimation and the SMO for uncertainty identification are derived in terms of linear matrix inequalities. Experimental results obtained with the INSA autonomous vehicle on a real test track demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed TS fuzzy observer under various driving scenarios. Performance comparisons are also performed to illustrate the interest of using NN-based uncertainty approximation for the new reduced-order observer scheme, especially under extreme driving conditions.

AB Future worldwide 6G research will drive the evolution of emerging intelligent control technologies, such as intelligent speed advisory systems (ISA), to a more advanced generation. As a special type of ISA, consensus-based speed advisory systems (CSAS) can be widely used to recommend a consensus speed for a vehicle platoon, enabling minimizing energy consumption or emissions over a planned route. Recently, speed recommendation services that protect data privacy (i.e., how to obtain an optimal speed in a privacy-preserving way) have drawn tremendous attention. However, current approaches could still encounter service trust issues with central servers and the malicious behavior of vehicles. Furthermore, existing research lacks considering road safety constraints (i.e., safe distance between adjacent vehicles and road speed limits) that are essential for the practical deployment of CSAS. To address the above issues, this paper proposes Eco-CSAS, a safe and eco-friendly consensus speed advisory system using blockchain. We formulate an optimization problem subject to the minimum following distance and maximum road speed limit to minimize the energy consumption of the automatic vehicle platoon. In addition, we introduce a consortium blockchain and cryptographic primitives to ensure service trust and data privacy. We implement the system on the Hyperledger platform, and experimental results show that the system can achieve speed recommendations in a trustworthy and privacy-preserving manner while ensuring a secure platoon.

TI Joint Optimization of Signal Phasing and Timing and Vehicle Speed
   Guidance in a Connected and Autonomous Vehicle Environment
SO TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH RECORD
LA English
DT Article
ID TECHNOLOGY; MODEL
AB A joint traffic signal optimization algorithm is proposed which utilizes connected vehicle (CV) information to identify optimum signal timing and phasing plans while also providing speed guidance to individual vehicles to minimize total number of stopping maneuvers. The contribution of this paper is provision of speed guidance to both autonomous (AVs) and human-driven speed guidance-enabled vehicles (SGVs), recognizing that the latter may not fully comply with the speed guidance and would require some delay (i.e., reaction time) to implement it. The control algorithm is triggered at regular discrete time intervals during which CV information is used to identify the presence of non-CVs and incorporate them into signal timing decision-making. Optimal speeds are determined for any AVs or SGVs so that they can travel through the intersection at the expected departure time without stopping, considering both acceleration/deceleration and human reaction times. Simulation tests are performed under different CV, AV, and SGV penetration rates, while explicitly modeling the potential human errors and varying acceptance levels. The results suggest that average delay and number of stops decrease with higher CV penetration rate. Furthermore, the number of stops decreases as the ratio of both AVs and SGVs increases. While AVs are about I 0% more efficient than SGVs, human-driven vehicles still provide a benefit even when they do not fully comply with speed guidance information. Sensitivity tests suggest that operation is not significantly affected by the range of human driver errors in speed compliance or range of reaction times.

AB In this paper, the navigation system of the autonomous vehicle prototype Verdino is introduced. Two navigation levels are considered. In the first level, a trajectory is generated from the current position toward a goal that considers two different approaches. In the first, the minimum cost path is obtained using a classical approach (used for regular navigation). The second approach is a little more complex, relying on a set of precomputed primitives representing the motion model of the vehicle, which are used as part of an ARA* algorithm in order to find the best trajectory. This trajectory consists of both forward and backward motion segments for complex maneuvers. In the second level, a local planner is in charge of computing the commands sent to the vehicle in order to follow the trajectory. A set of tentative local trajectories is computed in the Frenet space and scored using several factors, described in this paper. Some results for the two navigation levels are shown at the end of this document. For the global planner, several examples of the maneuvers obtained are shown and certain related factors are quantified and compared. As for the local planner, a study on the influence of the defined weights on the vehicle's final behavior is presented. Also, from these tests several configurations have been chosen and ranked according to two different proposed behaviors. The navigation system shown has been tested both in simulated and in real conditions, and the attached video shows the vehicle's real-world performance. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The e-commerce boom has increased the complexity of last-mile logistics operations in urban environments. In this context, unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), also known as delivery drones, and ground autonomous delivery devices (GADDs) show great potentialities. The objective of this paper is to provide strategic insights to adequately match these autonomous technologies with some given characteristics of cities and help define relevant decision variables. Using continuous approximation equations, the operations costs as well as the externalities induced by a) GADDs in association with an urban consolidation center (UCC) and b) truck-launched UAVs are estimated. Then, the developed mathematical formulations are applied in two different use cases: a part of the Paris suburbs (France) and the historical center of Barcelona (Spain). In less dense and larger service regions such as the Paris suburbs, truck-launched delivery drones seem more suitable to reduce the carriers? operations costs. In denser neighborhoods such as the Barcelona historical center, GADDs are expected to be more economically profitable. In both use cases, GADDs would generate less externalities. Finally, considering the high uncertainty of some input parameters, a sensitivity analysis of the models is done.

AB This paper investigates the station-keeping control of autonomous and remotely-operated vehicles (ARVs) for free-floating manipulation under model uncertainties and external disturbances. A modified adaptive generalized super-twisting algorithm (AGSTA) enhanced by adaptive tracking differentiator (ATD) and reduced-order extended state observer (RESO) is proposed. The ATD is used to obtain the smooth reference signal and its derivative. The RESO is used to estimate and compensate for the model uncertainties and external disturbances in real-time, which enhances the robustness of the controller. The modified AGSTA ensures the fast convergence of the system states and maintains them in a predefined neighborhood of origin without overestimating control gains. Besides, the proposed new variable gain strategy completely avoids the control gains vibrating near the set minimum value. Thanks to the RESO, the proposed controller is model-free and can be easily implemented in practice. The stability of the closed-loop system is analyzed based on Lyapunov's direct method in the time domain. Finally, the proposed control scheme is applied to the station-keeping control of Haidou-1 ARV, and the simulation results confirm the superiority of the proposed control scheme over the original AGSTA.

DT Article
AB The problem of reversing vehicles with two trailers could be solved with a semi-autonomous assistance system for automatically steering the vehicle. In the literature found, no controllers have been implemented on a full-size vehicle with two trailers. In this paper, two simple path-tracking controllers are presented for automating the reversing of a "B- double" vehicle, consisting of a tractor and two trailers. One of the controllers is a heuristic "preview point" controller; the other uses a state feedback approach. The controllers steer the wheels on the front axle so as to stabilize the vehicle in reverse and control the path of the rearmost axle to follow a prescribed path. A tuning strategy is outlined where both controllers are tuned using the linear quadratic regulator and have the same closed-loop poles. The two controllers are implemented on a full-size B-double test vehicle. Experimental results are discussed, and the controller performances are evaluated against criteria. With the state feedback controller, the test vehicle was able to track target paths, consisting of a roundabout and a lane change, to within 50 mm.

AB Autonomous Vehicles (AVs) have the potential to save millions of lives and increase the efficiency of transportation services. However, the successful deployment of AVs requires tackling multiple challenges related to modeling and certifying safety. State-of-the-art decision-making methods usually rely on end-to-end learning or imitation learning approaches, which still pose significant safety risks. Hence the necessity of risk-aware AVs that can better predict and handle dangerous situations. Furthermore, current approaches tend to lack explainability due to their reliance on end-to-end Deep Learning, where significant causal relationships are not guaranteed to be learned from data.This paper introduces a novel risk-aware framework for training AV agents using a bespoke collision prediction model and Reinforcement Learning (RL). The collision prediction model is based on Gaussian Processes and vehicle dynamics, and is used to generate the RL state vector. Using an explicit risk model increases the post-hoc explainability of the AV agent, which is vital for reaching and certifying the high safety levels required for AVs and other safety-sensitive applications. Experimental results obtained with a simulator and state-ofthe-art RL algorithms show that the risk-aware RL framework decreases average collision rates by 15%, makes AVs more robust to sudden harsh braking situations, and achieves better performance in both safety and speed when compared to a standard rule-based method (the Intelligent Driver Model). Moreover, the proposed collision prediction model outperforms other models in the literature. (c) 2023 The Author(s). Published by Elsevier B.V.

AB Connected and Autonomous Vehicle (CAV) platooning has gained attention for its potential for vastly enhancing capacity and safety of future transport systems. Previous research on CAV platoon control approximates stability as safety during CAV operations and primarily addressed instability and stability properties. Nevertheless, it is vital to note that stability does not stand for absolutely safe, since the behaviors of CAV platoons could also be impacted by the oscillation characteristics of damping that are essential for CAV platoons to boost reliability against variant continuous disturbances. To explore the impact of damping on CAV platoon safety, the time-domain analysis approach is introduced to reveal the relationship between damping characteristics and CAV platoon safety performance with Cooperative Adaptive Cruise Control (CACC) based on the constant time headway policy under stable conditions. Numerical simulations are carried out to verify the impacts of the damping on CAV platoon performance and evaluate the safety of a platoon possessing stability under different damping properties. Further, different control parameters based on damping and stability properties are applied to CAV platoons and their safety is evaluated by calculating the Deceleration Rate to Avoid a Crash (DRAC), Time Exposed Time-to-Collision (TET) and Time-Integrated Time-to-Collision (TIT) as surrogate safety measures of the rear-end collision risk. Numerical analysis results show that it could better maintain platoon safety, when control parameters make the damping ratio between 1 and 1.1. (c) 2022 Published by Elsevier B.V.

Dynamic movement primitive is extended by adding jerk to mock the kinematics, particularly for unmanned aerial vehicles. Combining the improved dynamic movement primitive with policy learning by weighted exploration with the returns, we propose the new algorithm producing optimal trajectories under different scenarios. Furthermore, numerical simulations under several scenarios are performed, demonstrating the ability of the proposed algorithm.

AB Autonomous vehicles (AVs) have no need to park dose to their destination, or even to park at all. Instead, AVs can seek out free on-street parking, return home, or cruise (circle around). Because cruising is less costly at lower speeds, a game theoretic framework shows that AVs also have the incentive to implicitly coordinate with each other in order to generate congestion. Using a traffic microsimulation model and data from downtown San Francisco, this paper suggests that AVs could more than double vehicle travel to, from and within dense, urban cores. New vehicle trips are generated by a 90% reduction in effective parking costs, while existing trips become longer because of driving to more distant parking spaces and cruising. One potential policy response-subsidized peripheral parking-would likely exacerbate congestion through further reducing the cost of driving. Instead, this paper argues that the rise of AVs provides the opportunity and the imperative to implement congestion pricing in urban centers. Because the ability of AVs to cruise blurs the boundary between parking and travel, congestion pricing programs should include two complementary prices-a time-based charge for occupying the public right-of-way, whether parked or in motion, and a distance- or energy-based charge that internalizes other externalities from driving.

AB The intelligent vehicle is a complicated nonlinear system, and the design of a path tracking controller is one of the key technologies in intelligent vehicle research. This paper mainly designs a lateral control dynamic model of the intelligent vehicle, which is used for lateral tracking control. Firstly, the vehicle dynamics model (i. e., transfer function) is established according to the vehicle parameters. Secondly, according to the vehicle steering control system and the CARMA (Controlled Auto-Regression and Moving-Average) model, a second-order control system model is built. Using forgetting factor recursive least square estimation (FFRLS), the system parameters are identified. Finally, a neural network PID (Proportion Integral Derivative) controller is established for lateral path tracking control based on the vehicle model and the steering system model. Experimental simulation results show that the proposed model and algorithm have the high real-time and robustness in path tracing control. This provides a certain theoretical basis for intelligent vehicle autonomous navigation tracking control, and lays the foundation for the vertical and lateral coupling control.

AB The growing number of smart vehicles makes it possible to envision a crowdsensing service where vehicles can share video data of their surroundings for seeking out traffic conditions and car accidents ahead. However, the service may need to deal with situations like malicious vehicles propagating false information to divert other vehicles to arrive at destinations earlier or lead them to dangerous locations. This article proposes a context-aware trust estimation scheme that can allow roadside units in a vehicular edge network to provide real-time crowdsensing services in a reliable manner by selectively using information from trustworthy sources. Our proposed scheme is novel in that its trust estimation does not require any prior knowledge of vehicles on roads but quickly obtains the accurate trust value of each vehicle by leveraging transfer learning. and its Q-learning-based dynamic adjustment scheme autonomously estimates trust levels of oncoming vehicles with the aim of detecting malicious vehicles and accordingly filtering out untrustworthy input from them. Based on an extensive simulation study, we prove that the proposed scheme outperforms existing ones in terms of malicious vehicle detection accuracy.

AB Whilst public opinion towards automated vehicles is largely favourable, there are recurrent concerns around responsibility in the event of a crash (Kyriakidis et al., 2015). There is debate about the complexities regarding the legal responsibility of crashes involving automated vehicles, with opinions ranging from the driver is always accountable to the impossibility of holding an 'automated driver' responsible. Whilst "who is responsible" for a crash at different levels of vehicle automation has been debated, little is known about public opinion around the attribution of blame in automated vehicle crashes. In order to better understand how these might impact trust and adoption of these technologies, the present study aimed to understand public perceptions of responsibility for crashes involving different levels of automation, and the perceived consequences of that responsibility. A total of 129 undergraduate students, aged between 19 and 61 (M = 24.6, SD = 7.64) read four vignettes which detailed a pedestrian crash scenario with level of vehicle automation being manipulated in each vignette (manual driving, partially automated, highly automated and fully automated driving). Participants were asked three open-ended questions; `Where do you assign blame?', `Based on where you assign blame, what course of action would you take from here?', and `How could this event be prevented in the future?'. Results revealed that participants attributed blame to six stakeholder categories (driver, pedestrian, car, government, manufacturer and programmer). As automation increased, the proportion of participants who blamed the driver decreased, whilst those blaming the manufacturer increased. Participants commonly identified legal action against the driver, the manufacturer or both as their course of action. The proportions varied across level of automation, with legal action against the `driver' still identified when the vehicle was fully automated. Furthermore, as level of automation increased, there were increased calls for automation to be reviewed, improved or completely avoided. Overwhelmingly the findings from this study highlight that the public believe that the ultimate responsibility for a crash is in the hands of the human driver, rather than the `automated driver'. These findings have implications for the public trust and rates of adoption of automated vehicles. Further it highlights the need for greater governance and legal frameworks around the outcomes of crashes involving automated vehicles.

AB Tactile Internet evolves communications to encompass sensory information such as smell and haptic sensations combining ultra-low latency with extremely high availability, reliability, and security. Tactile Internet is realized through underpinning technologies such as Multi-access Edge and Fog computing which facilitate decentralized infrastructures and machine to machine (M2M) communications. Mobile ad hoc networks (MANETs) form the foundation layer of such infrastructures, enabling direct communication between autonomous and decentralized devices such as sensors and vehicles. Among other applications, autonomous ad hoc vehicular networks (VANETs) and vehicle to vehicle (V2V) communications require efficient content discovery and quality of data transfer. The mobility patterns of vehicles within this communication model could effect the quality of data exchanged between devices in a tactile network. Several mobility models exist describing mobility patterns of mobile users in MANETs. In this paper, we present a first performance study to evaluate the impact of different mobility models on content discovery techniques for tactile Internet comprising of fast-moving vehicles and devices. This study combines direct and derived mobility metrics evaluating impact on content discovery and content dissemination using NS-3. Our simulation results indicate that unstructured techniques may not scale well within a tactile network of fast moving vehicles while maintaining low latency and could suffer from performance degradation in a saturated environment. Furthermore, simulation results also demonstrate the resilience of the unstructured content discovery protocol in mobility scenarios with proactive routing and diverse behavior.

AB For the purpose of overcoming the technical bottlenecks and limitations of autonomous vehicles on the information perception, and improving the sensing range and performance of vehicle driving environment and traffic information, a framework of vehicle-infrastructure cooperative perception for the Cooperative Automated Driving System is proposed in this paper. Taking the vehicle state information as an example, it also introduced a calculation method of data fusion for vehicle-infrastructure cooperative perception. Besides, considering that the intelligent roadside equipment may appear short-term sensing failure, the proposed method improved the traditional Kalman Filter to output position information even when the roadside fails. Compared with the vehicle-only perception, the simulation experiments verified that the proposed method could improve the average positioning accuracy under the normal condition and the intelligent roadside failure by 18% and 19%, respectively. The proposed framework provided a solution for coordinating and fusing perception intelligence and functions between connected automated vehicles, intelligent infrastructure and intelligent control system. The proposed improved Kalman Filter method provides flexible strategies for practical application.

AB We consider an intersection zone where autonomous vehicles (AVs) and human-driven vehicles (HDVs) can be simulteneously present. As a new vehicle arrives, the traffic controller needs to decide and suggest an optimal sequence of the vehicles which will exit the intersection zone. The traffic controller can inform the time at which an AV can cross the intersection; however, the traffic controller can not communicate with the HDVs, rather the HDVs can only be controlled using the traffic lights. We formulate the problem as an integer constrained nonlinear optimization problem. Since the number of possible combinations increases exponentially with the number of vehicles in the traffic system, we relax the original problem and proposes an algorithm which gives the optimal solution of the relaxed problem and yet only scales linearly with the number of vehicles in the system. The numerical validation shows that our algorithm outperforms the First-In-First-Out (FIFO) algorithm.

AB In this study, a novel nature-inspired autonomous motion was investigated using the honey-bee algorithm for aerial robots. The main idea belonged to a novel analogy between optimal honey bees and aerial robots' motion in proposing autonomous guidance. Three-dimensional simulations for aerial robots were considered to show the efficient performance of autonomous guidance. A new equation system was also developed based on the yaw angle control to simplify dynamic flight calculations. Moreover, different uncertainties such as lateral wind current and navigation' noise were considered and checked precisely using a neural-fuzzy network to enhance autonomous guidance reliability. Accordingly, aerial robots' autonomous motions were developed by fuzzy logic to overcome low-quality data linkages between aerial robots. The results of this study illustrated that the integrated nature-inspired guidance by fuzzy logic had a lower total passing and the final time of 24.64% and 21.87% for aerial robots, respectively.

   POLICIES; IMPACTS; SCHEME
AB Parking is a cumbersome part of auto travel because travelers have to search for a spot and walk from that spot to their final destination. This conventional method of parking will change with the arrival of autonomous vehicles (AV). In the near future, users of AVs get dropped off at their final destination and the occupant-free AVs search for the nearest and most convenient parking spot. Hence, individuals no longer bear the discomfort of cruising for parking while sitting in their vehicle. This paper quantifies the impact of AVs on parking occupancy and traffic flow on a corridor that connects a home zone to a downtown zone. The model considers a heterogeneous group of AVs and conventional vehicles (CV) and captures their parking behavior as they try to minimize their generalized travel costs. Insights are obtained from applying the model to two case studies with uniform and linear parking supply along the corridor. We show that (i) CVs park closer to the downtown zone in order to minimize their walking distance, whereas AVs park farther away from the downtown zone to minimize their parking search time, (ii) AVs experience a lower search time than CVs, and (iii) higher AV penetration rates reduce travel costs for both AVs and CVs.

ID SYSTEM
AB Lane-Changing Decision (LCD) behavior is complex, dangerous, and varied by the Driver's Psychology (DP) and Driving Style (DS). For lacking the consideration of DP and DS, the existing LCD models cannot predict the LCD process varying with the drivers and traffic conditions accurately. To deal with the problems, a new LCD model coupling DP and DS, named DP&DS-LCD, is put forward. In the model, a psychological field model is constructed to represent the DP effect on the scene vehicles. And then, K-means and K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN) algorithm are respectively adopted in learning and recognition phases to recognize the current driving style pattern. Finally, based on the DP and DS, the multi-Grained Cascade Forest (gcForest) algorithm is applied to predict the LCD behavior. In experiments, DP&DS-LCD is compared with other three LCD models by using the opening I-80 database from Next Generation Simulation project (NGSIM). And the results showed that the DP&DS-LCD model achieved the best performance. Therefore, the DP&DS-LCD model is effective and could provide support for the decision of autonomous vehicles by predicting the surrounding vehicles' Lane-Changing (LC) behavior.

AB Underwater docking enables autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) to operate independently of a surface vessel for extended periods. To perform the clocking mission, special attention has to he paid to the navigation, guidance, and control issues of the vehicle, especially under current disturbances. Based on a hill dynamic model of an AUV in currents, this paper studies the influences of current disturbances on AUV docking motion. A comprehensive docking scheme is introduced, which combines Kalman filter type navigation, guidance with current compensation, and proportional-integral-derivative (PID) controllers for both cross-track and heading control, to ensure successful docking operations. To counter the current effects, the proposed guidance algorithm applies current estimation and attitude compensation for motion correction online; in addition, an upstream control strategy in the case of strong current is also discussed. The proposed algorithms are initially validated through model-based numerical simulations, which provide effective guidance for the succeeding docking experiments conducted in a current generating pool. The feasibility and effectiveness of the countering approaches for AUV docking under current disturbances are demonstrated during the pool trials.

AB This study proposes a new car-following model considering the effects of the electronic throttle dynamics to capture the characteristics of connected autonomous vehicular traffic flow without lane discipline. In particular, the proposed model incorporates the effects of both electronic throttle opening angle and lateral gap into the traffic flow model by assuming that the information on electronic throttle dynamics is shared by surrounding vehicles through vehicle-to-vehicle communications. Stability of the proposed model is analyzed using the perturbation method. Numerical experiments analyze three scenarios: start, stop and evolution processes for the scenarios of lane-discipline-based full velocity difference (FVD) model, non-lane-based full velocity difference car-following (NLBCF) model and non-lane-discipline and throttle-based car-following model, respectively. Results from numerical experiments illustrate that the proposed car-following model has a larger stale region compared with the FVD and NLBCF models. In addition, it also demonstrates that the proposed car-following model can better represent the characteristics of connected and autonomous vehicular traffic flow in terms of the responsiveness, smoothness and stability with respect to the position, velocity, acceleration/deceleration and space headway profiles.

ID ASSISTANCE
AB In contemporary development, autonomous vehicles (AVs) have emerged as a potential solution for sustainable and smart transportation to fulfill the increasing mobility demands whilst alleviating the negative impacts on society, the economy, and the environment. AVs completely depend on a machine to perform driving tasks. Therefore, their quality and safety are critical concerns for driving users. AVs use advanced driver assistance systems (ADASs) that heavily rely on sensors and camera data. These data are processed to execute vehicle control functions for autonomous driving. Furthermore, AVs have a voice communication system (VCS) to interact with driving users to accomplish different hand-free functions. Some functions such as navigation, climate control, media and entertainment, communication, vehicle settings, vehicle status, and emergency assistance have been successfully incorporated into AVs using VCSs. Several researchers have also implemented vehicle control functions using voice commands through VCSs. If a situation occurs when AV has lost control due to malfunctioning or fault in the installed computer, sensors and other associated modules, driving users can control the AV using voice notes to perform some driving tasks such as changing speeds, lanes, breaking, and directing the car to reach a safe condition. Furthermore, driving users need manual control over AV to perform these tasks in some situations, like lane changing or taking an exit due to divergence. These tasks can also be performed with the help of voice commands using VCSs. Therefore, finding the exact voice note used to instruct different actuators in risk situations is crucial. As a result, VCSs can greatly improve safety in critical situations where manual intervention is necessary. AVs' functions and quality can be significantly increased by integrating a VCS with an ADAS and developing an interactive ADAS. Now, the driver functions are controlled by voice features. Therefore, natural language processing is utilized to extract the features to determine the user's requirements. The extracted features control the vehicle functions and support driving activities. The existing techniques consume high computation while predicting the user command and causing a reduction in the AVs' functions. This research issue is overcome by applying the variation continuous input recognition model. The proposed approach utilizes the linear training process that resolves the listening and time-constrained problems and uncertain response issues. The proposed model categorizes the inputs into non-trainable and trainable data, according to the data readiness and listening span. Then, the non-distinguishable data were validated by dividing it into the linear inputs used to improve the response in the AVs. Thus, effectively utilizing training parameters and the data decomposition process minimizes the uncertainty and increases the response rate. The proposed model has significantly improved the exact prediction of users' voice notes and computation efficiency. This improvement enhances the VCS quality and reliability used to perform hand-free and vehicle control functions. The reliability of these functions ultimately improves the safety of AVs' driving users and other road users.

AB Increasing levels of autonomy impose more pronounced performance requirements for unmanned ground vehicles (UGV). Presence of model uncertainties significantly reduces a ground vehicle performance when the vehicle is traversing an unknown terrain or the vehicle inertial parameters vary due to a mission schedule or external disturbances. A comprehensive mathematical model of a skid steering tracked vehicle is presented in this paper and used to design a control law. Analysis of the controller under model uncertainties in inertial parameters and in the vehicle-terrain interaction revealed undesirable behavior, such as controller divergence and offset from the desired trajectory. A compound identification scheme utilizing an exponential forgetting recursive least square, generalized Newton-Raphson (NR), and Unscented Kalman Filter methods is proposed to estimate the model parameters, such as the vehicle mass and inertia, as well as parameters of the vehicle-terrain interaction, such as slip, resistance coefficients, cohesion, and shear deformation modulus on-line. The proposed identification scheme facilitates adaptive capability for the control system, improves tracking performance and contributes to an adaptive path and trajectory planning framework, which is essential for future autonomous ground vehicle missions.

AB We present a neuro-fuzzy controller for intelligent cruise control of semiautonomous vehicles. This paper addresses the problem of longitudinal control that aims at regulating the speed of the controlled vehicle in order to maintain constant time headway with respect to the vehicle in front. A fuzzy radial basis function network (FRBFN) longitudinal controller is designed to incorporate the merits of fuzzy logics as well as neural networks. The FRBFN is prestructured, and its parameters are configured such that they are associated with their physical meaning. The parameters of the output layer are learned online via gradient algorithm. An attractive feature of the proposed method is that it does not require the training data and the vehicle longitudinal dynamic model. Simulation results on a vehicle theoretical model are provided to demonstrate the effectiveness of this controller. In order to investigate the proposed control algorithms in real-life situations, a small-scaled vehicle with computer and sensors onboard is developed. Experimental results of a conventional PID controller and the FRBFN controller are provided for comparison.

AB Cooperation of connected vehicles is a promising approach for autonomous intersection control. This article presents a systematic approach to the cooperation of connected vehicles at unsignalized intersections without global coordination. A task-area partition framework is proposed to decompose the mission of cooperative passing into three main tasks, i.e., vehicle state observation, arriving time optimization, and trajectory tracking control. To accomplish these tasks, a distributed observation algorithm is introduced to achieve fixed-time observation of other vehicles' states for passing sequence determination, a distributed optimization algorithm is introduced to schedule conflict-free arriving times for trajectory planning, and a distributed control algorithm is proposed to address parameter mismatches and acceleration saturation for fixed-time trajectory tracking control. Numerical simulations demonstrate that the proposed method can achieve cooperative passing of vehicles without global coordination at the cost of a growth of 8.8-18.1% average travel times in low and medium traffic volumes.

AB Heterogeneous unmanned systems consisting of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) and unmanned surface vehicles (USVs) have great application potential in marine environments. At present, the fully autonomous recovery of UAVs is a key problem that restricts any significant application of a heterogeneous unmanned system. This paper presents a novel fully autonomous recovery system, covering the entire process of recovery of small fixed-wing UAVs on mobile platforms at sea. We describe methods or solutions for the key problems encountered by the current system, including active modeling of the UAV-USV heterogeneous platform motion model, accurate estimation of the highly dynamic relative motion of the heterogeneous platform, dynamic analysis of the arresting cable system, and compliance control of the manipulator recovery system. Based on these methods, a physical simulation platform for the fully autonomous recovery system, including an actively adjustable arresting cable, manipulator compliance recovery system, and other subsystems, is developed and verified through experiments. The experiments show that the system proposed in this study can achieve full autonomous recovery of a small ship-based fixed-wing UAV with a high success rate in a short period. This system is the foundation for practical applications of UAV-USV heterogeneous unmanned systems in the marine environment.

AB Public transport is considered as one of the most suitable candidates to benefit from autonomous driving technologies. In this research, we develop a mathematical modeling framework to opti-mize service frequency and vehicle size for automated bus systems, while accounting for both user and operator costs. We explicitly consider travel time stochasticity, time-dependent passenger flows, vehicle capacity limitations (extra waiting time due to denied boarding), and in-vehicle discomfort externalities for both sitting and standing passengers at a microscopic level. We attempt to provide a thorough assessment of the service and cost implications of the deployment of automated buses. Hence, a broad range of experiments are simulated by combining different deployment cases: (i) vehicle technology (human-driven or automated vehicles), (ii) travel time assumptions (deterministic or stochastic travel times), and (iii) crowding externalities (consid-ering or ignoring in-vehicle crowding costs). The model applicability is assessed on two real -world bus corridors in Regensburg (Germany) and Santiago (Chile). Results show that, with crowding externalities, optimal vehicle size is increased at a similar rate for both human-driven and automated bus services, whereas optimal service frequency is increased at a higher rate for automated buses. Thus, under optimal levels of supply, automated vehicles are operated with lower occupancy levels than human-driven vehicles, increasing the quality of service. Besides, the deployment of automated bus systems can significantly alleviate or eliminate denied boardings. The effects of automation on travel time volatility and dwell time regularity are studied. The consideration of stochastic travel times increases optimal frequencies at a higher rate for auto-mated services relative to human-driven vehicles. Interestingly, we find that even though the operator benefits from automation are more pronounced in high-income countries (due to a greater potential for human driving cost savings), the final outcome is counterbalanced by the actual public transport demand level, because large user cost savings from automation are reachable in crowded routes even in situations in which labor costs are lower (as in developing countries).

AB The aim is to investigate the improvements in vehicle safety that can be achieved by limiting the vehicle speed based on GPS path information. The control strategy is aimed at reducing vehicle speed before a potentially dangerous situation is reached, in contrast with widely used stability control systems that only react once loss of control by the driver is imminent. An MSC.ADAMS/View simulation model of an off-road test vehicle was developed and validated experimentally. A longitudinal speed control system was developed by generating a reference speed based on the path information. This reference speed was formulated by taking into account the vehicle's limits due to lateral acceleration, combined lateral and longitudinal acceleration and the vehicle's performance capabilities. The model was used to evaluate the performance of the control system on various tracks. The control system was implemented on the test vehicle and the performance was evaluated by conducting field tests. Results of the field tests indicated that the control system limited the acceleration vector of the vehicle's centre of gravity to prescribed limits, as predicted by the simulations, thereby decreasing the possibility of accidents caused by rollover or loss of directional control due to entering curves at inappropriately high speeds.

AB After disasters, road side units, which can provide wireless communications to vehicles, may fail due to physical damages or power outages. Vehicle-to-vehicle communication also may not perform well owing to lack of neighbours in low vehicle density scenario or collisions in high vehicle density circumstance which may happen in disaster areas. In this study, the deployment of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) as flying base stations to improve connectivity among vehicles in disaster affected areas is analysed. First, the connectivity among vehicles as a function of the altitude of the UAV is derived. Furthermore, multiple UAVs scenario is analysed to determine the minimum number of UAVs needed to guarantee a target connectivity threshold among vehicles for a given geographical area and vehicle density. Numerical and simulation results verify that there exist optimal UAV altitudes for different scenarios as shown in the authors' analyses, and the simulation results also verify that the number of UAVs must be larger than a certain value to guarantee a target connectivity threshold among vehicles.

AB One of the essential systems in autonomous vehicles for ensuring a secure circumstance for drivers and passengers is the Advanced Driver Assistance System (ADAS). Adaptive Cruise Control, Automatic Braking/Steer Away, Lane-Keeping System, Blind Spot Assist, Lane Departure Warning System, and Lane Detection are examples of ADAS. Lane detection displays information specific to the geometrical features of lane line structures to the vehicle's intelligent system to show the position of lane markings. This article reviews the methods employed for lane detection in an autonomous vehicle. A systematic literature review (SLR) has been carried out to analyze the most delicate approach to detecting the road lane for the benefit of the automation industry. One hundred and two publications from well-known databases were chosen for this review. The trend was discovered after thoroughly examining the selected articles on the method implemented for detecting the road lane from 2018 until 2021. The selected literature used various methods, with the input dataset being one of two types: self-collected or acquired from an online public dataset. In the meantime, the methodologies include geometric modeling and traditional methods, while AI includes deep learning and machine learning. The use of deep learning has been increasingly researched throughout the last four years. Some studies used stand-alone deep learning implementations for lane detection problems. Meanwhile, some research focuses on merging deep learning with other machine learning techniques and classical methodologies. Recent advancements imply that attention mechanism has become a popular combined strategy with deep learning methods. The use of deep algorithms in conjunction with other techniques showed promising outcomes. This research aims to provide a complete overview of the literature on lane detection methods, highlighting which approaches are currently being researched and the performance of existing state-of-the-art techniques. Also, the paper covered the equipment used to collect the dataset for the training process and the dataset used for network training, validation, and testing. This review yields a valuable foundation on lane detection techniques, challenges, and opportunities and supports new research works in this automation field. For further study, it is suggested to put more effort into accuracy improvement, increased speed performance, and more challenging work on various extreme conditions in detecting the road lane.

AB Connected cruise control (CCC), as an advanced driver assistance system (ADAS), can enhance the stability and safety of the traffic flow. It is worth noting that the uncertain human driving reaction time will seriously affect the stability of the entire CCC system. In this paper, the car-following platoon is considered, where the CCC autonomous vehicle at the tail receives velocity and position signals of n human-driven vehicles ahead through wireless vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) communication. A robust feedback controller is designed by only using the current states of each preceding vehicle and the ego vehicle based on the LaSalle-Yoshizawa-like condition to overcome the influence of uncertain human driving reaction time. The Lyapunov-Razumikhin approach analyzes the stability of the CCC vehicle in the closed-loop system, and the string stability of the whole CCC system is ensured by dissipativity with L-2 gain. The practicability of the designed robust controller is verified by simulation comparison with other design schemes.

AB Predicting the motion of surrounding vehicles is important for autonomous vehicle trajectory planning. To ensure the accuracy of motion prediction, it is particularly important to obtain information about the state of surrounding vehicles at the current moment. For this purpose, a first-order generalized pseudo-Bayesian method based on moving horizon estimation (GPB1-MHE) is proposed here. First, for vehicles, pedestrians and obstacles in complex environments, we design several different intention-based motion models to describe multiple maneuvers of vehicles during driving. Second, we replace the Kalman filter (KF) in the first-order generalized pseudo-Bayesian (GPB1) method with moving horizon estimation (MHE) to obtain GPB1-MHE. Compared with GPB1, it makes full use of the historical state information of a vehicle to improve the estimation accuracy. Finally, the effectiveness of the estimation method is verified using four operating conditions, overtaking, overtaken, pedestrian approaching, and pedestrian staying away, in a SCANeR studio and Simulink joint simulation environment.

AB The intersection management system can increase traffic capacity, vehicle safety, and the smoothness of all vehicle movement. Platoons of connected vehicles (CVs) use communication technologies to share information with each other and with infrastructures. In this paper, we proposed a deep reinforcement learning (DRL) model that applies to vehicle platooning at an isolated signalized intersection with partial detection. Moreover, we identified hyperparameters and tested the system with different numbers of vehicles (1, 2, and 3) in the platoon. To compare the effectiveness of the proposed model, we implemented two benchmark options, actuated traffic signal control (ATSC) and max pressure (MP). The experimental results demonstrated that the DRL model has many outstanding advantages compared to other models. Through the learning process, the average waiting time of vehicles in the DRL method was improved by 20% and 28% compared with the ATSC and MP options. The results also suggested that the DRL model is effective when the CV penetration rate is over 20%.

AB Timely investigating post-disaster situations to locate survivors and secure hazardous sources is critical, but also very challenging and risky. Despite first responders putting their lives at risk in saving others, human-physical limits cause delays in response time, resulting in fatality and property damage. In this paper, we proposed and implemented a framework intended for creating collaboration between heterogeneous unmanned vehicles and first responders to make search and rescue operations safer and faster. The framework consists of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), unmanned ground vehicles (UGVs), a cloud-based remote control station (RCS). A light-weight message queuing telemetry transport (MQTT) based communication is adopted for facilitating collaboration between autonomous systems. To effectively work under unfavorable disaster conditions, antenna tracker is developed as a tool to extend network coverage to distant areas, and mobile charging points for the UAVs are also implemented. The proposed framework's performance is evaluated in terms of end-to-end delay and analyzed using architectural analysis and design language (AADL). Experimental measurements and simulation results show that the adopted communication protocol performs more efficiently than other conventional communication protocols, and the implemented UAV control mechanisms are functioning properly. Several scenarios are implemented to validate the overall effectiveness of the proposed framework and demonstrate possible use cases.

AB Connected intelligent vehicle following can improve safety and efficiency compared to today's road transport, but real traffic in the near future will not provide an ideal setting for its deployment. Unconnected human-driven vehicles will follow variable behavior patterns that combine with differences in dynamic capability to create heterogeneous scenarios. In this paper, connected automated vehicles employ model predictive control for following in traffic that may include both heavy and passenger vehicles at quasi-random positions. Adding further realism, some quasi-randomly mixed vehicles are completely unconnected and equipped with the reactive intelligent driver model using pseudorandom parameters. A mixed-integer quadratic programming formulation adapts the predictive algorithm to diverse powertrain operating point constraints. The preceding vehicle's control input is estimated from velocity and brake light observations and used to probabilistically generate a preview for the ego vehicle. A terminal constraint designed using particle kinematics prevents collisions due to shortsightedness. Results are simulated at various heavy and predictive vehicle concentrations in the presence of packet loss. Linear fuel economy improvements between 1.4% and 1.9% per 10% increase in predictive vehicle penetration rate are shown.

AB With the potential to increase road safety and provide economic benefits, intelligent vehicles have elicited a significant amount of interest from both academics and industry. A robust and reliable vehicle detection and tracking system is one of the key modules for intelligent vehicles to perceive the surrounding environment. The millimeter-wave radar and the monocular camera are two vehicular sensors commonly used for vehicle detection and tracking. Despite their advantages, the drawbacks of these two sensors make them insufficient when used separately. Thus, the fusion of these two sensors is considered as an efficient way to address the challenge. This paper presents a collaborative fusion approach to achieve the optimal balance between vehicle detection accuracy and computational efficiency. The proposed vehicle detection and tracking design is extensively evaluated with a real-world data set collected by the developed intelligent vehicle. Experimental results show that the proposed system can detect on-road vehicles with 92.36% detection rate and 0% false alarm rate, and it only takes ten frames (0.16 s) for the detection and tracking of each vehicle. This systemis installed on Kuafu-II intelligent vehicle for the fourth and fifth autonomous vehicle competitions, which is called "Intelligent Vehicle Future Challenge" in China.

AB Vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) communication-enabled cooperation of multiple connected vehicles improves the safety and efficiency of our transportation systems. However, the joining and leaving of vehicles and unreliability of wireless communication channels will cause the switching of communication topology among vehicles, thus affecting the performance of multi-vehicle systems. To address this issue, a distributed model predictive control (DMPC) method is proposed for multi-vehicle system control under switching communication topologies. First, an open-loop optimization problem is formulated, within which neighbor-deviation and self-deviation penalties and constraints are incorporated to ensure stability. Then, a DMPC algorithm is designed for multi-vehicle systems subject to switching communication topologies. For the closed-loop system, the convergence of predicted terminal states is proved based on the neighbor-deviation constraint. After that, closed-loop system stability is analysed based on a common Lyapunov function (CLF) defined using a joint neighbor set. It is proved that asymptotic stability of the closed-loop system can be achieved through a sufficient condition on the weight matrices of the open-loop optimization problem. Numerical simulations are conducted to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed DMPC controller.

AB This study proposes a method for a vehicle controller to learn human driving behaviours through iterative interactions. In particular, the vehicle controller and the human driver jointly control a vehicle along a path only known to the human driver. Through repeated cooperative driving, the vehicle controller estimates the hidden desired path of the driver by minimising the control input. Eventually, semi-autonomous driving is realised since the vehicle controller is able to automatically track the target path and release the human driver from the driving task. The iterative learning of the human target path on the basis of the proposed algorithm is in the spatial domain, and is effective in the presence of uncertain human driving speeds. The validity of the proposed method is proved by rigorous analysis and demonstrated by numerical simulations.

AB The nonlinear vehicle dynamics and the non-convexity of collision avoidance constraints pose major challenges for optimization-based trajectory planning of automated vehicles. Current solutions are either tailored to specific traffic scenarios, simplify the vehicle dynamics, are computationally demanding, or may get stuck in local minima. This work presents a novel approach to address the aforementioned shortcomings by identifying collision-free driving corridors that represent spatio-temporal constraints for motion planning using set-based reachability analysis. We derive a suitable formulation of collision avoidance constraints from driving corridors that can be integrated into arbitrary nonlinear programs as well as (successive) convexification procedures. When combining our approach with existing motion planning methods based on continuous optimization, trajectories can be planned in arbitrary traffic situations in a computationally efficient way. We demonstrate the efficacy of our approach using scenarios from the CommonRoad benchmark suite.

AB Ocean scientists have dreamed of and recently started to realize an ocean observing revolution with autonomous observing platforms and sensors. Critical questions to be answered by such autonomous systems are where, when, and what to sample for optimal information, and how to optimally reach the sampling locations. Definitions, concepts, and progress towards answering these questions using quantitative predictions and fundamental principles are presented. Results in reachability and path planning, adaptive sampling, machine learning, and teaming machines with scientists are overviewed. The integrated use of differential equations and theory from varied disciplines is emphasized. The results provide an inference engine and knowledge base for expert autonomous observing systems. They are showcased using a set of recent at-sea campaigns and realistic simulations. Real-time experiments with identical autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) in the Buzzards Bay and Vineyard Sound region first show that our predicted time-optimal paths were faster than shortest distance paths. Deterministic and probabilistic reachability and path forecasts issued and validated for gliders and floats in the northern Arabian Sea are then presented. Novel Bayesian adaptive sampling for hypothesis testing and optimal learning are finally shown to forecast the observations most informative to estimate the accuracy of model formulations, the values of ecosystem parameters and dynamic fields, and the presence of Lagrangian Coherent Structures.

ID SCHEME
AB Next-generation Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS) use wirelessly connected vehicles for safety and non-safety applications such as autonomous driving, cooperative awareness, route guidance and multimedia transmissions. This network known as the Internet of Vehicles (IoVs) suffers from many challenges such as collisions due to hidden terminals, and interference from simultaneously transmitting vehicles. Moreover, the packet reception ratio of transmissions between vehicles is significantly reduced at high vehicle densities and severe fading scenarios. As safety applications require periodic broadcast of safety messages from each vehicle to all other vehicles in the neighborhood, the development of an efficient medium access technique is a key challenge. In this paper, we propose an interference-aware medium access protocol for vehicular networks that allocate time slots to the vehicles such that interference due to hidden nodes is minimized. We first provide an analytical model to compute the interference range of a vehicle in the presence of simultaneously transmitting vehicles. We also propose a scheduling algorithm that uses vehicle GPS positions and reuse the same time slot only at a distance greater than the interference range. Simulation results show that the proposed technique improves the packet reception ratio by 70% as compared to the standard IEEE 802.11p based CSMA/CA protocol.

AB A driving strategy for autonomous vehicles (AVs) that is consistent with human behavior while demonstrating superior performance seems to have a good chance to be accepted by early AV users and be successful in the long run. Most of the past research focused on motion strategies affected by the presence of other vehicles. On the other hand, AV not constrained by other vehicles must select a safe and comfortable speed that is perceived as such by its occupants. This line of research is not well covered by the published work. The baseline speed, which is the speed AVs will follow without interaction with other vehicles, implemented via cruise control (CC) in modern vehicles is a constant speed consistent with speed limits and design speeds. A more advanced strategy of road-limiting speed control (RC) responds to influencing geometric features ahead of the AV's current position. Neither of the two strategies considers AV occupants' preferences. The current void in research is particularly obvious for free-flow conditions where baseline speeds must be implemented for extended periods of travel. Although the existing strategies have not been yet evaluated on roadways with demanding alignments and operating in free-flow conditions, the principles on which they are based provide a basis for skepticism if they can be acceptable to AV occupants. This study used the Tongji University driving simulator to evaluate the CC and RC strategies and their potential limitations in free-flow conditions on a mountainous freeway with complex alignments. Human speed-selection behavior was observed among a group of participating drivers. The clustering analysis of the data revealed three distinct driving styles: slow, fast, and consistent. The resulted analytical models provided human-focused road-dependent baseline speed profiles- a key element of the proposed humanlike speed control (HC) strategy. The comparison of the existing speed-control strategies CC and RC with the proposed HC confirmed the limitations of the two existing ones if applied to roads with complex alignments. Considerable discrepancies were revealed between the baseline speeds produced with the existing and the proposed ones.

ID COLLISION-AVOIDANCE; STEERING CONTROL
AB Not only do automated vehicles need to meet specifications for technical performance, they also need to satisfy the societal expectations for behavior in traffic with humans. Societal expectations, such as accident avoidance and adherence to traffic laws, have their foundation in core moral issues found in philosophy and ethics. Thus, engineers designing control algorithms for automated vehicles can benefit from applying principles and frameworks from philosophy to drive design decisions. In particular, we use a set of ethical frameworks to map design decisions for a model predictive control problem to philosophical principles. Deontology, a rule-based ethical framework, motivates the development of constraints on the system. Consequentialism, a cost-based ethical framework, motivates the construction of the objective function. The choice of weights is guided by the concepts of virtue ethics and role morality to determine behavior for different types of vehicles. The strong link between ethical principles and actual vehicle behavior developed through this approach is demonstrated experimentally by implementing alternative design choices on a test vehicle in a simple driving scenario.

AB Inspection of critical infrastructure with drones is experiencing an increasing uptake in the industry driven by a demand for reduced cost, time, and risk for inspectors. Early deployments of drone inspection services involve manual drone operations with a pilot and do not obtain the technological benefits concerning autonomy, coordination, and cooperation. In this paper, we study the design needed to handle the complexity of an Unmanned Aerial System (UAS) to support autonomous inspection of safety-critical infrastructure. We apply a constructive research approach to link innovation needs with concepts, designs, and validations that include simulation and demonstration of key design parts. Our design approach addresses the complexity of the UAS and provides a selection of technology components for drone and ground control hardware and software including algorithms for autonomous operation and interaction with cloud services. The paper presents a drone perception system with accelerated onboard computing, communication technologies of the UAS, as well as algorithms for swarm membership, formation flying, object detection, and fault detection with artificial intelligence. We find that the design of a cooperative drone swarm and its integration into a custom-built UAS for infrastructure inspection is highly feasible given the current state of the art in electronic components, software, and communication technology.

AB Artificial intelligence (AI)-powered autonomous vehicles (AVs) can integrate different machine learning (ML) techniques to build up a complex autonomous driving system. However, single AV intelligence is not enough to cope with ever-changing driving environments. The underlying reason is that, with current neural network design and training algorithms, it is challenging for the driving model to generalize to diverse driving environments all at once due to sample inefficiency and the curse of dimensionality. Powerful computing resources and massive amount of data can be used to train a good driving model offline. However, the driving model obtained offline might fail in corner case scenarios. In this paper, we propose an intelligence networking framework among AVs assisted by multi-access edge computing (MEC) with end-to-end learning for demonstration. In this framework, driving road is divided into segments and data is collected for each road segment separately. Assisted by MEC networks, a continuously updated driving model is produced in near real-time for each road segment when the environment changes. By dividing the road into segments, we aim to reduce the burden of generalization since a single model only needs to adapt to a specific road segment. Simulation results show that our solutions can produce updated driving model for each road segment to adapt to environmental changes better than the existing scheme. Upcoming AVs can then adapt to changing environments by downloading the updated driving model.

AB Advanced vehicle guidance systems use real-time traffic information to route traffic and to avoid congestion. Unfortunately, these systems can only react upon the presence of traffic jams and not to prevent the creation of unnecessary congestion. Anticipatory vehicle routing is promising in that respect, because this approach allows directing vehicle routing by accounting for traffic forecast information. This paper presents a decentralized approach for anticipatory vehicle routing that is particularly useful in large-scale dynamic environments. The approach is based on delegate multiagent systems, i.e., an environment-centric coordination mechanism that is, in part, inspired by ant behavior. Antlike agents explore the environment on behalf of vehicles and detect a congestion forecast, allowing vehicles to reroute. The approach is explained in depth and is evaluated by comparison with three alternative routing strategies. The experiments are done in simulation of a real-world traffic environment. The experiments indicate a considerable performance gain compared with the most advanced strategy under test, i.e., a traffic-message-channel-based routing strategy.

AB Unmanned combat aerial vehicles are expected to assist human pilots or to perform autonomous aerial combat in the future. Previous research studies on autonomous aerial combat often have limitations due to overly simplifying assumptions, heavy computational loads, and limited scalability. In this paper, we propose a novel autonomous aerial combat algorithm with high-performance and real-time calculations based on basic fighter maneuvers for gun-based engagement within visual range. From the perspective of energy maneuver, which is the core concept of basic fighter maneuvers, we analyzed the flight envelope and maximum maneuvering point of a fighter jet model using the velocity-load factor and energy-maneuver diagrams. We designed a score function and matrix for situation assessment based on combat geometries, enabling cooperative maneuvers and role assignment. By performing gun modeling and target prediction based on the maneuvering plane, the impact point for gun shooting was obtained. The performance of the designed algorithm was validated through not only Monte-Carlo simulations with various initial conditions, but also engagements with another algorithm for comparison, and evaluation sessions by an Air Force combat instructor in a real-time simulation environment using virtual reality goggles and X-Plane.

AB Thanks to the explosive evolution of 6G, Artificial intelligence, Blockchain, Cloud computing, Data, and Edge computing (6G+ABCDE), it is possible to make Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS) more autonomous, intelligent, and efficient. Conventional ITS technologies have been applied and deployed worldwide, and autonomous vehicles have also made a qualitative leap. The revolution of ITS magnitude is on the horizon, and the singularity may happen in the 6G Autonomous Intelligent Transportation Systems (6G-AITS). We indicate that the human-centric transportation system will still be the key to 6G-AITS. The 6G-AITS is a threedimensional intelligent system, which is driven by data and intelligence, and characterized by sharing and collaboration, thereby achieving the service-oriented demand response. To support this vision, we explore the 6G-AITS changes in terms of system architecture, communication, and resource allocation, as well as its key features. We elaborate on the mechanism and three applications of 6G-AITS. Furthermore, we explore the challenges of 6G-AITS and consider some issues that go beyond technologies that could affect the development of 6G-AITS. Key objective of this work is to provide an exploration of the imperative requirements to develop 6G-AITS and guidance for the research and development of 6G-AITS.

AB This paper studies a control architecture for vehicle lateral dynamics based on the execution of optimal trajectories via feedforward inverse model control. The focus here is on assessing the robustness of this arrangement when the vehicle real forward dynamics is not identically cancelled by the inverse model due to model approximations and parameter uncertainties. The trajectories that are considered are analytic solutions of the minimum square jerk optimal control problem for a simplified kinematic vehicle model in curvilinear coordinates. Various hypotheses are made concerning the mismatch between the inverse model and the actual forward dynamics of the vehicle. Closed-loop stability analysis shows that the studied control scheme guarantees asymptotic stability of both the nominal and the perturbed kinematic model with significant robustness margins. In addition to the theoretical robustness analysis, the same control scheme is validated in simulation using the industry-standard software for virtual vehicle testing IPG CarMaker.

AB It is becoming common to use instrumented probe vehicles (IPV) equipped with perception sensors (e.g., LIDAR or radar) to monitor ambient traffic for empirical studies of traffic dynamics and driver behavior, while the rapidly advancing field of autonomous vehicles (AV) uses perception sensors to identify and mitigate hazards. Yet the perception sensors are far from perfect, so targets of interest go undetected. The "unseen" targets might lead to inaccurate theories of traffic flow or worse, autonomous vehicle crashes. The challenge with the unseen targets is that it is difficult to detect the absence. There is little study of how vehicle-mounted perception sensors perform "in the wild" because often the perception sensors themselves usually provide the best measurements available. The focus of this work is IPV data for offline study, but the general findings are also relevant for perception sensors used in AV applications.
   While there is a growing number of IPV data sets, to date most suffer from the lack of independent validation of the perception sensors. This paper fuses individual vehicle actuations from loop detectors and concurrent ambient vehicle trajectories collected from an IPV to provide a rare opportunity to assess the perception sensor performance in situ, using the loop detector data to "see" what is missed by the perception sensors. While the specific results are unique to the IPV, one should expect similar biases from other perception sensor data; though without an independent measure like the loop detectors in this study, it will be difficult to quantify what goes unseen in those data sets. These findings also highlight the need to develop means to actively calibrate mobile perception sensors for AV's. It is important to capture the behavior of these systems in situ, as maintained by private owners, though we envision in the case of an AV the role of the loop detectors might be replaced with localization information from other AV's. The data fusion has added benefits for the study of traffic dynamics, with the loop detectors providing continuous monitoring at the detector locations and the WV providing spatially rich information about the ambient traffic as it travels between detector stations. This fused data set will be available upon publication.

AB Recently, virtual environment-based techniques to train sensor-based autonomous driving models have been widely employed due to their efficiency. However, a simulated virtual environment is required to be highly similar to its real-world counterpart to ensure the applicability of such models to actual autonomous vehicles. Though advances in hardware and three-dimensional graphics engine technology have enabled the creation of realistic virtual driving environments, the myriad of scenarios occurring in the real world can only be simulated up to a limited extent. In this study, a scenario simulation and modeling framework that simulates the behavior of objects that may be encountered while driving is proposed to address this problem. This framework maximizes the number of scenarios, their types, and the driving experience in a virtual environment. Furthermore, a simulator was implemented and employed to evaluate the performance of the proposed framework.

AB Evolution has endowed animals with outstanding adaptive behaviours which are grounded in the organization of their sensorimotor system. This paper uses inspiration from these principles of organization in the design of an artificial agent for autonomous driving. After distilling the relevant principles from biology, their functional role in the implementation of an artificial system are explained. The resulting Agent, developed in an EU H2020 Research and Innovation Action, is used to concretely demonstrate the emergence of adaptive behaviour with a significant level of autonomy. Guidelines to adapt the same principled organization of the sensorimotor system to other agents for driving are also obtained. The demonstration of the system abilities is given with example scenarios and open access simulation tools. Prospective developments concerning learning via mental imagery are finally discussed.
