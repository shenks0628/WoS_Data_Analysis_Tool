AB This paper investigates managed lane toll setting and its effect under mixed traffic of connected automated vehicles (CAVs), high-occupancy vehicles (HOVs), and human-driven vehicles (HDVs), with the goal of avoiding flow breakdown and minimizing total social cost. A mesoscopic finite difference traffic simulation model considers the flow-density relationship at different CAV market penetration rates, lane-changing behaviors, and multiple entries/exits, interacting with a reactive toll setting mechanism. The results of Monte Carlo simulation suggest an optimal policy of untolled HOV/CAV use with tolled HDVs in particular scenarios of limited CAV market penetration. Small and targeted tolling avoids flow breakdown in managed lanes while prioritizing HOVs and other vehicles with high values of time. Extensions of the formulation and sensitivity analysis quantify the benefits of converting high-occupancy HDVs to CAVs. The optimal tolling regime combines traffic science notions of flow stability and the economics of resource allocation.

ID ADAPTIVE CRUISE CONTROL; AUTONOMOUS VEHICLES
AB Connected automated vehicles (CAV) can increase traffic efficiency, which is considered a critical factor in saving energy and reducing emissions in traffic congestion. In this paper, systematic traffic simulations are conducted for three car-following modes, including intelligent driver model (IDM), adaptive cruise control (ACC), and cooperative ACC (CACC), in congestions caused by rear-end collisions. From the perspectives of lane density, vehicle trajectory and vehicle speed, the fuel consumption of vehicles under the three car-following modes are compared and analysed, respectively. Based on the vehicle driving and accident environment parameters, an XGBoost algorithm-based fuel consumption prediction framework is proposed for traffic congestions caused by rear-end collisions. The results show that compared with IDM and ACC modes, the vehicles in CACC car-following mode have the ideal performance in terms of total fuel consumption; besides, the traffic flow in CACC mode is more stable, and the speed fluctuation is relatively tiny in different accident impact regions, which meets the driving desires of drivers.

AB Various sensors are adopted by autonomous driving systems to perceive objects and surroundings. Thus, the multi-sensor data fusion techniques become essential to combine different sensors' advantages for better perception performance. However, the current multi-sensor data fusion techniques suffer from the high cost of computation resources, low expansibility for more diverse sensors, and insufficient systematic consideration for modeling. This paper first constructs a detachable and expansible multi-sensor data fusion model based on three main modules: front fusion, global fusion, and synthesizer, where the methods for flexible association gating and virtual targets have been designed. The model can be disassembled and configured for different trim levels of vehicles and is easily expansible for adding more heterogeneous sensors. Next, the presented multi-sensor data fusion model is compared with the cheap Joint Probabilistic Data Association (C-JPDA) method. The comparison shows the superior accuracy of the designed model on false association and effective narrowing of the variance of object detection. Finally, the presented multi-sensor data fusion model is integrated into an embedded system and experimented on urban roads and highways with the engaged Level 3 autonomous driving function. The experiment results indicate that the proposed model has excellent sensor data fusion performance and provides accurate and timely object information in the Level 3 autonomous driving system.

AB This study proposes a sliding mode fault-tolerant control (FTC) scheme for the medium-scale unmanned autonomous helicopter with rotor flapping dynamics in the presence of wind gusts and actuator faults using extended state observer technique. The radial basis function neural networks are employed to tackle the unknown non-linear interaction functions and adaptive neural network extended state observers are constructed to estimate the unknown wind gusts. Meanwhile, the adaptive fault observers are developed to estimate the fault parameters in position, attitude and flapping motion subsystems. With the aim of obtaining satisfactory trajectory tracking performance, a robust adaptive sliding mode FTC scheme is presented based on the backstepping sliding mode control technique and the closed-loop system stability is rigorously proved via Lyapunov analysis. Simulation results are carried out to validate the effectiveness of the proposed control method.

AB In this contribution a wireless, energy autonomous sensor micro-system is presented. The innovation of this wireless system is that it has been designed as an energy autonomous sensor system especially for use in vehicles. The newly developed pressure sensor system is intended to measure the pressure in the fuel system of vehicles and to wirelessly transmit it in the 2.4 GHz-frequency band to a receiver. The sensor system is powered by an electromagnetic energy harvester driven by vibration and transmits the measured data as soon as there is sufficient energy available in the system. As a consequence the system's data rate varies depending on the system energy level and consequently on the vibration power available. So the basic idea is to supply an energy storage system, e.g. a capacitor, with energy until a certain threshold value is achieved. This threshold value was defined such that the stored energy is sufficient for measuring the pressure and the temperature and transmitting these values to the receiver. After successful transmission the circuit goes back into the state of "energy collection". In order to realize a system setup as compact as possible consisting of pressure sensor, energy converter with energy storage, controller, and HF module, we have developed and implemented a housing constructed as a PCB/MID support frame.

SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF SYSTEMS SCIENCE

ID INTELLIGENT
AB This paper describes the design and implementation of a mission control system for the MARIUS autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV). The framework adopted for system design builds on the key concept of vehicle primitive,,which is a parametrized specification of an elementary operation performed by the vehicle. Vehicle primitives m-e obtained by coordinating the execution of a number of concurrent system tasks, which are parametrized specifications of classes of algorithms or procedures that implement basic functionalities in an underwater robotic system. Vehicle primitives are in turn logically and temporally chained to form more abstract mission procedures, which are executed as determined by mission programs, in reaction to external events. System task design is carried out using well-established tools from continuous- or discrete-time dynamic system theory, and finite-state algorithm to describe their logical (event-based) interaction with vehicle primitives. The design and analysis of vehicle primitives and mission procedures build on the theory of Petri nets, which are naturally oriented towards the modeling and analysis of asynchronous concurrent discrete-event systems. Vehicle primitives and mission procedures can be developed and implemented on the vehicle's distributed computer system using the specially designed software programming environments CORAL and ATOL respectively. The first is a set of software tools that allows for graphically building a library of vehicle primitives embodied in Petri nets and running them in real time. The latter provides similar tools for mission procedure programming but relies on a reactive synchronous programming language as a way to manage the potential complexity introduced by the occurrence of large Petri net structures. Whereas the first has been fully implemented, the latter has been specified but is still under development. Thus, at this stage of development, mission procedures and mission programs ai-e effectively embodied into higher-level Petri net structures that control the scheduling of the vehicle primitives that are necessary to execute a given mission. The paper provides a summary of the general methodology adopted for the design and implementation of mission control systems for underwater robots and describes its application to the control of the MARIUS AUV. The paper introduces the experimental set-up for mission programming, mission execution and mission follow-up from a support station and describes the sequence of steps involved in programming and running a selected mission with the vehicle at sea.

AB Eco-driving is a driving vehicle strategy aimed at minimizing energy consumption; that is, it is a method to improve vehicle efficiency by optimizing driving behavior without making any hardware changes, especially for autonomous vehicles. To enhance energy efficiency across various driving scenarios, including road slopes, car following scenarios, and traffic signal interactions, this research introduces an energy-conserving speed planning approach for self-driving electric vehicles employing reinforcement learning. This strategy leverages vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) and vehicle-to-infrastructure (V2I) communication to acquire real-time data regarding traffic signal timing, leading vehicle speeds, and other pertinent driving conditions. In the framework of rolling horizon reinforcement learning (RHRL), predictions are made in each window using a rolling time domain approach. In the evaluation stage, Q-learning is used to obtain the optimal evaluation value, so that the vehicle can reach a reasonable speed. In conclusion, the algorithm's efficacy is confirmed through vehicle simulation, with the results demonstrating that reinforcement learning adeptly modulates vehicle speed to minimize energy consumption, all while taking into account factors like road grade and maintaining a secure following distance from the preceding vehicle. Compared with the results of traditional adaptive cruise control (ACC), the algorithm can save 11.66% and 30.67% of energy under two working conditions.

ID OPTIMIZATION
AB This paper investigates the cooperative planning and control problem for multiple connected autonomous vehicles (CAVs) in different scenarios. In the existing literature, most of the methods suffer from significant problems in computational efficiency. Furthermore, as the optimization problem is nonlinear and nonconvex, it typically poses great difficulty in determining the optimal solution. To address this issue, this work proposes a novel and completely parallel computation framework by leveraging the alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM). The nonlinear and nonconvex optimization problem in the autonomous driving problem can he divided into two manageable sub-problems; and the resulting sub-problems can be solved by using effective optimization methods in a parallel framework. Here, the differential dynamic programming (DDP) algorithm is capable of addressing the nonlinearity of the system dynamics rather effectively; and the nonconvex coupling constraints with small dimensions can be resolved by invoking the notion of semi-definite relaxation (SDR), which can also be solved in a very short time. Due to the parallel computation and efficient relaxation of nonconvex constraints, our proposed approach effectively realizes real-time implementation; and thus extra assurance of driving safety is provided. In addition, two transportation scenarios for multiple CAVs are used to illustrate the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed method.

AB Maritime unmanned systems (MUS) have gained widespread usage in a diverse range of hydrographic survey activities, including harbor/port surveys, beach and coastline monitoring, environmental assessment, and military operations. The present article explains a validated, rapid, and reliable technique for processing hydrographic data that was obtained via an autonomous hydrographic survey, and which was executed by a prototype unmanned surface vessel (USV) belonging to the Unmanned Survey Solutions (USS) corporation. The experimentation was part of the annual Multinational Exercise Robotic Experimentation and Prototyping that was augmented by Maritime Unmanned Systems 22 (REPMUS22), which was held in the national waters of Portugal. The main objective of this experimentation was to assess the underwater environment over an ocean beach for an amphibious landing exercise. Moreover, the integration of the multibeam system with the autonomous prototype vessel was assessed. A short comparison between the USV survey and a traditional vessel multibeam survey is presented, whereby the advantages of performing an autonomous survey operation near the coastline is emphasized. A correlation between a known multibeam processing technique and the dissemination of a rapid but consistent product for operational use is described, highlighting the applicability of the technique for the data collected from small experimental platforms. Moreover, this study outlines the relationship between the particular errors observed in autonomous small vehicles and in conventional data processing methods. The resultant cartographic outputs from the hydrographic survey are presented, emphasizing the specific inaccuracies within the raw data and the suitability of distinct hydrographic products for various user domains.

TI Analyzing the Effect of Autonomous Ridehailing on Transit Ridership:
   Competitor or Desirable First-/Last-Mile Connection?
SO TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH RECORD
LA English
DT Article
ID VEHICLE; PREFERENCES; SERVICE; MODELS; SYSTEM; TAXI
AB Ridehailing services (e.g., Uber or Lyft) may serve as a substitute or a complement-or some combination thereof-to transit. Automation as an emerging technology is expected to further complicate the current complex relationship between transit and ridehailing. This paper aims to explore how US commuters' stated willingness to ride transit is influenced by the price of ridehailing services and whether the service is provided by an autonomous vehicle. To that end, a stated preference survey was launched around the US to ask 1,500 commuters how they would choose their commute mode from among choices including their current mode and other conventional modes as well as asking them to choose between their current mode and an autonomous mode. Using a joint stated and revealed preference dataset, a mixed logit model was developed and analyzed. The results show that ridehailing per se might not be a significant competitor to transit, especially if it is integrated with transit as a first-/last-mile service. The total share of transit (transit-only riders plus those who use transit in connection with first-/last-mile ridehailing) remains substantially flat as set against conventional ridehailing services, even if ridehailing fares decrease. On the other hand, when the ridehailing price is significantly reduced by automation, our analysis suggests a decline in total transit ridership and an increase in ridehailing, especially for solo ridehailing. Also, it was found that autonomous pooled ridehailing might not be as appealing to commuters as autonomous solo ridehailing.

AB Visual tracking is a vital component of autonomous driving perception system. Siamese networks have achieved great success in both accuracy and speed for visual tracking tasks. These Siamese trackers share a similar framework in which each tracker consists of two network branches for exploring semantic information. However, the performance of Siamese trackers is limited by an insufficient semantic template and an unsatisfactory updating strategy. To tackle these problems, we propose a manifold Siamese network for visual tracking that can simultaneously utilize semantic and geometric information. A manifold sample pool is constructed to exploit the manifold structure of image object sequences. This sample pool is dynamically learned via a fast Gaussian mixture model (GMM). After obtaining a manifold sample template, we design a deep architecture based on a correlation filter (CF) network and append a novel manifold feature branch. The network remains fully convolutional and can train a template to discriminate exemplar image and arbitrarily size search image. Then, a triplet occlusion score function cooperates with an effective update method that is established to prevent model drift. Extensive experiments show that the proposed tracking algorithm performs favorably compared with the state-of-the-art methods on three standard benchmark datasets at a high framerate, which is very suitable for autonomous driving.

AB This letter deals with autonomous farming and with the autonomous navigation of an agricultural robot in orchards. These letter are typical semistructured environments where the dense canopy prevents from using GPS signal and embedded sensors are often preferred to localize the vehicle. To move safely in such environments, it is necessary to provide the robot the ability of detecting and localizing trees. This letter focuses on this problem. It presents a low cost but an efficient vision-based system allowing to detect accurately, quickly, and robustly the trees. It is made of four stereo cameras that provide a point cloud characterizing the environment. The key idea is to find the tree trunks by detecting their shadows, which are materialized by concavities in the obtained point cloud. In this way, branches and leaves are not taken into account, improving the detection robustness and, therefore, the navigation strategy. The method has been implemented using robot operating system (ROS) and validated using data sequences taken in several different orchards. The obtained results definitely validate the approach and its performances show that the processing time (around 1 ms) is sufficiently short for the data to he used at the control level. A comparison with other approaches from the literature is also provided.

AB This paper proposes a semantic world model framework for hierarchical distributed representation of knowledge in autonomous underwater systems. This framework aims to provide a more capable and holistic system, involving semantic interoperability among all involved information sources. This will enhance interoperability, independence of operation, and situation awareness of the embedded service-oriented agents for autonomous platforms. The results obtained specifically affect the mission flexibility, robustness, and autonomy. The presented framework makes use of the idea that heterogeneous real-world data of very different type must be processed by (and run through) several different layers, to be finally available in a suited format and at the right place to be accessible by high-level decision-making agents. In this sense, the presented approach shows how to abstract away from the raw real-world data step by step by means of semantic technologies. The paper concludes by demonstrating the benefits of the framework in a real scenario. A hardware fault is simulated in a REMUS 100 AUV while performing a mission. This triggers a knowledge exchange between the status monitoring agent and the adaptive mission planner embedded agent. By using the proposed framework, both services can interchange information while remaining domain independent during their interaction with the platform. The results of this paper are readily applicable to land and air robotics.

AB The inability of semantic segmentation methods to detect anomaly road obstacles not pre-defined in the datasets significantly hinders the safety-critical application in autonomous driving. The excessively complex anomaly detection approaches cannot accommodate the constraints on the inference time of intelligent vehicles. Inspired by the fact that humans have a natural instinct to be curious about unknown objects in a new environment, we propose a novel curiosity-driven attention mechanism (CuDAM) for anomaly road obstacles segmentation. CuDAM adopts the attention map as a new uncertainty judging criterion and utilizes it to improve the efficiency of the model. Specifically, CuDAM is composed of three parts: 1) an attention module for generating an attention map; 2) a reward mechanism for encouraging the network to focus its attention on uncertain regions; 3) an attention loss function for widening the distance between the attention values of deterministic and uncertain pixels. Different from previous approaches, CuDAM can improve both anomaly detection and semantic segmentation performance without complex operations and training, which makes it widely applicable to existing semantic segmentation models. The result of qualitative and quantitative experiments shows that such a straightforward approach achieves consistent significant improvements in anomaly detection performances with the various uncertainty estimation methods, demonstrating the broad applicability of CuDAM.

AB Platoon formation of highway vehicles is a critical foundation for autonomous or semiautonomous vehicle control for enhanced safety, improved highway utility, increased fuel economy, and reduced emission toward intelligent transportation systems. Platoon control encounters great challenges from vehicle control, communications, team coordination, and uncertainties. This paper introduces a new method for coordinated control of platoons by using integrated network consensus decisions and vehicle control. To achieve suitable coordination of the team vehicles based on terrain and environmental conditions, the emerging technology of network consensus control is modified to a weighted and constrained consensus-seeking framework. Algorithms are introduced and their convergence properties are established. The methodology employs neighborhood information through on-board sensors and V2V or V2I communications, but achieves global coordination of the entire platoon. The ability of the methods in terms of robustness, disturbance rejection, noise attenuation, and cyber-physical interaction is analyzed and demonstrated with simulated case studies.

AB The development of fully autonomous vehicles is an ambition that took seed in the automotive industry a few years ago and is now growing in the railways considering their benefits. The main objective of autonomous train is to perform its operations and assure its mission with an acceptable safety level in all possible operational conditions. Such an objective needs to be supported by a safety demonstration. In order to authorize the operations of railway systems, they must be proven safe. This requires a technical and operational safety assessment, and also a safety assurance process during the system's whole life-cycle. The goal of such activities is to ensure that designed systems comply with railway safety standards and regulations. Both safety arguments and evidences are required to demonstrate that this compliance is achieved. These sets of evidence are documented in a so-called safety case. Recently, graphical safety cases, such as Goal Structuring Notation (GSN)-based safety case, have become an interesting alternative to narrative reports and plain texts. The graphical structure and visual properties improve the presentation and comprehension of the safety arguments. In this paper, we firstly review the use of the GSN for building graphical safety case for different transportation systems, with a focus on the railway domain. Then, we discuss the opportunities and challenges of considering such an approach in railway and we propose a high-level framework for building the GSN-based safety assurance case for the autonomous trains.

ID RENEWABLE ENERGY
AB The electric vehicles (EVs) connected to the charging stations (CSs), as a part of autonomous micro-grid (MG), introduce additional fluctuations due to their dynamic behaviour owing to variable state of charge (SOC) and the type of EV. This paper puts forth the charging station control strategy (CSCS) for proper energy management (EM) and voltage regulation (VR) in an autonomous MG subjected to dynamic behaviour of EVs, fluctuations of solar irradiance, wind speed, and load. The EVs parked in the CSs either charge or discharge through two-way power exchange between the autonomous MG system and the CSs, depending on the generation and load de-mand distinctions. As a result, EVs that enter and depart the CSs may have varying battery voltage ratings and upper SOC limits that differ. The simulations are executed using the MATLAB (R) software, and the efficiency of the proposed CSCS is assessed in two different modes: excess power mode (EPM) and deficient power mode (DPM). For a realistic proposal analysis, the results are also checked using a hardware-in the-loop (HIL) real-time OPAL-RT simulator (OP5700). By comparing and contrasting the results obtained with MATLAB (R) and the OPAL-RT simulator, the proposed control strategy is validated.

AB Landing on a moving platform is an essential requirement to achieve high-performance autonomous flight with various vehicles, including quadrotors. We propose an efficient and reliable autonomous landing system, based on model predictive control, which can accurately land in the presence of external disturbances. To detect and track the landing marker, a fast two-stage algorithm is introduced in the gimbaled camera, while a model predictive controller with variable sampling time is used to predict and calculate the entire landing trajectory based on the estimated platform information. As the quadrotor approaches the target platform, the sampling time is gradually shortened to feed a re-planning process that perfects the landing trajectory continuously and rapidly, improving the overall accuracy and computing efficiency. At the same time, a cascade incremental nonlinear dynamic inversion control method is adopted to track the planned trajectory and improve robustness against external disturbances. We carried out both simulations and outdoor flight experiments to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed landing system. The results show that the quadrotor can land rapidly and accurately even under external disturbance and that the terminal position, speed and attitude satisfy the requirements of a smooth landing mission.

DE Road-boundary detection; imitation learning; large-scale dataset;
   autonomous driving
AB Road-boundary detection is important for autonomous driving. It can be used to constrain autonomous vehicles running on road areas to ensure driving safety. Compared with online road-boundary detection using on-vehicle cameras/Lidars, offline detection using aerial images could alleviate the severe occlusion issue. Moreover, the offline detection results can be directly employed to annotate high-definition (HD) maps. In recent years, deep-learning technologies have been used in offline detection. But there still lacks a publicly available dataset for this task, which hinders the research progress in this area. So in this letter, we propose a new benchmark dataset, named Topo-boundary, for offline topological road-boundary detection. The dataset contains 25,295 1000 x 1000-sized 4-channel aerial images. Each image is provided with 8 training labels for different sub-tasks. We also design a new entropy-basedmetric for connectivity evaluation, which could better handle noises or outliers. We implement and evaluate 3 segmentation-based baselines and 5 graph-based baselines using the dataset. We also propose a new imitation-learning-based baseline which is enhanced from our previous work. The superiority of our enhancement is demonstrated from the comparison. The dataset and our-implemented code for the baselines are available at https:// tonyxuqaq.github.io/ Topo-boundary/.

AB The paper in hand addresses the issue of precise positioning of a human in peril, who is supervised by means of carrying a novel wearable apparatus in the context of a crisis event. A completely Autonomous Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (AUAV) comprises the main component of an Autonomous Aerial Rescue System (AARS), namely the ROLFER (Robotic Lifeguard For Emergency Rescue), which has been specifically designed for instantaneous response and provision of assistance in Search and Rescue (SAR) scenarios. As short response times constitute a sine qua non criterion in SAR operations, all the accuracy issues of such systems have to be seriously accounted so as for a rescue mission or activity to be considered successful. After examining and evaluating the performance of several Global Positioning System (GPS) methods and techniques, the moving-base Real-Time Kinematics (RTK)-GPS technology was chosen due to its superior accuracy. Hardware and software configuration of the novel wearable apparatus prototype, as well as the architecture of the overall rescue system are described in detail in this paper. Experimental results from real flight tests of the proposed AARS and the effectiveness of the implemented moving-base RTK-GPS-based wearable apparatus are also presented here.

DE sense and avoid; unmanned aircraft vehicle; remotely piloted vehicle;
   autonomous collision avoidance; path following
AB An autonomous navigation system integrating both the path following and the autonomous sense & avoid functions is presented in this article. The sense & avoid algorithm was developed to provide an avoidance manoeuvre that ensures a minimum separation between the ownship and all other agents during its execution in a multiple flying threats scenario. The resolution manoeuvre is defined as step variations in the heading angle and altitude autopilots commands. The commands are optimised in order to get the smallest step command necessary to keep a minimum predefined separation between the ownship and the threats. Its computation is based on the estimation of the future trajectory of all the agents and, therefore, on the estimation of aircraft performance during the manoeuvre. The suggested resolution manoeuvre is updated at 1 Hz in order to take into account any unpredictable changes of the threat trajectories. The obtained heading and altitude change commands are displayed on a novel human-machine interface to support the pilot in the planning of the avoidance action. The proposed sense & avoid system is modelled in a Matlab/Simulink (R) environment for a Piper J3 Cub 40 model aircraft. The threats considered are aircrafts that communicate their states to the system through their Automatic Dependent Surveillance-Broadcast mode S transponders.

DE Connected autonomous trucks (CATs); Connected autonomous vehicles

AB Previous studies on connected autonomous vehicles (CAVs) examined pavement performance and lane widths separately and in isolation, and without consideration for roadworks conditions. Hence, this study presents a holistic, optimal highway design solution for connected autonomous trucks (CATs) by testing pavement failure and traffic performance under different cross-sectional configurations incorporating a dedicated CAT lane for both normal and temporary traffic management (TTM) arrangements. Firstly, a dual three-lane motorway (D3M) was selected as a base case site. Next, previous research on substandard lanes was used to produce five nonstandard cross-section alternatives, which were then modeled using commercially available software. Capital investments to implement the alternatives were calculated by applying established industry construction cost models. Each cross-section was then subjected to different CATs penetration rates (PRs) and wheel wander regimes, and their pavement structural deterioration analyzed using the Texas Mechanistic-Empirical Asphalt Concrete Pavement Design and Analysis System (TxME) software. From this, maintenance frequencies and costs were determined. The study estimated delays and delay costs during TTM over a 20-year design period. Finally, initial investment, rehabilitation and delay costs were combined. It was found that the lowest life-cycle cost (LCC) of 19,091,470 pound occurred for high (80%) CAT PR operating under Standard D3M, whereas the highest LCC of 152,728,100 pound was also for high PR, but under Substandard D4M. Optimal LCC was found to change with different PRs. Hence cross-sections should be dynamically modifiable, given the anticipated gradual increase in PRs over time.

AB The robotic arms inside the EAST (Experimental Advanced Superconducting Tokamak) are bulky and slow, making them unable to efficiently complete remote handling tasks such as inspection and grasping. Miniature intelligent UAVs have the potential to assist in remote handling tasks. A key challenge is to achieve autonomous flight along a set trajectory within the EAST's vacuum vessel. This paper presents an autonomous UAV system with deep reinforcement learning for this purpose. The autonomous flight of a quadrotor UAV within the EAST was simulated using OpenAI Gym-style environment. To verify that the trained policy is transferable, we experimentally verified the trajectory tracking of UAVs along specific trajectories in real scenarios. The results show that our autonomous UAV system can complete trajectory-tracking flight tasks inside the EAST vacuum vessel.

Towards this end, in the present study, a fully autonomous UAV scenario is implemented, including the tasks of area scanning, target recognition, geo-location, monitoring, following and finally landing on a high speed moving platform. The underlying methodology includes AprilTag target identification through Graphics Processing Unit (GPU) parallelized processing, image processing and several optimized locations and approach algorithms employing gimbal movement, Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) readings and UAV navigation. For the experimentation, a commercial and a custom made quad-copter prototype were used, portraying a high and a low-computational embedded platform alternative. Among the successful targeting and follow procedures, it is shown that the landing approach can be successfully performed even under high platform speeds.

AB This paper presents a heuristic search technique performing collision avoidance for autonomous ships. Unlike collision avoidance systems of other unmanned vehicles, the collision avoidance system for autonomous ships aims not only at deriving a reasonable and safe path to the goal but also complying with COLREGs (International Regulations for Preventing Collisions at Sea). The heuristic search based on Bandler and Kohout's fuzzy relational products and an evaluation function representing heuristic information of domain experts is adopted to achieve the general purpose of collision avoidance that derives a reasonable and safe path. The rule of "action to avoid collision" stipulated in the COLREGs is used for the other necessary and sufficient condition and complies with the COLREGs. The proposed heuristic search is verified using scenarios which consider encounter situations classified in the COLREGs.

AB In this paper, we present a novel integrated vehicular system using collaborative unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) and unmanned ground vehicles (UGVs) for autonomous exploration, mapping, and navigation in GPS-denied 3-dimensional (3-D) unknown environments. The system implements a novel two-layered exploration strategy to decompose the perception task into a coarse exploration layer and a fine mapping layer. The coarse exploration makes use of a UGV to carry out fast autonomous exploration and active 2.5D simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) to generate a coarse environment model, which serves as a navigation reference for subsequent complementary 3-D fine mapping conducted by a UAV. The two layers share a novel optimized exploration path planning and navigation framework, which provides optimal exploration paths and integrates the collaborative exploration and mapping efforts through an OctoMap-based volumetric motion planning interface. The proposed system provides an efficient pipeline of fast environment perception taking advantages of the agility of the UAVs as well as the powerful computation resource aboard UGVs, also allowing assistive local perception with augmented object information when necessary. The effectiveness of our system is verified by both simulations and experiments, which demonstrate its capability of implementing heterogeneous UAV and UGV collaborative exploration and structural reconstruction of the environments through active SLAM, providing optimized perception for navigation tasks.

AB In the context of partial autonomy, where autonomous vehicles and humans share control of the vehicle, bringing out-of-the-loop drivers back into the loop is a significant challenge. While warning signal design guidelines are commonly used to provide alerts, few studies have examined each signal in depth with an emphasis on the autonomous environment. This study aims to fill this gap by investigating visual, auditory, and tactile stimuli and modifying their sub-attributes to explore variations related to age, gender, and other individual backgrounds. For this objective, the research examined the correlations between age, gender, and individual backgrounds with reaction times to TOR signals, investigating the effects of sub-attribute variations on participants' responses and exploring the subjective evaluations of the signals. A driving simulator was utilized to create a realistic driving environment and measure participants' reaction times in takeover request situations. Analysis of the data revealed correlations between age and reaction times for auditory and tactile signals, with interaction effects observed between age and sub-attribute intensity. Additionally, participants exhibited varying reaction time patterns in response to different sub-attribute intensities. By evaluating individual differences in perception based on modality characteristics, often overlooked in prior research, this study serves as a foundational contribution to future research in the field.

DE traffic accident; ADAS; AEBS; PC-Crash; simulation
AB As smart cities become a global topic, interest in smart mobility, the core of smart cities, is also growing. The technology that comes closest to general users is "autonomous driving". In particular, the successful market entry and establishment of some private companies proved that "autonomous driving" is not technology of the future but imminent reality. However, safety in autonomous vehicles that rely on sensors instead of the driver's five senses has been the focus of attention from the beginning and continues to be so. In this study, we attempted to counter this interest. Based on the actual data of thirty traffic accidents, assuming the AEBS (Autonomous Emergency Braking System) was installed to assist the driver in safe driving, it was reinterpreted through simulation to see what changes occurred in the accident. In the computer program, PC-Crash, the results were first analyzed through simulation using Euro NCAP (New Car Assessment Program)'s AEBS test standards. Subsequently, the other variables in the AEBS were controlled and the accident was reinterpreted by changing only the angle of the radar detection sensor. As a result, it was confirmed that a total of 27 accidents out of thirty accidents could have been prevented with the AEBS. In addition, it proved that the crash avoidance rate of vehicles gradually increased as the radar angle increased.

AB In this article, a prescribed time output feedback 3-D stabilization control scheme is proposed for unmanned underwater vehicles. Considering the problem of unmeasurable velocities, unknown hydrodynamic parameters, and external underwater perturbations, we construct a prescribed time extended state observer (PTESO) for the unmanned underwater vehicles based on a time-varying scaling function that can estimate the linear and angular velocities as well as unknown nonlinearities within a preset time. Then, a novel prescribed time output feedback controller is developed for the unmanned underwater vehicles with the aid of PTESO, which exhibits a simplified structure and allows for advance specification of the prescribed time. By using Lyapunov stability theory, it is strictly proven that the stabilization error converges to zero within a prescribed time. Finally, an experimental test is carried out on an open-frame unmanned underwater vehicle to verify the effectiveness of the proposed scheme.

AB In this paper, we propose a distributed model predictive control strategy for a team of vehicles moving in an unknown obstacle scenario. In particular, we combine receding horizon control arguments with leader-follower formations in order to design a flexible architecture where the vehicle topology, if needed, can be rearranged to better cope with the presence of obstacles. Each vehicle is equipped with an ad-hoc dual-mode controller in charge of tracking along the leader-follower chain the predecessor vehicle (namely the target for the leader) and ensuring absence of collisions. Moreover, whenever the leader recognizes that the obstacle scenario obstructs its navigation, the current formation is properly reconfigured by preserving recursive feasibility and obstacle avoidance properties. Final numerical results on a team of seven point mobile robots are instrumental to show the main features of the proposed distributed model predictive control algorithm.

ID CLASSIFICATION; EVOLUTION; SARS
AB Background This paper aims to move the debate forward regarding the potential for artificial intelligence (AI) and autonomous robotic surgery with a particular focus on ethics, regulation and legal aspects (such as civil law, international law, tort law, liability, medical malpractice, privacy and product/device legislation, among other aspects). Methods We conducted an intensive literature search on current or emerging AI and autonomous technologies (eg, vehicles), military and medical technologies (eg, surgical robots), relevant frameworks and standards, cyber security/safety- and legal-systems worldwide. We provide a discussion on unique challenges for robotic surgery faced by proposals made for AI more generally (eg, Explainable AI) and machine learning more specifically (eg, black box), as well as recommendations for developing and improving relevant frameworks or standards. Conclusion We classify responsibility into the following: (1) Accountability; (2) Liability; and (3) Culpability. All three aspects were addressed when discussing responsibility for AI and autonomous surgical robots, be these civil or military patients (however, these aspects may require revision in cases where robots become citizens). The component which produces the least clarity is Culpability, since it is unthinkable in the current state of technology. We envision that in the near future a surgical robot can learn and perform routine operative tasks that can then be supervised by a human surgeon. This represents a surgical parallel to autonomously driven vehicles. Here a human remains in the 'driving seat' as a 'doctor-in-the-loop' thereby safeguarding patients undergoing operations that are supported by surgical machines with autonomous capabilities.

AB Efficiently predicting high-resolution and accurate flow fields through networked autonomous marine vehicles (AMVs) is crucial for diverse applications. Nonetheless, a research gap exists in the seamless integration of data-driven flow modeling, real-time data assimilation from flow sensing, and the optimization of AMVs' sensing strategies, culminating in a closed-loop dynamic data-driven application system (DDDAS). This article presents a novel DDDAS that systematically integrates flow modeling, data assimilation, and adaptive flow sensing using networked AMVs. It features a hybrid data-driven flow model, uniting a neural network for trend prediction and a Gaussian process model for residual fitting. The neural network architecture is designed using knowledge extracted from historic flow data through tidal harmonic analysis, enhancing its capability in flow prediction. The Kriged ensemble transform Kalman filter is introduced to assimilate spatially correlated flow-sensing data from AMVs, enabling effective model learning and accurate spatiotemporal flow prediction, while forming the basis for optimizing AMVs' flow-sensing paths. A receding horizon strategy is proposed to implement non-myopic optimal path planning, and a distributed strategy of implementing Monte Carlo tree search is proposed to solve the resulting large-scale tree searching-based optimization problem. Computer simulations, employing underwater gliders as sensing networks, demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed DDDAS in predicting depth-averaged flow in nearshore ocean environments.

AB This paper introduces a robust adaptive path-tracking control scheme via a predicted interval approach for safe autonomous driving tasks under uncertainties. Specifically, a recursive least squares-based set-membership mechanism is firstly designed to estimate a bounding set of acceptable values to depict the uncertain parameters. Based on the estimated system parameters, an interval predictor is deployed to improve the prediction accuracy in the primary control action design. Successively, the unconstrained output feedback-based robust controller is proposed to yield the closed-loop system stabilization by utilizing predicted interval output only. Meanwhile, a model predictive control technique is conceived from solving an optimization problem that is given in the interval predictor to ensure robust constraint satisfaction. The recursive feasibility of the controlled system is theoretically analyzed by applying the nonconservative Lyapunov function with a novel structure and the closed-loop system possesses the input-to-state stability criteria. Finally, simulation results are provided to verify the efficacy of the presented strategy under various intricate scenarios. The results show that the suggested controller always maintains its cross-tracking error and longitudinal velocity error at the lowest level even in the most challenging weather scenario.

TI What influences attitudes about artificial intelligence adoption:
   Evidence from US local officials
SO PLOS ONE

ID ACCEPTANCE; OPINION; SYSTEMS; NEWS
AB Rapid advances in machine learning and related techniques have increased optimism about self-driving cars, autonomous surgery, and other uses of artificial intelligence (AI). But adoption of these technologies is not simply a matter of breakthroughs in the design and training of algorithms. Regulators around the world will have to make a litany of choices about law and policy surrounding AI. To advance knowledge of how they will make these choices, we draw on a unique survey pool-690 local officials in the United States-a representative sample of U.S. local officials. These officials will make many of the decisions about AI adoption, from government use to regulation, given the decentralized structure of the United States. The results show larger levels of support for autonomous vehicles than autonomous surgery. Moreover, those that used ridesharing apps prior to the COVID-19 pandemic are significantly more supportive of autonomous vehicles. We also find that self-reported familiarity with AI is correlated with increased approval of AI uses in a variety of areas, including facial recognition, natural disaster impact planning, and even military surveillance. Related, those who expressed greater opposition to AI adoption also appear more concerned about trade-offs between privacy and information and bias in algorithms. Finally, the explanatory logic used by respondents varies based on gender and prior experience with AI, which we demonstrate with quantitative text analysis.

AB State estimation is a fundamental necessity for any application involving autonomous robots. This paper describes a visual-aided inertial navigation and mapping system for application to autonomous robots. The system, which relies on Kalman filtering, is designed to fuse the measurements obtained from a monocular camera, an inertial measurement unit (IMU) and a position sensor (GPS). The estimated state consists of the full state of the vehicle: the position, orientation, their first derivatives and the parameter errors of the inertial sensors (i.e., the bias of gyroscopes and accelerometers). The system also provides the spatial locations of the visual features observed by the camera. The proposed scheme was designed by considering the limited resources commonly available in small mobile robots, while it is intended to be applied to cluttered environments in order to perform fully vision-based navigation in periods where the position sensor is not available. Moreover, the estimated map of visual features would be suitable for multiple tasks: i) terrain analysis; ii) three-dimensional (3D) scene reconstruction; iii) localization, detection or perception of obstacles and generating trajectories to navigate around these obstacles; and iv) autonomous exploration. In this work, simulations and experiments with real data are presented in order to validate and demonstrate the performance of the proposal.

AB Updated concrete construction robots are designed to optimize equipment operation, improve safety, enhance workspace awareness, and further ensure a proper working environment for construction workers. The importance of concrete construction robots has been constantly highlighted, as they have a profound impact on construction quality and efficiency. Autonomous vehicle driving monitoring has been widely employed in concrete construction robots; however, they lack clear relevance to the key functions in the building process. This paper aims to bridge this knowledge gap by systematically classifying and summarizing the existing concrete construction robots, analyzing their existing problems, and providing direction for their future development. The prescription criteria and selection of robots depend on the concrete construction process, which includes six common functional levels: distribution, leveling and compaction, floor finishing, surface painting, 3D printing, and surveillance. Misunderstood functions and the improper adjustment of construction robots may lead to increased cost, reduced effectiveness, and restricted application scenarios. Our review identifies current commercial and recently studied concrete construction robots to facilitate the standardization and optimization of robotic construction design. Moreover, this study may be able to guide future research and technology development efforts for autonomous robots in concrete construction.

AB Providing mobile robots with autonomous capabilities is advantageous. It allows one to dispense with the intervention of human operators, which may prove beneficial in economic and safety terms. Autonomy requires, in most cases, the use of path planners that enable the robot to deliberate about how to move from its location at one moment to another. Looking for the most appropriate path planning algorithm according to the requirements imposed by users can be challenging, given the overwhelming number of approaches that exist in the literature. Moreover, the past review works analyzed here cover only some of these approaches, missing important ones. For this reason, our paper aims to serve as a starting point for a clear and comprehensive overview of the research to date. It introduces a global classification of path planning algorithms, with a focus on those approaches used along with autonomous ground vehicles, but is also extendable to other robots moving on surfaces, such as autonomous boats. Moreover, the models used to represent the environment, together with the robot mobility and dynamics, are also addressed from the perspective of path planning. Each of the path planning categories presented in the classification is disclosed and analyzed, and a discussion about their applicability is added at the end.

AB While commercially available AUVs are routinely used in survey missions, a new set of applications exist which clearly demand intervention capabilities. The maintenance of permanent underwater observatories, submerged oil wells, cabled sensor networks, pipes and the deployment and recovery of benthic stations are a few of them. These tasks are addressed nowadays using manned submersibles or work-class ROVs, equipped with teleoperated arms under human supervision. Although researchers have recently opened the door to future I-AUVs, a long path is still necessary to achieve autonomous underwater interventions. This paper reviews the evolution timeline in autonomous underwater intervention systems. Milestone projects in the state of the art are reviewed, highlighting their principal contributions to the field. To the best of the authors' knowledge, only three vehicles have demonstrated some autonomous intervention capabilities so far: ALIVE, SAUVIM and GIRONA 500, being the last one the lightest one. In this paper GIRONA 500 I-AUV is presented and its software architecture discussed. Recent results in different scenarios are reported: (I) valve turning and connector plugging/unplugging while docked to a subsea panel, (2) free floating valve turning using learning by demonstration, and (3) multipurpose free-floating object recovery. The paper ends discussing the lessons learned so far. (C) 2015 International Federation of Automatic Control. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB To improve the usability of cooperative adaptive cruise control (CACC) in the mixed traffic, a CACC algorithm with unconnected vehicle in the loop (CACCu) is proposed. Unlike the traditional CACC that requires a connected preceding vehicle or otherwise degrades to adaptive cruise control (ACC), CACCu aims to closely follow an unconnected preceding vehicle utilizing the information from the further (connected) preceding vehicle. Moreover, CACCu can robustly maintain string stability given various behaviors of unconnected preceding vehicles, without requiring identification process or extra information on the unconnected vehicles. For the sake of simplicity, this paper starts with CACCu in the three-vehicle sandwich scenario (i.e., one unconnected vehicle is in between of two connected vehicles), but derivatively, this control design is extended and evaluated in multiple-unconnected-vehicle cases. It is proven that by attaching a filter of "virtual preceding vehicle" to the original feedforward filter, the CACCu vehicle can stay string-stable at a gap significantly shorter than that required by ACC, given almost all kinds of car-following behaviors of the unconnected vehicle. At last, the favorable properties of CACCu are validated in high-fidelity simulations using real vehicle trajectory data and a physics-based vehicle dynamics model. The results show that CACCu outperforms existing ACC and acceleration-based connected cruise control (CCC) in string stability, ride comfort, safety maintenance, and fuel consumption.

TI Intersection Control Optimization for Automated Vehicles Using Genetic

ID TRAJECTORY DESIGN
AB With wireless communication and autonomous vehicle control capabilities, automated vehicle technology has the potential to improve the performance of an intersection. The objective of this research was to develop an intersection control algorithm that can jointly optimize the system performance and the trajectory of every single vehicle. An optimization algorithm was developed for a four-approach intersection with the consideration of turning movements and a full set of possible phases under a 100% automated vehicle environment. The intersection controller makes decisions on the vehicle passing sequence using a genetic algorithm-based optimization method, and at the same time it calculates the optimal vehicle trajectories. The optimization process repeats over a time horizon to process continually arriving vehicles. The performance of the proposed algorithm was assessed in various scenario-based simulation experiments and the results were compared with the actuated signal control. It was concluded that the proposed algorithm is able to reduce the intersection average travel time delay by 16.3% to 79.3%, depending on the demand scenario.

ID LOCALIZATION; GPS
AB This paper presents a new real-time heading estimation method for an all-wheel steered single-articulated autonomous vehicle guided by a magnetic marker system. To achieve good guidance control for the vehicle, precise estimation of the position and heading angle during travel is necessary. The main concept of this study is to estimate the heading angle from the relative orientations of the magnetic markers and the vehicle motion. To achieve this, a kinematic model of the all-wheel steered vehicle is derived and combined with the motion of a magnetic ruler mounted near each axle underneath the vehicle. The position coordinates and polarities of the magnetic markers, which are provided a priori, are used to determine the vehicle position at every detection instance. A gyroscope is employed to assist real-time heading estimation at sample times when there are no marker detection data. The proposed method was tested on a real vehicle and evaluated by comparing the experimental results with those of the differential global positioning system (DGPS) in real-time kinematics (RTK) mode. Experimental results show that the proposed method exhibits good performance for heading estimation.

AB This paper focus on a distributed method for three-dimensional flow field estimation using multiple autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs). In this method, direct measurements of local flow velocity are not required and cooperation between AUVs is considered. In this paper, the flow field estimation is formulated as an inverse problem that solves a system of nonlinear equations and we propose a tree -based distributed algorithm to solve the above equations, in which we only require the communication network among AUVs to be connected. The tree structure allows for passage of solution estimates within the network, and through dispersion and pooling stages of the algorithm, the flow field parameters are finally estimated. The convergence of the distributed algorithm is strictly proved. Finally, simulations in simulated and real flow datasets are provided to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed distributed method.(c) 2023 Published by Elsevier B.V.

AB This paper presents the design of two predefined-time active fault-tolerant controllers for the trajectory tracking of autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) which can address actuator faults without causing actuator saturation. The first controller offers improved steady-state trajectory tracking precision, while the second ensures a nonsingular property. Firstly, a predefined-time sliding mode controller is formulated based on a predefined-time disturbance observer by integrating a novel predefined-time auxiliary system to prevent the control input from exceeding the actuator's physical limitations. Subsequently, a non-singular backstepping controller is introduced to circumvent potential singularities in the sliding mode controller, guaranteeing that the trajectory tracking error is uniformly ultimately bounded (UUB) within the predefined time. Additionally, theoretical analysis and simulation results are presented to illustrate the advantages of the proposed method.

AB For self-driving systems or autonomous vehicles (AVs), accurate lane-level localization is a important for performing complex driving maneuvers. Classical GNSS-based methods are usually not accurate enough to have lane-level localization to support the AV's maneuvers. LiDAR-based localization can provide accurate localization. However, the price of LiDARs is still one of the big issues preventing this kind of solution from becoming wide-spread commodity. Therefore, in this work, we propose a low-cost solution for lane-level localization using a vision-based system and a low-cost GPS to achieve high precision lane-level localization. Experiments in real-world and real-time demonstrate that the proposed method achieves good lane-level localization accuracy, outperforming solutions based on only GPS.

AB This article addresses the problem of three-dimensional path following control for underactuated autonomous underwater vehicles in the presence of ocean current. Firstly, three-dimensional path following error model was established based on virtual guidance method. The control law is developed by building virtual velocity errors and backstepping method, which can simplify the virtual control input and avoid the singular problem induced by initial state constraints. Considering the curvature and torsion characteristics of the three-dimensional desired path, the approaching angle is introduced to guarantee fast convergence of error. Nonlinear damping term is introduced to offset the effects of dynamic uncertainties and external disturbances. The controller stability was proved by Lyapunov stable theory. Finally, simulations were conducted and the results indicate the effectiveness and robustness to parameter uncertainties and external disturbances of the proposed approach.

AB The Autonomous Underwater Vehicle (AUV) Auiosub-1 made observations of the sea surface with an upward-looking echosounder during fish surveys in the vicinity of Shetland and Orkney (North Sea) in July 1999. Echograms from the AUV contained vertical traces extending downwards from the sea surface that were caused by diving seabirds. Visual observations provided evidence that those seabirds were Northern Cannets Sula bassana. Analysis of trace extent suggests a mean dive depth of 19.7 m (n = 19, SD = 7.5). Data on gannet diving depths are sparse, but this value is somewhat deeper than that accepted for the related Cafe Gannet (Morus capensis, mean 5.9 m) which has been used in foraging models for the Northern Gannet. These observations have implications for our understanding of the foraging capabilities of gannets, and the interactions of gannets with commercially targeted fish species.

AB Hybrid propulsion in underwater vehicles is the new idea of combining conventional propulsion systems such as screw propellers with other kinds of propulsion like oscillating biomimetic fins, glider wings or jet thrusters. Each of these propulsion systems has its own benefits and drawbacks, and the goal is to have them complement each other in certain conditions. This paper covers the topic of a dynamic model of the pitch and heave motion of the HUUV (hybrid unmanned underwater vehicle) using screw propellers and biomimetic lateral fins. Firstly, the simulation model of the vehicle performing depth and pitch change is presented. Secondly, the vehicle's hydrodynamic coefficients obtained from CFD simulations are discussed. Thirdly, the results of the HUUV experimental studies in a swimming pool are presented. Lastly, simulation results are compared with those of the experiment to verify the correctness of the model. The vehicle's motion in the swimming pool during the experiments was recorded using a submerged camcorder and then analysed using the Tracker software.

AB An intelligent and autonomous flight control system for an atmospheric re-entry vehicle is investigated, based on fuzzy logic control and aerodynamic inversion computation. A common PD-Mamdani fuzzy logic controller is designed for all the five re-entry flight regions characterized by different actuator configurations. A linear transformation to the controller inputs is applied to tune the controller performance for different flight regions while using the same fuzzy rule base and inference engine. Ail autonomous actuator allocation algorithm is developed, based on the aerodynamic inversion computation, to cover all the five actuator configurations with the same fuzzy logic controller. Simulation results of tracking both a bench mark trajectory and a given nominal re-entry trajectory are presented to evaluate the control performance. (C) 2003 Elsevier Science Ltd.

AB Self-driving safety is one of the major concerns raised with regard to pushing the use of automated vehicles on roads. Fully automated vehicles are forced to make appropriate decisions in an uncertain environment where driverless and human-driven vehicles share the road together. This study proposes a new model that can be used to enhance the autonomous driving behavior at a non-signalized intersection considering the traffic safety guarantee, delay time, and smooth driving. The proposed model is called the responsibility-sensitive safety-based partially observable Markov decision process model for the decision-making mechanism of automated vehicles. The model not only increases traffic safety guarantee and smooth driving, but also reduces the delay time. First, we generate some specific driving scenarios using the automated driving toolbox in MATLAB. Second, the driving strategy of automated vehicles is optimized by the partially observable Markov decision process framework using the adaptive cruise control system. Finally, the responsibility-sensitive safety algorithm is implemented under adaptive model predictive control. The proposed model performs better than the classical adaptive model predictive control. In the best case, the proposed model took a 31.60 % reduction in braking time and a 51.20 % improvement in smoothing speed control.

AB Trajectory planning for autonomous cars can be addressed by primitive-based methods, which encode nonlinear dynamical system behavior into automata. In this paper, we focus on optimal trajectory planning. Since, typically, multiple criteria have to be taken into account, multiobjective optimization problems have to be solved. For the resulting Pareto-optimal motion primitives, we introduce a universal automaton, which can be reduced or reconfigured according to prioritized criteria during planning. We evaluate a corresponding multi-vehicle planning scenario with both simulations and laboratory experiments.

AB Path planning is one of the key parts of unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) fast autonomous flight in cluttered environments. However, it remains a challenge to efficiently generate a high-quality trajectory for flight tasks with a high success rate. In this paper, a robust planning framework is proposed, which can stably support autonomous flight tasks in complex unknown environments with limited onboard computing resources. Firstly, we propose the directed frontier point information structure (DFP), which can roughly capture the frontier information of the explored environment. The planning direction of a local planner can be evaluated and rectified efficiently based on the DFP to avoid falling into traps with limited cost. Secondly, an adaptive fusion replanning method is designed to generate a high-quality trajectory efficiently by incorporating two optimization methods with different characteristics, which can both take advantage of different optimization methods while avoiding disadvantages as much as possible, but also adjust the focus of the optimization according to the actual situation to improve the success rate of the planning method. Finally, sufficient comparison and evaluation experiments in simulation environments are presented. Experimental results show the proposed method has better performance, especially in terms of adaptability and robustness, compared to typical and state-of-the-art methods in unknown complex scenarios. Moreover, the proposed system is integrated into a fully autonomous quadrotor, and the effectiveness of the proposed method is further evaluated by using the quadrotor in real-world environments.

AB The development of autonomous, energy efficient, underwater robots for large areas exploration has been attracting many researchers, since their use can be effective in several applications. In order to improve the propulsion efficiency, movement capability and situation awareness, last studies have been directed on biomimetic robots. Over millions of years in a vast and often hostile realm, fish have evolved swimming capabilities far superior in many ways to what has been achieved by nautical technology. Instinctively, they use their superbly streamlined bodies to exploit fluid-mechanical principles, achieving extraordinary propulsion efficiencies, acceleration and manoeuvrability. Their solutions achieved the best performances based on aspects like preys hunting and living conditions. Looking at nature for inspiration as to how design an Autonomous Underwater Vehicle can significantly improve its flexibility and efficiency. This paper presents an examination of the state of the art on biomimetic robotic fishes, underlining the reasons why bio-inspiration can be a winning move and discussing how fish swimming can be the line of sight of the future locomotion technology. The paper concludes with a novel mechanism proposal, designed to produce optimal oscillatory motion between the flexible parts constituting the hull of the robotic fish.

AB Programming autonomous systems can be challenging because many programming decisions must be made in real time and under stressful conditions, such as on a battle field, during a short communication window, or during a storm at sea. As such, new programming designs are needed to reflect these specific and extreme challenges.
   Trilobite(G) is a programming architecture for buoyancy-driven autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs), called gliders. Gliders are designed to spend weeks to months in the ocean, where they operate fully autonomously while submerged and can only communicate via satellite during their limited time at the surface. Based on the experience gained from a seven year long collaboration with two oceanographic institutes, the Trilobite(G) architecture has been developed with the main goal of enabling users to run more effective missions. The Trilobite(G) programming environment consists of a domain-specific language called ALGAE, a lower level service layer, and a set of real-time and faster-than-real-time simulators. The system has been used to program novel and robust glider behaviors, as well as to find software problems that otherwise may have remained undetected, with potentially catastrophic results. We believe that Trilobite(G) can serve as a blueprint for other autonomous systems as well, and that Trilobite(G) will motivate and enable a broader scientific community to work on extreme, realworld problems by using the simulation infrastructure.

AB Autonomous take-off and landing are essential to perform continuous missions of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) using drone stations. Generally, this is impossible to land on the drone station only using a global positioning system (GPS) because of sensor errors. This paper deals with the vision-based autonomous precision landing of UAV using fiducial markers. To improve landing accuracy, an image sensor attached to the bottom of the UAV and a ground-based fiducial marker is commonly used. However, if the fiducial marker is not recognized in the image frame, the guidance value cannot be calculated and it is impossible to land on the fiducial marker. To overcome this, we applied an image filter and Kalman filter to the algorithm for fiducial-marker recognition, and we used the calculated position and orientation data of fiducial markers as landing guidance values. To verify the developed algorithm and landing stability, a software-in-the-loop simulation and flight test were performed, resulting in a landing position error up to a radius of 2.70 cm with heading root mean square error (RMSE) of 1.4393 & DEG; in simulation, and within a radius of 9.470 cm with a heading RMSE of 2.3152 & DEG; in flight tests with disturbances. Thus, we confirmed that a stable and accurate landing is possible using the proposed algorithm and fiducial markers.

AB The capacity for autonomous functionality serves as the fundamental ability and driving force for the cross-generational upgrading of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs). With the disruptive transformation of artificial intelligence technology, autonomous trajectory planning based on intelligent algorithms has emerged as a key technique for enhancing UAVs' capacity for autonomous behavior, thus holding significant research value. To address the challenges of UAV trajectory planning in complex 3D environments, this paper proposes a multi-UAV cooperative trajectory-planning method based on a Modified Cheetah Optimization (MCO) algorithm. Firstly, a spatiotemporal cooperative trajectory planning model is established, incorporating UAV-cooperative constraints and performance constraints. Evaluation criteria, including fuel consumption, altitude, and threat distribution field cost functions, are introduced. Then, based on its parent Cheetah Optimization (CO) algorithm, the MCO algorithm incorporates a logistic chaotic mapping strategy and an adaptive search agent strategy, thereby improving the home-returning mechanism. Finally, extensive simulation experiments are conducted using a considerably large test dataset containing functions with the following four characteristics: unimodal, multimodal, separable, and inseparable. Meanwhile, a strategy for dimensionality reduction searching is employed to solve the problem of autonomous trajectory planning in real-world scenarios. The results of a conducted simulation demonstrate that the MCO algorithm outperforms several other related algorithms, showcasing smaller trajectory costs, a faster convergence speed, and stabler performance. The proposed algorithm exhibits a certain degree of correctness, effectiveness, and advancement in solving the problem of multi-UAV cooperative trajectory planning.

AB The Monterey Bay Aquarium Research Institute (MBARI, Moss Landing, CA) has developed a 54-cm-diameter (21-in) docking AUV and companion docking station. This program resulted in four consecutive successful autonomous homing and docking events in the open ocean, which included downloading data, uploading a new mission plan, recharging the battery, and complete power cycling of the AUV. We describe the design, simulation, and at-sea test of the homing and docking control system.

AB Vehicle-to-vehicle communication enables inter-vehicle interactions by sending a message or exchanging data. So a vehicle is affected not only by the ones in front but also by the ones behind. The mutual influence changes the feature of traffic flow from the anisotropy to the isotropy. In this paper, I model vehicle interactions by a stochastic game and formulate the isotropic flow in lane-based traffic by a kinetic approach. Specifically, a scalar variable, called the cooperation willingness, is introduced, which may evolve as time passes. Also, I formulate a mapping between the cooperation willingness and the cooperation probability. I embed the cooperation probability into the stochastic game. Also, a general expression of the evolution equation of cooperation willingness is derived. The equilibrium solutions for a given choice of five and seven discrete classes of the cooperation willingness are solved. Finally, the proposed kinetic model of the isotropic lane-based traffic flow is used to simulate the merging of two clusters of vehicles. The results show that the nudging of vehicles ahead can improve the efficiency of traffic flow. It also confirms the theoretical analysis results.

DE Autonomous driving; 3D object detection; multimodal fusion
ID MULTIOBJECT TRACKING; LIDAR
AB Autonomous vehicles require constant environmental perception to obtain the distribution of obstacles to achieve safe driving. Specifically, 3D object detection is a vital functional module as it can simultaneously predict surrounding objects' categories, locations, and sizes. Generally, autonomous vehicles are equipped with multiple sensors, including cameras and LiDARs. The fact that single-modal methods suffer from unsatisfactory detection performance motivates utilizing multiple modalities as inputs to compensate for single sensor faults. Although many multi-modal fusion detection algorithms exist, there is still a lack of comprehensive and in-depth analysis of these methods to clarify how to fuse multi-modal data effectively. Therefore, this paper surveys recent advancements in fusion detection methods. First, we present the broad background of multi-modal 3D object detection and identify the characteristics of widely used datasets along with their evaluation metrics. Second, instead of the traditional classification method of early, middle, and late fusion, we categorize and analyze all fusion methods from three aspects: feature representation, alignment, and fusion, which reveals how these fusion methods are implemented in an essential way. Third, we provide an in-depth comparison of their pros and cons and compare their performance in mainstream datasets. Finally, we further summarize current challenges and research trends for realizing the full potential of multi-modal 3D object detection.

AB The paper introduces novel families of cruise controllers for autonomous vehicles on lane-free ringroads. The design of the cruise controllers is based on a Control Lyapunov Function methodology with the Lyapunov function expressed on measures of the energy of the system with the kinetic energy expressed in ways similar to Newtonian or relativistic mechanics. The derived feedback laws (cruise controllers) are decentralized (per vehicle), as each vehicle determines its control input based on: (i) its own state; (ii) either only the distance from adjacent vehicles (inviscid cruise controllers) or the state of adjacent vehicles (viscous cruise controllers); and (iii) its distance from the boundaries of the ring-road. A detailed analysis of the differences and similarities between lane-free straight-roads and lane-free ring-roads is also presented. (c) 2023 The Franklin Institute. Published by Elsevier Inc.

Intelligent transportation systems (ITS) will support more efficient vehicular traffic flow, increased vehicular and pedestrian safety, and, eventually, autonomous driving. Wireless communications is fundamental for enabling ITS, and recent advances in communications technology and systems support establishing reliable wireless links and networks among cars, cars and pedestrians, and cars and fixed infrastructure. The success of ITS will be measured in terms of how well it can scale to the ever-increasing mobility application scenarios and harsh environmental conditions. Research and development is ongoing to make vehicle-to-everything (V2X) systems more reliable and more secure for providing safety-critical applications.

AB The ability of airships to fly in hover is a major plus of this category of flying vehicles. However, especially for the case of autonomous flight, this feature can be exploited only recurring to a carefully designed layout of the thrusters on board. Furthermore, the thrusters need to be suitably governed by a dedicated control algorithm. This paper explores a scheme for the control in hover of a thrust-controlled airship without thrust vector control, also assessing its effectiveness in near-hover positioning problems. The control scheme proposed herein extends the capability of a stability augmentation and guidance controller for forward flight, previously introduced by the authors for a conceptually similar airship. A control action based on a system of thrust forces required for hover, and additional thrust components for stabilizing and steering the airship in slow (near-hover) navigation, is thoroughly described. The ensuing control suite is applied and tested in the present paper on the high-fidelity virtual model of a five-thruster airship, showing reasonable stability levels and navigation accuracy of the controlled system.

AB Autonomous soaring has the potential to greatly improve both the range and endurance of small robotic aircraft. This paper describes an autonomous soaring system that generates a dynamic map of lift sources (thermals) in the environment and uses this map for online flight planning and decision making. Components of the autonomy algorithm include thermal mapping, explore/exploit decision making, navigation, optimal airspeed computation, thermal centering control, and energy state estimation. A finite state machine manages the aircraft behavior during flight and determines when changing behavior is appropriate. A complete system to enable autonomous soaring is described with special attention paid to practical considerations encountered during flight testing. A companion paper describes the hardware implementation of this system and the results of a flight test campaign conducted at Aberdeen Proving Ground in September 2015.

AB Curve-tracking control is challenging and fundamental in many robotic applications for an autonomous agent to follow a desired path. In this paper, we consider a particle, representing a fully actuated autonomous robot, moving at unit speed under steering control in the three-dimensional (3D) space. We develop a feedback control law that enables the particle to track any smooth curve in the 3D space. Representing the 3D curve in the natural Frenet frame, we construct the control law under which the moving direction of the particle will be aligned with the tangent direction of the desired curve and the distance between the particle and the desired curve will converge to zero. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed 3D curve-tracking control law in simulations.

AB Electric vehicles (EVs) are being rapidly adopted due to their economic and societal benefits. Autonomous mobility-on-demand (AMoD) systems also embrace this trend. However, the long charging time and high recharging frequency of EVs pose challenges to efficiently managing EV AMoD systems. The complicated dynamic charging and mobility process of EV AMoD systems makes the demand and supply uncertainties significant when designing vehicle balancing algorithms. In this work, we design a data-driven distributionally robust optimization (DRO) approach to balance EVs for both the mobility service and the charging process. The optimization goal is to minimize the worst-case expected cost under both passenger mobility demand uncertainties and EV supply uncertainties. We then propose a novel distributional uncertainty sets construction algorithm that guarantees the produced parameters are contained in desired confidence regions with a given probability. To solve the proposed DRO AMoD EV balancing problem, we derive an equivalent computationally tractable convex optimization problem. Based on real-world EV data of a taxi system, we show that with our solution the average total balancing cost is reduced by 14.49%, and the average mobility fairness and charging fairness are improved by 15.78% and 34.51%, respectively, compared to solutions that do not consider uncertainties.

ID DYNAMIC WINDOW APPROACH; ROBOT NAVIGATION; MOBILE
AB Safe unmanned ground vehicle navigation in unknown rough terrain is crucial for various tasks such as exploration, search and rescue and agriculture. Offline global planning is often not possible when operating in harsh, unknown environments, and therefore, online local planning must be used. Most online rough terrain local planners require heavy computational resources, used for optimal trajectory searching and estimating vehicle orientation in positions within the range of the sensors. In this work, we present a deep reinforcement learning approach for local planning in unknown rough terrain with zero-range to local-range sensing, achieving superior results compared to potential fields or local motion planning search spaces methods. Our approach includes reward shaping which provides a dense reward signal. We incorporate self-attention modules into our deep reinforcement learning architecture in order to increase the explainability of the learnt policy. The attention modules provide insight regarding the relative importance of sensed inputs during training and planning. We extend and validate our approach in a dynamic simulation, demonstrating successful safe local planning in environments with a continuous terrain and a variety of discrete obstacles. By adding the geometric transformation between two successive timesteps and the corresponding action as inputs, our architecture is able to navigate on surfaces with different levels of friction.

ID TRAJECTORY GENERATION
AB The task of trajectory design of autonomous vehicles is typically two-fold. First, it needs to take into account the intrinsic dynamics of the vehicle, which are sometimes termed local constraints. Second, on a higher level, the designed trajectories must allow the vehicle to achieve some application-specific task. The specification of the task results in the so-called global constraints. Both of these two components of trajectory design are generally nontrivial problems, and very often, they are pursued as two parallel areas. When the results drawn from the two areas are applied in conjunction, the synthesis is usually somewhat arbitrary.
   In this paper, we assume that some optimal control laws are available as a set of motion primitives to address the vehicle dynamics. The trajectories that achieve the task are determined solely through the primitives and do not reference the vehicle dynamics directly. For the higher level, we translate the task into a very special type of cost-to-go function, which is partially specified artificially and partially determined by an admissibility condition imposed by the set of primitives. The optimality feature of the primitives is formally extended to the final trajectory design. We illustrate this result with the example of a mobile robot retrieving an object, which is an interesting problem of its own fight. Both a direct design approach and a learning approach are presented. (C) 2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

ID OPTIMIZATION
AB The growth of autonomous vehicles, ridesharing systems, and self-driving technology will bring a shift in the way ride hailing platforms plan out their services. However, these advances in technology coupled with road congestion, environmental concerns, fuel usage, vehicles emissions, and the high cost of the vehicle usage have brought more attention to better utilize the use of vehicles and their capacities. In this paper, we propose a novel distributed multi-hop ride-sharing (MHRS) algorithm that uses deep reinforcement learning to learn optimal vehicle dispatch and matching decisions by interacting with the external environment. By allowing customers to transfer between vehicles, i.e., ride with one vehicle for some time and then transfer to another one, MHRS helps in attaining 30% lower cost and 20% more efficient utilization of fleets, as compared to the ride-sharing algorithms. This flexibility of multi-hop feature gives a seamless experience to customers and ride-sharing companies, and thus improves ride-sharing services.

DT Article
ID DECISION-MAKING
AB In this article, we present the concept of cooperative autonomous driving using mirror neuron inspired intention awareness and cooperative perception, whose primary benefit is to enable cooperative autonomous driving in a more general approach rather than complicated rule-based approaches. The cooperative perception can provide information on the upcoming traffic situations ahead, even beyond line-of-sight and field-of-view. From a control perspective, a spatial map for navigation planning is extended up to the boundary of connected vehicles in a see-through manner. By leveraging this augmented perception capability, a better driving decision can be accomplished in terms of traffic flow efficiency and safety improvement. For this purpose, we propose a mirror neuron inspired intention awareness algorithm along with planning and control methods for cooperative autonomous driving. We demonstrate the feasibility of our proposals through simulations and experiments on the road with a cooperative lane changing scenario.

AB In this paper, we aim to exploit an effective way to solve the output multi-formation tracking problem of the networked autonomous surface vehicles (ASVs) in a fast fixed time manner. Specifically, addressing the output multi-formation tracking problem implies that 1) the networked ASVs are divided into multiple interconnected subnetworks with respect to multiple targets; 2) for each subnetwork, the outputs of the networked ASVs form a desired geometric formation with exchanging the local interactions. Besides, solving the fast fixed-time tracking problem in this paper implies that 1) the convergence time is independent of the initial conditions; 2) the system states are forced to reach the employed nonsingular fixed-time sliding surface in a prescribed time, which thus called fast fixed-time control. Then, based on a time-related function and a nonsingular fixed-time sliding surface, a hierarchical fast fixed-time control algorithm is proposed to solve the aforementioned problem within a fast fixed time being independent of the initial conditions. Furthermore, by employing the Lyapunov argument and mathematical induction, we present the sufficient conditions for fast fixed-time convergence of the tracking errors with respect to multiple targets. Finally, numerous simulation examples are presented to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed control algorithm.

AB Aiming at the requirements of offline high-precision navigation and positioning in the mapping of ocean floor, survey, and other fields for autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV)integrated navigation system, a post-processing algorithm based on factor graph optimization is proposed in this paper. First, the factor graph model is established by the factor graph formulation to address the asynchronous and heterogeneous problem of multi-source information fusion. Then the equivalent inertial measurement unit (IMU) factor is introduced to replace several consecutive IMU factors between two adjacent measurements to further aid high-rate navigation solutions. Second the forward and backward message passing processes are performed independently using the sum-product algorithm in the factor graph model. Finally, the optimal navigation solution is obtained by weighted smoothing the results of the forward and backward message passing processes. Simulation results show this algorithm proposed in this paper provides more accurate navigation accuracy and smoothness, especially in the case of signals loss or sensors fault. Compared with the federal Kalman filtering method, the horizontal positioning errors of the un-simplified factor graph, the simplified factor graph, and the factor graph optimization are improved by about 30%, 34%, and 80%, respectively. The semi-physical environment results also clearly verify the reliability and effectiveness of the proposed method, and its horizontal positioning accuracies are kept within -2 similar to 2 m.

AB This study explored pedestrians' understanding of Fully Autonomous Vehicles (FAVs) intention to stop and what influences pedestrians' decision to cross the road over time, i.e., learnability. Twenty participants saw fixed simulated urban road crossing scenes with a single FAV on the road as if they were pedestrians intending to cross. Scenes differed from one another in the FAV's, distance from the crossing place, its physical size, and external Human-Machine Interfaces (e-HMI) message by background color (red/green), message type (status/advice), and presentation modality (text/symbol). Eye-tracking data and decision measurements were collected. Results revealed that pedestrians tend to look at the e-HMI before making their decision. However, they did not necessarily decide according to the e-HMIs' color or message type. Moreover, when they complied with the e-HMI proposition, they tended to hesitate before making the decision. Overall, a learning effect over time was observed in all conditions regardless of e- HMI features and crossing context. Findings suggest that pedestrians' decision making depends on a combination of the e-HMI implementation and the car distance. Moreover, since the learning curve exists in all conditions and has the same proportion, it is critical to design an interaction that would encourage higher probability of compatible decisions from the first phase. However, to extend all these findings, it is necessary to further examine dynamic situations.

AB In this paper, we present a detailed analysis and implementation of secondary radar beacons designed for a local ad-hoc localization and landing system (LAOLa) to support the navigation of autonomous ground and aerial vehicles. We discuss a switched linear feedback network as a virtually coherent oscillator and show how to use it as a secondary radar transponder. Further, we present a signal model for the beat signal of the transponder response in an FMCW radar system, which is more detailed than in previously published papers. An actual transponder realization in the 24 GHz ISM band is presented. Its RF performance was evaluated both in the laboratory and in the field. Finally, we put forward some ideas on how to overcome the range measurement inaccuracy inherent in this transponder concept.

AB A system capable of both autonomous navigation and remote fire detection was developed from first principles. Using a complementary filter and attitude fundamentals, an Euler coordinate system representation of the aircraft's orientation was measured using a widely available low-cost inertial measurement unit incorporating MEMS accelerometers, gyroscopes and magnetometers. Using line-of-sight guidance principles, navigation trajectories could be calculated in real-time providing autonomous navigation between user designated waypoints. A stabilisation control system using proportional-integral-derivative (PID) controllers was developed in order to achieve stabilised flight on the calculated navigation trajectories. Fire detection was facilitated with the use of three low-cost air composition sensors fed into an artificial neural network. A motion planner was developed to assist in flight planning by using topology information for the flight area to construct an optimal flight path based on distance and climb penalties.

DE Autonomous Driving; Semantic Segmentation; Urban Environments; Improved
   Deeplabv3+Model
AB This paper proposes an improved Deeplabv3+ model for semantic segmentation of urban scenes targeting autonomous driving applications. A high-quality semantic segmentation dataset is con-structed from 2,967 manually labeled aerial images captured at 200m height with a 5-eye camera. The images contain 5 classes -buildings, vegetation, ground, lake and playgrounds. The improved Deeplabv3+ network enriches high-level semantics by replacing max pooling with depthwise separa-ble convolutions. Dilated convolutions extract multi-scale features to avoid overfitting. Experiments demonstrate that the model achieves an overall mean IoU of 0.87 on the test set, with IoU scores of 0.90, 0.92 and 0.94 on buildings, vegetation and water respectively. The model shows promising results for extracting semantic information from complex urban environments to support navigation for autonomous vehicles.

AB Curbs are used as physical markers to delimit roads and to redirect traffic into multiple directions (e.g., islands and roundabouts). Detection of road curbs is a fundamental task for autonomous vehicle navigation in urban environments. Since almost two decades, solutions that use various types of sensors, including vision, Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) sensors, among others, have emerged to address the curb detection problem. This survey elaborates on the advances of road curb detection problems, a research field that has grown over the last two decades and continues to be the ground for new theoretical and applied developments. We identify the tasks involved in the road curb detection methods and their applications on autonomous vehicle navigation and advanced driver assistance system (ADAS). Finally, we present an analysis on the similarities and differences of the wide variety of contributions.

AB Although autonomous vehicles (AVs) have been proved to have potential to reduce traffic accidents, people often hold skepticism toward the safety of AVs. The critical question is that what drives people to perceive and expect the safety of AVs. In this paper, a structural model is constructed, comprising risk sensitivity, risk-related feelings, perceived and expected safety. A survey of 185 respondents was conducted, and the results were analyzed by using PLS-SEM. Our study provided a deeper understanding of mental reasons for safety judgments in AVs by exploring how risk sensitivity and feelings explain safety judgment in AVs and establish the connections between them. It is found that perceived safety was influenced by feelings of worry more than dread, but there was no significant correlation between perceived safety and expected safety. New possible research ideas of AV's safety study are discussed in the paper.

AB Recently, visual simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) has been widely used in robotics and autonomous vehicles. It performs well in static environments. However, real-world environments are often dynamic scenarios. Because it is difficult for SLAM to deal with moving objects such as pedestrians and moving cars, SLAM does not meet the actual needs of robots and autonomous vehicles in real-world scenarios. Visual odometry (VO) is a key component of SLAM systems. In this paper, to extend SLAM to dynamic scenarios, we propose a monocular VO based on direct sparse odometry (DSO) to solve the problems arising in a dynamic environment. The proposed method, called DSO-Dynamic (DSOD), combines a semantic segmentation network with a depth prediction network to provide prior depth and semantic information. Experiments were conducted on the KITTI and Cityscapes datasets, and the results show our method achieves good performance compared with the baseline algorithm, DSO.

ID INTERSECTION MANAGEMENT; CAPACITY
AB This work examines the next-generation interchange control system (NIC) that aims to control connected and autonomous vehicles (CAV) at interchanges with the consideration of different mixed traffic cases. The first objective of the paper is to test several parameters including traffic demand, heavy vehicle percentage, communication range, and advance stop line (ASL) to investigate their impact on throughput and delay. The second objective is to incorporate mixed traffic in the NIC, utilizing a lane-based strategy that is responsive to market penetration rates. The NIC coordinates vehicles to traverse the interchange terminal by using a reservation-based control strategy with a first-come-first-served (FCFS) reservation protocol. The algorithm of this system was modeled in the simulation software package VISSIM using a slightly modified real-world scenario of interchange. The evaluation of the system starts with testing some key variables when market penetration rate is 100%. The results demonstrate that the increase in traffic demand and heavy vehicle percentage affects the performance of the NIC by increasing the delay. Although the effects of communication range and advance stop location do not have clear patterns, the communication range of 600 ft and ASL of 100 ft indicate a relatively lower delay. Throughput and delay results reveal that the NIC outperforms traffic signals when the market penetration rate is 75%, whereas a 25% market penetration rate provides similar performance to traffic signals.

AB This paper presents design and verification of an estimation and control system for a helicopter slung load system. The estimator provides position and velocity estimates of the slung load and is designed to augment existing navigation in autonomous helicopters. Sensor input is provided by a vision system on the helicopter that measures the position of the slung load. The controller is a combined feedforward and feedback scheme for simultaneous avoidance of swing excitation and active swing damping. Simulations and laboratory flight tests show the effectiveness of the combined control system, yielding significant load swing reduction compared to the baseline controller. (c) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

AB This article presents point-to-point tracking error reduction algorithm for indoor surveillance vehicle, which is driven by two in-wheel brushless ac (BLac) motors. In general, in order to control the position, additional equipment such as a separate sensor, camera, or GPS to know the absolute or relative position of the vehicle is required. However, when a large number of sensors or expensive equipment is used, the overall price of the system will also increase, which creates a problem. Also, Global Positioning System cannot be used in indoor systems due to poor signal reception. In the proposed method, the position tracking of the autonomous vehicle only adopts the hall sensor of the traction BLac motors and a gyro sensor on the controller, without any absolute position detecting sensors. From the estimated heading angle by the inertia measurement unit sensor and the calculated moving distance by the hall sensor, the tracking path and actual moving distance errors can be estimated in the proposed method. The actual real-time moving path error is compensated by adjusting the speed and heading angle in the presented control method. Through various experiments, it is verified that the position tracking performance of the indoor autonomous vehicle is improved using the proposed method.

AB Uncertain cut-in maneuver of vehicles from adjacent lanes makes it difficult for vehicle's automatic speed control strategy to make judgments and effective control decisions. In this paper, an intelligent speed control strategy for uncertain cut-in scenarios is established based on a basic autonomous driving system. This strategy judges cut-in maneuver from surrounding vehicles and outputs adaptive control action under current environment according to Q value of state-action pair based on a Q network. In addition, according to the analysis of cut-in scenarios, the Q network is trained based on a novel reinforcement learning method named as experience screening deep Q-learning network (ES-DQN). The proposed ES-DQN is an extension of double deep Q-learning network (DDQN) algorithm, and includes two parts: experience screening and policy learning. Based on the experience screened from the experience screening part, the proposed learning method can train an intelligent speed control strategy which has stronger adaptability and control effect in uncertain cut-in scenarios. According to simulation results, the proposed intelligent speed control strategy trained by ES-DQN has better performance under uncertain cut-in scenarios than DDQN method and traditional ACC strategy. Meanwhile, by adjusting weight value in reward function, the system can realize different control target.

AB This paper presents the design and dynamic simulation of a jumping mechanism for flight initiation in flapping wing aerial vehicles to enhance their autonomous mobility. It is inspired by avian flyers that start flight by jumping using their hind limbs. A 4-bar linkage that performs the prescribed take-off maneuvers has been geometrically designed using dimensional synthesis by motion generation. The kinematic dimensions obtained thereof have been ascertained analytically. A magnetic latching solenoid actuator and its corresponding transmission mechanism has been proposed for jumping actuation due to its compact structure, and low power consumption with no heat nor electrical noise generation. After take-off, the necessity to sustain the aerial vehicle airborne by providing adequate supportive forces at low air speeds has been demonstrated by the prospect of unsteady aerodynamics. Fluid-structure interaction has been analyzed by co-simulation between ADAMS? and MATLAB?/Simulink. The designed legs give an inclined take-off of about 64 degrees and an initial speed of almost 2m/s with an angular deflection of 110 degrees between the leg segments. Flight performance indicates an increase in lift/drag ratios with in both flapping rate and forward velocity up to some limit. The results also compared favorably with those from wind tunnel tests and previous analysis of related work. They all exhibited an increase in wing efficiency with decreasing mean angles of attack as the air vehicle approaches stable flight.

AB Objective: This research evaluated Automated Driving Systems (ADSs) involved collisions to identify factors relevant to future ADS research and development. Background: Rapidly developing ADSs promise improved safety, among other benefits. Properly applied collision research can inform ADS development, to minimize future collisions. Errors and failures that result in collisions come from sources including the system, ADS operators, and external factors including other drivers. Partially automated systems incorporate new equipment and procedures creating new sources of human error. Fully autonomous systems represent a new class of drivers that interact in unique ways. Method: ADS collision reports from the California Department of Motor Vehicles and the National Transportation Safety Board were collected. An expert in human factors and collision investigation analyzed and categorized the crashes while extracting common factors. Results: ADS vehicles were never at fault but were often affected from the rear during braking, turning, and gap acceptance maneuvers. Side impacts to ADS vehicles were related to passing vehicles and lane keeping behaviors. Unique incidents also provided additional insights. ADS collision rates cannot yet be determined with confidence. Conclusion: Conflicts that lead to collision-involvement with ADSs may be caused by differences between ADS and human driving behavior. Conservative ADS behavior may violate the expectations of other nearby human road users. Application: The findings from this work help inform the future development of ADS, as well as potentially the testing of ADS and the formation of policy to guide their future deployment.

AB An autonomous robotic vehicle (ARVs) is a self-driving vehicle that uses advanced technologies to navigate through the environment without human intervention. These vehicles can be used for various applications, including transportation, logistics, surveillance, and exploration. Route planning (RP) is the process of determining the most efficient and safe route for a vehicle, pedestrian, or any other mode of transportation to reach a destination. Route management is the process of selecting a collision-free path through an environment, which in practice is frequently crowded. Therefore, offering a RP solution for robotic systems is essential. The particle swarm optimization (PSO) method incorporates inertia weights and imitates the cooperative behavior of the flock's population as well as its predatory nature to address route modeling issues. The Dijkstra algorithm (DA) works by determining the shortest path among the closest vertices between the source and destination. To choose the best path, inertia weight is also taken into account. By analyzing algorithms, we presented the combination technique for RP. In order to give a reliable route planning method, we suggested the weight-controlled particle swarm-optimized Dijkstra algorithm (WCPSODA). MATLAB was used to run the simulation, and conventional tools were used to evaluate the results. The findings of the study show that the suggested systems are capable of performing well.

AB Simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) is a fundamental technique block in the indoor-navigation system for most autonomous vehicles and robots. SLAM aims at building a global consistent map of the environment while simultaneously determining the position and orientation of the robot in this map. Significant advances have been made in visual SLAM techniques in the past several years. However, due to the fragile performance in tracking feature points in environments that lack texture, e.g., a warehouse with blank white walls, visual SLAM can hardly provide a reliable localization. Compared with visual SLAM, LiDAR SLAM can often provide more robust localization in indoor environments by using 3D spatial information directly captured by LiDAR point clouds. Thus, LiDAR SLAM techniques are often employed in industrial applications such as automated guided vehicles (AGVs). In the past decades, a number of LiDAR SLAM methods have been proposed. However, the strength and weakness points of various LiDAR SLAMs are not clear, which may perplex the researchers and engineers. In this article, analysis and comparisons are made on different LiDAR SLAM-based indoor navigation methods, and extensive experiments are conducted to evaluate their performances in real environments. The comparative analysis and results can help researchers in academia and industry in constructing a suitable LiDAR SLAM system for indoor navigation for their own usage scenarios.

ID AUTONOMOUS UNDERWATER VEHICLE; SLIDING MODE CONTROLLER; METHODOLOGY
AB In this paper, an output-feedback fuzzy adaptive dynamic surface controller (FADSC) based on fuzzy adaptive extended state observer (FAESO) is proposed for autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) systems in the presence of external disturbances, parameter uncertainties, measurement noises and actuator faults. The fuzzy logic system is incorporated into both the observers and controllers to improve the adaptability of the entire system. The dynamics of the AUV system is established first, considering the external disturbances and parameter uncertainties. Based on the dynamic models, the ESO, combined with a fuzzy logic system tuning the observer bandwidth, is developed to not only adaptively estimate both system states and the lumped disturbances for the controller, but also reduce the impact of measurement noises. Then, the DSC, together with fuzzy logic system tuning the time constant of the low-pass filter, is designed using estimations from the FAESO for the AUV system. The asymptotic stability of the entire system is analyzed through Lyapunov's direct method in the time domain. Comparative simulations are implemented to verify the effectiveness and advantages of the proposed method compared with other observers and controllers considering external disturbances, parameter uncertainties and measurement noises and even the actuator faults that are not considered in the design process. The results show that the proposed method outperforms others in terms of tracking accuracy, robustness and energy consumption.

AB In the search to enhance the effectiveness and efficiency of structural health monitoring for preserving safety and integrity in civil infrastructure, the search for innovative technologies is of critical importance. This paper introduces ExpoDet, a comprehensive framework designed for autonomous health inspection and infrastructure assessment. ExpoDet features a multi-detection detector, autonomous navigation for micro aerial vehicles facilitated through secondary reward reinforcement learning, and a damage aggregation scheme for autonomous health assessment following detections. Moreover, it presents an attention module called EEAM+ that introduces dynamic feature orientation and significantly enhances the capabilities of ExpoDet. ExpoDet is extensively tested and evaluated in both offsite and field test experiments. Comparisons with several state-of-the-art object detectors coupled with attention modules show an average improvement of approximately 3% across various evaluation metrics.

AB Lateral motion control, a core autonomous driving technology, still faces the significant challenge of accurately tracking the reference path under complex and changeable driving maneuvers. In this regard, this study develops an efficient model predictive control (MPC)-based lateral motion controller considering path preview to improve the robustness and computational efficiency in large lateral acceleration or high-speed lateral motion control. As a typical model-based approach, the accuracy of the MPC predictive model substantially affects the controller's robustness. Thus, to improve the robustness of the lateral motion controller, a fire parameter online adaptive module (TPOAM) is proposed to update the MPC predictive model online to reduce the model mismatch. Unlike other online adaptation methods, the proposed TPOAM does not rely on complex and multi-parameter fire models or look-up tables. Through delay augmentation, the proposed method accurately models the steering system delay and compensates it in the MPC predictive model. In the engineering implementation of the MPC-based lateral motion controller, the long prediction horizon substantially deteriorates the computational efficiency of the receding optimization. Addressing this issue, the preview-follower theory is introduced into the predictive model to make full use of the future path information. The tracking deviation at the corresponding preview point can be obtained by previewing maneuvers similarly to human drivers at each time in the prediction horizon. This tracking deviation is also considered part of the MPC cost function. The total prediction horizon of the lateral motion controller considering path preview can be effectively extended while almost no computing time increment. The designed controller is verified on an autonomous vehicle platform in the low-speed large curvature and high-speed lane changing scenarios. Experimental results show that the proposed controller can effectively improve the robustness and computational efficiency of lateral motion control compared with the typically used MPC-based lateral motion approach.

AB In this paper, a new controller is proposed to help AUV (Autonomous Underwater Vehicle) track ideal trajectory in the high speed and variable speed ocean current environment. The kinematic and dynamic model of AUV under current interference is derived in the defined coordinate system. For the observation of variable speed current, the proposed controller proposes an improved extended state observer based on ADCP (Acoustic Doppler Current Profiler) sensor and fuzzy control. In order to resist the interference of high speed current, the proposed controller introduces an auxiliary lateral thruster to improve the anti-current capability of AUV. In order to coordinate the path tracking performance and current interference resistance of AUV, the proposed controller proposes an improved line of sight method, where observer gain is selected through fuzzy control. The improved line of sight method compensates for the prediction error of the state observer and the error in the AUV speed regulation process through the switching symbol function term in the sliding film control. The AUV's speed gradually reaches the ideal speed calculated by the navigation law through the dynamic controller, which is designed based on the backstepping method. Finally, the proposed controller is theoretically proved by the Lyapunov stability criterion and tested by comparison simulation in various working environments and controllers.

AB To improve traffic efficiency at highway on-ramps under heavy traffic, this study proposes a platoon-based cooperative optimal control algorithm for connected autonomous vehicles (CAVs). The proposed algorithm classifies CAVs on both mainline and on-ramp into multiple local platoons (LPs) according to their initial conditions (i.e., spacing and speed), which enables the algorithm to adapt to time-varying traffic volume. A distributed cooperative control for multiple LPs is designed which projects on-ramp LPs onto mainline to transform the complex 2-D multi-platoon cooperation problem into a 1-D platoon following control problem. An optimal control is applied to further consider the strict nonlinear safety spacing constraint and state limitations (e.g., maximum speed and acceleration), and an analytical solution to the optimal control is derived based on Pontryagin's maximum principle. The consensus of intra-platoon and inter-platoon are analyzed, and sufficient conditions of the consensus are mathematically deducted based on Lyapunov stability theorem. Numerical simulations are conducted for different traffic demand levels and demand splits to verify the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm. The sensitivity analysis of maximum platoon sizes for mainline and on-ramp LPs is performed. A comparison with a baseline virtual platooning merging strategy is conducted, and results show that the proposed algorithm could significantly improve the average travel speed and traffic efficiency, and reduce total travel time.

AB In this paper, we consider the distributed polynomial path tracking problem for a swarm of autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) modeled by second-order uncertain multi-agent systems. The application scenario of this paper has three distinguished characteristics. First, the communication network for the multi-agent system is unreliable and switching. Under the jointly connected condition, the communication network can be disconnected the entire time. Second, it is supposed that only the relative position between AUVs can be obtained for trajectory tracking control. Third, the AUV dynamics are subject to uncertain system parameters. By applying the cooperative output regulation control framework, a novel distributed robust control scheme is proposed to solve the distributed path tracking problem, which consists of three parts. First, to cope with communication network uncertainty, the distributed observer was invoked to recover the polynomial path for each AUV. Second, based on the relative position measurement between AUVs, a pseudo position estimator was adopted to generate the pseudo position for each AUV. Finally, based on the estimated polynomial path and the pseudo position, a certainty equivalent robust internal model control law was synthesized to achieve asymptotic reference trajectory tracking, where the internal model compensator aims to tackle uncertain system parameters. Numerical simulations are provided to validate the effectiveness of the proposed control scheme.

AB The autonomous landing of an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) on a moving platform is an essential functionality in various UAV-based applications. It can be added to a teleoperation UAV system or part of an autonomous UAV control system. Various robust and predictive control systems based on the traditional control theory are used for operating a UAV. Recently, some attempts were made to land a UAV on a moving target using reinforcement learning (RL). Vision is used as a typical way of sensing and detecting the moving target. Mainly, the related works have deployed a deep-neural network (DNN) for RL, which takes the image as input and provides the optimal navigation action as output. However, the delay of the multi-layer topology of the deep neural network affects the real-time aspect of such control. This paper proposes an adaptive multi-level quantization-based reinforcement learning (AMLQ) model. The AMLQ model quantizes the continuous actions and states to directly incorporate simple Q-learning to resolve the delay issue. This solution makes the training faster and enables simple knowledge representation without needing the DNN. For evaluation, the AMLQ model was compared with state-of-art approaches and was found to be superior in terms of root mean square error (RMSE), which was 8.7052 compared with the proportional-integral-derivative (PID) controller, which achieved an RMSE of 10.0592.

ID ATTACKS
AB Connected and Autonomous Vehicles (CAVs) are an emerging solution to the issues of safe and sustainable transportation systems in the future. One major transport technology for CAVs is Cooperative Adaptive Cruise Control (CACC), for which unsignalized autonomous intersection crossing is a growing use case. CACC relies heavily on inter-vehicular communication and is thus vulnerable to message forgery and jamming attacks. Most solutions for CACC focus exclusively on enhancing efficiency or security but do not offer an integrated framework for achieving both on a large scale. In this paper, we propose a Block-chainintegrated Multi-Agent Deep Reinforcement Learning (BlockMADRL) architecture for enhancing the efficiency of CACC while cooperatively detecting attacks, reducing the fuel efficiency of identified attackers and securely notifying the overall network. Our approach uses multi-agent deep reinforcement learning to find fuel and throughput optimizing solutions for CACC and a cooperative verification mechanism based on Extended Isolation Forest (EIF) for attack detection. Attacker data is securely stored in a Road Side Unit (RSU) level blockchain, and we design a low-latency, high throughput consensus protocol for speedy and secure data dissemination. Simulation results indicate over 29.5% better lane throughput with our approach during acceleration forgery attack, up to 23% induced reduction in fuel efficiency of malicious vehicles, 17.6% higher blockchain throughput through our consensus protocol and over 8% improvement in attack detection rate compared to the state-of-the-art.

AB In this paper, multiple autonomous underwater vehicle (multi-AUV) formation control with obstacle avoidance ability in 3D complex underwater environments based on an event-triggered model predictive control (EMPC) is proposed. Firstly, multi-AUV motion model systems are developed. The navigation reference trajectory of the follower AUVs can be obtained using a multi-AUV relative motion model. Secondly, in order to overcome the speed jump and obstacle avoidance problem in multi-AUV systems, compatibility constraints are presented in MPC that limit the uncertainty deviation of each AUV. The event-triggered mechanism (ET) is designed to decrease the computational load, which is based on the error between the optimal predicted and current state of the AUV. Finally, the effectiveness and superiority of the proposed algorithm are confirmed via simulation and compared with those of other algorithms.

AB The current maturity of autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) has made their deployment practical and cost-effective, such that many scientific, industrial and military applications now include AUV operations. However, the logistical difficulties and high costs of operating at sea are still critical limiting factors in further technology development, the benchmarking of new techniques and the reproducibility of research results. To overcome this problem, this paper presents a freely available dataset suitable to test control, navigation, sensor processing algorithms and others tasks. This dataset combines AUV navigation data, sidescan sonar, multibeam echosounder data and seafloor camera image data, and associated sensor acquisition metadata to provide a detailed characterisation of surveys carried out by the National Oceanography Centre (NOC) in the Greater Haig Fras Marine Conservation Zone (MCZ) of the U.K in 2015.

AB This study addresses the problem of position-tracking control of underactuated autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) in the presence of unknown ocean currents in a horizontal plane. A position-tracking controller and a current observer are presented based on the Lyapunov stability theory by using the backstepping technique, respectively. The final controlled system, which arises from putting together the position-tracking controller and the observer, is proved to be globally K-exponentially stable by stability criteria for cascade system. The trajectories used for the illustration of the proposed control schemes are a circle with constant velocity and a sinusoidal curve that requires time-varying velocity. In order to demonstrate the practicability of the proposed controller, the surge force is assumed to be non-negative, and control input saturations are considered. Simulation results are presented to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed control schemes.

AB Previous research by the authors has investigated the application of nature inspired search strategies and particle swarm optimisation to the guidance of autonomous vehicles in search roles. Findings suggest that nature inspired search strategies are beneficial under a wide range of search conditions. However, that research did not consider the potential for reacquisition of lost targets, which is especially of interest where the targets are travelling faster than the searching agents or in environments that allow for some means of visual or other sensory occlusion. This work investigates whether behaviours observed in nature can be applied to scenarios where target detection is lost. Through employing a variety of reacquisition strategies against a range of target movement types it is demonstrated that the overall effectiveness of the system can be improved in a variety of scenarios by incorporating nature inspired reacquisition strategies.

This review summarises deep reinforcement learning (DRL) algorithms and provides a taxonomy of automated driving tasks where (D)RL methods have been employed, while addressing key computational challenges in real world deployment of autonomous driving agents. It also delineates adjacent domains such as behavior cloning, imitation learning, inverse reinforcement learning that are related but are not classical RL algorithms. The role of simulators in training agents, methods to validate, test and robustify existing solutions in RL are discussed.

AB Lane change trajectory prediction is crucial for autonomous vehicles (AVs) to assess their own driving safety in advance. However, there are significant uncertainties in the implementation of such prediction, including different behaviors caused by agent-agent interaction and driving styles of drivers. While prototype trajectories can serve as a means to represent typical motion patterns and enhance trajectory prediction performance, their utilization in modeling motion patterns tends to overlook the influence of agent-agent interactions and vehicle dynamics. This paper proposes a fusion algorithm that considers driving style and vehicle dynamics to address these uncertainties. The algorithm involves a long short-term memory (LSTM) lane change behavior recognition model that mines key features of agent-agent interaction through the attention mechanism. The Gaussian process (GP) motion modeling trajectory prediction (GPMM-TP) algorithm considers the driving style of the prototype trajectory based on the behavior recognition results. To further improve short-term and long-term prediction, the interactive multi-model (IMM) algorithm is used to assign probability weights to the GP model and the Extended Kalman Filter (EKF) model based on prediction accuracy, taking into account the driving styles and the vehicle dynamics. The proposed algorithm provides a promising approach to improving the accuracy of lane change trajectory prediction for AVs, and its effectiveness is demonstrated using the HighD dataset.

AB Autonomous Vehicles (AVs) rely on a set of radar sensors operated on frequency modulated waveforms. Due to the large bandwidth requirement of frequency modulated radars, only a limited number of proximate vehicles can be allowed for a concurrent transmission within the available spectrum. However, with the explosive growth of AVs, the available spectrum may soon reach its capacity. As a results, the coexistence of multiple AVs working on same resource, may lead to the problem of Radar-to-Radar (R2R) interference, also known as radar blindness. In this paper, we propose the notion of coded waveforms to minimize the R2R interference among the vehicles operating on the same resource. Specifically, the spread spectrum codes have been used as another degree of freedom (i.e., along with time-frequency resources) to spread the inter-vehicular radar interference over the wider spectrum, which enable to orthogonalize more number of AVs over the available range of spectrum. In addition, we have formulated a Spread Spectrum-based Radar Transmission Scheme (SS-RTS), and described the transmission and reception through SS-RTS. Also, the SS-RTS has been compared with the existing Graph-based Resource Allocation (GRA) scheme. Further, simulation results verified that SS-RTS significantly reduces the inter-vehicular R2R interference and outperforms GRA in terms of blind probability.

AB This article presents a prior data-driven strategy to solve the motion planning problem of autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) for the target search mission. Compared with the widely studied cases over wide marine area, however, this article focuses on searching static target that exists in nonwide area. First, under the assumption that the nonwide area could be regarded as a combination of lines or curves, we utilize the Parzen windows theory with one-dimensional Gaussian kernels to generate the prior probability map of target based on the previous qualitative data. Then, we use the "global warming" method to extract some valuable subregions quantitatively, which will be visited by AUV in the optimal sequence.

AB This paper presents a comparative study of docking algorithms intended for non-holonomic autonomous underwater vehicles, docking in funnel-shaped docking stations, operating under the influence of ocean currents. While descriptive surveys have been already reported in the literature, our goal is to compare the most relevant algorithms through realistic Monte Carlo simulations to provide an insight into their performance. To this aim, a new numerical performance indicator is proposed, which, based on the geometry of the manoeuvre, is able to characterize a successful or unsuccessful docking, providing a metric for comparison. The experimental study is carried out using hardware-in-the-loop simulation by means of the Stonefish simulator, including the dynamic/hydrodynamic model of the Sparus II AUV, models of all internal and external sensors, and the collision geometry representing the docking station.

AB We propose a novel temporal attention based neural network architecture for robotics tasks that involve fusion of time series of sensor data, and evaluate the performance improvements in the context of autonomous navigation of unmanned ground vehicles (UGVs) in uncertain environments. The architecture generates feature vectors by fusing raw pixel and depth values collected by camera(s) and LiDAR(s), stores a history of the generated feature vectors, and incorporates the temporally attended history with current features to predict a steering command. The experimental studies show the robust performance in unknown and cluttered environments. Furthermore, the temporal attention is resilient to noise, bias, blur, and occlusions in the sensor signals. We trained the network on indoor corridor datasets (that will be publicly released) from our UGV. The datasets have LiDAR depth measurements, camera images, and human tele-operation commands.

TI Integration of navigation systems for autonomous underwater vehicles
SO JOURNAL OF MARINE ENGINEERING AND TECHNOLOGY

DT Article
AB An autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) requires a precise navigational system for localization, positioning, path tracking, guidance and control. The main navigational device for an AUV is an inertial navigation system (INS) because highprecision navigational devices such as the Global Positioning System have a limited usage in the underwater environment. In this study, based on the dynamic mathematical model of AUV, we develop two types of low-cost integrated navigational system for AUVs based on error models of INS and its aiding devices such as Doppler velocity logs, compasses and pressure depth sensors. Nine-and 15-state INS error models and corresponding measurement models of aiding devices are derived for the Kalman filter (KF). We compare the performance of those two integrated navigation systems. The simulation results confirm that low-cost inertial measurement unit sensors produce a notable amount of noisy measurements, but KF-based integrated navigation system models for AUV can effectively mitigate those drawbacks.

AB Radar deception through phantom track generation using multiple electronic combat air vehicles is addressed, which serves as a motivating example for cooperative control of autonomous multiagent systems. A general framework to derive sufficient conditions for the existence of feasible solutions,for an affine nonlinear control system comprising of a team of nonholonomic mobile agents having to satisfy, actuator and interagent constraints is presented. Based on this feasibility analysis, an algorithm capable of generating trajectories online and in real time, for the phantom track generation problem, is developed. A rigorous treatment of the phantom track generation problem, which includes results on its accessibility, feasibility, local asymptotic straightening of trajectories, and a limited result on system controllability, is given. The basic approach to the algorithm based on the results developed here is presented along with simulation results, validating the proposed approach.

AB We present a parameter inference algorithm for autonomous stochastic linear hybrid systems, which computes a maximum-likelihood model, given only a set of continuous output data of the system. We overcome the potentially intractable problem of identifying the sequence of discrete modes by using dynamic programming; we then compute the maximum-likelihood continuous models using an Expectation Maximization technique. This allows us to find a maximum-likelihood model in time that is polynomial in the number of discrete modes as well as in the length of the data series. We prove local convergence of the algorithm. We also propose a novel initialization technique to derive good initial conditions for the model parameters. Finally, we demonstrate our algorithm on some examples - two simple one-dimensional examples with simulated data, and an application to real flight test data from a dual-vehicle demonstration of the Stanford DragonFly Unmanned Aerial Vehicles.

DT Article
DE Adaptive control; kinematics; land vehicles; marine vehicles; path
   planning; unmanned aerial vehicles
ID TRACKING; VEHICLES
AB We present a nonlinear adaptive path following controller that compensates for drift forces through vehicle sideslip. Vehicle sideslip arises during path following when the vehicle is subject to drift forces caused by ocean currents, wind, and waves. The proposed algorithm is motivated by a line-of-sight (LOS) guidance principle used by ancient navigators, which is here extended to path following of Dubins paths. The unknown sideslip angle is treated as a constant parameter, which is estimated using an adaptation law. The equilibrium points of the cross-track and parameter estimation errors are proven to be uniformly semiglobally exponentially stable. This guarantees that the estimated sideslip angle converges to its true value exponentially. The adaptive control law is in fact an integral LOS controller for path following since the parameter adaptation law provides integral action. The proposed guidance law is intended for maneuvering in the horizontal-plane at given speeds and typical applications are marine craft, autonomous underwater vehicles, unmanned aerial vehicles as well as other vehicles and crafts, where the goal is to follow a predefined parametrized curve without time constraints. Two vehicle cases studies are included to verify the theoretical results.

   parallel computation
AB The trajectory planning algorithm of underwater vehicle near-bottom cruise is important to scientific investigation, industrial inspection, and military affairs. An autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) often faces the problems of complex underwater environment and large cruise area in a real environment, and some robots must hide themselves during the cruise. However, to the best of our knowledge, few studies have focused on trajectory planning algorithms for AUVs with multiple constraints on large-scale maps. The currently used algorithms are not effective at solving length-constraint problems, and the mainstream trajectory planning algorithms for robots cannot be directly applied to the needs of underwater vehicle sailing near the bottom. Therefore, we present a bounded ridge-based trajectory planning algorithm (RA*) for an AUV to go on a near-bottom cruise. In the algorithm, we design a safety map based on a spherical structure to ensure the safe operation of the robot. In addressing the length-constraint problem and large-scale map planning problem, this paper proposes a two-stage framework for RA*, which designs map compression and parallel computation using a coarse-fine planning framework to solve the large-scale trajectory planning problem and uses a bounded search method to meet the trajectory planning requirements of length constraint. In this study, experiments based on the virtual ocean ridge are conducted, and the results validate the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed RA* with MCPC algorithm framework.

AB Autonomous delivery robots (ADRs) as green last-mile delivery alternatives to traditional vans have received much attention due to the rapid development of Physical Internet (PI). However, their low efficiency limits the application in the last-mile delivery because few orders per trip are delivered. Also, the cost and emission impact of new motilities on the PI-enabled last-mile delivery network is still not clear. To address these issues, this study developed an innovative two-echelon delivery system that combines traditional vans and ADRs to take their advantages for the last-mile delivery. The objective of this study was to minimize transportation costs and emissions through solving an extension of a two-echelon vehicle routing problem considering load-dependent unit transport costs and unit emissions with mixed vehicles and multiple depots. The problem was formulated as a mixed-integer programming model and then efficiently solved by a cluster-based artificial immune algo-rithm, in which an improved clustering method was employed to assign the customers. The experimental results showed that the proposed solution approach efficiently solved the problem with better solutions than existing approaches in the relevant literature. Several managerial implications on configuring the two-echelon delivery system were also provided for potential applications.

AB Traffic awareness is the prerequisite of autonomous driving. Given the limitation of on-board sensors (e.g., precision and price), remote measurement from either infrastructure or other vehicles can improve traffic safety. However, the wireless communication carrying the measurement result undergoes fading, noise and interference and has a certain probability of outage. When the communication fails, the vehicle state can only be predicted by Bayesian filtering with a low precision. Higher communication resource utilization (e.g., transmission power) reduces the outage probability and hence results in an improved estimation precision. The power control subject to an estimate variance constraint is a difficult problem due to the complicated mapping from transmit power to vehicle-state estimate variance. In this paper, we develop an estimator consisting of several Kalman filters (KFs) or extended Kalman filters (EKFs) and an interacting multiple model (IMM) to estimate and predict the vehicle state. We propose to apply deep reinforcement learning (DRL) for the transmit power optimization. In particular, we consider an intersection and a lane-changing scenario and apply proximal policy optimization (PPO) and soft actor-critic (SAC) to train the DRL model. Testing results show satisfactory power control strategies confining estimate variances below given threshold. SAC achieves higher performance compared to PPO.

AB Recent smart urban mobility innovations such as intelligent transportation systems, electric vehicles, autonomous vehicles, demand-responsive transportation, shared transportation, and mobility-as-a-service are consistently identified as the panacea to many of the economic, social and environmental effects associated with private vehicles-including road congestion, urban sprawl, social exclusion, increased costs, crashes, emissions, and environmental degradation. One of the strategies of many smart urban mobility policies is to view the transportation system from a holistic perspective to seek reduction of negative effects and an improve performance. Nonetheless, given the rapid technological advances in the transportation sector, there is a need to identify and evaluate primary smart mobility innovations from a sustainability perspective. This article presents a thorough technology review and evaluation of the main smart mobility innovations identified in the literature. The study has identified and categorized six main smart mobility innovations most commonly discussed within the literature including: (a) intelligent transport systems; (b) alternative fuel systems; (c) driving automation systems; (d) shared mobility services; (e) demand responsive transport; and (f) integrated mobility systems. Furthermore, this article includes a brief description of their characteristics, applications, and also evaluates their sustainability according to their proposed impacts on transport safety, road congestion, energy consumption, the environment, and accessibility.

TI HybridNet: A fast vehicle detection system for autonomous driving
SO SIGNAL PROCESSING-IMAGE COMMUNICATION

DT Article
DE Vehicle detection; CNN; Two-stage; Decision refinement
AB For autonomous driving system, vehicle detection is an import part as well as a challenging problem due to the large intra-class differences caused by occlusion, truncation and different viewpoints. The detection system should be fast and accurate enough to support real-world applications. Most of the existing deep convolution neural network (CNN) based object detection methods can be roughly categorized into two streams: single-stage and two-stage modes. These single-stage methods are usually extremely fast and easy to train with losing some precision. As for two-stage methods, they often get high performance in object detection competitions, however, they are not competitive for real-world applications because of the speed limits. The detection system with high degree of precision and fast computation speed is desirable. In this paper, a new two-stage regression based cascade object detection system is proposed. This system can be fast detection of the vehicles which concentrated the advantages of the two aforementioned methods, denoted by HybridNet. In our design, the first and the second stage are both regression modes. We add a transitional stage to map proposals (generated in the first stage) on high resolution feature maps to get exact features for decision refinement in the second stage. The challenging KITTI and PASCAL VOC2007 data sets are used to evaluate our proposed method. The experimental results show that our approach is more fast and more accurate in vehicle detection than other state-of-the-art methods.

AB Near-ground maneuvers, such as hover, approach, and landing, are key elements of autonomy in unmanned aerial vehicles. Such maneuvers have been tackled conventionally by measuring or estimating the velocity and the height above the ground, often using ultrasonic or laser range finders. Near-ground maneuvers are naturally mastered by flying birds and insects because objects below may be of interest for food or shelter. These animals perform such maneuvers efficiently using only the available vision and vestibular sensory information. In this paper, the time-to-contact (tau) theory, which conceptualizes the visual strategy with which many species are believed to approach objects, is presented as a solution for relative ground distance control for unmanned aerial vehicles. The paper shows how such an approach can be visually guided without knowledge of height and velocity relative to the ground. A control scheme that implements the tau strategy is developed employing only visual information from a monocular camera and an inertial measurement unit. To achieve reliable visual information at a high rate, a novel filtering system is proposed to complement the control system. The proposed system is implemented onboard an experimental quadrotor unmanned aerial vehicle and is shown to not only successfully land and approach ground, but also to enable the user to choose the dynamic characteristics of the approach. The methods presented in this paper are applicable to both aerial and space autonomous vehicles.

DT Article
AB Recent experimentation with autonomous surface vehicles (ASVs) has focused on the use of such platforms to perform tasks of classification or identification of objects first discovered by another sensor. The ASV generally carries small sensors capable of high-resolution imaging, but only at relatively short ranges. Reacquisition of a contact is inherent in the problem of classification and involves positioning of the surface vehicle with good precision such that the object of interest is in the field of view of the sensors aboard the ASV. This critical task of positioning the vehicle such that the classification sensors can be effectively brought to bear is the primary goal of our autonomy development. Experimental results from a variety of sensors are presented, but the most important in our present work has been a high-resolution multibeam imaging sonar operating at 450 kHz. This sensor has been successfully used to image divers and bottom objects, with telemetry data sent back to shore via wireless LAN. Although classification was done by a human operator ashore, the vehicle has the capability to keep an object in view of the sensor, representing an important operational advantage of the autonomy. Future work could expand the role of the unmanned platform to deployment of effectors-warning devices or entanglement devices in the case of harbor protection missions or neutralization devices in the case of countermine operations.

AB Transportation network companies (TNCs) are regularly demonstrating the economic and operational viability of dynamic ride-sharing (DRS) to any destination within a city (e.g., uberPOOL or Lyft Line), thanks to real-time information from smartphones. In the foreseeable future, fleets of shared automated vehicles (SAVs) may largely eliminate the need for human drivers, while lowering per-mile operating costs and increasing the convenience of travel. This may dramatically reduce private vehicle ownership resulting in extensive use of SAVs. This study anticipates DRS matches across different travelers and identifies optimum fleet sizes required using AirSage's cellphone-based trip tables across 1267 zones over 30 days. Assuming that the travel patterns do not change significantly in the future, the results suggest significant opportunities for DRS-enabled SAVs. Nearly 60% of the single-person trips could be shared with other individuals traveling solo and with less than 5 min of added travel time (to arrive at their destinations), and this value climbs to 80% for 15 to 30 min of added wait or travel time. 60,000 SAVs will be required to meet nearly 50% of Orlando's 2.8 million single-traveler trips each day. With maximum ride-sharing delays of 15 minutes, and when focused on serving solo travelers, the average SAV is able to serve 25 person-trips per day, reducing parking demands while filling up passenger vehicle seats.

AB Autonomous vehicles (AVs) need to adequately predict the trajectory space of surrounding vehicles (SVs) in order to make reasonable decision-making and improve driving safety. In this paper, we build the driving behavior intention recognition module and traffic vehicle expected trajectory prediction module by deep learning. On the one hand, the driving behavior intention recognition module identifies the probabilities of lane keeping, left lane changing, right lane changing, left acceleration lane changing, and right acceleration lane changing of the predicted vehicle. On the other hand, the expected trajectory prediction module adopts an encoder-decoder architecture, in which the encoder encodes the historical environment information of the surrounding agents as a context vector, and the decoder and MDN network combine the context vector and the identified driving behavior intention to predict the probability distribution of future trajectories. Additionally, our model produces the multiple behaviors and trajectories that may occur in the next 6 s for the predicted vehicle (PV). The proposed model is trained, validated and tested with the HighD dataset. The experimental results show that the constructed probabilistic multi-modal expected trajectory prediction possesses high accuracy in the intention recognition module with full consideration of interactive information. At the same time, the multi-modal probability distribution generated by the anticipated trajectory prediction model is more consistent with the real trajectories, which significantly improves the trajectory prediction accuracy compared with other approaches and has apparent advantages in predicting long-term domain trajectories.

AVs may have advantages in efficiency and convenience, but safety can be compromised in mixed operations of manual vehicles and AVs. To deal with the issues associated with mixed traffic and to avoid its negative effects, a special purpose lane reserved for AVs can be proposed to segregate AVs from manual vehicles. In this research, we analyze the effect on efficiency and safety of AVs in mixed traffic and in a situation where an AV-only lane is deployed. In the analysis, we investigate the average speed, the throughput, and the inverse time-to-collision (ITTC). We differentiate the behaviors of manual vehicles and AVs through the reaction time, desired speed, and car-following models. As a result, we observe that the efficiency is improved when the market penetration rate of AVs increases, especially when the highway throughput increases by up to 84% in the case of mixed traffic. However, safety worsens when the market penetration of AVs is under 40%. In this case, the average speed can be improved and the frequency of dangerous situations (ITTC > 0.49) can be reduced drastically in the merging section by making the innermost lane AV-only. Accordingly, we conclude that AV-only lanes can have a significant positive impact on efficiency and safety when the market penetration rate of AVs is low.

AB This paper presents an online AUV (autonomous underwater vehicle) path planner that employs path replanning approach and the SDEQPSO (selective differential evolution-hybridized quantum-behaved particle swarm optimization) algorithm to optimize an AUV mission conducted in an unknown, dynamic and cluttered ocean environment. The proposed path replanner considered the effect of ocean currents in path optimization to generate a Pareto-optimal path that guides the AUV to its target within minimum time. The optimization was based on the onboard sensor data measured from the environment, which consists of a priori unknown dynamic obstacles and spatiotemporal currents. Different sensor arrangements for the forward-looking sonar and horizontal acoustic Doppler current profiler (H-ADCP) were considered in 2D and 3D simulations. Based on the simulation results, the SDEQPSO path replanner was found to be capable of generating a time-optimal path that offered up to 13% reduction in travel time compared to the situation where the vehicle simply followed a path with the shortest distance. The proposed replanning technique also showed consistently better performance over a reactive path planner in terms of solution quality, stability, and computational efficiency. Robustness of the replanner was verified under stochastic process using the Monte Carlo method. The generated path fulfilled the vehicle's safety and physical constraints, while intelligently exploiting ocean currents to improve the vehicle's efficiency.

In this paper, the current implementation of SAMON is presented, along with a formal model based on process algebra. Flexible optimization handles planning, mobility, evolution, and learning. A generic behavior message-passing language is developed for communication and knowledge representation among heterogeneous Autonomous Undersea Vehicles (AUV's). The process algebra subsumed in this language expresses a generalized optimization framework that contains genetic algorithms, and neural networks as limiting cases.

AB Technology advancements have paved the way for public access to shared autonomous vehicles (SAVs), but there is still no travel survey examining how SAVs with dynamic ride sharing (DRS) affect long-distance (LD) trips. Given the growth in these trips and the higher importance of travel time and cost on LD trips, assessing potential impacts of SAVs could be a vital tool in planning for a sustainable transportation system. This paper examines the impact of various attitudinal, sociodemographic, and travel-related characteristics on the usage intention of SAVs with DRS on LD trips. We have designed and conducted a web-based survey for this purpose and based on a representative sample of 723 individuals in 2021, a Generalized Ordered Logit model is estimated. Estimation results highlight the key importance of following psychological factors in a descending order: price evaluation, perceived usefulness, consumer innovativeness, sharing attitude, and privacy concern. Further, key factors among sociodemographic and travel-related characteristics are gender, education level, driving license, household car ownership, generational element, and crash history. These findings provide crucial insights into the likely effects of SAVs with DRS on LD trip behavior, based on which a number of practical implications are proposed for facilitating policy-making.

AB Reinforcement learning (RL) and approximate dynamic programming (ADP) have been recently studied to solve nonlinear optimal control problems (OCPs) of continuous-time (CT) systems. However, online learning efficiency and reliability are two major concerns to be further improved. Motivated by the above issues, in this paper we propose a receding-horizon reinforcement learning (RHRL) algorithm for near-optimal control of CT systems under control constraints. Different from classic RL and ADP, in the proposed approach, the infinite-horizon OCP is decomposed as a series of finite-horizon ones solved with an actor-critic structure according to the receding horizon strategy, which can improve the online learning efficiency and reliability. The unknown dynamics of the system are identified offline using a sparse kernel-based neural network structure whose weights are also updated online in the RHRL framework to improve the control performance. Moreover, the convergence of the modeling error is proven. To verify the effectiveness of our approach, we apply the RHRL algorithm to the autonomous ground vehicle for realizing near-optimal path-tracking control. Compared with CT model predictive control using a nominal model and other model-free tracking controllers such as pure pursuit, heuristic dual programming, and the soft actor-critic algorithm, RHRL performs better in terms of control performance.

AB Road detection is a vital task for autonomous vehicles, as it has a direct link to passengers' safety. Given its importance, researchers aimed to improve its accuracy and robustness. We look at the task from a holistic point of view, where we aim to balance computation and accuracy. A multimodal road detection pipeline is proposed, which fuses the camera image with the preprocessed LIDAR input. First, the LIDAR input is preprocessed using three-dimensional models inspired from computer graphics to generate image-like representations. Then, the preprocessed LIDAR input is combined with the camera image using a fusion module named inputs cross-fusion module, to reduce the computation amount required by other fusion strategies. To prevent the accuracy loss caused by the computation gain, we introduce the surface normal information to add distinctiveness. Furthermore, we propose a cost/benefit metric to evaluate the trade-off between computation cost and accuracy of road detection approaches. Several tests were conducted using the KITTI road detection benchmark based on deep convolutional neural networks, the obtained results were considered very satisfactory. In particular, the robustness of the proposed approach resulted in accuracies higher than 95% on different road types, comparable to those of the state-of-the-art techniques. In addition to marginally reducing the inference time of the used DCNN on images with a resolution of 1248 x 352 pixels to 130 ms using an NVIDIA GTX-1080TI. (C) 2020 SPIE and IS&T

AB Robotic platforms are essential for future human planetary and lunar exploration as they can operate in more extreme environments with a greater endurance than human explorers. In this era of space exploration, a terrestrial analog that can be used for development of the coordination between manned and robotic vehicles will optimize the scientific return of future missions while concurrently minimizing the downtime of both human explorers and robotic platforms. This work presents the use of underwater exploratory robots - autonomous underwater vehicles (AUV), remotely operated vehicles (ROV), and manned submersibles - as analogues for mixed human-robot exploration of space. Subaqueous settings present diverse challenges for navigation, operation and recovery that require the development of an exploration model of a similar complexity as required for space exploration. To capitalize on the strengths of both robotic and human explorers this work presents lessons learnt with respect to the fields of human-robotic interface (HRI) and operator training. These are then used in the development of mission evaluation tools: (1) a task efficiency index (TEI), (2) performance metrics, and (3) exploration metrics. Although these independent evaluations were useful for specific missions, further refinement will be required to fully evaluate the strengths and capabilities of multiple platforms in a human-robotic exploration campaign in order to take advantage of unforeseen science opportunities in remote settings.

AB This article is dedicated to solving the problem of predefined-time cooperative control for autonomous surface vessels encountering model uncertainties and external perturbations. By virtue of the prescribed-time stable theory, a robust formation controller is constructed, with which the settling time of the cooperative system can be prescribed in advance. The controller is developed under the backstepping framework, where the dynamic surface control is applied to generate the real-time command. Considering the unmodeled autonomous surface vessel dynamics, the neural network-based nonlinear approximator is incorporated with minimum-learning-parameter technique. Under this scenario, the real-time control can be pursed with one parameter being estimated. Finally, comparative simulation examples are provided to exhibit the effectiveness and advantages of designed control strategies.

AB To understand potential users' behavioral intention (BI) to adopt new energy vehicles (NEVs), a media-based perceptions and adoption model (MPAM) of NEVs geared toward potential NEV consumers was constructed based on social cognition theory, the technology acceptance model, the value acceptance model, perceived risk theory, and the MPAM of autonomous vehicles (AVs). A sample survey including 309 NEV potential users was conducted and the results were analyzed through SPSS 24.0 and SmartPLS 3.0 to test the model and verify the research hypotheses. The results show that mass media (MM) has a direct influence on users' social norms (SNs) and part of product perceptions, and an indirect influence on their BI to adopt NEVs; SNs have a direct influence on product perception, and also indirectly affect BI toward NEVs. Product perception directly and significantly affects BI; perceived usefulness (PU), perceived ease of use (PEOU), and perceived enjoyment (PE) have a positive and significant influence on BI, while both perceived cost (PC) and perceived risk (PR) have a negative and significant impact. This study is a theoretical extension of the technology acceptance model (TAM) to green product adoption scenarios, such as NEVs, in the face of the external stimuli from MM information; it proposes product perception variables and media information effects that are different from the MPAM of AVs. The results are expected to greatly promote NEV design and marketing.

AB The following paper presents a method for the use of a virtual electric dipole potential field to control a leader-follower formation of autonomous Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs). The proposed control algorithm uses a virtual electric dipole potential field to determine the desired heading for a UAV follower. This method's greatest advantage is the ability to rapidly change the potential field function depending on the position of the independent leader. Another advantage is that it ensures formation flight safety regardless of the positions of the initial leader or follower. Moreover, it is also possible to generate additional potential fields which guarantee obstacle and vehicle collision avoidance. The considered control system can easily be adapted to vehicles with different dynamics without the need to retune heading control channel gains and parameters. The paper closely describes and presents in detail the synthesis of the control algorithm based on vector fields obtained using scalar virtual electric dipole potential fields. The proposed control system was tested and its operation was verified through simulations. Generated potential fields as well as leader-follower flight parameters have been presented and thoroughly discussed within the paper. The obtained research results validate the effectiveness of this formation flight control method as well as prove that the described algorithm improves flight formation organization and helps ensure collision-free conditions.

AB We consider ride-sharing networks served by human-driven vehicles (HVs) and autonomous vehicles (AVs). We propose a model for ride-sharing in this mixed autonomy setting for a multilocation equidistant network, in which a ride-sharing platform sets prices for riders, compensations for drivers of HVs, and operates AVs for a fixed price with the goal of maximizing profits. When there are more vehicles than riders at a location, we consider three vehicle-to-rider assignment possibilities: 1) rides are assigned to HVs first; 2) rides are assigned to AVs first; and 3) rides are assigned in proportion to the number of available HVs and AVs. Next, for each of these priority possibilities, we establish a nonconvex optimization problem characterizing the optimal profits for a network operating at a steady-state equilibrium. We then provide a convex problem which we show to have the same optimal profits, allowing for efficient computation of equilibria, and we show that all three priority possibilities result in the same maximum profits for the platform. Next, we show that, in some cases, there is a regime, for which the platform will choose to mix HVs and AVs in order to maximize its profit, while, in other cases, the platform will use only HVs or only AVs, depending on the relative cost of AVs. For a specific class of networks, we fully characterize these thresholds analytically and demonstrate our results on an example.

AB Accurate position, velocity, attitude, and angular velocity state estimation is crucial for unmanned aerial vehicles, especially in enabling them with autonomous capabilities. It is necessary to adequately model and account for all the environmental and dynamic flight parameters. A hierarchical mixture of experts (HME) framework has been viable in improving state estimation accuracy in interplanetary orbit determination problems, and this paper proposes an extension for quadcopters. It is shown that the state and motor angular velocity estimation accuracy can be significantly improved by processing different thrust models, and acoustic parameters have an important, previously unreported, role in this improvement. Higher motor angular velocities produce higher noise levels, and thus, the relationships of the onboard acoustic measurements to the vehicle state parameters play an essential part in estimation. The motor angular velocities' estimations depend on the extended Kalman filter solutions or an acoustic curve fit. The experts in the HME framework utilize the state estimation solutions from the extended Kalman filters and the motor angular velocity estimations to compare against the telemetry data as truth. The overall HME solution is compared against a non-acoustic static thrust model. Illustrative examples and analysis presented in this paper reveal that the proposed estimation solutions can also apply to other flight vehicles for onboard real-time implementation to leverage autonomy.

AB It is widely recognized that human-driven vehicles (HVs) and connected and autonomous vehicles (CAVs) are expected to coexist and share the urban traffic infrastructure in the transportation network for a long time. To fully utilizes CAVs' potential to reduce congestion in the transitional period, this study proposes and addresses the intersection design and signal setting problem in the transportation network with mixed HVs and CAVs. Due to the difference in terms of communication technology and autonomous driving technology for HVs and CAVs, three types of intersections have been proposed to amplify the efficiency-improvement benefit from CAVs by separating CAVs from HVs in a temporal or local-spatial dimension: the conventional signalized intersection, the novel signalized intersection with a dedicated CAV phase and dedicated CAV approaches, and the intelligent signal-free intersection. The problem is to determine the spatial layout of different types of intersections in the transportation network, the cycle time, and green time duration for each phase of signalized intersections that minimize the total travel cost, in which the route choice behavior of heterogeneous travelers has been respected based on the user equilibrium principle. A mixed-integer nonlinear programming model is developed to formulate the proposed intersection design and signal setting problem based on the link-node modeling method, in which the path enumeration is avoided. Then, by employing various linearization techniques (e.g., disjunctive constraints, logarithmic transformation, piecewise linearization with logarithmic-sized binary variables and constraints, outer-approximation technique), the proposed model can be further transformed into a relaxed sub-problem in the form of mixed-integer linear programming. A globally optimal solution algorithm embedding with solving a sequence of relaxed sub-problems and nonlinear mixed complementarity problems is proposed to converge to a global optimum. The results of numerical experiments illustrate that the proposed methodology can significantly improve the performance of the whole network. Moreover, it consistently outperforms the optimization model considering only conventional signalized intersections under various CAV market penetration rates.

An off-line identification procedure, consisting of simulated manoeuvres, is defined to learn the high-level and low-level models. A closed-loop simulation is setup to control the black-box vehicle near the limits of handling along a racetrack. Simulation results are compared with the off-line solution of a minimum-time-optimal control problem.

   algorithm; safe; low energy consumption; autonomous sampling operations
AB To ensure the safety and energy efficiency of autonomous sampling operations for a deep-sea landing vehicle (DSLV), the Safety Energy-Dynamic Window Approach (SE-DWA) algorithm was proposed. The safety assessment sub-function formed from the warning obstacle zone and safety factor addresses the safety issue arising from the excessive range measurement error of forward-looking sonar. The trajectory comparison evaluation sub-function with the effect of reducing energy consumption achieves a reduction in path length by causing the predicted trajectory to deviate from the historical trajectory when encountering "U"-shaped obstacles. The pseudo-power evaluation sub-function with further energy consumption reduction ensures optimal linear and angular velocities by minimizing variables when encountering unknown obstacles. The simulation results demonstrate that compared with the Minimum Energy Consumption-DWA algorithm, the SE-DWA algorithm improves the minimum distance to an actual obstacle zone by 68% while reducing energy consumption by 11%. Both the SE-DWA algorithm and the Maximum Safety-DWA (MS-DWA) algorithm ensure operational safety with minimal distance to the actual obstacle zone, yet the SE-DWA algorithm achieves a 24% decrease in energy consumption. In conclusion, the path planned by the SE-DWA algorithm ensures not only safety but also energy consumption reduction during autonomous sampling operations by a DSLV in the deep sea.

AB Existing thruster fault diagnosis methods for AUV (autonomous underwater vehicle) usually need sufficient labeled training data. However, it is unrealistic to get sufficient labeled training data for each working condition in practice. Based on this challenge, a transferable thruster fault diagnosis approach is proposed. In the approach, an IPSE (instantaneous power spectrum entropy) and a STNED (signal-to-noise energy difference) are added to SPWVD (smoothed pseudo Wigner-Ville distribution) to identify time and frequency boundaries of the local region in the time-frequency power spectrum caused by thruster fault, forming a TFE (time-frequency energy) method for feature extraction. In addition, the RCQFFV (relative change quantity of the fault feature value), an MSN (multiple scale normalization) and a LSP (least square prediction) are added to SVDD (support vector data description) to align distributions of fault samples, contributing a TSVDD (transferable SVDD) for classification of fault samples. The experimental results of a prototype AUV indicate that the fault feature is monotonic to the percentage of thrust loss for the proposed TFE but not for the SPWVD.

AB Human-on-the-loop (HOTL) system is regarded as a promising technology to allow autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) to track the most adequate target point as soon as possible. However, the unique characteristics of the underwater environment make it challenging to perform the tracking task. This article is concerned with a finite-time tracking control issue for AUV, subjected to unavailable velocity signals in the measurement side and uncertain model parameters in physical side. A HOTL system, including operator, buoys, AUV and sensors, is first provided to construct a cooperative tracking network. For such system, operator in surface control center decides the tracking mission based on all available data. Then, a buoy-assisted localization estimator is utilized by AUV to acquire its position, through which a fast terminal sliding mode observer is developed to estimate the velocity of AUV in finite time. With the estimated velocity information, an adaptive-nonsingular fast terminal sliding mode tracking controller is designed to drive AUV to the target point in finite time. For the proposed velocity observer and tracking controller, the signum and differential functions are employed together to improve the convergence speed and reduce the chattering. Besides that, the proposed solution can not only guarantee finite-time velocity observation, but also achieve finite-time tracking control. Finally, simulation and experimental results are both presented to verify the effectiveness.

AB Surveys of behavior could benefit from information about people's relative ranking of choice alternatives. Rank ordered data are often collected in stated preference surveys where respondents are asked to rank hypothetical alternatives (rather than choose a single alternative) to better understand their relative preferences. Despite the widespread interest in collecting data on and modeling people's preferences for choice alternatives, rank-ordered data are rarely collected in travel surveys and very little progress has been made in the ability to rigorously model such data and obtain reliable parameter estimates. This paper presents a rank ordered probit modeling approach that overcomes limitations associated with prior approaches in analyzing rank ordered data. The efficacy of the rank ordered probit modeling methodology is demonstrated through an application of the model to understand preferences for alternative configurations of autonomous vehicles (AV) using the 2015 Puget Sound Regional Travel Study survey data set. The methodology offers behaviorally intuitive model results with a variety of socio-economic and demographic characteristics, including age, gender, household income, education, employment and household structure, significantly influencing preference for alternative configurations of AV adoption, ownership, and shared usage. The ability to estimate rank ordered probit models offers a pathway for better utilizing rank ordered data to understand preferences and recognize that choices may not be absolute in many instances.

AB Cruising-for-parking is a common problem in urban areas due to the limited availability of parking spaces, which leads to increased travel costs and road congestion. To address this issue, this paper proposes a shared parking allocation and guidance optimization framework for autonomous vehicles (AVs) as shared parking and autonomous driving mature. In this framework, facing multi-candidate adjacent parking lots, a rolling-horizon parking allocation model that embeds an adjustment mechanism is first established to optimize the matches dynamically. Then, a global parking routing algorithm (GPR-A*) that considers time-varying link travel times (LTTs) is developed by improving the A* shortest routing method. Results on the Xi'an urban road network show that: (i) compared with the traditional first-book-first-serve (FBFS) model, the established parking allocation model significantly increases the platform revenue and parking utilization, and decreases the travel cost in the shared parking zone; (ii) the developed GPR-A* algorithm that works with the parking allocation can reduce travel time by an average of 14.9% and 5.5% compared to static parking routing (SPR) and rolling parking routing (RPR) methods. The constructed model and algorithm should have a promising application in the intelligent vehicle parking field. (c) 2023 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

ID SEQUENCE SPREAD-SPECTRUM; COMMUNICATION
AB The Multiuser Direct Sequence Spread Spectrum (DSSS) has been proposed for the autonomous underwater vehicles (AUV) communication systems in a long transmission distance to transmit multiple users over the same channel bandwidth. Unfortunately, the DSSS data rate is limited by four users as a maximum due to the extensive multipath arrivals. This paper proposes a new scheme for the AUV communication systems called, deep learning coded index modulation-spread spectrum (DL-CIM-SS), to overcome the increasing data rate restriction of limited users number. The proposed DL-CIM-SS transmits the majority of information bits via the index of spreading code instead of transmitting all information bits physical. That doesn't only harvest more energy efficiency as the majority of information bits are not transmitted physically anymore, but also provide almost perfect detection at the receiver end. To further save the AUV energy, a pre-processing stage is added before feeding the received signal into the DL-based detector; the DL-based detector becomes environment-independent and no more training will be required during the online deployment. The proposed DL-CIM-SS performance is evaluated in this paper over simulation and measured underwater acoustic channels. The simulation results show the ability of the proposed scheme to increase the underwater acoustic data rate with significant energy efficiency improvement and low system bit and symbol error rate.

AB In this paper, a robust finite time trajectory tracking control approach is proposed for autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV), which belongs to the class of highly nonlinear, coupled dynamics with motion in 6-degrees-of-freedom (DOF). The finite-time error convergence and robust control task is accomplished by designing a non-singular fast fuzzy terminal sliding mode controller (NFFTSMC) with disturbance estimator for the 6-DOF dynamics of an AUV. The proposed NFFTSMC incorporates a non-singular fast terminal sliding mode controller (NFTSMC) which not only assures faster and finite convergence of the tracking errors to the equilibrium from anywhere in the phase portrait but also eliminates the issue of singularity dilemma appeared in conventional terminal sliding mode controller (TSMC); a fuzzy logic control (FLC) tool is employed to generate the hitting control signal in order to reduce chattering in control inputs, which commonly occur in conventional TSMC, and an estimated uncertainty term to compensate for the un-modeled dynamics, external disturbances, and time varying parameters. Furthermore to investigate the effectiveness of the proposed method, it has been extended to task space control problem of an AUV - manipulator system (AUVMS) employed for underwater manipulation tasks. Simulation studies confirms the potency of the proposed method.

AB The autonomous mobility-on-demand (AMoD) system is regarded as a promising shared mobility method for the sustainable transportation system. In addition, battery swapping could become an efficient energy-refueling means for electric vehicles (EVs). The quality-of-service aware battery swapping price determined by the battery swapping stations (BSSs) considers the interaction between AMoD fleet and BSSs, which is formulated as a bilevel optimization problem in this article. The interdependence between two systems is bridged by the swapping price that is both time-varying and location-varying. In the upper level, the swapping pricing is optimized to reflect the battery inventory so that the EV fleet could be navigated for the BSS strategically, the queue time would be reduced consequently. BSS operator optimizes swapping pricing scheme and battery charging management with the objective of minimizing the cost induced by the queue process and battery charging. In the lower level, a unified network flow model incorporating queue procedure in BSSs is proposed in order to characterize the operational decision of AMoD fleet. The AMoD operator develops fleet scheduling strategies with the objective of maximizing the AMoD system profit. An iteration-based algorithm is applied to attain the results and the effectiveness of the algorithm is validated by the real-world data from New York.

TI Impacts of shared mobility on vehicle lifetimes and on the carbon
   footprint of electric vehicles

ID LIFE-CYCLE ASSESSMENT; TRAVEL-TIME; EMISSIONS
AB Shared cars will likely have larger annual vehicle driving distances than individually owned cars. This may accelerate passenger car retirement. Here we develop a semi-empirical lifetime-driving intensity model using statistics on Swedish vehicle retirement. This semi-empirical model is integrated with a carbon footprint model, which considers future decarbonization pathways. In this work, we show that the carbon footprint depends on the cumulative driving distance, which depends on both driving intensity and calendar aging. Higher driving intensities generally result in lower carbon footprints due to increased cumulative driving distance over the vehicle's lifetime. Shared cars could decrease the carbon footprint by about 41% in 2050, if one shared vehicle replaces ten individually owned vehicles. However, potential empty travel by autonomous shared vehicles-the additional distance traveled to pick up passengers-may cause carbon footprints to increase. Hence, vehicle durability and empty travel should be considered when designing low-carbon car sharing systems.
   Shared cars are driven more, which could shorten their lifetimes. This could influence carbon dioxide emissions in car manufacturing. Sharing nonetheless reduces carbon footprints. Designing cars for durability can further enhance the benefits

AB Most vehicle controllers are developed and verified with V-model. There are several traditional methods in the automotive industry called "X-in-the-Loop (XIL)". However, the validation of advanced driver assistance system (ADAS) controllers is more complicated and needs more environmental resources because the controller interacts with the external environment of the vehicle. Vehicle-in-the-Loop (VIL) is a recently being developed approach for simulating ADAS vehicles that ensures the safety of critical test scenarios in real-world testing using virtual environments. This new test method needs both properties of traditional computer simulations and real-world vehicle tests. This paper presents a Vehicle-in-the-Loop topology for execution in global Coordinates system. Also, it has a modular structure with four parts: synchronization module, virtual environment, sensor emulator and visualizer, so each part can be developed and modified separately in combination with other parts. This structure of VIL is expected to save maintenance time and cost. This paper shows its acceptability by testing ADAS on both a real and the VIL system.

TI iCurb: Imitation Learning-Based Detection of Road Curbs Using Aerial
   Images for Autonomous Driving
SO IEEE ROBOTICS AND AUTOMATION LETTERS
LA English
DT Article
DE Road-curb Detection; Graph Representation; Imitation Learning;
   Autonomous Driving
AB Detection of road curbs is an essential capability for autonomous driving. It can be used for autonomous vehicles to determine drivable areas on roads. Usually, road curbs are detected on-line using vehicle-mounted sensors, such as video cameras and 3-D Lidars. However, on-line detection using video cameras may suffer from challenging illumination conditions, and Lidar-based approaches may be difficult to detect far-away road curbs due to the sparsity issue of point clouds. In recent years, aerial images are becoming more and more worldwide available. We find that the visual appearances between road areas and off-road areas are usually different in aerial images, so we propose a novel solution to detect road curbs off-line using aerial images. The input to our method is an aerial image, and the output is directly a graph (i.e., vertices and edges) representing road curbs. To this end, we formulate the problem as an imitation learning problem, and design a novel network and an innovative training strategy to train an agent to iteratively find the road-curb graph. The experimental results on a public dataset confirm the effectiveness and superiority of our method. This work is accompanied with a demonstration video and a supplementary document at https://tonyxuqaq.github.io/iCurb/.

AB Cooperative adaptive cruise control is recognised as an effective means to reduce the rear-end collision caused by the delayed reaction and improper driving behaviours of manually driven vehicles. However, vehicle-to-vehicle communication, as the key to collect information for the cooperative adaptive cruise control system, is likely to be interrupted by malicious attacks and equipment failures. When communication interruption occurs, sensors of the adaptive cruise control system will replace vehicle-to-vehicle communication for information collection, that is, cooperative adaptive cruise control vehicles degrade to adaptive cruise control vehicles automatically, causing an increased rear-end collision risk. This study aims to investigate the safety impact of cooperative adaptive cruise control vehicles' degradation under spatial continuous communication interruption. A mixed platoon, consisting of cooperative adaptive cruise control vehicles, adaptive cruise control vehicles, manually driven vehicles, and improved manually driven vehicles with information-sending devices, is simulated with the realistic cooperative adaptive cruise control and adaptive cruise control model, and the intelligent driver model. Different platoon forms are discussed by adjusting the quantity and position of manually driven vehicles in the mixed platoon. The results show that manually driven vehicles can effectively block the backward extension of speed fluctuation and reduce the rear-end collision risk under the spatial continuous communication interruption. Nevertheless, equipping manually driven vehicles with information-sending devices weakens the ability to defend against communication interruption.

TI Predicting Millimeter Wave Radar Spectra for Autonomous Navigation
SO IEEE SENSORS JOURNAL
LA English
DT Article
DE Millimeter wave RADAR; power range spectra; autonomous robotics
AB Millimeter Wave (MMW) radars are currently used as range measuring devices in applications such as automotive driving aids (Langer and Jochem, 1996), (Rohling and Mende, 1996), the mapping of mines (Brooker et al., 2005) and autonomous field robotics (Brooker, 2001), (Langer, 1996). This recent interest is largely due to the advantages MMW radars offer over other range measuring sensors, as their performance is less affected by dust, fog, rain or snow and ambient lighting conditions. MMW radars can provide received signal strength values, at all discrete range intervals, within the working range of the radar (Clark and Durrant-Whyte, 1997), (Scheding et al., 2002). The received power versus range spectra hence contain useful range to target information, but are also corrupted by noise. User defined stochastic algorithms can then be implemented, which exploit this rich data to improve object detection and mapping performance. This is in contrast to many other range measuring devices which typically internally threshold received signals, to provide single hard decisions only, on the estimated range to objects (Mullane, 2007).
   This paper addresses the issues of predicting the power-range spectra from MMW radars which use the Frequency Modulated Continuous Wave (FMCW) range estimation technique. This is important for two reasons. First, in automotive and autonomous robotic applications, such sensors are used in conjunction with vehicle navigation and map state estimation filters. This is so that (typically uncertain) vehicle motion knowledge can be optimally fused with the noisy sensor information, to infer estimates of the state of interest (typically, the vehicle's pose (position and orientation) and/or information of the surrounding object locations). Hence, it is essential that predicted power versus range spectra can be computed, to apply a Bayesian recursive estimation framework, based on previous measurements, and uncertain vehicle motion information. Second, it is extremely useful to be able to simulate MMW radar data, given certain environmental configurations. This aids the development of reliable object detection algorithms, based on theoretical sensor and noise models, which can then be applied more effectively to real MMW radar data.

AB This paper studies a time-varying formation control problem of a swarm of autonomous surface vehicles (ASVs) with prescribed constraints. Every ASV suffers from unavailable velocities, saturated inputs, internal uncer-tainties, and external disturbances. A distributed finite-time performance-prescribed time-varying formation control method is proposed for ASVs. Specifically, an adaptive fuzzy state observer (AFSO) is firstly proposed to recover the unavailable velocity by using saturated inputs and estimated disturbances from the fuzzy logic system. Secondly, a tunnel prescribed performance (TPP) function is designed to limit tracking errors with a concise form and smaller overshoot. At the kinematic level, with TPP-based error transformation, a C1 finite -time time-varying guidance law is proposed by using the smooth switch functions and recovered velocities. Next, a finite-time command filter based on Levant differentiator is presented to smooth the guidance signals. At the kinetic level, a C1 finite-time saturated control law is developed with the estimated velocities and disturbances. Then, it proves that tracking errors of the proposed closed-loop system converge into a small neighborhood around the equilibrium within finite time while evolving under TPP constraints regardless of saturated inputs. Finally, comparison results are provided to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed distributed finite-time performance-prescribed time-varying formation control method.

AB Autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) is widely used in complex underwater missions such as bottom survey and data collection. Multiple AUVs can cooperatively complete tasks that single AUV cannot accomplish. Recently, multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) has been introduced to improve multi-AUV control in uncertain marine environments. However, it is very difficult and even unpractical to design effective and efficient reward functions for various tasks. In this paper, we implemented multi-agent generative adversarial imitation learning (MAGAIL) from expert demonstrated trajectories for formation control and obstacle avoidance of multi-AUV. In addition, decentralized training with decentralized execution framework was adopted to alleviate the communication problem in underwater environments. Moreover, to facilitate the discriminator to accurately judge the quality of AUV's trajectory in the two tasks and increase the convergence speed, we improved upon MAGAIL by dividing the state-action pairs of expert trajectory for each AUV into two groups and updating discriminator by randomly selecting equal number of state-action pairs from both groups. Our experimental results on a simulated AUV system modeling Sailfish 210 of our lab in the Gazebo simulation environment show that MAGAIL allows control policies of multi-AUV to obtain a better performance than traditional multi-agent deep reinforcement learning from fine-tuned reward function - IPPO. Moreover, control policies trained via MAGAIL in simple tasks can generalize better to complex tasks than those trained via IPPO.

AB As autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) adoption increases, operators demand advanced behaviors from commercial off-the-shelf systems. However, new behaviors can often only be deployed operationally once assured. This paper overviews research into expediting recovery to an operator's vessel through a custom homing behavior, demonstrating technology advancement in conjunction with test and evaluation activities. Advanced docking infrastructure and frameworks are still under development, yet current AUV operations require rapid and reliable recovery when mission factors change. Homing is achieved with a directional acoustic transponder providing range and bearing data to the AUV from the operator's vessel. A converted measurement Kalman filter processes range and bearing data that generates dynamic waypoints for the AUV through MOOS-IvP as a backseat driver; a universal approach and filtering that is unique from prior AUV research. Results from simulations and field trials were analysed through a modular and experimental Test & Evaluation framework that was adopted specifically to help verify and validate the new AUV behavior, including systematic variations in recovery boat manoeuvres. The process includes documented use for the first time in AUV research of combinatorial screening (high throughput testing) and an average standardized residual metric to focus development early, encourage constructive iteration and build operational and engineering trust. Consistent homing was demonstrated with localization within 0.3 m and homing within 1.8 m of a moving digital acoustic transponder.

AB cially for the tightly-coupled mode, provides a promising autonomous tactics for Hypersonic Vehicle (HV) in military demands. However, INS/CNS integration is a challenging research task due to its special characteristics such as strong nonlinearity, non-additive noise and dynamic complexity. This paper presents a novel nonlinear filtering method for INS/CNS integration by adopting the emerging Cubature Kalman Filter (CKF) to handle the strong INS error model nonlinearity caused by HV's high dynamics. It combines the state-augmentation technique into the nonlinear CKF to decrease the negative effect of non-additive noise in inertial measurements. Subsequently, a technique for the detection of dynamic model uncertainty is developed, and the augmented CKF is modified with fading memory to tackle dynamic model uncertainty by rigorously deriving the fading factor via the theory of Mahalanobis distance without artificial empiricism. Simulation results and comparison analysis prove that the proposed method can effectively curb the adverse impacts of non-additive noise and dynamic model uncertainty for inertial measurements, leading to improved performance for HV navigation with tightly-coupled INS/CNS integration.

AB The frequency-modulated continuous-wave radar is an ideal choice for autonomous vehicle and surveillance-related industries due to its ability to measure the relative target-velocity, target-range, and target-characterization. Unlike conventional microwave radar systems, the photonic radar has the potential to offer wider bandwidth to attain high range-resolution at low input power requirements. Subsequently, a frequency-modulated continuous-wave photonic-radar is developed to measure the target-range and velocity of the automotive mobile targets concurrently with acceptable rang resolution keeping in mind the needs of the state-of-the-art autonomous vehicle industry. Furthermore, the target-identification is also an important parameter to be measured to enable the futuristic autonomous vehicles for the recognition of the objects along with their dimensions. Therefore, the reported work is extended to characterize the target-objects by measuring the specular-reflectance, diffuse-reflectance, the ratio of horizontal-axis to vertical-axis, refractive index constants of the targets using the bidirectional reflectance distribution function. Furthermore, the reflectance properties of the target-objects are also measured with different operating wavelengths at different incident angles to assess the influence of the operating wavelength and the angle at which the radar-pulses incident on the surface of the targets. Moreover, to validate the performance of the demonstrated work, a comparison is also presented in distinction with the conventional microwave FMCW-RADAR.

AB Terrain-aided navigation (TAN) holds high potential for long-term accurate navigation of autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs), and path planning algorithms are essential in TAN to decrease positioning errors by avoiding flat areas. This study proposed an AUV localization and path planning algorithm for TAN, which consists of a value function calculation and online path planning. In the value function calculation, the topographic complexity is treated as a factor that influences AUV state transition probabilities to calculate the optimal policy; meanwhile, the online path planning applies a particle filter to localize and command AUVs, and particle weights are calculated according to topographic complexity. Simulation experimental results demonstrate that this algorithm could provide paths with accurate TAN location results and good maneuvering performance. (C) 2020 ISA. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

TI Dense Moving Fog for Intelligent IoT: Key Challenges and Opportunities
SO IEEE COMMUNICATIONS MAGAZINE

DT Article
AB As the ratification of 5G New Radio technology is being completed, enabling network architectures are expected to undertake a matching effort. Conventional cloud and edge computing paradigms may thus become insufficient in supporting the increasingly stringent operating requirements of intelligent IoT devices that can move unpredictably and at high speeds. Complementing these, the concept of fog emerges to deploy cooperative cloud-like functions in the immediate vicinity of various moving devices, such as connected and autonomous vehicles, on the road and in the air. Envisioning the gradual evolution of these infrastructures toward an increasingly denser geographical distribution of fog functionality, we in this work put forward the vision of dense moving fog for intelligent IoT applications. To this aim, we review the recent powerful enablers, outline the main challenges and opportunities, and corroborate the performance benefits of collaborative dense fog operation in a characteristic use case featuring a connected fleet of autonomous vehicles.

AB This work presents a solution to localize Unmanned Autonomous Vehicles with respect to pipes and other cylindrical elements found in inspection and maintenance tasks both in industrial and civilian infrastructures. The proposed system exploits the different features of vision and laser based sensors, combining them to obtain accurate positioning of the robot with respect to the cylindrical structures. A probabilistic (RANSAC-based) procedure is used to segment possible cylinders found in the laser scans, and this is used as a seed to accurately determine the robot position through a computer vision system. The priors obtained from the laser scan registration help to solve the problem of determining the apparent contour of the cylinders. In turn this apparent contour is used in a degenerate quadratic conic estimation, enabling to visually estimate the pose of the cylinder.

AB The systematic design of an autonomous platform for robotic weeding research in arable farming is described. The long term objective of the project is the replacement of hand weeding in organic farming by a device working autonomously at field level. The distinguishing feature of the described design procedure is the use of a structured design approach, which forces the designer to systematically review and compare alternative solution options, thus preventing the selection of solutions based on prejudice or belief. The result of the design is a versatile research vehicle with a diesel engine, hydraulic transmission, four-wheel drive and four-wheel steering. The robustness of the vehicle and the open software architecture permit the investigation of a wide spectrum of research options for intra-row weed detection and weeding actuators. (C) 2009 ISTVS.

AB In this paper, the problem of the surveillance and the security of indoor environments is addressed through the development of an autonomous surveillance vehicle (ASV). The ASV has been designed to perform the object detection by adopting an image alignment method followed by a change detection operation. Hence, in addition to the classical robotic tasks (e.g., navigation and obstacle avoiding), the tracking of objects (e.g., persons) moving in an indoor environment is considered. The tracking procedure allows the ASV to maintain the interesting objects in the centre of the image, and in specific cases to focus the image acquisition on particular parts of the object (e.g., face of a person, etc.) for recognition purposes. Experimental results have been performed on different real scenarios where no objects moves inside the monitored scene and where at least one moving object is into the scene.

AB This paper presents a method for vision navigation of an autonomous vehicle by road recognition based on fuzzy reasoning. A mobile robot that operates in out-door environments requires fast image processing, noise protection, and robustness to environment changes. Some researchers use fuzzy inference for edge detection. Their idea is to classify a pixel in an original image into a border region or a uniform region according to luminance differences between the pixel and its neighboring ones. In this paper it is studied that for robot navigation some special knowledge is integrated into a fuzzy rule base to recognize road edges based on an approach for general edge extraction. This method is implemented on the THMR-III mobile robot. Some experiments show that this method yields satisfactory results in noise protection, and robustness to environment changes.

AB Object detection methods have been applied in several aerial and traffic surveillance applications. However, object detection accuracy decreases in low-resolution (LR) images owing to feature loss. To address this problem, we propose a single network, SRODNet, that incorporates both super-resolution (SR) and object detection (OD). First, a modified residual block (MRB) is proposed in the SR to recover the feature information of LR images, and this network was jointly optimized with YOLOv5 to benefit from hierarchical features for small object detection. Moreover, the proposed model focuses on minimizing the computational cost of network optimization. We evaluated the proposed model using standard datasets such as VEDAI-VISIBLE, VEDAI-IR, DOTA, and Korean highway traffic (KoHT), both quantitatively and qualitatively. The experimental results show that the proposed method improves the accuracy of vehicular detection better than other conventional methods.

AB Broad waters, harbor waters, and waterway waters make up more than 90% of autonomous underwater vehicles (AUV) navigation area, and each of them has its typical environmental characteristics. In this paper, a three-layer AUV motion planning architecture was designed to improve the planning logic of an AUV when completing complex underwater tasks. The AUV motion planning ability was trained by the improved deep deterministic policy gradient (DDPG) combined with the experience pool of classification. Compared with the traditional DDPG algorithm, the proposed algorithm is more efficient. Using the strategy obtained from the training and the motion planning architecture proposed in the paper, the tasks of AUVs searching in broad waters, crossing in waterway waters and patrolling in harbor waters were realized in the simulation experiment. The reliability of the planning system was verified in field tests.

AB A battery-less 5.8-GHz transmitter (TX), compact and lightweight enough to enable flight of similar to 90 mg honeybees and free roaming of bumblebees within their nest, was developed. The TX was coupled to a compact phased-array antenna receiver to achieve angle of arrival (AOA) estimation and bee localization through a received signal strength indicator approach (RSSI). The receiver was integrated into a commercial unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) to support autonomous position updates based on the AOA estimates and a software development kit. A simple model predicting the system detection range was finally developed and is herein discussed. Our experimental results provide proof of concept toward autonomous tracking of tagged bees both in open air and in polytunnel settings.

AB Autonomous underwater vehicles (AUV) can only operate for hours or days at a time between battery charges. Alternative power systems or in-situ charging strategies are required to extend missions. This paper presents the feasibility of a new gyroscopic wave-energy scavenging system. The energy scavenging system promises to; reduce AUV battery requirements negating the necessity to carry sufficient energy reserves (size and weight) for entire missions, reduce costs by freeing support vessel time (a major cost component in AUV deployment) and enable AUVs to be remotely and renewably recharged at sea, indefinitely extending missions. A theoretical description of the system and simulation results for a range of geometrically scaled torpedo style AUVs are presented. The results show that the generated power is sufficient to provide power for a range of AUV sensors and comparable to equivalent solar panel and wind turbine devices.

AB In this paper, we investigate the PID controller design problem of path following for an autonomous ground vehicle (AGV). Firstly, a bicycle model is adopted and a vehicle offset model from the target path is integrated to the bicycle model. The PID controller considers the vehicle longitudinal speed variation for adaption to the road curvature and the stochastic delay induced by the network communication. This is realized by transforming the tuning problem of proportional-integral-derivative (PID) gains for path following into a design problem of a static-output-feedback (SOF) controller for a time-delayed linear parameter varying (LPV) model form. A sufficient condition is adopted to guarantee the stability of the closed-loop system. In order to achieve better tracking performance, we propose a strategy in which the PID gains are piecewise constant and are dependent on the road-curvature ranges. The stability of the switched system is guaranteed via the common Lyapunov function method. Grey wolf optimizer (GWO) is employed to solve the optimization problem with maximum absolute tracking error as the optimization objective and stability condition and actuator dynamics as constraints. Both simulation results based on the CarSim-Simulink joint platform and hardware-in-loop experiment results are used to verify the effectiveness of the proposed control strategy.

DT Article
DE Autonomous vehicle; intersection; motion prediction; prior trajectories
   model; turning intention
AB Intersections are quite important and complex traffic scenarios, where the future motion of surrounding vehicles is an indispensable reference factor for the decision-making or path planning of autonomous vehicles. Considering that the motion trajectory of a vehicle at an intersection partly obeys the statistical law of historical data once its driving intention is determined, this paper proposes a long short-term memory based (LSTM-based) framework that combines intention prediction and trajectory prediction together. First, we build an intersection prior trajectories model (IPTM) by clustering and statistically analyzing a large number of prior traffic flow trajectories. The prior trajectories model with fitted probabilistic density is used to approximate the distribution of the predicted trajectory, and also serves as a reference for credibility evaluation. Second, we conduct the intention prediction through another LSTM model and regard it as a crucial cue for a trajectory forecast at the early stage. Furthermore, the predicted intention is also a key that is associated with the prior trajectories model. The proposed framework is validated on two publically released datasets, next generation simulation (NGSIM) and INTERACTION. Compared with other prediction methods, our framework is able to sample a trajectory from the estimated distribution, with its accuracy improved by about 20%. Finally, the credibility evaluation, which is based on the prior trajectories model, makes the framework more practical in the real-world applications.

DE Kalman filter; navigation; sensor fusion; agriculture
AB Implementation of an autonomous vehicle for precision treatment of crop plants is described. The navigation system integrates the vision system described in Part I with inertial and odometric sensing. A modular approach is adopted, where the crop grid observation model is re-formulated as a non-linear compression filter which combines a set of observations of crop plants into a single pseudo-observation of the position of the crop planting grid relative to the vehicle position. The compression filter encapsulates all internal detail of the vision system (camera calibration, crop layout, etc.). The output from this vision module can be used as an observation in the conventional way by the vehicle's navigation Kalman filter
   Plant features classified into crop and weed by the vision module are registered into a treatment map. The need to treat targets from a moving platform requires time delays in the processing of observations to be considered. A method of compensation is introduced which allows time delayed vision observations to be used; the effectiveness of the technique is illustrated by an example wit an artificially extended time delay.
   Infield trials of the vehicle have been performed, and the accuracy of both vehicle navigation and crop treatment are reported. We conclude that the navigation accuracy falls within the 20 mm root mean square error region thought appropriate for precise horticultural operations, and that spray application is sufficiently accurate for the treatment of individual crop plants.

AB Autonomous vehicles platooning has received considerable attention in recent years, due to its potential to significantly benefit road transportation, improving traffic efficiency, enhancing road safety and reducing fuel consumption. The Vehicular ad hoc Networks and the de facto vehicular networking standard IEEE 802.11p communication protocol are key tools for the deployment of platooning applications, since the cooperation among vehicles is based on a reliable communication structure. However, vehicular networks can suffer different security threats. Indeed, in collaborative driving applications, the sudden appearance of a malicious attack can mainly compromise: (i) the correctness of data traffic flow on the vehicular network by sending malicious messages that alter the platoon formation and its coordinated motion; (ii) the safety of platooning application by altering vehicular network communication capability. In view of the fact that cyber attacks can lead to dangerous implications for the security of autonomous driving systems, it is fundamental to consider their effects on the behavior of the interconnected vehicles, and to try to limit them from the control design stage.
   To this aim, in this work we focus on some relevant types of malicious threats that affect the platoon safety, i.e. application layer attacks (Spoofing and Message Falsification) and network layer attacks (Denial of Service and Burst Transmission), and we propose a novel collaborative control strategy for enhancing the protection level of autonomous platoons. The control protocol is designed and validated in both analytically and experimental way, for the appraised malicious attack scenarios and for different communication topology structures. The effectiveness of the proposed strategy is shown by using PLEXE, a state of the art inter-vehicular communications and mobility simulator that includes basic building blocks for platooning. A detailed experimental analysis discloses the robustness of the proposed approach and its capabilities in reacting to the malicious attack effects.

AB This article develops a four-level test system for accurately evaluating pavement compaction performance of autonomous articulated vehicles. In the evaluation layer, various performance indicators are evaluated, including the stability, rapidity and accuracy of trajectory tracking, and the ratio of required compaction to actual compaction once and twice and compaction repeatability index when pavement compaction. The guidance and control layer can be described in terms of theory and application. At the theoretical level, the line of sight guidance algorithm and incremental proportional integral control algorithm are introduced to eliminate system control lag. Among them, the best line of sight guidance and incremental proportional integral control parameters are selected by the Elitist strategies genetic algorithm, and the initial parameters are set according to human driving experience initial control parameters. At the application level, the BECKHOFF controller, a kind of programmable logic controller, acts as the main guidance and control unit in the four-level control system, fixed speed is given to the autonomous articulated vehicle by setting the engine speed and transmission gear, and steering wheel angle is adjusted in real time by the BECKHOFF controller. In the sensor level, a simplified sensor configuration is used to reduce overall cost. The comparative simulation results of no controller, the incremental proportional integral controller, line of sight guidance-incremental proportional integral controller with human driving experience initial control parameters, line of sight guidance-incremental proportional integral controller with random initial control parameters, and elitist strategies genetic algorithm-line of sight guidance-incremental proportional integral controller with human driving experience initial control parameters manifest evidently that the proposed elitist strategies genetic algorithm-line of sight guidance-incremental proportional integral controller with human driving experience initial control parameters has almost no steady-state error, no overshoot, and short settling time. Field results show that ratio of required compaction to actual compaction once achieves 100%, ratio of required compaction to actual compaction twice achieves 94.6%, and compaction repeatability index achieves 35%.

AB Based on an improved performance function and error transformation, a kind of predefined-time control method with prescribed performance is investigated for the trajectory tracking control problem of the Autonomous Underwater Vehicle (AUV). First, an improved form of performance function is proposed and the corresponding error transformation is given. The AUV trajectory tracking error is limited within the predefined boundary to ensure the expected steady-state and transient response from the perspective of constraint boundary. Then, by using the idea of predefined-time control method, a prescribed performance controller with predefined time is proposed. The convergence time of trajectory tracking error is strictly set, and the Lyapunov method is used to prove the stability of the controller. Finally, the numerical simulation results show that the proposed controller is effective.

TI COLREGS-compliant path planning considering time-varying trajectory
   uncertainty of autonomous surface vehicle
SO ELECTRONICS LETTERS
LA English
DT Article
AB A path planning approach is proposed that is in accordance with Collision Regulations (COLREGS) for avoidance of a potential collision and considers the time-varying trajectory uncertainties of an autonomous surface vehicle (ASV) and an obstacle. Unfortunately, as the motion information for each object includes various uncertainties caused by characteristics of the navigation and perception systems, the trajectory uncertainties increase linearly during the pre-specified time in a trajectory prediction process. This trajectory uncertainty is preferentially modelled using the error covariance of a tracking filter designed for estimating motion information. Subsequently, collision risk is computed using a probabilistic method, and a collision risk zone (CRZ) is configured on the predicted trajectory. Finally, a COLREGS-compliant path is planned with consideration of the dynamic characteristics of the ASV to avoid the CRZ. Simulation results that demonstrate the feasibility of the proposed approach with marine traffic examples are presented and discussed.

TI Autonomous obstacle avoidance for fixed-wing unmanned aerial vehicles
SO AERONAUTICAL JOURNAL
LA English
DT Article
ID POTENTIAL FUNCTIONS
AB This paper investigates a method for autonomous obstacle avoidance for fixed-wing unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), utilising potential fluid flow theory. The obstacle avoidance algorithm needs only compute the instantaneous local potential velocity vector, which is passed to the flight control laws as a direction command. The approach is reactive, and can readily accommodate real-time changes in obstacle information. UAV manoeuvring constraints on turning or pull-up radii, are accounted for by approximating obstacles by bounding rectangles, with wedges added to their front and back to shape the resulting fluid pathlines. It is shown that the resulting potential flow velocity field is completely determined by the obstacle field geometry, allowing one to determine a non-dimensional relationship between obstacle added wedge-length and the corresponding minimum pathline radius of curvature, which can then be readily scaled in on-board implementation. The efficacy of the proposed approach has been demonstrated numerically with an Aerosonde UAV model.

ID SYSTEMS; DIAGNOSIS
AB A controlled system can be subjected to faults, which may cause unexpected system dynamics that prevent the system objectives to be achieved. This paper introduces the problem of structural fault-tolerance analysis of actuator, sensor, and plant faults with respect to diagnosability and recoverability conditions. Existing methods in the literature usually investigate the fault tolerance of systems separately from fault diagnosis, even if they are strongly related. The bond graph (BG) tool is an adequate tool for dynamic modeling of complex systems and performing fault detection and isolation. The innovative interest of the proposed approach is to extend the use of this tool for verification of structural recoverability conditions by exploiting the behavioral, structural, and causal properties of the BG tool. The obtained structural technique is then applied to an intelligent autonomous vehicle named RobuCar with decentralized inputs and outputs.

AB This paper describes a heuristic search technique carrying out collision avoidance for autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs). Fuzzy relational products are used as the mathematical implement for the analysis and synthesis,of relations between obstacles that are met in the navigation environment and available candidate nodes. In this paper, we propose a more effective evaluation function that reflects the heuristic information of domain experts on obstacle clearance, and an advanced heuristic search method performing collision avoidance for AUVs. The search technique adopts fuzzy relational products to conduct path-planning of intelligent navigation system. In order to verify the performance of proposed heuristic search, it is compared with A* search method through simulation in view of the CPU time, the optimization of path and the amount of memory usage.

TI Traffic Oscillation using Stochastic Lagrangian Dynamics: Simulation and
   Mitigation via Control of Autonomous Vehicles
SO TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH RECORD
LA English

ID KINEMATIC WAVES; VARIATIONAL FORMULATION; FLOW; STABILITY; MODEL
AB The phenomenon of stop-and-go waves is frequently observed in congested traffic. With the development of connected and autonomous vehicle (CAV) technologies, it is possible to reduce traffic oscillation via control of CAVs in a mixed traffic flow with both human drivers and autonomous vehicles (AVs). This paper introduces a stochastic Lagrangian model which is capable of simulating stop-and-go traffic considering the heterogeneity of drivers. The sample paths of the stochastic process are smooth without aggressive oscillation. The model is further extended to the mixed traffic flow condition, considering stochastic human driving behavior and deterministic behavior of AVs. With the proposed model, the variation of performance of AV control strategies can be quantified in addition to the average performance. A numerical example with a single lane circular road is used to investigate the impact of the AV control strategy on mitigating stop-and-go waves. Both qualitative and quantitative results show that the phenomenon of stop-and-go waves can be reduced significantly with only one AV, while the increase of AVs from 10% (two AVs) to 50% (10 AVs) offers just marginal improvement in relation to the ensemble-averaged performance and 95% confidence interval of the ensemble-averaged performance. The proposed simulation approach based on the stochastic Lagrangian model can effectively investigate the impact of AV control strategies on traffic oscillation, considering in particular the uncertainty of human driver behavior.

AB This article addresses multitarget circumnavigation with autonomous surface vehicles (ASVs) subject to model nonlinearities, environmental disturbances, and physical constraints in the presence of stationary/moving obstacles. A neurodynamics-driven distributed optimization method is proposed to achieve safety-certified cooperative circumnavigation guided by multiple targets. Specifically, a cooperative circumnavigation guidance law based on a finite-time distributed observer is designed for surrounding multiple targets. Based on the geometric characteristics of multitarget circumnavigation, three collision-avoidance rules are formulated with respect to obstacles, targets, and ASVs; and three types of control barrier functions are derived to encode the coupled safety constraints into state constraints. A distributed command governor optimization problem is formulated to generate optimal commanded guidance signals within the globally coupled state constraints. To compute optimal commands in real time, multiple recurrent neural networks (RNNs) are employed to solve a distributed optimization problem. An event-triggered communication scheme is designed for the communication among RNNs with reduced communication burden. A predictor-based fuzzy control law is designed to track safe velocity commands. The closed-loop system is proven to be input-to-state stable. Simulation results are elaborated to demonstrate the effectiveness of the safety-certified control method for ASVs to circumnavigate multiple targets with guaranteed safety.

AB Autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) or gliders are increasingly being used with acoustic telemetry to elucidate fish movements while collecting simultaneous environmental data. We assessed the utility of an AUV equipped with an integrated acoustic receiver to detect Pacific herring (Clupea pallasii) in Prince William Sound, AK, USA. A range test evaluated the effect of glider flight characteristics and environmental conditions on the detection efficiency of transmitters at varying depths. While distance from transmitters was the strongest predictor of detections, glider depth had a variable effect on detection efficiency which depended on transmitter depth and dive orientation. The detection efficiency of the glider-mounted acoustic receiver was less affected by wind speed and water level than that of stationary acoustic receivers deployed within the study area. The AUV also performed repeated, adaptive transects in an area of similar to 630 km(2) area and detected 30 Pacific herring transmitters without a priori knowledge of their locations. Of these herring transmitters, 14 were presumed shed after repeated detections within the same area, and 2 were detected at multiple locations. This study is the first to demonstrate that glider-mounted acoustic receivers have high detection efficiency for transmitters at varying depths and can detect movements of migratory forage fish in large search areas.

AB There have been many surveys of public responses to Autonomous Vehicles (AVs), both reported in peer-reviewed journals and in the mainstream media.
   People anchor their representations of novel technological objects within their existing experience. What elements of such experience anchor AVs? We review academic English language survey studies from 2015 to 2017 and surveys publicised in UK National newspapers which typically reveal discomfort about the prospect of AVs. Against this background we report the results of our own survey of 11,827 drivers across 11 European countries, addressing attitudes to driving alongside AVs as well as to riding in them. We establish a composite indicator of perceptions of AVs that combines responses on using AVs and sharing the road with them, and analyse its relationship with a set of covariate measures. Respondents' technological optimism and uptake of driving technology was associated with more positive perceptions of AVs, and measures of respondents' enjoyment of driving, and how 'sociable' they were towards fellow road users, was associated with more negative perceptions. The negative association between driving 'sociability' and enthusiasm for AVs was attenuated by levels of general technological optimism. We discuss the difficulties in researching public responses to novel technological objects and make suggestions for improvement in future survey research on AVs.

AB In order to achieve the functional requirements of multi-moving state, a new autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) provided with the functions such as the submarine vectorial thrust, landing on the sea bottom, wheel driving on the ground and crawling on the ground was designed. Then five new theories and methods were proposed about the motion mechanism of the AUV such as vectorial thruster technology, design of a new wheel propeller, kinematics and dynamics, navigation control and the ambient flow field in complex sea conditions, which can all conquer conventional technique shortages and predict the multi-moving state performance under wave disturbance. The theoretical research can realize the results such as a vectorial transmission shaft with the characteristics of spatial deflexion and continual circumgyratetion, parameterized design of the new wheel propeller with preferable open-water performance and intensity characteristics satisfying multi-moving state requirements, motion computation and kinetic analysis of AUV's arbitrary postures under wave disturbance, a second-order sliding mode controller with double-loop structure based on dynamic boundary layer that ensures AUV's trajectory high-precision tracking performance under wave disturbance, fast and exact prediction of the ambient flow field characteristics and the interaction mechanism between AUV hull and wheel propellers. The elaborate data obtained from the theoretical research can provide an important theoretical guidance and technical support for the manufacture of experimental prototype.

   Flapping-wing flight; payload-capable; prototype design; unmanned

AB Autonomous lightweight flapping-wing robots show potential to become a safe and affordable solution for rapidly deploying robots around humans and in complex environments. The absence of propellers makes such vehicles more resistant to physical contact, permitting flight in cluttered environments, and collaborating with humans. Importantly, the provision of thousands of species of birds that have already mastered the challenging task of flapping flight is a rich source of solutions. However, small wing flapping technology is still in its beginnings, with limited levels of autonomy and physical interaction capability with the environment. One significant limitation to this is the low payload available. Here we show the Eagle-inspired Flapping-wing robot E-Flap, a 510 g novel design capable of a 100% of payload, exceeding the requirement of the computing and sensing package needed to fly with a high degree of autonomy. The concept is extensively characterized, both in a tracked indoor space and in outdoor conditions. We demonstrate flight path angle of up to 50 degrees and velocities from as low as 2 m/s to over 6 m/s. Overall, the robotic platform has been proven to be reliable, having performed over 100 flights. Through mechanical and electronics advances, the E-Flap is a robust vehicle prototype and paves the way towards flapping-wing robots becoming a practical fully autonomous flying solution.

AB This paper investigates the problem of cooperative path following for a fleet of underactuated autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) with uncertain nonlinear dynamics. Path following controllers for individual AUVs are developed to ensure that each AUV converges to the desired position. The coordination mission is completed by reaching synchronization on a suitably defined path variable, even in the presence of partial knowledge of the reference speed. The key features of the proposed cooperative path following design scheme can be summarized as follows. First, the command filter design technique based cooperative path following control strategy is derived by introducing compensating error signals to remove the requirement of the higher derivative of reference signal, and a simplified cooperative path following controller is proposed. Second, a smoothly switching function is designed to yield neural network (NN) based energy-efficient controller. Third, by designing the distributed speed estimator, the global knowledge of the reference speed is relaxed. Finally, all the signals in the closed-loop system are guaranteed to be globally uniformly ultimately bounded (GUUB) under the proposed algorithm, and the path following error is proven to converge to a small neighborhood of the origin. Simulation example is provided to validate the performance of the control strategy. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB The multi-jointed autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) has higher manoeuvrability and a smaller turning radius in comparison with an AUV with a rigid body. It is able to implement spatially denser sample collection in three-dimensional space in the deep ocean for scientific expeditions. As conventional positioning approaches, such as ultra-short-baseline and long-baseline, cannot be employed to obtain the coordinates of a multi-jointed AUV, because they only work with constant baselines, a novel underwater acoustic positioning system with a single beacon and a varied baseline is proposed. The coordinate transformation based on the angles of rotating joints and the geometry of the multi-jointed AUV is mathematically modelled. Generalised cross-correlation is applied to measure the time delays of sound signals between the beacon and the hydrophones on the AUV. Numerical simulations and experiments in an anechoic water tank were carried out, and the impacts of parameters on the accuracy of the estimated coordinates of the multi-jointed AUV are examined. Accuracies of 0.86% in simulation and 0.2 m (at a range of 30 m) in experiments are demonstrated.

AB A micro air vehicle with a bird-mimetic up-down and twisting wing drive system was developed in this study. The Flapping-wing Micro Air Vehicle (FMAV), with a 50 cm wingspan and a double-crank drive system, performed successful flights of up to 23 min. The performance and capabilities of the FMAV were enhanced by adapting a number of unique features, such as a bird-mimetic wing shape with a span-wise camber and an up-down and twisting wing drive mechanism with double-crank linkages. This lift-enhancing design by mimicking the flapping mechanism of a bird's wing enabled the 210 g FMAV to fly autonomously in an outdoor field under wind speeds of less than 5 m.s(-1). Autonomous flight was enabled by installing a flight control computer with a micro-electro-mechanical gyroscope and accelerometers, along with a micro video camera and an ultralight wireless communication system inside the fuselage. A comprehensive wind tunnel test shows that the FMAV with a high-camber wing and double-crank mechanism generates more lift and less net thrust than the FMAV with a flat wing and single-crank mechanism, which confirms the improved performance of the developed FMAV, as well as the superior slow flying or hovering capabilities of the FMAV with a high-camber wing and double-crank wing drive system.

AB High altitude air-launched autonomous underwater vehicle (AL-AUV) is a new anti-submarine field, which is designed on the Lockheed Martin's high altitude anti-submarine warfare weapons concept (HAAWC) and conducts the basic aerodynamic feasibility in a series of wind tunnel trials. The AL-AUV is composed of a traditional torpedo-like AUV, an additional ex-range gliding wings unit and a descending parachute unit. In order to accurately and conveniently investigate the dynamic and static characteristic of high altitude AL-AUV, a simulation platform is established based on MATLAB/SIMULINK and an AUV 6DOF (Degree of Freedom) dynamic model. Executing the simulation platform for different wing's parameters and initial fixing angle, a set of AUV gliding data is generated. Analyzing the recorded simulation result, the velocity and pitch characteristics of AL-AUV deployed at varying wing areas and initial setting angle, the optimal wing area is selected for specific AUV model. Then the comparative simulations of AL-AUV with the selected wings are completed, which simulate the AUV gliding through idealized windless air environment and gliding with Dryden wind influence. The result indicates that the method of wing design and simulation with the simulation platform based on SIMULINK is accurately effective and suitable to be widely employed.

AB Autonomous Underwater Vehicles (AUVs) have emerged as pivotal tools for intricate underwater missions, spanning seafloor exploration to meticulous inspection of subsea infrastructures such as pipelines and cables. Although terrestrial obstacle avoidance paradigms exhibit proficiency, their efficacy diminishes in aquatic environments due to the nuanced challenges and distinct dynamics inherent to marine realms and AUV maneuvering. This paper presents an advanced obstacle avoidance algorithm for AUVs based on a stream function framework. Central to this approach is the utilization of a stream function, further nuanced by a radial histogram that serves as the defining cost function. This work also encapsulates constraints related to the maximum allowed path curvature, ensuring enhanced path optimization. Comprehensive simulation results validate the robustness and adaptability of the introduced strategy, evincing its capacity to outline both practicable and optimal evasion trajectories across diverse operational contexts.

ID CAMERA
AB Multimodal sensor systems require precise calibration if they are to be used in the field. Due to the difficulty of obtaining the corresponding features from different modalities, the calibration of such systems is an open problem. We present a systematic approach for calibrating a set of cameras with different modalities (RGB, thermal, polarization, and dual-spectrum near infrared) with regard to a LiDAR sensor using a planar calibration target. Firstly, a method for calibrating a single camera with regard to the LiDAR sensor is proposed. The method is usable with any modality, as long as the calibration pattern is detected. A methodology for establishing a parallax-aware pixel mapping between different camera modalities is then presented. Such a mapping can then be used to transfer annotations, features, and results between highly differing camera modalities to facilitate feature extraction and deep detection and segmentation methods.

AB Cognitive automobiles acquire an internal representation of the driving environment through perception and interpretation of video- and lidar-data. This knowledge serves as a basis for decision and control of driving behavior that is appropriate in the perceived driving situation. Probabilistic models enable a consistent representation of the acquired sensor information and its uncertainty. In this context, symbolic knowledge on the traffic situation may be formulated probabilistically and inferred using Markov Logic Networks. Beyond skill- and rule-based behavior the concept of knowledge-based methods allow to specify values and goals. The task of behavior decision then reduces to the selection of the behavior alternative that fulfils the preset goals to the highest expected degree. Preliminary results include an experimental vehicle that conducts first autonomous maneuvers and that has entered the finals of the Urban Challenge competition.

AB A synchronous motion-based control strategy for unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) landing on an unmanned surface vehicle (USV) is proposed to address the problem of low accuracy or even failure of UAV landing on the surface of a USV under wave action. Firstly, the landing marks are identified and localized based on computer vision; secondly, the USV attitude angle is predicted based on a bidirectional long-short term memory (Bi-LSTM) neural network to ensure that the UAV can respond to USV attitude changes in real-time; furthermore, the UAV attitude controller is designed based on a PID algorithm to realize UAV-USV synchronous motion. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed UAV-USV synchronous motion landing scheme with high landing accuracy is more suitable for the UAV to achieve autonomous landing on a USV in a complex marine environment.

AB In this paper, a new outlier-robust Student's t based Gaussian approximate filter is proposed to address the heavy-tailed process and measurement noises induced by the outlier measurements of velocity and range in cooperative localization of autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs). The state vector, scale matrices, and degrees of freedom (DOF) parameters are jointly estimated based on the variational Bayesian approach by using the constructed Student's t based hierarchical Gaussian state-space model. The performances of the proposed filter and existing filters are tested in the cooperative localization of an AUV through a lake trial. Experimental results illustrate that the proposed filter has better localization accuracy and robustness than existing state-of-the-art outlier-robust filters.

AB An adaptive fixed-time backstepping control is proposed to achieve the three-dimensional trajectory tracking control of an underactuated autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) in the presence of model uncertainty and external disturbances. In this paper, the dynamics of the AUV in terms of five degrees of freedom (DOFs) are discussed. Considering it is an underactuated AUV, a virtual velocity guidance law is derived using the back -stepping method. For velocity convergence, an adaptive fixed-time control is derived without model parameters, with adaptive adjusting law tackling system unknows. Theoretical analyses demonstrate that the tracking error converges to a small bounded field within a fixed time in the proposed control scheme. The effectiveness and superiority of the proposed method are verified by simulation results.

The study aims to understand the impact process in AUV docking with the dock and derive a number of probable suggestions. To realise this objective, a dynamic model with impact is established in the commercial software ADAMS after identifying relevant forces especially obtaining hydrodynamic coefficients and completing impact configurations. Based on the proposed dynamic model, five interesting influence elements are discussed respectively. A pool trial was conducted, and experiment results are compared with the corresponding simulation data to validate the model. Several effective suggestions are proposed for the designs of the docking system and the docking control of the companion AUV.

SO MATHEMATICAL PROBLEMS IN ENGINEERING
LA English
DT Article
ID AUV
AB During a constant depth maneuver of an autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV), its pitch attitude and stern plane deflections create forces and moments to achieve equilibrium in the vertical plane. If an AUV has a proportional controller only in its depth control loop, then different weights or centers of gravity will cause different steady-state depth errors at trimmed conditions. In general, a steady-state depth error can be eliminated by adding an integral controller in the depth control loop. However, an improper integrator may lead to a bad transient response, even though the steady-state depth error can finally be eliminated. To remove the steady-state depth error, this study proposes methods that adjust the depth command and add a switching integral controller in the depth control loop. Simulation results demonstrate that the steady-state depth error can be eliminated and the transient response can be improved.

AB This paper presents an output-sensitive event-triggered communication (ETC) scheme for the security path tracking control of autonomous ground vehicles (AGVs) while considering stochastic false data injection (FDI) attacks. In order to adjust the event-triggered threshold according to only available output measurements dynamically, a novel output-sensitive ETC scheme is proposed that can make better use of network resources when implementing path tracking control actions. Then, by considering a class of stochastic FDI attacks, the discrete sampled-data control model is transformed into time-delay system based on the available output measurements. By virtue of Lyapunov stability theory and linear matrix inequality techniques, sufficient criterions on both stability analysis and controller synthesis are well derived. At last, some simulation experiments demonstrate the validity of the proposed security control scheme.(c) 2022 The Franklin Institute. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB This paper studies the reliable H-infinity path following control problem for an autonomous ground vehicle (AGV) in spite of actuator faults and finite frequency disturbances, the efficiency coefficient of actuator is assumed to be an unknown positive scalar whose minimum possible value is also unknown. The nonlinear AGV system is modeled as a linear parameter varying (LPV) system, and an adaptive mechanism together with a finite frequency H-infinity control strategy is introduced to reject the effects of actuator faults and disturbances, respectively. Furthermore, the finite frequency performance is analysed using Lyapunov theory and Parseval's Theorem which is formulated as a set of linear matrix inequalities(LMIs). Finally, an example is presented to verify the approach proposed in this paper. (C) 2020 The Franklin Institute. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB This paper investigates the possibility of augmenting an Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) navigation system with a passive video camera in order to cope with long-term GPS outages. The paper proposes a vision-based navigation architecture which combines inertial sensors, visual odometry, and registration of the on-board video to a geo-referenced aerial image. The vision-aided navigation system developed is capable of providing high-rate and drift-free state estimation for UAV autonomous navigation without the GPS system. Due to the use of image-to-map registration for absolute position calculation, drift-free position performance depends on the structural characteristics of the terrain. Experimental evaluation of the approach based on offline flight data is provided. In addition the architecture proposed has been implemented on-board an experimental UAV helicopter platform and tested during vision-based autonomous flights. Copyright (C) 2009 G. Conte and P.

AB In order to ensure the safety of the autopilot system, this article analyzes the causes of motion blur from the perspective of camera imaging principles and uses the relationship between the coordinate systems to determine the position of a certain point in the three-dimensional space in the pixel coordinate system. Finally, the degree of motion blur is determined by calculating the displacement of the pixel points per unit time and assigning weights to them using a Gaussian function. The results show that the degree of motion blur increases from the center of the image to the sides, and it is positively correlated with the motion speed in general. This is used to determine the critical speed of safe driving, providing a way to improve the safety of the open-pit mining autopilot system further.

AB The last decade has witnessed important advancements in the field of computer vision and scene understanding, enabling applications such us autonomous vehicles. Radar is a commonly adopted sensor in automotive industry, but its suitability to machine learning techniques still remains an open question. In this work, we propose a neural network (NN) based solution to efficiently process radar data. We introduce RadarPCNN, an architecture specifically designed for performing semantic segmentation on radar point clouds. It uses PointNet++ as a building-block-enhancing the sampling stage with mean-shift-and an attention mechanism to fuse information. Additionally, we propose a machine learning radar pre-processing module that confers the network the ability to learn from radar features. We show that our solutions are effective, yielding superior performance than the state-of-the-art.

AB This paper describes a new method for classifying three-dimensional environments in real time using Kohonen self-organizing maps (SOMs). The method has been developed to enable autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) to navigate without human intervention in previously unexplored subsea environments, but can be generalized to unmanned aircraft equipped with appropriate sensors flying over unchartered terrains, or spacecraft exploring remote planets, subject to appropriate pre-mission training. The method involves a fuzzy comparison between a SOM created in real time using accumulated sensor data and a class atlas of SOMs derived from previously trained and manually classified environments. This enables mission- and environment-appropriate AUV navigation strategies to be selected in real time. Simulation results using real-world, three-dimensional environment data acquired from digital elevation maps are presented, which demonstrate the potential of the method.

AB Battery thermal management (BTM) plays a significant role in the safety and reliability of autonomous underwater vehicles (AUV) at higher speeds. In this study, a nanoparticle/phase change material (nano-PCM) composite is proposed for the BTM of an AUV. The effects of nanoparticle loading percentage (phi = 5, 10, and 15%) and nanoparticle filling range (alpha = 30, 60, 90, and 120 degrees) on the battery temperature and PCM melting were investigated numerically. Two criteria for the dimensionless temperature control performance (TCP) factor and dimensionless heat storage performance (HSP) factor were used to evaluate the influence of various variables on the BTM performance. The results show that increasing the nanoparticle loading percentage improves the effective thermal conductivity of the PCM but reduces the overall effective latent heat. An optimal nanoparticle filling range of alpha = 60 degrees. is recommended to accelerate the overall melting rate of the PCM. Compared with those of the pure PCM-based BTM, the TCP rate and TCP density are enhanced by 14.56% and 26.75%, respectively, at alpha = 60 degrees. The HSP rate increases by 2.84% but the HSP density reduces by 11.85% at alpha = 60 degrees. These findings can provide a reference for the accurate design of nano-PCM composites for the BTM of AUVs.

AB Autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) is a key mobile node in the ocean observation network. However, the limited endurance capacity and limited cruising range have become the bottlenecks in the wide application of the AUVs. In order to extend cruising range, this article develops a uniform power inductive power transfer (IPT) system for AUVs. A novel magnetic coupler with a low output fluctuation, low weight of receiver and a low space occupation of the AUV is proposed in this article. The proposed magnetic structure employing a quadruple-coil transmitter and a crossed dipole receiver utilizes uniform horizontal magnetic flux to establish stable coupling against rotational and axial misalignment. An IPT circuit topology is designed and analyzed in detail, meanwhile, the phase difference of the excitation currents is optimized to achieve the power and efficiency stability versus misalignments. The proposal is analyzed, established, and tested in this article. The magnetic receiver weighs only 414 g. The results show that the prototype can deliver 964.7 W with a dc-dc efficiency of 90.9%. In the process of rolling dislocation from -20 degrees to 20 degrees and axial dislocation from -30 mm to 30 mm, the maximum fluctuation of output power is 12.1% and 20.2%, respectively.

AB Autonomous vehicles (AVs) hold considerable promise for maintaining aging adults' mobility as they develop impairments in driving skill. Nonetheless, attitudes can be a significant barrier to adoption as has been shown for other technologies. We investigated how different introductions to AV, video with a driver in the front seat, the rear seat, and a written description, affected attitudes, as well as how individual difference variables such as age, gender, prior knowledge, and personality traits predict attitudes within a middle-aged (Median age = 34, IQR = 20, n = 441) Amazon Mechanical Turk sample. The 16-item attitude survey uncovered three factors: Concern with AV, Eagerness to Adopt AV technology, and Willingness to Relinquish Driving Control. ANOVAs showed that only age (younger less concerned) and gender, (females more concerned) were significant factors in Concern with AV. Only gender affected Willingness to Relinquish Driving Control, with males more willing. Multiple regressions that included previous knowledge level and personality traits showed a different pattern. Female gender and greater conscientiousness were associated with greater Concern about AV. Prior knowledge of AV was associated with less concern. Emotional stability and openness to experience were positive predictors of Eagerness to Adopt AV, whereas conscientiousness was a negative predictor. Prior knowledge and openness to experience, positively, and extraversion, negatively, were associated with being willing to relinquish driving control. These results suggest that different information dissemination campaigns are needed to persuade consumers to adopt AV technology. We discuss potential approaches.

In combination, these technologies can overcome data collection and maintenance problems of in situ monitoring in remote and extreme environments. Precision localisation in support of maximum efficiency mid-range inductive power transfer when recharging devices and increased throughput between drone and device are needed for data intensive monitoring applications, and to balance proximity time for devices powered by supercapacitors that recharge in seconds. The platform described in this article incorporates ultra-wideband technology to achieve high-performance ranging and high data throughput. It enables the development of a new localisation system that is experimentally shown to improve accuracy by around two orders of magnitude to 10 cm with respect to GNSS and achieves almost 6 Mbps throughput in both lab and field conditions. These results are supported by extensive modelling and analysis. The platform is designed for application flexibility, and therefore includes a wide range of sensors and expansion possibilities, with source code for two applications made immediately available as part of a open source project to support research and development in this new area.

ID MOTION
AB For autonomous vehicles to achieve terrain navigation, obstacles must be discriminated from terrain before any path planning and obstacle avoidance activity is undertaken. In this paper, a novel approach to obstacle detection has been developed. The method finds obstacles in the 2D image space, as opposed to 3D reconstructed space, using optical flow. Our method assumes that both nonobstacle terrain regions, as well as regions with obstacles, will be visible in the imagery. Therefore, our goal is to discriminate between terrain regions with obstacles and terrain regions without obstacles. Our method uses new visual linear invariants based on optical flow. Employing the linear invariance property, obstacles can be directly detected by using reference flow lines obtained from measured optical flow. The main features of this approach are: (1) 2D visual information (i.e., optical flow) is directly used to detect obstacles; no range, 3D motion, or 3D scene geometry is recovered; (2) knowledge about the camera-to-ground coordinate transformation is not required; (3) knowledge about vehicle (or camera) motion is not required; (4) the method is valid for the vehicle (or camera) undergoing general six-degree-of-freedom motion; (5) the error sources involved are reduced to a minimum, because the only information required is one component of optical flow. Numerous experiments using both synthetic and real image data are presented. Our methods are demonstrated in both ground and air vehicle scenarios.

AB This paper proposes a control strategy for the design of an automated steering control for an autonomous electric vehicle. The proposed Active Disturbance Rejection Control (ADRC) with Model Predective Control (MPC) is not only capable of alleviating the disturbance but also shows robustness against structured uncertainties which may arise due to models that represent the vehicle dynamics. Simulations have been carried out to assess the effectiveness of the proposed control strategy. Simulation results show that the proposed scheme is better in terms of tracking performance than MPC and ADRC. The steering control system, with the proposed strategy, can achieve faster response, higher tracking accuracy, and improved robustness performance in dealing with model uncertainties and external disturbances.

AB A key research subject in the area of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) is how to make them autonomous. Towards this goal, the most vital step is stabilizing the attitude of the vehicles. This paper presents the design of an autonomous control system for a hybrid UAV to enable it to carry out a stable hovering mission under external wind disturbances. The hovering capability of the hybrid UAV under windy conditions is analysed with computational fluid dynamics (CFD) and a control law is designed to stabilize the craft in the hovering position. The proposed hovering controller is verified with simulations and experiments. Finally, the flight control system is installed in a small prototype and a full transition flight test, including vertical take-off, transition from vertical flight to cruise, cruise, transition cruise to vertical mode and hover landing, is successfully accomplished.

DE Responsibility; Military autonomous robots; Unmanned aerial vehicles
AB The prospect of increasingly autonomous military robots has raised concerns about the obfuscation of human responsibility. This papers argues that whether or not and to what extent human actors are and will be considered to be responsible for the behavior of robotic systems is and will be the outcome of ongoing negotiations between the various human actors involved. These negotiations are about what technologies should do and mean, but they are also about how responsibility should be interpreted and how it can be best assigned or ascribed. The notion of responsibility practices, as the paper shows, provides a conceptual tool to examine these negotiations as well as the interplay between technological development and the ascription of responsibility. To illustrate the dynamics of responsibility practices the paper explores how the introduction of unmanned aerial vehicles has led to (re)negotiations about responsibility practices, focusing particularly on negotiations within the US Armed Forces.

TI Guidance of Autonomous Amphibious Vehicles for Flood Rescue Support
SO MATHEMATICAL PROBLEMS IN ENGINEERING
LA English
DT Article
AB We develop a path-planning algorithm to guide autonomous amphibious vehicles (AAVs) for flood rescue support missions. Specifically, we develop an algorithm to control multiple AAVs to reach/rescue multiple victims (also called targets) in a flood scenario in 2D, where the flood water flows across the scene and the targets move (drifted by the flood water) along the flood stream. A target is said to be rescued if an AAV lies within a circular region of a certain radius around the target. The goal is to control the AAVs such that each target gets rescued while optimizing a certain performance objective. The algorithm design is based on the theory of partially observable Markov decision process (POMDP). In practice, POMDP problems are hard to solve exactly, so we use an approximation method called nominal belief-state optimization (NBO). We compare the performance of the NBO approach with a greedy approach.

ID STABILIZATION
AB This paper addresses the problem of dynamic positioning and way-point tracking of underactuated autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) in the presence of constant unknown ocean currents and parametric modelling uncertainty. A non-linear adaptive controller is proposed that steers an AUV along a sequence of way-points consisting of desired positions (x, y) in a inertial reference frame, followed by vehicle positioning at the final target point. The controller is first derived at the kinematic level assuming that the ocean current disturbance is known. An exponential observer for the current is then designed and convergence of the resulting closed-loop system trajectories is analysed. Finally, integrator backstepping and Lyapunov based techniques are used to extend the kinematic controller to the dynamic case and to deal with model parameter uncertainty. Simulation results with a dynamic model of an underactuated autonomous underwater shuttle for the transport of benthic labs are presented and discussed.

AB A high quality Inertial Navigation System (INS) combined with a Doppler Velocity Log (DVL) is a common approach for Autonomous Underwater Vehicle (AUV) navigation. In this paper, a novel backtracking navigation scheme is employed. In the case of only when an initial position and the velocity of DVL are available, a precise current position can be obtained when finishing the backtracking. Therefore, AUV can be launched without waiting for the completeness of the alignment. In addition, a newly derived INS error model is employed to reduce the volume of the data that has to be recorded for the backtracking and to estimate the INS biases. With the proposed method, INS/DVL integration is able to reach the accuracy of within 0.3% of the distance travelled. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB This paper describes a method for estimating sensor biases by using a low-dimensional Unscented Kalman Filter (UKF) to maintain the positional estimation accuracy of an autonomous vehicle (AV). It is difficult to estimate attitude accurately in a blind situation (such as with no GPS satellites and no landmarks), because of sensor bias. We developed a dead reckoning system for an embedded system using the UKF. The UKF has high computational effort, so, we decreased the number of dimensions in the UKF by excluding sensor biases term. On the presumption that AV drives steadily, we derived equations for the relationship between the averages of angular acceleration and gyro bias, and corrected the sensor output. Instead of using high-dimensional UKF, we corrected sensor biases by using these equations. This method quickly and accurately estimated attitude.

AB We present the motion planning framework for in autonomous vehicle navigating through urban environments. Such environments present a number of motion planning challenges, including ultrareliability, high-speed operation, complex intervehicle interaction, parking in large unstructured lots, and constrained maneuvers. Our approach combines a model-predictive trajectory generation algorithm for computing dynamically feasible actions with two higher level planners for generating long-range plans in both on-road and unstructured areas of the environment. In the first part of this article, we describe the underlying trajectory generator and the on-road planning component of this system. We then describe the unstructured planning component of this system used for navigating through parking lots and recovering from anomalous on-road scenarios. Throughout, we provide examples and results from "Boss," an autonomous sport utility vehicle that has driven itself over 3,000 km and competed in, and won, the DARPA Urban Challenge.

TI Autonomous driving in urban environments: Boss and the Urban Challenge
SO JOURNAL OF FIELD ROBOTICS
LA English
DT Article
AB Boss is an autonomous vehicle that uses on-board sensors (global positioning system, lasers, radars, and cameras) to track other vehicles, detect static obstacles, and localize itself relative to a road model. A three-layer planning system combines mission, behavioral, and motion planning to drive in urban environments. The mission planning layer considers which street to take to achieve a mission goal. The behavioral layer determines when to change lanes and precedence at intersections and performs error recovery maneuvers. The motion planning layer selects actions to avoid obstacles while making progress toward local goals. The system was developed from the ground up to address the requirements of the DARPA Urban Challenge using a spiral system development process with a heavy emphasis on regular, regressive system testing. During the National Qualification Event and the 85-km Urban Challenge Final Event, Boss demonstrated some of its capabilities, qualifying first and winning the challenge.

AB The aim of the research was to develop an Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) hardware and software which can control a small size UAV (with 1-10 kg takeoff weight) from takeoff to landing. The research was based on AERObot V5 autopilot, developed and tested previously by us. AERObot can control a chosen aerial vehicle on a predefined route and altitude reliably but requires manual talceoff and landing. The speciality of the new takeoff and landing methods is that they do not need any additional RF guidance transmitter, onboard radio/ultrasonic altimeter or special navigation marker points. Using only the existing onboard sensors (GPS, Inertial, Measurement Unit - IMU, barometric airspeed meter, barometric altimeter) AERObot can safely take off and land the UAV under the specified weather limitations for the aerial vehicle frame.

LA English
DT Article
DE Unmanned Aerial Vehicle; Quadrotor; Helicopter; Flight stability;
   Aircraft dynamics
AB The application of rotorcraft to autonomous load carrying and transport is a new frontier for Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs). This task requires that hovering vehicles remain stable and balanced in flight as payload mass is added to the vehicle. If payload is not loaded centered or the vehicle properly trimmed for offset loads, the robot will experience bias forces that must be rejected. In this paper, we explore the effect of dynamic load disturbances introduced by instantaneously increased payload mass and how those affect helicopters and quadrotors under Proportional-Integral-Derivative flight control. We determine stability bounds within which the changing mass-inertia parameters of the system due to the acquired object will not destabilize these aircraft with this standard flight controller. Additionally, we demonstrate experimentally the stability behavior of a helicopter undergoing a range of instantaneous step payload changes.

AB This article presents a novel algorithm for autonomous parking vehicles (AVs). The idea is driven by the fact that AVs are the face of the future, and for their sustenance, the environment must be suitable for enduring technological advancements. This manuscript ensures the proper utilization of the parking space of AVs, and the proposed algorithm ensures the consideration of appropriate criterion information to be withheld from the focus. For it, the presented manuscript introduces the notion of the adjustable probabilistic neutrosophic hesitant fuzzy set (Ad-PNHFS). This set can tackle the hesitant information considering corresponding probability values but with adjustable capacities. These capacities offer the decision-maker the liberty to choose over two sets of operational laws based on the specific tolerance level. Ad-PNHFSs eliminate the existing dubiety on treating the probabilities and avoid them from attaining the zero value in the state of multiple hesitant values. In developing the advanced functionalities of the proposed set, this manuscript focuses on presenting the adjustable probabilistic neutrosophic hesitant Einstein weighted average (Ad-PNHFEWA) as well as geometric (Ad-PNHFEWG) aggregation operators (AOs). An efficient decision-making (DM) approach has been proposed by introducing a weight determination model. The process is applied to the parking of AVs, and its comparisons are made with the existing theories.

ID REFERENCE ADAPTIVE-CONTROL; OF-THE-ART; PATH TRACKING
AB This paper aims to enhance the lateral path tracking control of autonomous vehicles (AV) in the presence of external disturbances. While AV technology has made significant strides, real-world driving scenarios often pose challenges such as slippery or uneven roads, which can adversely affect the lateral path tracking control and reduce driving safety and efficiency. Conventional control algorithms struggle to address this issue due to their inability to account for unmodeled uncertainties and external disturbances. To tackle this problem, this paper proposes a novel algorithm that combines robust sliding mode control (SMC) and tube model predictive control (MPC). The proposed algorithm leverages the strengths of both MPC and SMC. Specifically, MPC is used to derive the control law for the nominal system to track the desired trajectory. The error system is then employed to minimize the difference between the actual state and the nominal state. Finally, the sliding surface and reaching law of SMC are utilized to derive an auxiliary tube SMC control law, which helps the actual system keep up with the nominal system and achieve robustness. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms conventional tube MPC, linear quadratic regulator (LQR) algorithms, and MPC in terms of robustness and tracking accuracy, especially in the presence of unmodeled uncertainties and external disturbances.

AB Flying robots are expected to be used in many tasks, such as aerial delivery, inspection inside dangerous areas, and rescue. However, their deployment in unstructured and highly dynamic environments has been limited. This paper proposes a novel approach for enabling a micro-aerial vehicle (MAV) system equipped with a laser rangefinder and depth sensor to autonomously navigate and explore an unknown indoor or outdoor environment. We built a modular deep-Q-network architecture to fuse information from multiple sensors mounted onboard a vehicle. The developed algorithm can perform collision-free flights in the real world, while being trained entirely on a 3D simulator. The proposed method does not require prior expert demonstrations, 3D mapping, or path planning. It transforms fused sensory data into a velocity control input for a robot through an end-to-end convolutional neural network (CNN). The obtained policy was compared to a simulation using the conventional potential-field method. Our approach achieves zero- shot transfer from simulation to real-world environments that were never experienced during training by simulating realistic sensor data. Several intensive experiments were conducted to demonstrate the effectiveness of our system for safely flying in dynamic outdoor and indoor environments. The supplementary videos for the actual flight tests can be accessed at https://bit.ly/2SEw8dQ.

AB Autonomous underwater vehicle plays a more and more important role in the exploration of marine resources. Path planning and obstacle avoidance is the core technology to realize the autonomy of AUV, which will determine the application prospect of AUV. This paper mainly describes the state-of-the-art methods of path planning and obstacle avoidance for AUV and aims to become a starting point for researchers who are initiating their endeavors in this field. Moreover, the objective of this paper is to give a comprehensive overview of work on recent advances and new breakthroughs, also to discuss some future directions worthy to research in this area. The focus of this article is put on these path planning algorithms that deal with constraints and characteristics of AUV and the influence of marine environments. Since most of the time AUV will operate in the environments full of obstacles, we divide path planning methods of AUV into two categories: global path planning with known static obstacles, and local path planning with unknown and dynamic obstacles. We describe the basic principles of each method and survey most related work to them. An in-depth discussion and comparisons between different path planning algorithms are also provided. Lastly, we propose some potential future research directions that are worthy to investigate in this field.

AB Shared autonomous electric vehicles (SAEVs) are a promising car-sharing service expected to be implemented in the near future. However, existing studies on the optimization of SAEV systems do not consider uncertainties in the SAEV systems, which may interfere with the achievement of the desired performance or objective. From the perspective of the company, a SAEV system should be designed to minimize the total cost while securing the targeted wait time of the customer, but uncertainties in the SAEV system can cause variation in the customer wait time, which can lead to inconveniences to customers and damage to the reputation of the company. Therefore, this study considers the uncertainties in a SAEV system and applies reliability-based design optimization (RBDO) to the design of the SAEV system to minimize the total cost of system design while satisfying the target reliability of the customer wait time. A comparison of the optimization results of various wait time constraints and probabilities of failure provides observations on applying RBDO to the design of a SAEV system. Furthermore, several insights can be obtained through various parametric studies. From this study, it is verified that RBDO can be successfully applied to the design of a SAEV system and a design framework for the SAEV system that can both lower the cost and ensure the reliability of the customer wait time is proposed.

AB Multi-Criteria Decision-Making (MCDM) methods have a significant influence on decision making in a variety of strategic fields, including science, business, and real-life studies. These methods also effectively support researchers in solving the emerging issues that may be encountered during their research activity. This work introduces a new Evaluation method based on the Distance from the Average Solution in the Minkowski space (EDAS-M). The main contribution of this study is the EDAS-M based MCDM model for the evaluation of an autonomous vehicle. Besides, the CRITIC (Criteria Importance Through Intercriteria Correlation) was used to determine objective criteria weights. The EDAS-M method provides a modified extension of the conventional Evaluation method based on the Distance from the Average Solution (EDAS) method. Seven different MADM methods are used to compare problem-solving results. Namely, the EDAS, WASPAS (Weighted Aggregated Sum Product ASsessment), SAW (Simple Additive Weighting), ARAS (Additive Ratio ASsessment), TOPSIS (Technique for Order Preference by Similarity Ideal Solution), TOPSIS-M (TOPSIS Minkowski space) and MABAC (Multi-Attributive Border Approximation Area Comparison) techniques validate the stability of the results obtained by using the new method above mentioned. Sensitivity analysis reflects the dynamics of the influence of dynamic matrices. It showed a high correlation of positions with all applied approaches.

AB Limited energy, high mobility, and unsteady acoustic communication links render the underwater acoustic sensor networks subject to performance reduction. To solve this problem, a topology optimization method, also called TO-A algorithm, is developed based on topology reconfiguration. First, the proposed method optimizes the coverage rate of underwater acoustic sensor networks by adjusting the location of sensor nodes through simulating fish behaviors. Second, to optimize the connectivity of underwater acoustic sensor networks, the proposed method, using edge nodes, repairs disconnected positions and eliminates key nodes in underwater acoustic sensor networks. Third, a topology optimization strategy, also called TO-DA algorithm, is developed for Double-autonomous underwater vehicles to improve the robustness and adaptability of the network topology. When the inherent law of underwater acoustic sensor networks topology formation is further found, the method for optimizing network topology is proposed, which based on the triangle principle eliminates those key nodes and can help with the survivability of network regeneration. The method proves reasonable and valid by stimulation and contrast examinations. The comparison of TO-A algorithm and TO-DA algorithm shows that under low energy consumption, TO-A algorithm can keep the network coverage at about 97% for a long time, connectivity rate above 89%, while the TO-DA algorithm can improve the survivability of the network by above 50% at the expense of 8.5% of the network coverage.

AB The localization of autonomous vehicles mainly depends on GPS-based methods in large-scale outdoor scenarios. Unfortunately, GPS is vulnerable and not reliable in some regions, such as urban canyons. Odometry is taken as a complementary method for positioning in GPS-limited areas, but it suffers from accumulated errors, which limits its application. Topological map is a concise and low-cost representation of real world environment, which can be deemed as one of the information sources for localization. To realize accurate localization in the GPS-limited and large-scale scenes for autonomous vehicles, a generalized localization framework based on the topological map and odometry is proposed in this article. The odometry trajectory can be automatically aligned with the correct paths of the map through matching without the initial global position. Under this framework, odometry is deemed as the kinematic model while topological map is regarded as a global sensor that is utilized to correct the drift errors of odometry. As an example, the integration of visual odometry and topological map is used to validate the effectiveness of the proposed method on KITTI benchmark. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method can effectively constrain the drift errors of odometry, and it achieves state-of-the-art localization performance compared with existing map-aided methods.

AB This paper is concerned with tele-presence and tele-operation of autonomous vehicles over the Additive White Gaussian Noise (AWGN) channel. This wireless communication channel is subject to transmission noise and transmission power constraint. An encoder, decoder and controller are proposed by implementing a novel linearization method for linearizing the nonlinear dynamic systems at operating points. For the linearized systems, the encoder, decoder and controller are implemented that were previously proposed for output tracking as well as stability of linear dynamic systems. Two novel linearization methods are proposed and their satisfactory performances are proved for output tracking as well as stability of nonlinear dynamic system. The first method is based on the fixed linearization rate and the second one is based on the variable (optimal) linearization rate. The decoder that is based on the second method is in fact the extended Kalman filter with the optimal linearization rate. The performances of these two methods are compared with each other and the other proposed methods by implementing them to the problems of the tele-presence and tele-operation of autonomous vehicles over the AWGN channel. Their satisfactory performances are illustrated. It is illustrated that the second method has higher computational complexity with slightly better performance and is applicable to a larger class of reference trajectories.

AB Considering intense hydrothermal activities and rugged topography in a near-bottom environment of the trans-Atlantic geotraverse (TAG) hydrothermal mound, a small autonomous underwater vehicle (S-AUV) will suffer from time-varying disturbances, model uncertainties, actuator faults, and input saturations. To handle these issues, a fault-tolerant adaptive robust sliding mode control method is presented in this paper. Firstly, unknown disturbances, model uncertainties, and actuator faults of the S-AUV are synthesized into a lumped uncertain vector. Without requiring the upper bound and gradient of the uncertainties, a continuous adaptive finite-time extended state observer is designed to estimate the lumped uncertain vector. Then, an auxiliary dynamic system composed of continuous functions is introduced to deal with input saturations, thereby contributing to achieving fixed-time trajectory tracking control of S-AUVs. Based on a designed continuous fixed-time nonsingular fast sliding mode surface, the proposed continuous adaptive controller is chattering free. Simulated topography is built according to topographic data of the TAG mound, and a smooth trajectory model is constructed by cubic spline interpolation. Comprehensive simulations performed on an actual S-AUV model are given to validate the effectiveness and superiority of the presented algorithm.

AB Accurate methods to track changes in lake productivity through time and space are critical to fisheries management. Chlorophyll a is the most widely studied proxy for ecosystem primary production and has been the topic of many studies. The main sources of chlorophyll a measurements are ship-based measures or multi-spectral satellite data. Autonomous underwater vehicles can survey large spatial extents approaching the scale of satellite data, but with the accuracy of ship-based water sampling methods. We use several statistical measures to compare measures of chlorophyll a collected in Lake Michigan with spatiotemporally matched satellite-derived measures of chlorophyll a from the MODIS Aqua multi-spectral sensor using NASA's OC3 and the Great Lakes Fit algorithms. Our findings show a near one to one relationship between AUV data and both satellite-derived data sets when the AUV data are coarsened to the resolution of the satellite data. A comparison of satellite-based chlorophyll a to AUV-derived chlorophyll summarized in discrete water depth bins suggested that, based on decreasing coefficients of determination, satellite estimates of chlorophyll accounted for the most variability in chlorophyll a concentrations in the upper 10 m of the water column, even though satellite sensors may detect past this depth.

AB In this paper, we propose a design for an on-glass 5G monopole antenna for a vehicle window glass. The proposed antenna consists of a monopole resonator, an inductive line, and a co-planar waveguide (CPW), which can adjust the phase so that the current in each resonator is close to in phase. Therefore, although the vehicle window glass has a high dielectric loss, the proposed monopole with an inductive line can obtain an antenna gain that is suitable for applying to vehicle 5G communications. To verify the antenna characteristics, the reflection coefficients and the radiation patterns are measured in a full anechoic chamber. The results demonstrate that the proposed on-glass antenna is suitable for applying in vehicle 5G communications.

AB This paper presents a novel method for generating three-dimensional optimal trajectories for a vehicle or body that moves forward at a constant speed and steers in both horizontal and vertical directions. The vehicle's dynamics limit the body-frame pitch and yaw rates; additionally, the climb and decent angles of the vehicle are also bounded. Given the above constraints, the path planning problem is solved geometrically by building upon the two-dimensional Dubins curves and then Pontryagin's Maximum Principle is used to validate that the proposed solution lies within the family of candidate time-optimal trajectories. Finally, given the severe boundedness constraints on the vertical motion of the system, the robustness of the proposed path planning method is validated by naturally extending it to remain applicable to high-altitude final configurations.

AB Early deployment of automated vehicles (AVs) may likely cause a loss of efficiency in the transportation system. However, after there are a sufficient number of such vehicles in the traffic stream, many benefits can be realized. It thus appears sensible to provide subsidies to promote the early adoption of AVs and shorten the transition period. This paper investigates an optimal subsidy policy that accelerates the deployment of AVs from lower to higher market penetration rates. The policy can maximize the government agency's expected total payoff associated with the AV deployment. The main contribution is a dynamic games approach that considers the uncertainty in the market forecast and the information asymmetry between the government agency and the subsidized entities.

AB Current and conventional pose (position and orientation) control of a small underwater vehicle is achieved by using rudders (yaw motion control) and elevators (pitch motion control), but these suffer from non-linear, indirect and complex control issues. This paper proposes an innovative pose control mechanism for small underwater vehicles. The mass shifter mechanism is designed and fabricated to control pitch and yaw motion with a single propeller only. The center of mass of the underwater vehicle is altered by moving a pair of counterweights on fixed tracks. The pitch and yaw are achieved by controlling the position of the counterweight pairs. The proposed system is designed, fabricated and tested in a real underwater environment for proof-of-concept. The result shows a simpler, more efficient and more effective pose control mechanism than conventional technology.

AB This paper presents a study of the energy-efficient operation of all-electric vehicles lever-aging route information, such as road grade, to adjust the velocity trajectory. First, Pontryagin's maximum principle (PMP) is applied to derive necessary conditions and to determine the possible operating modes. The analysis shows that only five modes are required to achieve minimum energy consumption: full propulsion, cruising, coasting, full regeneration, and full regeneration with conventional braking. Then, the minimum energy consumption problem is reformulated and solved in the distance domain using dynamic programming to find the optimal speed profiles. Various simulation results are shown for a lightweight autonomous military vehicle. The sensitivity of energy consumption to regenerative-braking power limits and trip time is investigated. These studies provide important information that can be used in designing component size and scheduling operation to achieve the desired vehicle range.

The multiagent reinforcement learning communication network (CommNet) was introduced to enable multiple agents to perform actions in a distributed manner to achieve shared goals by training all agents' states and actions in a single neural network. Additionally, the Myerson auction method guarantees trustworthiness among multiple agents to optimize rewards in highly dynamic systems. Our findings suggest that the integration of MARL CommNet and Myerson techniques is very much needed for improved efficiency and trustworthiness.

AB Rich semantic information in natural language increases team efficiency in human collaboration, reduces dependence on high precision data information, and improves adaptability to dynamic environment. We propose a semantic centered cloud control framework for cooperative multi-unmanned ground vehicle (UGV) system. Firstly, semantic modeling of task and environment is implemented by ontology to build a unified conceptual architecture, and secondly, a scene semantic information extraction method combining deep learning and semantic web rule language (SWRL) rules is used to realize the scene understanding and task-level cloud task cooperation. Finally, simulation results show that the framework is a feasible way to enable autonomous unmanned systems to conduct cooperative tasks.

For this purpose, a brief description of the mathematical model of the quadrotor UAV and the ground vehicle is presented, and the Hopf bifurcation method around a mobile balance point is used to design the path planning for a quadrotor UAV, and autonomously it generates a circular surveillance relative to a moving ground vehicle. The stability analysis based on Lyapunov theory is presented in order to demonstrate that the trajectory satisfies the bifurcation properties. Simulation and experimental tests are carried out to validate the proposed approach.

AB Marine magnetic field surveys conducted near the sea bottom are useful in producing images of the oceanic crust in order to ascertain its volcanic eruption history, active hydrothermal systems, and hydrothermal deposit evolution. An autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) can carry out self-controlled survey operations while maintaining a stable vehicle attitude at low altitudes above the seafloor. As a result of these benefits, AUVs have attracted attention for various missions. The total magnetic field intensity is generally used for subsurface magnetization images. Recently, vector magnetic anomaly analysis has been considered to be extremely effective for high-accuracy estimation of subsurface magnetization structures. However, correcting for the anomalous magnetic field produced by the vehicle body is one of the difficulties that hinders vector magnetic anomaly analysis. Therefore, we developed a magnetometer system designed for the AUV URASHIMA with a renewed navigation data distribution system. Experimental observation was carried out around a submarine mud volcano with a small magnetic anomaly off Tanegashima Island. The results show that correction for the magnetic field of the vehicle because of the attitude, especially for changes in pitch, is essential for near-bottom magnetic surveys using AUVs. Based on these results, we proposed a suitable data acquisition method to remove the pitching effects of the vehicle for figure-eight turns. Next, practical observation was carried out in the hydrothermal area, and the proposed correction method for magnetic data reduced the pitch variation effect. These results indicate that the correction for the magnetic field of the vehicle based using attitude data, especially for pitching variations, is required in order to obtain high-quality magnetic anomaly data using AUVs. However, a short-period variation of approximately 10 nT caused by abrupt pitch changes remains.

AB Recently, autonomous vehicles and the relevant studies have attracted much attention. Adaptive cruise control (ACC), which is a kind of cruise control system for vehicles, automatically adjusts the vehicle speed to maintain a safe distance from vehicles ahead. Since the vehicle with ACC (called ACC vehicles) is semi-autonomous, the performance of ACC vehicle must be quite different from that of manual vehicle. The characteristics of traffic flow with ACC vehicles should be carefully investigated, especially when the traffic system is a bit complicated, such as on-ramp system.
   The primary objective of this paper is to propose a traffic flow model to simulate the traffic flow with considering the influence of ACC vehicles and on-ramps. Based on the model proposed by Yuan in 2009 [Yuan Y M 2009 Ph.D. Dissertation (Hefei: University of Science and Technology of China)], a hybrid traffic flow model with considering the influence of ACC vehicles and on-ramps is developed. Considering the differences between ACC and manual vehicles, a car-following sub-model based on constant time headway principle is developed for ACC vehicles, while an MCD cellular automata sub-model is proposed for manual vehicles. Besides, a new parameter, lambda, is introduced to show different psychologies of drivers when changing lane from on-ramp to main road. The lane-changing model for vehicles on-ramp is developed as well. At the end, numerical simulation is demonstrated to study the influence of ACC vehicles on traffic flow at on-ramp, and to reveal the influence of parameters on the proposed hybrid model (i.e., the length of merge area, the desired time headway of ACC vehicle and lambda) on model performance.
   The results of this paper are as follows. 1) When the ACC vehicles exist in a traffic system, the performance of traffic flow in a on-ramp area is improved: the influence of merged vehicles on main road is reduced, and the average speed and volume are increased. 2) The increase of ACC vehicles can help to alleviate traffic congestion in both congestion duration and scope aspects. 3) The newly proposed hybrid model is sensitive to the length of merge area l(w), the desired time headway of ACC vehicle H-d and lane-changing psychology parameter lambda: the decrease of H-d and the increase of lambda can both improve the average speed and volume of traffic flow. In addition, when the volume of on-ramp is small, the speed and volume of main road can be improved by enlarging l(w). When the volume of on-ramp is large, a small l(w) will be better for traffic flow.

AB This work is framed within the PITVANT project and aims to contribute to the development of obstacle avoidance techniques for unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs). The paper describes the design, implementation and experimental evaluation of a potential field obstacle avoidance algorithm based on the fluid mechanics panel methods. Obstacles and the UAV goal position are modeled by harmonic functions thus avoiding the presence of local minima. Adaptations are made to apply the method to the automatic control of a fixed wing aircraft, relying only on a local map of the environment that is updated with information from sensors onboard the aircraft. Hardware-In-Loop simulations show the good performance of the proposed algorithm in the envisioned mission scenarios for the PITVANT vehicles.

AB This paper describes a strategy to feature point correspondence and motion recovery in vehicle navigation. A transformation of the image plane is proposed that keeps the motion of the vehicle on a plane parallel to the transformed image plane. This permits to define linear tracking filters to estimate the real-world positions of the features, and allows us to select the matches that accomplish the rigidity of the scene by a Hough transform. Candidate correspondences are selected by similarity, taking into account the smoothness of motion. Further processing brings out the final matching. The methods have been tested in a real application. (C) 1999 Pattern Recognition Society. Published by Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB In this work, the output-feedback fault-tolerant tacking control issue for underactuated autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) with actuators faults is investigated. Firstly, an output-feedback error tacking system is constructed based on the theoretical model of underactuated AUV with actuators faults. Then, an adaptive dynamic programming (ADP) based fault-tolerant control controller is developed. In our proposed control scheme, a neural-network observer is designed to approximate the system states with actuators faults. An online policy iteration algorithm is designed with critic network and action network in order to improve the tracking accuracy. Based on Lyapunov stability theorem, the stability of the error tracking system is guaranteed by the proposed controller. At last, the simulation results show that the underactuated AUV achieves better tracking performance.

AB There is an ocean current in the actual underwater working environment. An improved self-organizing neural network task allocation model of multiple autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) is proposed for a three-dimensional underwater workspace in the ocean current. Each AUV in the model will be competed, and the shortest path under an ocean current and different azimuths will be selected for task assignment and path planning while guaranteeing the least total consumption. First, the initial position and orientation of each AUV are determined. The velocity and azimuths of the constant ocean current are determined. Then the AUV task assignment problem in the constant ocean current environment is considered. The AUV that has the shortest path is selected for task assignment and path planning. Finally, to prove the effectiveness of the proposed method, simulation results are given.

AB Vehicle localization and autonomous navigation consist of precisely positioning a vehicle on road by the use of different kinds of sensors. This paper presents a vehicle localization method by integrating a stereoscopic system, a laser range finder (LRF) and a global localization sensor GPS. For more accurate LRF-based vehicle motion estimation, an outlier-rejection invariant closest point method (ICP) is proposed to reduce the matching ambiguities of scan alignment. The fusion approach starts by a sensor selection step that is applied to validate the coherence of the observations from different sensors. Then the information provided by the validated sensors is fused with an unscented information filter. To demonstrate its performance, the proposed multisensor localization method is tested with real data and evaluated by RTK-GPS data as ground truth. The fusion approach also facilitates the incorporation of more sensors if needed.

AB Improving the system performance of a traffic network by dynamically controlling the routes of connected and automated vehicles (CAVs) is an appealing profit that CAVs can bring to our society. Considering that there may be a long way to achieve 100% CAV penetration, we discuss in this paper the mixed traffic flow of human driven vehicles (HDVs) and CAVs on a transportation network. We first propose a double queue (DQ) based mixed traffic flow model to describe the link dynamics as well as the flow transitions at junctions. Based on this mixed flow model, we develop a dynamic bi-level framework to capture the behavior and interaction of HDVs and CAVs. This results in an optimal control problem with equilibrium constraints (OCPEC), where HDVs' route choice behavior is modeled at the lower level by the instantaneous dynamic user equilibrium (IDUE) principle and the CAVs' route choice is modelled by the dynamic system optimal (DSO) principle at the upper level. We show how to discretize the OCPEC to a mathematical programming with equilibrium constraints (MPEC) and discuss its properties and solution techniques. The non-convex and non-smooth properties of the MPEC make it hard to be efficiently solved. To overcome this disadvantage, we develop a decomposition based heuristic model predictive control (HMPC) method by decomposing the original MPEC problem into two separate problems: one IDUE problem for HDVs and one DSO problem for CAVs. The experiment results show that, compared with the scenario that all vehicles are HDVs, the proposed methods can significantly improve the network performance under the mixed traffic flow of HDVs and CAVs.

AB The existing electronic stability control (ESC) system does not consider the steering intention of an autonomous driving system (ADS) during autonomous driving emergency avoidance. The distributed control scheme between ESC and ADS does not involve any information interaction, and the balance between path tracking and lateral stability is not optimal. A Nash game control scheme of steering and braking system is proposed to ensure that both path tracking and stability are simultaneously in the loop and solve the conflict by simulating the interaction between the two agents considering the impact on the interaction between a path following and lateral stability. Each agent considers its interests and the opponent's interest, resulting in a global optimal control solution of steering control and ESC. Then, using minimax optimization theory, a lateral stability strategy is proposed to make the game control architecture under emergency avoidance more robust to uncertain lateral disturbances. Finally, simulation and hardware in the loop experiments show that the proposed scheme can consider both vehicle's path following performance and lateral stability in the event of an emergency.

AB Aiming at the path planning problem for searching static target by autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) in ocean environment, this paper proposes a hierarchical method based on the maximum cumulative detection reward or search efficiency. First, the mission sea region is described in the form of target probability map, and the subregions with high search value are extracted by the method of expectation-maximization (EM). For multiple AUVs, we propose the bidirectional negotiation with biased min-consensus (BN-BMC) algorithm to determine the allocation and prioritization of subregions to be searched. On this basis, we utilize an adaptive oval spiral coverage (AOSC) strategy to plan the coverage path within each subregion, and take the Dubins path satisfying the AUV kinematic constraint as the transition path between subregions. Finally, the simulation results validate the advantage of our method.

AB A new and effective seafloor geodetic observing robot network system, which consists of several submarine stations situated in regions susceptible to interplate earthquakes, has been proposed and is under construction in Japan. Each station, equipped with an autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) dock, is connected to a land facility by cables providing power and communication. Near the AUV dock, three or four seafloor reference stations will be set up for geodetic observations. In this system, a noncontact power supply is required for a battery-driven AUV to conduct observations for extended durations. A small, intelligent, efficient, high-power noncontact feed system of 400W capacity with an inverting efficiency of 77% in salt water has been developed. It has been shown to be effective in a water tank experiment in which the noncontact power supply automatically fed power to an AUV for 3 days.

AB This paper presents a two-stage motion planning algorithm which can compute low-cost motions for autonomous agricultural vehicles, for a given cost function defined over the entire path (e.g., shortest path, maximum clearance, etc.). In the first stage, the algorithm utilizes randomized motion planning to explore the space of possible motions and computes a feasible sub-optimal trajectory. In the second stage, the optimization of the stage-1 motion is formulated within the optimal control framework and function-space gradient descent is used to minimize the cost of the entire motion. The numerical results suggest that the two-stage motion planner can compute optimal or quasi-optimal motions in free space very quickly. In the presence of obstacles however, the execution time increases significantly. Furthermore, kino-dynamic, or dynamic motion models seem to be necessary in order to produce smooth motion trajectories.

ID HYDROGEN; STORAGE
AB This paper compares lead-acid batteries, sodium-sulfur batteries, solid polymer fuel cells and closed-cycle diesel engines for autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) applications.  The service is described in terms of a parametric mission and life cycle.  A generic AUV is used as a basis for comparison.  Power systems are evaluated by two criteria:  1) submerged endurance capability and 2) life cycle cost.  This study determines categories of service for which each power system is preferred.
   The solid polymer fuel cell can provide greater submerged endurance than other power systems examined.  For extremely long duration AUV missions, the fuel cell is the required system, indicating a possible market niche for today's fuel cell technology.  Considering cost projections for each power system, the results also show that the SPFC can become cost-competitive with conventional technologies, particularly for services characterized by high levels of utilization.

AB Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) for Autonomous Surface Vehicles (ASVs) addresses developers' needs for model interpretation, understandability, and trust. As ASVs approach wide-scale deployment, these needs are expanded to include end user interactions in real-world contexts. Despite recent successes of technology-centered XAI for enhancing the explainability of AI techniques to expert users, these approaches do not necessarily carry over to non-expert end users. Passengers, other vessels, and remote operators will have XAI needs distinct from those of expert users targeted in a traditional technology-centered approach. We formulate a concept called 'human-centered XAI' to address emerging end user interaction needs for ASVs. To structure the concept, we adopt a model-based reasoning method for concept formation consisting of three processes: analogy, visualization, and mental simulation, drawing from examples of recent ASV research at the Norwegian University of Science and Technology (NTNU). The examples show how current research activities point to novel ways of addressing XAI needs for distinct end user interactions and underpin the human-centered XAI approach. Findings show how representations of (1) usability, (2) trust, and (3) safety make up the main processes in human-centered XAI. The contribution is the formation of human-centered XAI to help advance the research community's efforts to expand the agenda of interpretability, understandability, and trust to include end user ASV interactions.

AB The integrated navigation system based on multi-sensor data fusion could effectively improve the navigation accuracy for Autonomous Underwater Vehicle (AUV). Various navigation equipment and sensors have different error characteristics. Current research does not take a specific processor based on their error characteristics, causing the optimal estimation is hard to realize in engineering applications. To address this issue, this study presents a robust and practical integrated navigation algorithm. When the AUV works on the surface where the Global Position System (GPS) could obtain the position, the navigation system employs an adaptive fault tolerance filter to smooth the GPS trajectory, then the processed GPS information would be used to correct the Inertial Navigation System (INS). Otherwise, Variational Bayesian (VB) is adopted to estimate the measurement error covariance of the Doppler Velocity Log (DVL), which would be used for the INS/DVL integration system. Subsequently, the pressure sensor (PS) uses the conventional method to correct the height error of INS. The above information would be fused to obtain the position when the AUV operates underwater. The real experiment data of our independently developed Sailfish AUV is processed to evaluate the algorithm performance. Experimental results illustrate that the proposed algorithm could improve the navigation accuracy and the robustness of resisting unknown measurement uncertainty compared to the conventional method.

AB This paper investigates the lateral and longitudinal formation control problem of a group of vehicles driving in rough road environments. An adaptive sliding mode disturbance observer is introduced to estimate the road disturbance. Then, based on the road disturbance observer, a conmand-filtered vehicular formation control method is given, which can make the formation tracking errors converge to a small neighborhood of zero in a finite time. In other words, the lateral-longitudinal formation of vehicles can be practically finite-time stabilized despite the road disturbance, via the use of a backstepping control algorithm with a finite-time command filter based on an error compensation mechanism. Numerical simulations have shown the effectiveness of the presented method.

AB Research suggests the general public has inherent distrust in highly automated vehicles (HAV), typically stemming from a lack of vehicle system transparency while in motion (e.g., the user not being informed how the car will react in the upcoming scene) and not having an effective way to control the vehicle in the event of a system failure. To better understand user trust and perceptions of comfort and safety while riding in an HAV, this study evaluated in-situ human-machine interface (HMI) systems (visual, auditory, and mixed-modal) to relay vehicle "intentions" (e.g., the vehicle's response to roadway stimuli) to the user. A considerable link was found between HMI modality and users' reported levels of comfort, safety, and trust during experimentation. In addition, several key behavioral traits are identified as factors that contributed to users' baseline comfort levels with the HAV. Moving forward, it will be necessary for HAV systems to keep users in-the-loop in an effort to increase system transparency and overall understanding. Vehicle feedback should consistently and accurately represent the driving landscape and clearly communicate vehicle system state to users.

AB The decision-making system of intelligent vehicles is the core component of an advanced driving system for both passenger vehicles and commercial vehicles. Finding ways to improve decision-making strategies to suit the complex and unfamiliar environments is a standing problem for traditional rule-based methods. This paper proposes a semi-rule-based decision-making strategy for heavy intelligent vehicles based on the Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient algorithm. Firstly, according to the car-following characteristics, the problems of high dimensions and a large amount of data in vehicle action space and state space are solved by dimension reduction and interval reduction to accelerate the training process. Subsequently, an accurate three-axle vehicle load model is established to calculate the load transfer rate value and carry out active control to increase the roll stability of heavy vehicles at high-speed corners. Furthermore, the Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient algorithm is developed based on the reward function and update function to achieve adaptive cruise control objectives for heavy vehicles on different curvature roads. Finally, the effectiveness and robustness of the algorithm are verified through simulation experiments.

AB The aim of this study was to develop a model to analyse the acceptance of Automated Shuttles (AS) in order to predict and explain individuals' intentions to use and adopt this new type of automated vehicle. Based on a review of the literature, we proposed an extension of the widely used UTAUT model of Venkatesh et al. (2003), named UTAUT4-AV (for Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology 4 [for] Automated Vehicles) to specifically study AS acceptance. An online survey was conducted among a representative sample of 2,612 French citizens. From the processed data, it appears that UTAUT4-AV may explain 89% of the variance in the intention to use automated shuttles, which is 20-30% higher than existing models. This better explanatory power is likely due to the inclusion of new constructs related to the mean of transport currently used by the participants, whether in terms of satisfaction with this mode of transport or regarding mobility performance increasing thanks to AS. The inclusion of individual factors, such as attitudes towards new technologies and innovation, also contributed to this highest explanatory power. Moreover, the results obtained also show that UTAUT4-AV is robust enough to be applied to three other types of automated vehicles (i.e., Automated Cars, Robotaxis, and Autonomous Air Mobility Vehicles), with an ability to explain from 90% to 92% of the variance in the intention to use these other automated vehicles. Additional studies will be however required to evaluate the validity of the UTAUT4-AV model among populations of different countries or regarding acceptance of other types of new technologies, to support a better generalization of these results.

AB Connected autonomous vehicles (CAV) are currently under development, and the mixed flow with CAV would make the traffic states more complicated. Due to the lack of mature applications, the future traffic with CAV are still full of uncertainties. Under the new situation, the traditional cellular automata (CA) model is in need of upgrade. To discover the characteristics of traffic flow under different CAV penetration rates, and considering the particularity of the ramp segments on freeway, this paper updates the current CA model and analyzes the car-following and lane-changing behavior of mixed traffic flow under the intelligent network. Results show that, as the CAV penetration rate continues to increase, the road operation performance continues to improve, and the capacity of the road segment increases accordingly.

AB This paper addresses the dynamic event-triggered consensus problem of multiple autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) via the adaptive control method. First, due to limited bandwidth resources, an adaptive dynamic event-triggered mechanism (ADEM) with coefficients automatically adjusted according to the triggering errors is proposed to reduce the transmission burden. second, for the AUV model, an auxiliary variable is introduced to simplify the AUV system to a first-order model that is easy to analyse. Meanwhile, a novel adaptive dynamic event-triggered consensus control protocol is developed for each AUV to achieve consensus. Third, it is shown that, with the ADEM, the minimum interevent time between any two consecutive triggering instants can be prolonged to avoid the Zeno phenomenon for each AUV. Finally, the simulation results demonstrate the advantage of the proposed scheme.

AB Cooperative localization (CL) is considered a promising method for underwater localization with respect to multiple autonomous underwater vehicles (multi-AUVs). In this paper, we proposed a CL algorithm based on information entropy theory and the probability hypothesis density (PHD) filter, aiming to enhance the global localization accuracy of the follower. In the proposed framework, the follower carries lower cost navigation systems, whereas the leaders carry better ones. Meanwhile, the leaders acquire the followers' observations, including both measurements and clutter. Then, the PHD filters are utilized on the leaders and the results are communicated to the followers. The followers then perform weighted summation based on all received messages and obtain a final positioning result. Based on the information entropy theory and the PHD filter, the follower is able to acquire a precise knowledge of its position.

AB Stereo vision is becoming more and more common in three-dimensional visualization, autonomous vehicle navigation, path finding, object recognition, and other computer vision applications. In this paper, we present an approach for extracting visual landmarks from images acquired by a stereoscopic camera. The scale invariant feature transform (SIFT) technique with self-organizing map is used to detect and recognize visual landmarks. Our methodology is based on winner calculation technique, and the main idea is to keep in the database only distinctive features or landmarks in order to minimize detection time. We will demonstrate that this methodology is more efficient than ordinary SIFT algorithm or speeded up robust features (SURF) matching technique. Improved feature group matching with computation time better than SIFT and the SURF has been observed in the experiments with a variety of stereo image pairs.

AB In this paper, we develop an obstacle avoidance control scheme for autonomous aerial vehicles. The strategy is based on command governor (CG) ideas that are here extended to take into account nonconvex constraints typically arising in path planning obstacle avoidance problems. As one of its main merits, the collision avoidance task is accomplished by exploiting convex inner approximations of the obstacle-free region and an ad hoc constraints switching procedure which significantly reduces the online computations pertaining to the CG design. Experimental results on the quadrotor Qball-X4 show the applicability and effectiveness of the proposed approach.

AB In order to improve the endurance of underwater vehicles and make it possible for the underwater vehicle to inspect long-distance water tunnels, a sliding mode control method based on event triggering is proposed for the depth control of underwater vehicles from the perspective of energy saving. Firstly, the kinematics and dynamics models of underwater vehicle dive surface are established. Secondly, an event-triggered sliding mode controller is designed. According to the Lyapunov function, the stability of the designed controller is proved by theoretical analysis, and Zeno phenomena will not appear in the closed-loop control system. Compared with other controllers, the simulation results show that this controller can effectively realize the depth control of AUV, has strong adaptability and robustness to unmodeled nonlinear dynamics and bounded disturbances, and has the effect of saving computing resources.

ID BARRIER CERTIFICATES
AB Safety and stability are two primary factors that affect the task execution performance of autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs), especially when they operate in a disturbed environment. The unknown disturbances and unmodeled dynamics will severely degrade the performance, resulting in unsafe and unstable behaviors. This paper presents a safety-critical control framework for AUVs in the presence of unknown disturbances using a neural network function approximator. The high-order control barrier functions (CBFs) are utilized to address the safe constraints of relative degree two. A nominal controller is designed in which the unknown lumped disturbances are compensated by a radial basis function neural network, thus ensuring that the tracking errors are uniformly ultimately bounded. Besides, the function approximation and the associated bounded approximation errors are adopted to estimate the unknown lumped disturbance terms in the second-order derivative of CBFs, which alleviates the mismatch of the forward invariance condition for the safety set. The minimally invasive quadratic program (QP) is formulated to make minimal sacrifice on the performance of nominal controller. The proposed method encompasses a straightforward structure for disturbance estimation, alongside a highly efficient explicit estimating rule that promotes rapid convergence. Integrated with computationally efficient QP, the proposed method demonstrates substantial promise for realtime implementation. Comparative numerical results with disturbance observer and input-to-state safety-based robust methods reveal an improved trade-off between safety and control performance.

AB In recent years, governments have successively introduced a variety of policies to promote the development of the autonomous vehicle (AV) industry and technology. Existing research sheds light on individuals' decision process regarding their willingness to purchase AVs or legislation and policy design from the perspective of policymakers, regulators and experts. Little research has been conducted to explore what incentive policies consumers demand and how the policies affect their purchase intentions. In this study, a decision model of AV purchase intentions is proposed through a combination of the planned risk information seeking model (PRISM) and innovation diffusion theory (IDT), and the decision model is utilized to explore the mechanism of the influence of incentive policies on purchase intentions. The early stage of AV commercialization is the research background, and potential AV consumers are the research object. A national survey was conducted in China, and the empirical results indicate that consumers show higher risk perceptions of AVs and that they are most concerned about the unclear risk involved after the occurrence of traffic accidents by unattended cars. The perceived attractiveness of policies such as tax subsidy policies, insurance policies, and commute policies are all significantly and positively correlated with purchase intentions toward AVs. Rational industrial policies have significant effects on mitigating consumer risk perceptions and stimulating purchasing intentions.

ID FRAMEWORK
AB Connected autonomous vehicles (CAVs) are capable of capturing high-definition images from onboard sensors, which can be used to facilitate the detection of objects in the vicinity. Such images may, however, contain sensitive information (e.g., human faces and license plates) as well as the indirect location of CAVs. To protect the object privacy of images shared by CAVs, this article proposes a privacy-preserving object detection (P2OD) framework. Specifically, we propose multiple secure computing protocols designed to construct a privacy-preserving Faster $R$ -convolutional neural network (CNN) model to securely extract features and bounding-boxes of objects in an image. By leveraging edge computing (with higher performance computation and lower latency, in comparison to cloud-based solutions), CAVs randomly split the captured images and upload them to two noncollusive edge servers. Both servers will then perform the P2OD framework cooperatively to directly detect objects over random image shares without exposing sensitive information. The theoretical analysis demonstrates the security, correctness, and efficiency of the P2OD framework, and the experimental findings show that the P2OD framework can effectively protect the classification and location privacy of image objects for CAVs. Compared with the original Faster R-CNN model, the classification and regression errors of the P2OD framework can be controlled within 10-12 and 10-14, respectively.

AB This paper presents a whale optimization algorithm (WOA) based on forward looking sonar to achieve two-dimensional optimal path planning for an autonomous underwater vehicle. The purpose of path planning is not only to effectively avoid threat regions and safely reach the intended target with minimum fuel cost but also to obtain an optimal or near-optimal path in a complex ocean battlefield environment. The WOA, based on the bubble-net attacking behavior of humpback whales, mimics encircling the prey, attacks with a bubble-net method, and search for prey to effectively determine the global optimal solution in the search space. The WOA not only has fast convergence speed and high calculation accuracy but can also effectively balance exploration and exploitation to avoid falling into a local optimum and obtain the global optimal solution. Five sets of experiments are applied to verify the superiority and stability of the WOA. Compared with other algorithms, such as artificial bee colony, bat algorithm, cuckoo search, flower pollination algorithm, moth-flame optimization algorithm, particle swarm optimization, and water wave optimization, the WOA exhibits better optimization performance and stronger robustness. The experimental results reveal that the WOA can find the shortest path compared with all the other algorithms, and it is an effective and feasible method for solving the path planning problem.

AB Drone-based last-mile delivery is an emerging technology that uses drones loaded onto a truck to deliver parcels to customers. In this paper, we introduce a fully automated system for drone-based last-mile delivery through incorporation of autonomous vehicles (AVs). A novel problem called the autonomous vehicle routing problem with drones (A-VRPD) is defined. A-VRPD is to select AVs from a pool of available AVs based on crowd sourcing, assign selected AVs to customer groups, and schedule routes for selected AVs to optimize the total operational cost. We formulate A-VRPD as a Mixed Integer Linear Program (MILP) and propose an optimization framework to solve the problem. A greedy algorithm is also developed to significantly improve the running time for large-scale delivery scenarios. Extensive simulations were conducted taking into account real-world operational costs for different types of AVs, traveled distances calculated considering the real-time traffic conditions using Google Map API, and varying load capacities of AVs. We evaluated the performance in comparison with two different state-of-the-art solutions: an algorithm designed to address the traditional vehicle routing problem with drones (VRP-D), which involves human-operated trucks working in tandem with drones to deliver parcels, and an algorithm for the two echelon vehicle routing problem (2E-VRP), wherein parcels are first transported to satellite locations and subsequently delivered from those satellites to the customers. The results indicate a substantial increase in profits for both the delivery company and vehicle owners compared with the state-of-the-art algorithms.

AB The relentless growth of plastic manufacturing since the 1980s has resulted in significant accumulation of litter throughout the ocean. Cleaning up this litter manually poses a major challenge, highlighting the value of autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) equipped with a robust vision detection algorithm. Despite prior studies, it remains challenging to employ AUVs to detect marine litter in actual maritime habitats. This paper introduces an efficient and accurate deep learning method called MLDet to cope with marine litter detection. The experimental findings show that the proposed method notably outperforms other object detectors. Furthermore, the present study comprehensively discusses the relationship between the proposed detection algorithm and recycling waste collected from marine litter. The encouraging conclusion of the study suggests that a dedicated detection algorithm is a reliable tool for automatically recognizing marine litter and sustaining a healthy ocean.

AB This paper concerns the consensus of the second-order discrete-time autonomous connected vehicle system (CVS) in presence of cyber-attacks. First, the necessary and sufficient conditions for the autonomous CVS are derived without a cyber-attack. Then, a virtual system in hidden layer, interconnected with the original CVS in platoon layer through the designed interaction network, is introduced to resist cyber attacks. Matrix analysis tool, algebraic graph theory and Lyapunov stability method are used to analyze the convergence of CVS. It is proved that the states of CVS can reach consensus and the state errors converge to a certain bound in the case of attacks existing only in hidden layer, or in the overall system including both hidden layer and platoon layer. Finally, the validity of the proposed control approach is verified by the designed simulations. ? 2021 The Franklin Institute. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB In this paper, a novel distributed self-organizing control of swarm is proposed for multiple underactuated surface vehicles (USVs) under the environment of irregular obstacles and complex unknown disturbances. An innovative method to deal with irregular obstacles by discretizing the boundary of obstacles is introduced, combining with artificial potential field (APF) method, it can achieve more reasonable collision avoidance of irregular obstacles. A virtual center point of swarm (CPS) is designed to make USVs follow the desired path, while the selforganization swarm strategy has more flexible response when encountering obstacles. Meanwhile, in order to compensate the uncertainty dynamics, the neural network (NN) approximation is used to estimate the ocean disturbance and model uncertainty. Simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed strategy.

AB This study proposes a discrete event system-based control strategy for autonomous tributary mapping using multi-unmanned aerial vehicle. When considering the unmanned aerial vehicles as discrete event systems, supervisory control theory is used to model and control individual unmanned aerial vehicle behavior in the system. In tributary mapping, the situation changes each time depending on environmental factors (e.g. weather) and the work must be performed in an unstructured environment. Therefore, this article proposes a multi-unmanned aerial vehicle-based supervisory control system to solve real-field problems. Unlike the control systems of recent studies, which mainly deal with continuous-time dynamics, we modeled a multi-unmanned aerial vehicle system based on a discrete event system in which the dynamic states are transitioned by asynchronous events. The proposed multi-unmanned aerial vehicle-based supervisory control system was validated in dynamic simulators and demonstrated that multi-unmanned aerial vehicle satisfies the behavior specifications. The supervisor proposed in this study was validated using a physics-based simulator.

ID PATH-FOLLOWING CONTROL; SLIDING MODE
AB Typically the longitudinal and lateral control is separate for the tracking control of autonomous vehicles, especially for vehicles distributed driven at rear wheels. It may cause problems, such as high computation complexity and low performance. This paper proposes a trajectory tracking control algorithm with coupling of longitudinal and lateral control. In the presented algorithm, the trajectory tracking errors in lateral direction, heading angle error and speed error, and the allocation of longitudinal forces to the driven wheels are taken accounted in a cost function. By using model predictive control (MPC) method, the front wheel steering angle and the longitudinal force of the driving wheels are optimized in one step with no further need of torque allocation. A torque control algorithm is designed based on the target longitudinal force obtained and tire characteristics. Longitudinal forces are fulfilled through sliding control to achieve vehicle velocity. Stability of this algorithm is validated through map of beta-(beta)overdot method. This paper conducted simulation analysis on typical scenarios such as skid pad test, extreme corner turning test, and closed loop test. The results verified that the proposed algorithm has better tracking performance which decreased the lateral error by 14.6% than the decoupled method in closed loop test, and better dynamic response compared to the traditional MPC algorithm that does not consider longitudinal force optimization.

AB As a cutting-edge strategy to reduce travel delay and fuel consumption, platooning of connected and autonomous vehicles (CAVs) at signal-free intersections has become increasingly popular in academia. However, when determining optimal platoon size, few studies have attempted to comprehensively consider the relations between the size of a CAV platoon and traffic conditions around an intersection. To this end, this study develops an adaptive platoon-based autonomous intersection control model, named INTEL-PLT, which adopts deep reinforcement learning technique to realize the optimization of multiple dynamic objectives (e.g., efficiency, fairness, and energy saving). The framework of INTEL-PLT has a two-level structure: The first level employs a reservation-based policy integrated with a nonconflicting lane selection mechanism to determine the lanes' releasing priorities; and the second level uses a deep Q-network algorithm to identify the optimal platoon size based on real-time traffic conditions (e.g., traffic density, vehicle movement, etc.) of an intersection. The model is validated and examined on the simulator Simulation of Urban Mobility. It is found that the proposed model exhibits superior performances on both travel efficiency and fuel conservation as compared with state-of-the-art methods in three typical traffic conditions. Moreover, several in-depth insights learned from the simulations are provided in this paper, which could better explain the relation between platoon size and traffic condition.

ID SAFETY
AB Accurately predicting the possible behaviors of traffic participants is an essential capability for autonomous vehicles. Since autonomous vehicles need to navigate in dynamically changing environments, they are expected to make accurate predictions regardless of where they are and what driving circumstances they encountered. A number of methodologies have been proposed to solve prediction problems under different traffic situations. However, these works either focus on one particular driving scenario (e.g. highway, intersection, or roundabout) or do not take sufficient environment information (e.g. road topology, traffic rules, and surrounding agents) into account. In fact, the limitation to certain scenario is mainly due to the lackness of generic representations of the environment. The insufficiency of environment information further limits the flexibility and transferability of the predictor. In this paper, we propose a scenario-transferable and interaction-aware probabilistic prediction algorithm based on semantic graph reasoning. We first introduce generic representations for both static and dynamic elements in driving environments. Then these representations are utilized to describe semantic goals for selected agents and incorporate them into spatial-temporal structures. Finally, we reason internal relations among these structured semantic representations using learning-based method and obtain prediction results. The proposed algorithm is thoroughly examined under several complicated real-world driving scenarios to demonstrate its flexibility and transferability, where the predictor can be directly used under unforeseen driving circumstances with different static and dynamic information.

AB Small autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) offer advantages in ease of deployment and recovery, covertness, and minimal logistical requirements for operation; however, speed and battery capacity can limit their effectiveness in areas where there are strong currents. While measurement of currents from these platforms is enabled by use of Doppler velocity logs (DVLs) with profiling capability, the quality of these current measurements needs evaluation. A trial was conducted in the Narrows channel of Halifax Harbour in October 2019 with coinciding tidal current measurements using fixed acoustic Doppler current profilers, drifters, and an AUV equipped with a profiling DVL. Output from a high-resolution tidal current model, Halifax Finite-Volume Community Ocean Model, has also been compared. The intercomparison of the current measurements and model output shows good agreement and highlights the complex structure of the tidal flow in the harbor channel. Evaluation of the AUV/DVL current measurements shows that adequate smoothing is achieved using shorter spatial/temporal averaging windows than other investigators have reported. A spatial (alongtrack) averaging bin size of 20 m, or equivalently 13 1-Hz profiles at 3-kn speed, reduces the standard deviation of the current magnitude measurements to a stable level. A shorter averaging scale allows fine enough detail in current mapping to be useful in harbor and littoral environments with strongly localized flows.

ID POLICY
AB Urban transportation is in the midst of a two-fold transformation: On the one hand, cities are beginning to acknowledge their climate responsibilities and are seeking to establish environmentally-friendly, sustainable transport systems. On the other hand, new transportation trends, such as shared mobility and autonomous driving, carry the potential to disruptively change conventional practices. In this study, we develop an activity-based transport demand model to quantify the effects of potential influencing factors on urban transportation in a syn-thetic city. We develop 18 scenarios to investigate urban transportation against the backdrop of mode availability, the deployment of shared mobility services, urban structure and societal change, such as urbanization and an aging population, as well as behavioral shifts in mode choice preferences. With respect to the results, we highlight the derived modal split for a city without private cars but with access to shared autonomous vehicles for all agents: We find a distribution of mode choices of 55% for walking and biking, 40% for public transportation and 5% for shared modes. Given this modal split, the total driven distance, as well as the total number of vehicles in the city, decreases by over 90% against current levels. Thus, an efficient future urban transport system should build upon public transportation for meeting the major share of transport demand, with slow modes for convenient travel across short distances and shared mobility for the inter-modal connection of both.

ID SPECKLE
AB Autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) operate in unknown underwater environments and must be able to avoid submerged obstacles such as cliffs, wrecks, and seabed changes. This paper proposes a methodology for obstacle avoidance by AUVs that are equipped with forward-looking sonars (FLSs). The data collected from two FLSs placed in horizontal and vertical orientation are processed in real time to provide obstacle detection information in the xz- and xy-planes, respectively. Due to the necessity of maintaining constant height when employing sidescan sonar (SSS) and lower energy consumption, horizontal avoidance maneuvers are preferred over vertical ones. For the horizontal obstacle avoidance, a two-layer obstacle avoidance algorithm (OAA) contains two different processes, an OAA based on Bandler and Kohout (BK) product of fuzzy relation used as a preplanning method and a reactive approach based on potential field and edge detection methods. The preplanning technique has a clear advantage on a line segment of the path, and the reactive method is more efficient on a curved segment. In case a horizontal approach cannot find a path to safely avoid the obstacle, the reactive vertical approach is activated. A seabed gradient detection technique that allows prediction of seabed and altitude changes up to 40 m ahead of the AUV is presented. Simulation and experimental results clearly demonstrate that the proposed methodology enables AUVs to navigate safely through obstacles and provide crucial information about the seafloor terrain changes.

ID OCEAN ACOUSTIC TOMOGRAPHY; FIELD; TIME
AB In December 2013, an experiment using an autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) as a moving source for water column sound speed profile (SSP) inversion was conducted in Mogan Lake, China. With in-situ conductivity, temperature, and depth (CTD) measurements, the empirical orthogonal functions were first constructed to represent the SSP. Radiated noises of the AUV were received on a vertical line array and processed via acoustic field matching to obtain estimates of the range-independent SSP, along with the position and velocity of the AUV and the water column depth. The frequency of the radiation noise of the AUV was approximately 14 kHz. At such high frequency, even though the source motion was slow, a significant Doppler shift/broadening was observed. To incorporate the Doppler effects to better match the measured data, a forward acoustic model is derived based on the waveguide Doppler and normal mode theory. An analytical solution of the forward model is obtained for arbitrary signal integration intervals with a monochromatic source, moving radially relative to the receiver. Through simulations and experimental data processing, the feasibility of using an AUV source for water column SSP inversion has been demonstrated; it is also shown that the waveguide Doppler model is more effective compared with the model that does not consider the waveguide Doppler effect.

We then present the design and implementation of our robust computer vision system to measure the pose of the shipdeck with respect to the vehicle.

AB Deep learning models require vast amounts of annotated training data. Gathering and annotating the data from the real world is an expensive and time-consuming process. Thus, synthetically generated data are being researched more and more. This article tries to answer the question of whether and to what extent synthetically generated data can help in developing the advanced driver-assistance system algorithms for autonomous vehicles, for the object detection task based on deep learning. Two state-of-the-art deep learning object detectors were trained on various combinations of real-world and synthetic data. A total of 12 detectors were tested on real-world test images. Results show that synthetic data can contribute to better detector performance until a certain ratio between real-world and synthetic data is reached.

AB This paper investigates the problem of three-dimensional trajectory tracking control for an underactuated autonomous underwater vehicle in the presence of uncertain disturbances. The concept of virtual velocity control is adopted and desired velocities are designed using the backstepping method. Then, the trajectory tracking problem is transformed into a stabilization problem of virtual velocity errors. Dynamic control laws are developed based on non-singular terminal sliding mode control to stabilize virtual velocity errors, and adaptive laws are introduced to deal with parameter perturbation and current disturbances. The stability of the closed-loop control system is analyzed based on Lyapunov stability theory. Two sets of typical simulations are carried out to verify the effectiveness and robustness of the trajectory tracking control algorithm under uncertain disturbances.

AB Magnetic field surveys obtained near the seafloor can map the boundaries of recent volcanic eruptions and can provide thickness estimates of these lava flow units independent of bathymetry differencing methods. Magnetic thickness estimation requires knowledge of the intensity of magnetization of the new lava and surrounding terrain, but this can be satisfactorily obtained by representative sampling of the various volcanic units. While bathymetry differencing requires pre-existing data to assess the thickness of new lava eruptions, magnetic surveys can be obtained after an eruption has occurred. In this study, near-bottom magnetic surveys were obtained using an autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV), which operates without a tether or human intervention. AW technology offers rapid deployment and an efficient surveying approach for remotely mapping recent lava eruption sites on the seafloor.

AB This paper introduces a novel autonomous vehicle-based storage and retrieval system that utilizes movable lifts (AVS/RS/ML), proposed as an alternative to the tier-captive shuttle-based storage and retrieval system (SBS/RS). The newly proposed system aims to provide an affordable solution with highly utilised AGVs, that can also perform operations out of warehouse. The performance of this novel system is compared with the equivalent tier-captive SBS/RS warehouse design, where each shuttle is dedicated in a specific tier in that design. The comparison is based on the initial system investments costs, throughput rates, and average utilisation of lifts/MLs in the system. Collision prevention rules are also applied to AVS/RS/ML, and its performance is tested through simulation. The results show that the tier-captive SBS/SR system becomes cost-efficient under high throughput rate requirements, while the AVS/RS/ML technology is preferred for relatively moderate and low process rate requirements. The unit-cost per month performance metric of AVS/RS/ML is less sensitive to an increase in number of tiers in the system, compared to the tier-captive SBS/RS case, indicating that AVS/RS/ML may be promising for high-tier warehouse system designs.

AB The path planning of the autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) has shown great potential in various Internet of Underwater Things (IoUT) applications. Although considerable efforts had been made, prior studies are confronted with some limitations. For one thing, existing work only uses the ocean current simulation model without introducing real ocean information, having not been supported by real data. For another, traditional path planning algorithms have strong environment dependence and lack flexibility: once the environment changes, they need to be remodeled and replanned. To overcome these challenges, this article proposes comprehensive ocean information D3QN (COID), an AUV path planning scheme exploiting comprehensive ocean information and reinforcement learning (RL), which consists of three steps. First, we introduce the comprehensive real ocean data, including weather, temperature, thermohaline, current, etc., and apply them into the regional ocean modeling system to generated reliable ocean current. Next, through well-designed state transition function and reward function, we build a 3-D grid model of ocean environment for RL. Furthermore, based on the framework of the double dueling deep Q network (D3QN), COID integrates local ocean current and position features to provide state input and uses priority sampling to accelerate network convergence. The performance of COID has been evaluated and proved by numerical results, which demonstrate efficient path planning and high flexibility for expansion into different ocean environments.

AB A robotic mobile fulfillment system (RMFS) is a "parts-to-picker" system employing a fleet of autonomous vehicles (AV), which transport pods between a storage area and picking stations. In this paper, an AV interference free scheduling on bidirectional paths (IFSB) approach is studied and shows better working efficiency than unidirectional paths. In order to model AV scheduling on bidirectional path with interference-free constraints, a no-wait flexible process job shop scheduling problem (NWFPJSP) is employed to evaluate total completion time. A mathematical model aiming to minimize the total completion time is presented with as constraint interference free operation. An A* algorithm is modified for path planning and a simulated annealing algorithm (SA) is employed for scheduling AVs and their paths. Based on a case study with a small RMFS, the IFSB approach results in a 40% increase of the storage capacity and a 22% decrease of the total completion time when compared to a unidirectional approach. Meanwhile, the number of AVs stop-starts are decreased by 40% and the paths length for all AV are decreased by 36%. This indicates the great potential of bidirectional paths in future logistic applications, which may increase the storage capacity, working efficiency, technical health of the AVs, and environmental sustainability.

AB In order to navigate safely at sea, contemporary marine vehicles, both surface and underwater, are equipped with a variety of different sensors. One of these sensors is typically a video camera, a device that is becoming increasingly popular on the decks of both ships and smaller marine vehicles. A compact size and low cost make it an appealing sensor particularly for small and medium size autonomous vehicles which utilize the camera mainly for obstacle detection and collision avoidance. However, the visual information provided by the camera can also be combined with information acquired from the navigational map, for estimating the position of the vehicle in the environment. In this paper, an the coast can be estimated and then utilized to calculate vehicle position. The paper formulates the algorithm and reports verification experiments on real images of the Gdynia harbor and its neighborhood. (c) 2019 The Authors. Published by Atlantis Press SARL.

Disturbance estimation is a fundamental issue in MV motion control, and various disturbance estimation methods are explored for high-performance motion control of MVs. This paper provides a comprehensive review of disturbance estimation methods developed for MVs. First, a three-degree-of-freedom nonlinear MV model is introduced. Next, two types of disturbance estimation methods in terms of disturbance observers and extended state observers are elaborated in detail. Then, applications of disturbance estimation methods in three MV motion control scenarios are discussed. Finally, six theoretical and technical issues on disturbance estimation methods for MVs are suggested for future investigations.

ID DESIGN
AB Spiral coaxial coils are widely used in wireless charging systems for autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs). However, these coils can generate axial electromagnetic interference that may adversely affect the electronic components contained within the AUV. In order to overcome this issue, this paper introduced a pair of radially coupled coils which implement distributed ferrite cores. The mathematical model of the curly coils was derived, and its geometry parameters were optimized through the use of genetic algorithms. ANSYS Maxwell was used to analyze and optimize the layout of the ferrite cores. A prototype of the AUV wireless charging system was presented, demonstrating a maximum efficiency of 94% at 2.2 kW in salt water. The rotation adaptivity of the system was also tested, revealing stable output performance within the possible roll-angle variations of the AUV.

AB This paper aims to understand the stability and the manoeuvrability of an Autonomous Underwater Vehicles (AUV) through the simulation of the drag, lift and torque acting on the hull by the passing seawater. These are important questions in deep water conditions where telecommand is impracticable. The present study is based on the behaviour of a stern shaped as a fishtail in three different ways, and considers several attack angles. The solutions of the Navier-Stokes equations are computed with the OpenFOAM library. An open source library based on the Finite Volume Method (FVM) using C++ language. An analysis of the effects of the fishtail shape on the resistance and stability is based on the calculation of the averages drag, lift and torque. A filtering on the Fourier transform of the torque is used to discuss the manoeuvrability in each case.

AB Most fish have the capability of sensing flows and nearby movements even in dark or murky conditions by using the lateral line organs. This enables them to perform a variety of underwater activities, such as localizing prey, avoiding predators, navigating in narrow spaces, and schooling. To emulate this capability for Autonomous Underwater Vehicles, we developed an artificial lateral line using an array of Micro-Electro-Mechanical-Systems (MEMS) flow sensors. The signals collected via the artificial lateral line are then processed by an adaptive beamforming algorithm developed from Capon's method. The system produces 3D images of source locations for different hydrodynamic activities, including the vibration of a dipole source and the movement of a tail-flicking crayfish. A self-calibration algorithm provides the capability of self-adaptation to different environments. Lastly, we give a Cramer-Rao bound on the theoretical performance limit which is consistent with experimental results.

AB To meet the requirements of scenario-based testing for Autonomous Vehicles (AVs), driving scenario characterization has become a critical issue. Existing studies have concluded that complexity is a necessary criticality measure for supporting critical AV testing scenario identification. However, the existing scenario complexity quantification studies mainly have two limitations, namely, subjective quantification methods highly rely on human participations and are difficult to apply to big data, and existing objective methods lack consideration of human driver characteristics and hence the performance cannot be guaranteed. To bridge these research gaps, a general objective quantification framework is proposed to quantify human drivers' judgement on driving environment complexity, by describing the vehicle-vehicle spatial-temporal interactions from the perspectives of quantity, variety, and relations. The model mainly contains three parts. First, to describe quantity information, a dynamic influencing area was set to identify the surrounding vehicles that contribute to driving environment complexity based on ResponsibilitySensitive Safety (RSS) theory. Second, considering the various surrounding vehicles' driving statuses, behaviors, and intentions, a basic vehicle-pair complexity quantification model was constructed based on encounter angles. Then, nonlinear relationships based upon information entropy theory were introduced to capture the heterogeneous longitudinal and lateral complexities. Third, a vehicle-pair complexity aggregation and smoothing step was conducted to reflect the characteristics of human driver's cognition. To demonstrate the abovementioned model, empirical Field Operational Test (FOT) data from Shanghai urban roadways were used to conduct case studies, and it can be concluded that this model can accurately describe the timing and extent of the complexity change, and reveal the complexity differences due to scenario type and spatial-temporal heterogeneity. Besides, Inter-Rater Reliability (IRR) index was calculated to validate the consistency of scenario complexity judgement between the proposed model and human drivers, and for performance comparison with the existing models. Finally, the applications of the proposed model and its further investigations have been discussed.

ID OPTIMIZATION
AB This letter focuses on the constraint-driven optimal control for multiple Autonomous Underwater Vehicles (AUVs). The different tasks are formulated as multiple constraints on optimization. First, the task goals are formulated by the time-varying control barrier functions. Then, a novel cost-to-constraint transformation method is proposed for time-varying tasks to achieve the high-order constraint-driven task execution under AUV dynamics. The priority of each task is adjusted by the maximum allowed limit of the slack variable, thus relaxing the task constraints and avoiding potential constraint conflicts. Finally, the collision-free optimal energy-aware task execution is achieved by a minimum input norm objective that is incorporated into computationally efficient quadratic programming, which is scalable to different task behaviors. Comparative numerical simulations considering time-varying trajectory tracking and cooperative coverage tasks validate the effectiveness of the proposed method.

AB This paper focuses on the adaptive neural control problem for a connected vehicles platoon system with external disturbances, actuator fault and constraints. Then, the tangent barrier Lyapunov function is introduced into the control design to solve the time-varying position and velocity constraints in a vehicle platoon. Since the selected engine dynamics model is nonlinear, the neural network is adopted to approximate the unknown internal vehicle dynamics. Moreover, the actuator fault effect is addressed by the designed adaptive law designed based on the projection operator. It can be eventually confirmed that all the involved closed-loop signals are bounded based on the Lyapunov stability theory. Finally, a comparative simulation shows the effectiveness of the proposed control scheme.

ID SHARED AUTONOMOUS VEHICLES; SIMULATION; MOBILITY; SYSTEMS
AB This paper proposes an (automated) on-demand public transport service using different vehicle capacities to serve current car demand in cities. The service relies on space and time aggregation of passengers that have similar origins and destinations. It provides a point-to-point service with predefined pick-up and drop-off locations. In this way, detours to pick-up en-route passengers is avoided. The optimization problem that minimizes the fleet size along with limiting rebalancing distances is defined as a mixed-integer linear programming problem. Solving the problem for Zurich, Switzerland, yields, in the best case, a fleet size equal to 3.7% of the current fleet that could serve current car demand. Vehicle kilometers traveled could also be reduced by nearly 10%. Results also show that the speed of automated vehicles has a substantial effect on the necessary fleet size and free-flow speeds generally produce over-optimistic results.

AB Recently, model predictive control (MPC)-based platooning strategies have been developed for connected and autonomous vehicles (CAVs) to enhance traffic performance by enabling cooperation among vehicles in the platoon. However, they are not deployable in practice as they require the embedded optimal control problem to be solved instantaneously, with platoon size and prediction horizon duration compounding the intractability. Ignoring the computational requirements leads to control delays that can deteriorate platoon performance and cause collisions between vehicles. To address this critical gap, this study first proposes an idealized MPC-based cooperative control strategy for CAV platooning based on the strong assumption that the problem can be solved instantaneously. It also proposes a solution algorithm for the embedded optimal control problem to maximize platoon performance. It then develops two approaches to deploy the idealized strategy, labeled the deployable MPC (DMPC) and the DMPC with first-order approximation (DMPC-FOA). The DMPC approach reserves certain amount of time before each sampling time instant to estimate the optimal control decisions. Thereby, the estimated optimal control decisions can be executed by all the following vehicles at each sampling time instant to control their behavior. However, under the DMPC approach, the estimated optimal control decisions may deviate significantly from those of the idealized MPC strategy due to prediction error of the leading vehicle's state at the sampling time instant. The DMPC-FOA approach can significantly improve the estimation performance of the DMPC approach by capturing the impacts of the prediction error of the leading vehicle's state on the optimal control decisions. An analytical method is derived for the sensitivity analysis of the optimal control decisions. Further, stability analysis is performed for the idealized MPC strategy, and a sufficient condition is derived to ensure its asymptotic stability under certain conditions. Numerical experiments illustrate that the control decisions estimated by the DMPC-FOA approach are very close to those of the idealized MPC strategy under different traffic flow scenarios. Hence, DMPC-FOA can address the issue of control delay of the idealized MPC strategy effectively and can efficiently coordinate car-following behaviors of all CAVs in the platoon to dampen traffic oscillations. Thereby, it can be applied for real-time cooperative control of a CAV platoon. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Asynchronous navigation has a more flexible application area compared with synchronous methods. However, the precision of the asynchronous navigation is low, especially for the single beacon navigation due to the improperly geometrical configuration. In this paper, we address a high-precision asynchronous navigation method using single beacon for autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV). Firstly, the coordinate-solving equations are established utilizing the synchronization-free phase difference (PD) information and time-difference-of-arrival (TDOA) information. Secondly, a scheme to obtain the PD information is proposed via signal alignment, conjugate multiplication, phase unwrapping, and linear fitting (or quadratic fitting), successively. Thirdly, the precision analysis is presented, which shows that the proposed method has a comparable precision compared with synchronous methods. Finally, the effectiveness of the method is validated through several groups of the simulations. (C) 2020 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB In this letter we address the mine countermeasures (MCM) search problem for an autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) surveying the seabed using a side-looking sonar. We propose a coverage path planning method that adapts the AUV track spacing with the objective of collecting better data. We achieve this by shifting the coverage overlap at the tail of the sensor range where the lowest data quality is expected. To assess the algorithm, we collected data from three at-sea experiments. The adaptive survey allowed the AUV to recover from a situation where the sensor range was overestimated and resulted in reducing area coverage gaps. In another experiment, the adaptive survey showed a 4.2% improvement in data quality for nearly 30% of the 'worst' data.

ID LOCALIZATION
AB This brief addresses the problem of trajectory tracking control of autonomous rotorcraft in operation scenarios where only relative position measurements obtained from light detection and ranging (LiDAR) sensors are possible. The proposed approach defines an alternative kinematic model, directly based on LiDAR measurements, and uses a trajectory-dependent error space to express the dynamic model of the vehicle. A linear parameter varying representation with piecewise affine dependence on the parameters is adopted to describe the error dynamics over a set of predefined operating regions, and a continuous-time H-2 control problem is solved using linear matrix inequalities and implemented within the scope of gain-scheduling control theory. The performance of the proposed control method is validated with comprehensive simulation and experimental results, using a mock-up scenario of a pier inspected by a quadrotor.

AB This study investigates the effect of peripheral visual and haptic information in providing information about upcoming motions of a fully automated vehicle to an occupant engaging in a non-driving related task, i.e. reading. Two peripheral displays, one visual and the other haptic, were designed and tested. It was hypothesized that the peripheral information would enhance the users' situation awareness and reduce their mental workload. The study was conducted with 18 participants driven around in a real-road environment in a multi-purpose vehicle that simulated a fully automated vehicle. The peripheral visual and haptic information significantly enhanced situation awareness but did not reduce the mental workload. Implications and future work are discussed.

AB Finding a pathway between crop rows is essential for automated guidance of some agricultural vehicles. The research reported in this paper developed a vision-based method for detecting crop rows. This method applied the Hough transform and connectivity analysis to process images of a vehicle's forward view and to use them to find the appropriate pathway in the field. The Hough transform was used to detect crop rows and the connectivity analysis was applied to identify the most suitable path from all possible choices. This system was implemented in an agricultural tractor and tested in both laboratory and field experiments. The methodology devised overcame image noise problems and successfully determined the proper trajectory for the tractor.

AB Development of a robust autonomous Underwater Robotic Vehicle (URV) is a key element to the exploitation of marine resources. An accurate dynamic model is important for both controller design and mission simulation, regardless of the control strategy employed. In this paper, a dynamic model for an underwater vehicle with an n-axis robot arm is developed based on Kane's method. The technique provides a direct method for incorporating external environmental forces into the model. The model developed in this paper includes four major hydrodynamic forces: added mass, profile drag, fluid acceleration, and buoyancy. The model derived is a closed form solution which can be utilized in modem model-based control schemes.

DT Article
DE Deep reinforcement learning; monitoring; path planning; autonomous
   surface vehicle; patrolling; complete coverage
AB Autonomous Surfaces Vehicles (ASV) are incredibly useful for the continuous monitoring and exploring task of water resources due to their autonomy, mobility, and relative low cost. In the path planning context, the patrolling problem is usually addressed with heuristics approaches, such as Genetic Algorithms (GA) or Reinforcement Learning (RL) because of the complexity and high dimensionality of the problem. In this paper, the patrolling problem of Ypacarai Lake (Asuncion, Paraguay) has been formulated as a Markov Decision Process (MDP) for two possible cases: the homogeneous and the non-homogeneous scenarios. A tailored reward function has been designed for the non-homogeneous case. Two Deep Reinforcement Learning algorithms such as Deep Q-Learning (DQL) and Double Deep Q-Learning (DDQL) have been evaluated to solve the patrolling problem. Furthermore, due to the high number of parameters and hyperparameters involved in the algorithms, a thorough search has been conducted to find the best values for training the neural networks and the proposed reward function. According to the results, a suitable configuration of the parameters allows better results for coverage, obtaining more than the 93% of the lake surface on average. In addition, the proposed approach achieves higher sample redundancy of important zones than other common-used algorithms for non-homogeneous coverage path planning such as Policy Gradient, lawnmower algorithm or random exploration, achieving an 64% improvement of the mean time between visits.

TI Autonomous Four-Dimensional Mapping and Tracking of a Coastal Upwelling
   Front by an Autonomous Underwater Vehicle
SO JOURNAL OF FIELD ROBOTICS
LA English
DT Article
ID PHYTOPLANKTON; SYSTEM
AB Coastal upwelling is a wind-driven ocean process that brings cooler, saltier, and nutrient-rich deep water upward to the surface. The boundary between the upwelling water and the normally stratified water is called the upwelling front. Upwelling fronts support enriched phytoplankton and zooplankton populations, thus they have great influences on ocean ecosystems. Traditional ship-based methods for detecting and sampling ocean fronts are often laborious and very difficult, and long-term tracking of such dynamic features is practically impossible. In our prior work, we developed a method of using an autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) to autonomously detect an upwelling front and track the front's movement on a fixed latitude, and we applied the method in scientific experiments. In this paper, we present an extension of the method. Each time the AUV crosses and detects the front, the vehicle makes a turn at an oblique angle to recross the front, thus zigzagging through the front to map the frontal zone. The AUV's zigzag tracks alternate in northward and southward sweeps, so as to track the front as it moves over time. This way, the AUV maps and tracks the front in four dimensionsvertical, cross-front, along-front, and time. From May 29 to June 4, 2013, the Tethys long-range AUV ran the algorithm to map and track an upwelling front in Monterey Bay, CA, over five and one-half days. The tracking revealed spatial and temporal variabilities of the upwelling front.

SO IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON INTELLIGENT TRANSPORTATION SYSTEMS

DT Article
DE Autonomous vehicular platoon; self-healing systems; robotic resilience;

ID CONSENSUS; NETWORKS; SYSTEM
AB Autonomous platoons are good alternatives for cargo transportation, with many approaches to safety and efficiency issues. In the last decades, much effort has been employed in this context, with solutions ranging from low-level control laws to learning strategies. Although some papers have concentrated on methods robust to disturbances or resilient to disruptions, most of the current literature assumes that the platoon starts and remains connected all the time, even when subjecting vehicles to limited communication ranges and time-delay. Therefore, in this paper, we address the problem of connectivity maintenance and stability of platoons under the complete disconnection of vehicles. The main goal is to increase the tolerance to agent exits, external elements (such as traffic lights and human-driven vehicles), and non-ideal initial conditions, improving traffic safety in mixed traffic scenarios. By modeling the network connection as a Directed Acyclic Graph, we use a state-machine policy to recover connectivity and regulate the spacing distance to other vehicles under heterogeneous time-delays. We demonstrate that this state alteration can be interpreted as a reference tracking problem and propose a design procedure that provides stability and zero spacing error in steady-state. Our control protocol allows vehicles to reach a consensus with the team, even when they start disconnected from other ones. Results with agent-based and nonlinear simulations illustrate the effectiveness of our approach.

AB We consider the design of a disagreement correction protocol in multi-vehicle systems. Vehicles broadcast in real-time vital information such as position, direction, speed, acceleration, intention, etc. This information is then used to identify the risks and adapt their trajectory to maintain the highest performance without compromising the safety. To minimize the risk due to the use of inconsistent information, all cooperating vehicles must agree whether to use the exchanged information to operate in a cooperative mode or use the only local information to operate in an autonomous mode. However, since wireless communications are prone to failures, it is impossible to deterministically reach an agreement. Therefore, any protocol will exhibit necessary disagreement periods. In this paper, we investigate whether vehicles can still cooperate despite communication failures even in the scenario where communication is suddenly not available. We present a deterministic protocol that allows all participants to either operate a cooperative mode when vehicles can exchange all the information in a timely manner or operate in autonomous mode when messages are lost. We show formally that the disagreement time is bounded by the time that the communication channel requires to deliver messages and validate our protocol using NS-3 simulations. We explain how the proposed solution can be used in vehicular platooning to attain high performance and still guarantee high safety standards despite communication failures.

AB In this paper, we present a two stages solution to 3D vehicle detection and segmentation. The first stage depends on the combination of EfficientNetB3 architecture with multiparallel residual blocks (inspired by CenterNet architecture) for 3D localization and poses estimation for vehicles on the scene. The second stage takes the output of the first stage as input (cropped car images) to train EfficientNet B3 for the image recognition task. Using predefined 3D Models, we substitute each vehicle on the scene with its match using the rotation matrix and translation vector from the first stage to get the 3D detection bounding boxes and segmentation masks. We trained our models on an open-source dataset (ApolloCar3D). Our method outperforms all published solutions in terms of 6 degrees of freedom error (6 DoF err).

In order to analyze sequential sensor data, a recurrent neural network (RNN) is used and the input data for RNN is drawn from three sensors: LIDAR, camera and GPS. These sensor data are obtained experimentally with real vehicles. In addition, deep ensemble is used for robustness of the estimation and acquisition of the uncertainty. The predicted path of the proposed method is continuous and it predicts both short-term and long-term path with a single algorithm. The size of the network model is small, but it shows good performance in predicting future trajectory of obstacle vehicles.

AB For firefighters and rescuers, the disaster relief works are difficulty performed in the tunnels because of their constricted space. To reduce the losses of accident, the safety of tunnels and factories should be ordinarily kept under surveillance. Hence, a multisensor based smart tracked vehicle is designed for the application of autonomous detection and surveillance in this paper. Besides, multisensors, communication modules, wireless cameras, an electronic compass, and a GPS module are installed in the vehicle. The key feature is the integration of disaster detection and warning systems so that the vehicle can move autonomously. Furthermore, a LabVIEW graphical programming software is applied to design a human machine interface (HMI) and integrate all systems such that the vehicle can be guided by High Speed Downlink Packet Access (HSHPA) based remote control. Moreover, basic stamp microcontrollers are utilized as its control kernel such that the remote monitoring and control system (RMCS) can be constructed successfully.

The lateral dynamics of a vehicle with and without wind disturbance are derived and utilised to implement a control strategy based on the brain limbic system. To show the robustness of the proposed controller, several disturbance conditions including wind, uncertainty in the cornering stiffness, and changes in the vehicle mass are investigated. To demonstrate the performance of the suggested strategy, simulation results of the proposed method are compared with the human driver model-based control scheme, which has been discussed in the literature. The simulation results demonstrate the superiority of the proposed controller in energy efficiency, driving comfort, and robustness.

AB The provision of an adequate liability regime for ADAS technologies is an essential prerequisite for its roll out over the coming decade. Facing to the challenge of future highly automated vehicles, this paper proposed a Human-Machine Transition (HMT) approach as a common conceptual framework for considering Human Machine Interaction (HMI), liability and ethical issues in a unified way. The issues that arise are interrogated from a legal perspective, more specifically liability regimes and that of applied ethics. The paper high-lights the issue of the handover/takeover. Potential consequences for insurance companies are then identified accordingly, with the aim to progress towards the sustainable deployment of automated vehicles on public roads.

ID AUTONOMOUS VEHICLES; CHALLENGES
AB As the automotive industry evolves, visual perception systems to provide awareness of surroundings to autonomous vehicles have become vital. Conventional deep neural networks have been effective on 2D Euclidean problems during the previous decade. However, analyzing point clouds, particularly RADAR data, is not well-studied due to their irregular structures and geometry, which are unsuitable for 2D signal processing. To this end, we propose graph signal processing (GSP) based classification methods for RADAR point clouds. GSP is designed to process spatially irregular signals and can directly create feature vectors from graphs. To validate our proposed methods experimentally, publicly available nuScenes and RadarScenes point cloud datasets are used in our study. Extensive experiments on these challenging benchmarks show that our proposed approaches outperform state-of-the-art baselines. (c) 2023 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

We also include similar analyses of the deep chlorophyll maximum during the summer of those years. Ranges based on semivariance analysis and decorrelation distances generally were 5-15 km, with greater differences observed among seasons in the epilimnion and less unresolved error found for the temperature calculations. Our analysis provides information on submesoscale variation in limnological conditions that may be useful for several applications, including planning field sampling, observation networks, and data assimilation.

AB This article presents an online smooth-path lane-change control framework. We focus on dense traffic where intervehicle space gaps are narrow, and cooperation with surrounding drivers is essential to achieve the lane-change maneuver. We propose a two-stage control framework that harmonizes model predictive control (MPC) with generative adversarial networks (GANs) by utilizing driving intentions to generate smooth lane-change maneuvers. To improve performance in practice, the system is augmented with an adaptive safety boundary and a Kalman filter to mitigate sensor noise. Simulation studies are investigated at different levels of traffic density and cooperativeness of other drivers. The simulation results support the effectiveness, driving comfort, and safety of the proposed method.

AB Mobile robot path planning has passed through multiple phases of development and took up several challenges. Up to now and with the new technology in hands, it becomes less complicated to conduct path planning for mobile robots and avoid both static and dynamic obstacles, so that collision-free navigation is ensured. Thorough state of the art review analysis with critical scrutiny of both safe and optimal paths for autonomous vehicles is addressed in this study. Emphasis is given to several developed techniques based using sampling algorithms, node-based optimal algorithms, mathematic model-based algorithms, bio-inspired algorithms, which includes neural network algorithms, and then multi-fusion-based algorithms, which combine different methods to overcome the drawbacks of each. All of these approaches consider different conditions and they are used for multiple domains.

ID SELF-ORGANIZING MAP
AB For cooperative hunting by a multi-AUV (multiple autonomous underwater vehicles) team, not only basic problems such as path planning and collision avoidance should be considered but also task assignments in a dynamic way. In this paper, an integrated algorithm is proposed by combining the self-organizing map (SOM) neural network and the Glasius Bio-Inspired Neural Network (GBNN) approach to improve the efficiency of multi-AUV cooperative hunting. With this integrated algorithm, the SOM neural network is adopted for dynamic allocation, while the GBNN is employed for path planning. It deals with various situations for single/multiple target(s) hunting in underwater environments with obstacles. The simulation results show that the proposed algorithm is capable of a cooperative hunting task with efficiency and adaptability.

AB Vehicle behavior prediction in complex urban scenarios with traffic signals and interactive agents is an important yet complicated task for autonomous vehicles (AVs). In this work, a hierarchical vehicle behavior prediction framework is proposed to incorporate the traffic signal information and model the interaction between vehicles. The framework predicts vehicle behaviors in two stages, discrete intention prediction and continuous trajectory prediction. In the discrete intention prediction stage, Bayesian network is adopted to provide a high-level behavior prediction of the principle other vehicle. The discrete prediction results are forwarded to the second stage, where a continuous trajectory is predicted with maximum entropy inverse reinforcement learning and potential game. The framework is designed to be able to capture the difference among human drivers with parameterized driver characteristics. The proposed predictor is validated in two scenarios: the yellow light running scenario and the right-turn scenario. The trajectory prediction average displacement error of the yellow light running scenario is 0.695m for a 3-second prediction interval, and the prediction accuracy of the right-turn vehicle in the right-turn scenario is 0.51m for a 2-second prediction interval.

AB Intelligent vehicles are expected to accurately recognize the driving intentions of surrounding vehicles so as to precisely identify the hazards to automatic driving and accomplish reasonable motion planning. This paper introduces a model for vehicles driving behavior recognition (VDBR) based on Sparse Least Squares Support Vector Machine (S-LSSVM) by means of machine learning methods, with the subject vehicle and its surrounding vehicles as the research subject. First, the relative lateral displacement and relative lateral speed between vehicles are captured as the eigenvectors after calculation of trajectory curvature and change time window. Then, the pruning algorithm is used to make Least Squares Support Vector Machine (LSSVM) training samples sparse and the Particle Swarm Optimization algorithm (PSO) is employed to accomplish parameter tuning of S-LSSVM. Thus, a modified S-LSSVM model is constructed to grasp the interaction behavior between vehicles. The experiment results demonstrate that the S-LSSVM based model obtain better accuracy and timeliness compared with SVM and LSSVM on the Next Generation Simulation (NGSIM) dataset and the data from autonomous driving experimental platform.

AB In future mobility, robust obstacle detection is imperative for autonomous vehicles, fostering a reliance on vision-based data and the emergence of light detection and ranging (LiDAR) as a pivotal sensor. Despite challenges of cost and novelty, LiDAR's unique capabilities find favor among automakers, except Tesla. Offering 3D imaging with superior resolution than radar, LiDAR holds potential significance as a perception sensor for safe and efficient transportation. Its 3D distance measurement using laser pulses and waveform analysis is vital for obstacle detection in autonomous vehicles. Techniques like scanning and flash LiDAR optimize point cloud acquisition, albeit with challenges in balancing resolution and frame rates. Because LiDAR measures the distance to an object using the time-of-flight, the idle listening time required to detect reflected waves increases in proportion to the maximum distance. Both, lateral angular resolution and frame rates are dependent on this idle listening time. Lateral angular resolution impacts LiDAR's ability to detect objects. This study proposes an optical orthogonal frequency-division multiple access (OFDMA) LiDAR with a coded pulse technique to enhance the detection accuracy of objects. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed OFDMA LiDAR overcoming false positives and mutual interference through pulse stream LiDARs and strategic approaches is crucial in LiDAR's integration into future mobility systems.

AB This paper addresses the tracking control of an autonomous tractor-trailer robot with a desired distance and orientation angle relative to a combine harvester in the presence of model uncertainties for the autonomous unloading of the harvested cereals in agriculture applications. A coordinate transformation and the prescribed performance technique are employed to develop a second-order Euler-Lagrange formulation of the tracking errors. Then, a neural adaptive proportional-integral-derivative (PID) tracking controller is proposed to guarantee that the tracking errors exponentially converge to an arbitrary small ultimate bound with a pre-specified maximum overshoot and convergence rate. By an effective application of the prescribed performance technique, the controller non-singularity, the collision avoidance and connectivity between two vehicles are preserved continuously. The model uncertainties including unknown vehicle parameters, variable trailer mass and moment of inertia during the crop collection, surface friction, climate and crop conditions and external disturbances are compensated by an effective combination of a multi-layer neural network and an adaptive robust control law. Lyapunov's direct method is employed to prove that the tracking errors are semi-globally uniformly ultimately bounded and converge to a neighborhood of the origin with a prescribed performance. Finally, the computer simulation results are presented to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed controller.

ID AUTONOMOUS UNDERWATER VEHICLES; ALGORITHM
AB This paper presents an on-line dynamic path re-planning system for an autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) to enable it to operate efficiently in a spatiotemporal, cluttered, and uncertain environment. The proposed strategy combines path re-planning with an evolutionary algorithm to adapt and regenerate the trajectory during the course of the mission using continuously updated current profiles from on-board sensors, such as a Horizontal Acoustic Doppler Velocity Logger. A quantum-behaved particle swarm optimization (QPSO) algorithm is used with a cost function which is based on the total time required to travel along the path segments accounting for the effect of space-time variable currents. The proposed path planner is designed to generate an optimal trajectory for an AUV navigating through a spatiotemporal ocean environment in the presence of irregularly shaped terrains as well as obstacles whose position coordinates are uncertain. Simulation results show that using the same on-board computation resources, the proposed path re-planning methodology with reuse of information gained from the previous planning history is able to obtain a more optimized trajectory than one relying on reactive path planning. Subsets of representative Monte Carlo simulations were run to analyse the performance of these dynamic planning systems. The results demonstrate the inherent robustness and superiority of the proposed planner based on path re-planning scheme when compared with the reactive path planning scheme.

ID PERFORMANCE
AB Recently, there have been intensive studies on protocol methods and applications of short range inter-vehicle communication network (SR-IVCN) and systems. The purpose of the studies is to improve the safety of road traffic systems and the smooth control of the traffic flow by providing information to vehicles. Spread spectrum (SS) communication systems are able to simultaneously communicate and measure the distance between the terminals, thus it is advantageous to apply the spread spectrum technique to inter-vehicle communications. This paper assumes that the Vehicles incidentally close to each other, form and manage a locally autonomous decentralized dynamic network. An R-ALOHA (Reservation-ALOHA) protocol for the spread spectrum inter-vehicle communication network using head spacing information is proposed which improve the conventional slot reservation methods. Since the near-far problem in SS communication is one reason for the degradation of system performance, this proposed scheme is shown to improve the efficiency of communication. The performance of the proposed system in the environment where the vehicles are assumed to run freely on a highway is verified by computer simulation. It is shown that inter-vehicle communication can be smoothly carried out between one vehicle and the surrounding vehicles using the propose method.

AB Visual semantic segmentation is a key technology to realize scene understanding for autonomous driving and its accuracy is affected by the light changes in images. This paper proposes a novel multi-exposure fusion approach to visual semantic enhancement of autonomous driving. Firstly, a multi-exposure image sequence is aligned to construct a stable image input. Secondly, high contrast regions of multi-exposure image sequences are evaluated by context aggregation network (CAN) to predict image weight map. Finally, the high-quality image is generated by weighted fusion of multi-exposure image sequences. The proposed approach is validated by using Cityscapes' HDR dataset and real environment data. The experimental results show that the proposed method effectively restores lost features in the light changing images and enhances accuracy of subsequent semantic segmentation.

AB Collaborative exploration using unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) and unmanned ground vehicles (UGVs) has become increasingly popular in academia over the past decade. This study addresses the task of autonomously landing a UAV on a ground vehicle in rough terrain, which is fundamental, yet challenging, for UAV-UGV collaborative exploration. The method proposed in this paper estimates the relative pose and velocity between UAV and UGV and uses model predictive control for UAV trajectory planning while considering the field of view of camera onboard the UAV. Through a simulation study, we confirmed that the proposed method enables a UAV to accurately track the UGV traversing in rough terrain, and to land on it with 100% success rate at the UGV velocity of 1.0 m/s and still 50% at 3.0 m/s.

AB Navigation continues to fundamentally limit our ability to understand the underwater world. Long baseline navigation uses range measurements to localize a remote vehicle using acoustic time-of-flight estimates. For autonomous surveys requiring high precision navigation, current solutions do not satisfy the performance or robustness requirements. Hypothesis grids represent the survey environment capturing the spatial dependence of acoustic range measurement, providing a framework for improving navigation precision and increasing the robustness with respect to non-Gaussian range observations. Prior association probabilities quantify the measurement quality as a belief that subsequent observations will correspond to the direct-path, a multipath, or an outlier as a function of the estimated location. Such a characterization is directly applicable to Bayesian navigation techniques. The algorithm for creating the representation has three main components: Mixed-density sensor model using Gaussian and uniform probability distributions, measurement classification and multipath model identification using expectation-maximization (EM), and grid-based spatial representation. We illustrate the creation of a set of hypothesis grids, the feasibility of the approach, and the utility of the representation using survey data from the autonomous benthic explorer (ABE).

AB Underwater robotic vehicles (URVs) have become an important tool for numerous underwater tasks due to their greater speed, endurance, depth capability, and a higher factor of safely than human divers. However, most vehicle control system designs are based on simplified vehicle models and often result in poor vehicle performance due to the nonlinear and time-varying vehicle dynamics having parameter uncertainties. Conventional proportional-integral-derivative (PID) type controllers cannot provide good performance without fine-tuning the controller gains and may fail for sudden changes in the vehicle dynamics and its environment. Conventional adaptive control systems based on parameter adaptation techniques also fail in the presence of unmodeled dynamics.
   This paper describes a new vehicle control system using the bound estimation techniques, capable of learning, and adapting to changes in the vehicle dynamics and parameters. The control system was extensively ''wet-tested'' on the Omni-Directional Intelligent Navigator (ODIN)-a six degree-of-freedom, experimental underwater vehicle developed at the Autonomous Systems Laboratory, and its performance was compared with the performance of a conventional linear control system. The results showed the controller's ability to provide good performance in the presence of unpredictable changes in the vehicle dynamics and its environment, and it's capabilities of learning and adapting.

AB In this paper, a disturbance observer based nonsingular fast terminal sliding mode control (NFTSMC) scheme is proposed for the trajectory tracking control of an underactuated autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV). A nonlinear disturbance observer (DO) is designed to estimate complex external disturbances and incorporated into a NFTSMC. In constructing sliding surfaces, the parameter selection in the exponential terms in NFTSMC is expanded. Lyapunov's second method proves the uniformly ultimately bounded stability of the proposed DO based NFTSMC. Simulation is performed to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed controller. Compared with the existing NTSMC methods, the convergence rate is improved by the proposed NFTSMC. Moreover, the proposed controller has good robustness to smooth external disturbances. For random disturbances along with an impulse at some time, the proposed controller can also track the disturbance well and achieve good robustness.

AB In this paper, the event-based triggering method is adopted to investigate the secure consensus issue of multiple autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) under denial-of-service (DoS) attacks. DoS attack is a form of time-sequence-based cyber attack, which can destroy the normal service of the control target or network. First, based on an event-triggered mechanism, a novel secure control protocol is proposed. Second, the upper bounds of attack duration and attack frequency are given to ensure that multiple AUVs under DoS attacks can reach consensus. Third, an event-triggered mechanism with exponential variables is developed to avoid the continuous update of the controller, thereby reducing the burdens of communication and calculation. Zeno behavior can be strictly ruled out for each AUV under this triggering mechanism. Finally, the simulation results illustrate the feasibility of the proposed scheme.

ID SYSTEM; OPTIMIZATION; DYNAMICS; STRATEGY
AB For the speed control system of autonomous electric vehicle (AEV), challenge happens with how to determine an appropriate driving speed to satisfy the dynamic environment while resisting uncertainty and disturbance. Therefore, this paper proposes a robust optimal speed control approach based on hierarchical architecture for AEV through combining deep reinforcement learning (DRL) and robust control. In decision-making layer, a deep maximum entropy proximal policy optimization (DMEPPO) algorithm is presented to obtain an optimal speed via dynamic environment information, heuristic target entropy and adaptive entropy constraint. In motion control layer, to track the learned optimal speed while resisting uncertainty and disturbance, a robust speed controller is designed by the linear matrix inequality (LMI). Finally, simulation experiment results show that the proposed robust optimal speed control scheme based on hierarchical architecture for AEV is feasible and effective.

AB In highly interactive driving scenarios, the actions of one agent greatly influence those of its neighbors. Planning safe motions for autonomous vehicles (AVs) in such interactive environments, therefore, requires reasoning about the impact of the ego's intended motion plan on nearby agents' behavior. Deep-learning-based models have recently achieved considerable success in trajectory prediction and many models in the literature allow for ego-conditioned prediction. However, leveraging ego-conditioned prediction remains challenging in downstream planning due to the complex nature of neural networks, limiting the planner structure to simple types, e.g., sampling-based planners. Despite the ability of gradient-based planning algorithms, such as model predictive control (MPC), to generate fine-grained high-quality motion plans, it is difficult for them to leverage ego-conditioned prediction due to their iterative nature and need for gradients. We present Interactive Joint Planning (IJP), which bridges MPC with learned prediction models in a computationally scalable manner to provide us with the best of both the worlds. In particular, IJP optimizes over the joint behavior of the ego and the surrounding agents and leverages deep-learned prediction models as prediction priors that the join trajectory optimization tries to stay close to. Furthermore, by leveraging free-end homotopy classes-a novel concept that we introduce in this letter-IJP efficiently searches over diverse motion plans. Closed-loop simulation results show that IJP significantly outperforms baselines without joint optimization or running sampling-based planning.

AB In this paper, a modified proximate time-optimal control (PTOC) is proposed based on reduced order extended state observer (RESO) and controller scaling method, for the heading control of underactuated autonomous underwater vehicles (AUV) with input nonlinearities. First, a simple and practical modified ADRC is proposed for heading control with input nonlinearities. The non-symmetric dead-zone with unknown parameters is modeled as a combination of linear input and bounded disturbances, and the RESO is designed to estimate and compensate it. The influence of actuator saturation constraint is reduced by limiting the control signal before it goes into the RESO. Then, a parameter self-tuning strategy is proposed for the feedback controller with the changed control gain by the controller scaling method. The control gain is quadratic respect to the velocity of AUV, the active disturbance rejection control (ADRC) controller parameters can be adjusted based on the AUV velocity using the strategy. And finally, the modified PTOC, based on RESO and with an updating strategy for the limit of linear region, is proposed to improve the control performance. Several simulation experiments are carried out, the effectiveness of self-tuning modified ADRC is verified, and the proposed modified PTOC shows better performance.

AB The transportation network can provide additional utility by addressing the safety concerns on roads. On-road fatalities are an unfortunate loss of life and lead to significant costs for society and the economy. Connected and Autonomous Vehicles (CAVs), envisaged as operating with idealised safety and cooperation, could be a means of mitigating these costs. This paper intends to provide insights into the safety improvements to be attained by incrementally transitioning the fleet to CAVs. This investigation is done by constructing a calibrated micro-simulation environment in Vissim and deploying the custom developed Virdi CAV Control Protocol (VCCP) algorithm for CAV behaviour. The CAV behaviour is implemented using an application programming interface and a dynamic linking library. CAVs are introduced to the environment in 10% increments, and safety performance is assessed using the Surrogate Safety Assessment Module (SSAM). The results of this study show that CAVs at low penetrations result in an increase in conflicts at signalised intersections but a decrease at priority-controlled intersections. The initial 20% penetration of CAVs is accompanied by a + 22%, - 87%, - 62% and + 33% change in conflicts at the signalised, priority, roundabout and DDI intersection respectively. CAVs at high penetrations indicate a global reduction in conflicts. A 90% CAV penetration is accompanied by a - 48%, - 100%, -98% and -81% change in conflicts at the signalised, priority, roundabout and DDI intersection respectively.

AB This paper focuses on the development of a nonlinear H-infinity control (NHC) algorithm for an autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) in the vertical plane. A three-degree-of-freedom AUV depth model is developed in terms of a nonlinear affine form which is used to design the control algorithm. The depth is controlled using a backstepping technique which generates a desired pitch angle for the NHC algorithm. The nonlinear control is designed using the L-2-gain analysis which is transformed into a Hamilton-Jacobi-Isaacs (HJI) inequality. Further, the HJI inequality is presented in terms of a nonlinear matrix inequality structure in order to find a solution for the NHC problem using the concept of convex optimization. Hence, we desire to test the convex property of the nonlinear system before the realization of the control algorithm. The robust behaviour of the NHC algorithm is realized by ensuring the performance of the proposed control algorithm in the face of model and parameter uncertainties. A comparison between the NHC algorithm and the state-dependent Riccati equation is made in order to show the efficacy of the developed control algorithm. Furthermore, an experimental study of the proposed control scheme has been pursued to analyse the effectiveness of the developed control algorithm.

AB The main contribution of this article is a novel method for planning globally optimal trajectories for dynamical systems subject to polygonal constraints. The proposed method is a hybrid trajectory planning approach, which combines graph search, i.e., a discrete roadmap method, with convex optimization, i.e., a complete path method. Contrary to past approaches, which have focused on using simple obstacle approximations, or suboptimal spatial discretizations, our approach is able to use the exact geometry of polygonal constraints in order to plan optimal trajectories. The performance and flexibility of the proposed method are evaluated via simulations by planning distance-optimal trajectories for a Dubins car model, as well as time-, distance-, and energy-optimal trajectories for a marine vehicle.

AB V2X communication facilitates information sharing between a vehicle and the infrastructure, pedestrians, devices, or any other entity that may affect the vehicle, which is known as a critical component in 5G that promises to realize the vision of connected and autonomous vehicles. Crowd sensing, a.k.a. collective perception, is one of the essential concepts of V2X networks, where vehicles share their information collected by local perception sensors about the environment for improving safety, saving energy, optimizing traffic, and so on. Although the operational aspects of V2X networks are being studied actively, its security aspect has received little attention. In this article, we discuss security issues that may pose serious threats to crowd sensing in V2X networks, and we focus on V2X-specific threats that are unique in V2X networks, e.g. platoon disruption and perception data falsification. We also discuss countermeasures against these threats and the technical challenges that must be overcome to implement such methods.

AB The docking station is usually deployed at seafloor as a charging node to enhance the endurance of autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs). However, for deep-sea observation requirements, it is nearly unaffordable to deploy extremely long cables to provide power for docking stations. Therefore, this paper proposes a possible power-supply solution by developing an underwater bidirectional wireless power transmission (UBWPT) system. To improve the efficiency of the UBWPT system in underwater scenarios, the power converters coupled with coils is designed by analyzing the eddy current loss and parasitic jumper capacitor in seawater. Additionally, two independent controllers are developed for the transmitting and receiving converters to achieve power flow control underwater. The effectiveness of the bidirectional power converters is verified by developing a 51-W charging prototype system, which improves the system efficiency by 3% in simulated seawater.

AB Autonomous vehicles have recently been very popular and it seems to be causing a major transformation in the automotive industry. A vital component for autonomous vehicles is lane keeping systems. The performance of lane keeping systems is directly related to the lane detection accuracy. For lane detection, various sensors are commonly used. In this paper, a vision based robust lane detection system using a novel 1-dimensional deep learning approach is proposed. Challenging situations as rain, shadow, and illumination reduces the overall performance of vision based approaches. Experimental results show that the performance of proposed approach outperforms existing approaches in literature including these challenging situations in terms of detection performance versus processing speed assessment. Although deep learning based methods that provide high performance have difficulties on low-capacity embedded platforms, the proposed method stands out as a solution with its significantly lower processing time.

AB Three-dimensional (3D) image sensors have many applications, including enabling autonomous vehicles to avoid obstacles and providing guidance, navigation, and control for spacecraft immediately before landing on a celestial body. Flash LIDAR is a system that can acquire a 3D image by emitting a diffuse pulsed laser beam, and hence is suitable for both obstacle detection and terrain measurement. In the 3D image sensors used for Flash LIDAR, a photosensor array and time measurement integrated circuit are vertically bonded. Here, we report the results of a detailed evaluation of the principles, functions, sensitivity, and time measurement accuracy of a prototype 1-k pixel (32 x 32 pixels) 3D image sensor based on a multi-pixel photon counting avalanche photodiode. By counting photons, a 3D image sensor is realized that has both high sensitivity and the ability to measure light intensity.

AB Traditionally, the engineering approaches consider the nominal values for all parameters in the design process, although there is usually a degree of uncertainty in every actual engineering system. Therefore, it is necessary to consider the uncertainty in the design optimization of a system. Multidisciplinary optimization is an approach in which interactions between different disciplines are taken into account, and it tries to find a solution that is optimal in all disciplines. In this paper, reliability based multidisciplinary design optimization with interval-val fuzzy numbers is investigated. In this regard, the design of an autonomous underwater vehicle with five disciplines including sonar, hydrodynamics, propulsion, structure and tactics is considered and two methods named Sequential Optimization and Reliability Assessment and Genetic Algorithm are used to find the optimal solution.

AB Unmanned aerial vehicles, commonly known as drones, have many potential uses in real-world applications. Drones require advanced planning and navigation algorithms to enable them to safely move through and interact with the world around them. This paper presents an extended potential field controller (ePFC) which enables an aerial robot, or drone, to safely track a dynamic target location while simultaneously avoiding any obstacles in its path. The ePFC outperforms a traditional potential field controller with smoother tracking paths and shorter settling times. The proposed ePFC's stability is evaluated by Lyapunov approach, and its performance is simulated in a MATLAB environment. Finally, the controller is implemented on an experimental platform in a laboratory environment which demonstrates the effectiveness of the controller.

AB Autonomous Underwater Vehicle (AUV) response robots are special multipurpose devices, capable of moving and performing various tasks in water, autonomously, or with human teleoperation. Capability assessment of such devices is hard and complex work. This paper describes our work in AUV Response Robot testing from two aspects: First, additional testing methods are proposed for AUV capability assessment and second, we describe, in detail, how an AUV can be enhanced to pass the existing underwater response robot tests, defined by National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST). In the first part of the paper, a short overview of the existing AUV testing methods is given, followed by our proposed, new test scenarios. The second part covers a general overview about our system design and development, which enabled the custom, enhanced AUV to pass the test scenarios.

AB Recently, various technologies and sciences are developed for fourth industrial revolution which includes artificial intelligence, robotics, internet of things, 3-D printing, and autonomous transportation. The autonomous transportation is one of the fourth industrial technology, and has been studying for safety driving. Accurate lane detection and lane departure warning system is very important for autonomous transportation. However, conventional methods have some problems of applying real-driving such as extracting miss lanes under cloudy weather and vehicle disturbance situations. In order to solve the real driving problems, we propose a new lane detection technique for lane departure and forward collision warning system using a single in-vehicle camera. The proposed method consists of triangular lane model, feature points extraction method. In the near field, a triangular lane model is used to approximate a pair of lane boundaries. Subsequently, feature points extraction method based on hyperbola curve model is applied to obtain lane curvature in the far field. Mathematical B-spline applied to feature points for curved lane fitting. Simulation results show that the proposed lane detection and tracking method has good performance.

AB Public vehicle service (PVS), as a paradigm to manage and share large-capacity vehicles for public passenger delivery, is promising to improve the quality of urban transportation. In the PVS system, a command center receives requests sent by passengers, periodically assigns them to public vehicles and schedules vehicle routes to serve the requests. However, in the PVS system, the passengers' waiting time is not well utilized. Moreover, it is observed that the driving distance on low-speed roads accounts for a rather high percentage. These two factors impact on system efficiency. In order to utilize the waiting time, we propose to let passengers walk a short distance instead of standing at their origins. At the same time, the driving distance on low-speed roads will be reduced. In this paper, the closest meeting point algorithm is proposed to address the challenge of determining the best pick-up and drop-off locations. The large-scale simulations show that the passenger walking and the proposed fast-route scheduling strategy can shorten the total vehicle travel distance by 34%.

TI 3D Detection for Occluded Vehicles From Point Clouds
SO IEEE INTELLIGENT TRANSPORTATION SYSTEMS MAGAZINE

DT Article
ID OBJECT DETECTION
AB In autonomous driving, 5D vehicle detection plays an important role in traffic safely, and the detection of occluded vehicles is equally important. Different from 2D images, the point clouds are sparse and disordered, causing an uncompetitive expression for occluded vehicles. As a result, current detection methods cannot achieve a higher performance for the detection of occluded vehicles. To alleviate this problem, we present a novel 3D detector for occluded vehicle GOON) detection using lidar data. The proposed method has the following contributions: different data representations, including a bird's-eye view and voxel grids, which are fused to strongly represent the features of occluded vehicles; a novel voxel-wise convolutional encoder that leverages the hierarchical property of convolutional networks to learn features with spatially local correlation from unordered points; a multiscale detection header that removes the influence of occlusions and optimizes the backpropagation of gradients; and a slimmer 3DOV network is presented to handle the speed-accuracy tradeoff. The experiment results on the KITTI 3D vehicle-detection benchmark show that the 3DOV has achieved excellent performance in terms of accuracy and efficiency, especially for occluded vehicles. Ablation studies are provided to demonstrate the effectiveness of each designed module.

AB A major inadequacy of the Kalman filter is the necessity of accurate measurement models, which may not be possible in the case of complicated disturbances. A new solution to multisensor integrated autonomous navigation based on intelligent information fusion technology for launch vehicles is proposed in this paper, which can improve navigation performance based on the existing measurement models. Artificial neural networks (ANNs) are designed to discover the hidden relationship between the available data and trajectory parameters. The tracking, telemetry, and control system can provide centimeter-level accuracy of the launch vehicle after every flight. While postprocessing data is irrelevant to real-time navigation using traditional methods, it is crucial for ANNs to learn the rules of information fusion and identify the inaccuracy of the input variables. In this way, artificial-intelligence-modified trajectory parameters are expected to be closer to the truth value. The experimental results indicate that the proposed method can significantly improve navigation performance compared with the unscented Kalman filter, and ANNs can achieve good performance in various situations.

ID ACCELERATED EVALUATION
AB Autonomous driving systems have witnessed significant development during the past years thanks to the advance in machine learning-enabled sensing and decision-making algorithms. One critical challenge for their massive deployment in the real world is their safety evaluation. Most existing driving systems are still trained and evaluated on naturalistic scenarios collected from daily life or heuristically-generated adversarial ones. However, the large population of cars, in general, leads to an extremely low collision rate, indicating that safety-critical scenarios are rare in the collected real-world data. Thus, methods to artificially generate scenarios become crucial to measure the risk and reduce the cost. In this survey, we focus on the algorithms of safety-critical scenario generation in autonomous driving. We first provide a comprehensive taxonomy of existing algorithms by dividing them into three categories: data-driven generation, adversarial generation, and knowledge-based generation. Then, we discuss useful tools for scenario generation, including simulation platforms and packages. Finally, we extend our discussion to five main challenges of current works - fidelity, efficiency, diversity, transferability, controllability - and research opportunities lighted up by these challenges.

AB Reliable navigation systems are fundamental for Autonomous Underwater Vehicles (AUVs) to perform complex tasks and missions. It is well known that the Global Positioning System (GPS) cannot be employed in underwater scenarios; thus, during missions below the sea's surface the real-time position is usually obtained with expensive sensors, such as the Doppler Velocity Log (DVL), integrated within a navigation filter such as an Extended Kalman Filter (EKF), Unscented Kalman Filter (UKF), or Dead Reckoning (DR) strategies. The goal of this work is to develop an underwater navigation system that does not rely on a DVL and where linear speed estimations are obtained exploiting data from a Forward-Looking SONAR (FLS) or, in its absence, taking advantage of a dynamic model that presents a reduced set of parameters. The proposed solution is validated through the use of navigation data obtained during sea trials undertaken in July 2018 with FeelHippo AUV at La Spezia (Italy), at the NATO Science and Technology Organization Center for Maritime Research and Experimentation (CMRE).

AB Modern AUV designs must handle submerged autonomous operation for long periods of time. The state of the art solution embedded in the HUGIN AUVs is a Doppler Velocity Log (DVL) aided Inertial Navigation System (INS) that can integrate various forms of position measurement updates. In autonomous operations, position updates are only available in limited periods of time or space, thus the core velocity aided inertial navigation system must exhibit high accuracy However, position uncertainty of a DVL aided inertial navigation system will eventually drift off, compromising either mission operation or requirements for accurate positioning of payload data. To meet the requirements for a range of military and civilian AUV applications, the HUGIN vehicles come with a flexible and powerful set of navigation techniques. Methods for position updates include GPS surface fix, DGPS-USBL, Underwater Transponder Positioning (UTP) and bathymetric terrain navigation. Based on synthetic aperture sonar technology, a potentially revolutionary accurate velocity measurement is under development. HUGIN also comes with a navigation post-processing system (NavLab), which can be applied to increase navigational integrity and maximize position accuracy.

TI Performance Analysis of NDT-based Graph SLAM for Autonomous Vehicle in
   Diverse Typical Driving Scenarios of Hong Kong
SO SENSORS
LA English
DT Article

ID PARTICLE FILTER SLAM; ALIGNMENT
AB Robust and lane-level positioning is essential for autonomous vehicles. As an irreplaceable sensor, Light detection and ranging (LiDAR) can provide continuous and high-frequency pose estimation by means of mapping, on condition that enough environment features are available. The error of mapping can accumulate over time. Therefore, LiDAR is usually integrated with other sensors. In diverse urban scenarios, the environment feature availability relies heavily on the traffic (moving and static objects) and the degree of urbanization. Common LiDAR-based simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) demonstrations tend to be studied in light traffic and less urbanized area. However, its performance can be severely challenged in deep urbanized cities, such as Hong Kong, Tokyo, and New York with dense traffic and tall buildings. This paper proposes to analyze the performance of standalone NDT-based graph SLAM and its reliability estimation in diverse urban scenarios to further evaluate the relationship between the performance of LiDAR-based SLAM and scenario conditions. The normal distribution transform (NDT) is employed to calculate the transformation between frames of point clouds. Then, the LiDAR odometry is performed based on the calculated continuous transformation. The state-of-the-art graph-based optimization is used to integrate the LiDAR odometry measurements to implement optimization. The 3D building models are generated and the definition of the degree of urbanization based on Skyplot is proposed. Experiments are implemented in different scenarios with different degrees of urbanization and traffic conditions. The results show that the performance of the LiDAR-based SLAM using NDT is strongly related to the traffic condition and degree of urbanization. The best performance is achieved in the sparse area with normal traffic and the worse performance is obtained in dense urban area with 3D positioning error (summation of horizontal and vertical) gradients of 0.024 m/s and 0.189 m/s, respectively. The analyzed results can be a comprehensive benchmark for evaluating the performance of standalone NDT-based graph SLAM in diverse scenarios which is significant for multi-sensor fusion of autonomous vehicle.

AB Future smart transportation systems are anticipated to integrate automation and sharing of vehicles. Responding to the expected changes in shared mobility services, this study used representative data from over 4100 households in California to examine consumers' affinity to use shared automated vehicles (SAV) and their willingness to renounce existing vehicle(s) in the presence of SAVs - two interlinked factors determining the longterm success of SAVs. Results of the study showed that around 50 % of the households reported willingness to use SAVs but unwillingness to renounce their current vehicle(s). As innovators, another 9.1 % stated their affinity to use SAVs and renounce existing vehicle(s) but with heterogeneity across vehicle ownership levels. Random parameter logit models revealed that households using existing vehicles to work for ride hailing companies were significantly less likely to use SAVs and renounce their current vehicle(s). Households who had high awareness about self-driving cars, possessed full electric vehicles, used sustainable work travel modes (bike, e-bike, bikeshare), had greater number of leased vehicles and ridesharing trips were more likely to use SAVs and renounce current vehicle(s). Significant unobserved preference heterogeneity was recorded in the effects of behavioral and sociodemographic correlates. The study contributes by shedding new light on the behavioral determinants of the vehicle ownership impacts of SAVs. We discuss policy implications of the key findings.

AB This paper presents a novel real-time tire-road friction coefficient estimation method that is independent of vehicle longitudinal motion for ground vehicles with separable control of the front and rear wheels. The tire-road friction coefficient information is of critical importance for vehicle dynamic control systems and intelligent autonomous vehicle applications. In this paper, the vehicle longitudinal-motion-independent tire-road friction coefficient estimation method consists of three main components: 1) an observer to estimate the internal state of a dynamic LuGre tire model; 2) an adaptive control law with a parameter projection mechanism to track the desired vehicle longitudinal motion in the presence of tire-road friction coefficient uncertainties and actively injected braking excitation signals; and 3) a recursive least square estimator that is independent of the control law, to estimate the tire-road friction coefficient in real time. Simulation results based on a high-fidelity CarSim full-vehicle model show that the system can reliably estimate the tire-road friction coefficient independent of vehicle longitudinal motion.

AB To inspect subsea cables, an autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) with two triaxial magnetometers is usually assigned to track the cable route. In this paper, a novel two-layer framework synthesizing antinoise cable localization and robust tracking algorithm is proposed to guide an AUV to track subsea cables in the presence of sensor noise and ocean currents. First, an analytic formulation for the cable localization using two magnetometers is derived, and then a dedicated magnetic line-of-sight (LOS) guidance is built based on the horizontal offset between the AUV and the cable. Second, a novel antinoise method by estimating the horizontal offset is integrated into the LOS guidance law to reduce the negative effects of magnetic noise in the kinematic layer. Subsequently, in the dynamic layer, a simplified yet robust feedback controller with reduced implementation complexity is designed to track the desired guidance profiles, such that the AUV is able to track subsea cables in the presence of sensor noise and ocean currents. In addition, the capability of dynamic control laws accounting for ocean currents is analyzed in the amplitude-frequency domain. Finally, numerical studies illustrate the antinoise and robust performance of the proposed two-layer framework for subsea cable tracking.

AB Unmanned Surface Vehicle (USV) is a novel multifunctional platform for ocean observation, and its heading and velocity control are essential and important for autonomous operation. A coupled heading and velocity controller is designed using backstepping technology for an USV called USBV' (Unmanned Surface Bathymetry Vehicle). The USBV is an underactuated catamaran, where the heading and velocity are controlled together by two thrusters at the stern. The three degrees-of-freedom equations are used for USBV's modeling, which is identified using experiment data. The identified model, with two inputs, induces heading and velocity tracking, which are coupled. Based on the model, a nonlinear controller for heading and velocity are acquired using backstepping technology. The stability of the controller is proved by Lyapunov theory under some assumptions. The verification is presented by lake and sea experiments.

AB Velocity profile optimization using upcoming signal information of urban vehicles is one of the main eco-driving techniques, which can significantly enhance the capability of reducing idling fuel loss and trip time. This paper proposes a hierarchical velocity control system considering different drive preferences for connected and automated vehicles to improve overall efficiency under the vehicle-to-X (V2X) environment. Two major contributions are (i) control-oriented formulation of task planning in multiple road segments, which is amiable to numerical computation and can consider different drive preferences; and (ii) solving the nonlinear velocity trajectory optimization to realize real-time control in the lower level. Simulation results indicate that energy-saving and computational efficiency are improved using the proposed control system. The solution algorithm is further demonstrated under a hardware-in-the-loop simulation.

AB Complex slippage and nonholonomic constraints can disturb the precise movement of tracked vehicles. In this study, a position control system using driving force control and virtual-turning velocity control (VTVC) was established for a tracked vehicle. Slippage in the translational direction can be suppressed by controlling the driving force of the crawlers, estimated using the vehicle velocity. However, the driving forces interfere with each other in a turning motion. Therefore, a driving force distribution method was developed using the instantaneous turning center of a vehicle to decouple the forces. This distribution induced slippage in the direction of turning. In addition, a virtual reference was derived from the vehicle velocity and lateral disturbance, which described the effects of the nonholonomic constraints and skidding of the tracked vehicle. Next, a VTVC method was developed to suppress the lateral disturbance by controlling the turning velocity to follow the virtual reference. The experimental results confirm that the proposed approach ensures high-performance position tracking and adequate slippage of the tracked vehicle.

AB This paper presents test results and performance characterization of the first fixed-wing unmanned vehicle capable of full cross-domain operation in both the aerial and underwater environments with repeated transition and low-energy loitering capabilities. This vehicle concept combines the speed and range of an aircraft with the persistence, diving capabilities, and stealth of a submersible. The paper describes the proof-of-concept vehicle including its concept of operations, the approaches employed to achieve the required functions, and the main components and subsystems. Key subsystems include a passively flooding and draining wing, a single motor and propeller combination for propulsion in both domains, and aerodynamic-hydrodynamic control surfaces. Experiments to quantify the vehicle performance, control responses, and energy consumption in underwater, surface, and flight operation are presented and analyzed. Results of several full-cycle tests are presented to characterize and illustrate each stage of operation including surface locomotion, underwater locomotion, water egress, flight, and water ingress. In total, the proof-of-concept vehicle demonstrated 12 full-cycle cross-domain missions including both manually controlled and autonomous operation.

AB Since the last few years, the Internet of Vehicles (IoV) has gained more interest from the community because of the rapid development of autonomous vehicles, the growing amount of data generated by vehicles' sensors, and the motivation to use this data for different purposes. Given the very dynamic nature of fast moving vehicles, building a network that guarantees the Quality of Service (QoS) is still a challenge. This is why we have developed an original architecture and a programmable objective function to improve QoS on the ever-changing networks present in the IoV. Simulation results will show that the proposed solution adapts better to mobility by providing better packet delivery ratio up to five times, achieving three times less packet losses and greatly reducing the energy consumption by a factor 10 compared with state of the art solutions, without compromising delay nor throughput usage.

AB The safety of increasingly automated vehicles is of great concern to regulators, yet crash rates are generally reported by manufacturers using proprietary metrics with limited source data. Without consistent definitions of crashes and exposure, automated vehicle crash rates cannot be meaningfully compared with baseline datasets. The objective of this study was to establish methods to normalize automated vehicle crash rates using one manufacturer's crash reports as a case study. The manufacturer's quarterly crash rates for vehicles using SAE Level 1 and Level 2 automation were compared. Road type was controlled for using data from a naturalistic driving study with the same model vehicles, while driver age was controlled for using demographic ownership surveys. Although Level 2 vehicles were claimed to have a 43% lower crash rate than Level 1 vehicles, their improvement was only 10% after controlling for different rates of freeway driving. Direct comparison with general public driving was impossible due to unclear crash severity thresholds in the manufacturer's reports, but analysis showed that controlling for driver age would increase reported crash rates by 11%. These results establish the need for detailed crash data, crash definitions, and exposure and demographic data in order to accurately assess automated vehicle safety.

AB This pilot study focuses on employment of hybrid LMS-ICA system for in-vehicle background noise reduction. Modern vehicles are nowadays increasingly supporting voice commands, which are one of the pillars of autonomous and SMART vehicles. Robust speaker recognition for contextaware in-vehicle applications is limited to a certain extent by in-vehicle background noise. This article presents the new concept of a hybrid system, which is implemented as a virtual instrument. The highly modular concept of the virtual car used in combination with real recordings of various driving scenarios enables effective testing of the investigated methods of in-vehicle background noise reduction. The study also presents a unique concept of an adaptive system using intelligent clusters of distributed next generation 5G data networks, which allows the exchange of interference information and/or optimal hybrid algorithm settings between individual vehicles. On average, the unfiltered voice commands were successfully recognized in 29.34% of all scenarios, while the LMS reached up to 71.81%, and LMS-ICA hybrid improved the performance further to 73.03%.

AB Unmanned, underwater vehicles have been developed considerably in recent years. Remotely operated vehicles (ROVs) are increasingly used for routine inspection and maintenance tasks but have a range that is limited by the umbilical cable. For long range operations, such as oceanographic exploration and surveying, autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) are emerging which have on-board power and are equipped with advanced control capabilities to carry out tasks with the minimum of human intervention. AUVs typically resemble torpedoes in that most have control surfaces and a single propulsion unit, and must move forwards to manoeuvre. Such vehicles are called flight vehicles. This paper describes techniques which are candidates for control of a flight AUV and identifies controllers used on some existing vehicles. Since underwater vehicle dynamics are nonlinear, fuzzy logic and sliding mode control were felt to have promise for autopilot application due to their potential robustness. Following development using a comprehensive simulation programme, the controllers were tested using the experimental vehicle, Subzero II, and their performance compared with that of a classical linear controller. The relative merits of the methods for practical implementation are discussed.

AB Before having a massive deployment of fully connected and autonomous vehicles (CAVs), CAVs with different automation levels and human-driven vehicles (HVs) will coexist on roads for a long time. To quantify the impacts of CAV technology on vehicle market penetration and travelers' route choices in the future from the perspective of transportation planning, this paper investigates a two-sided market equilibrium problem, which considers the vehicle market on one side and the road traffic equilibrium market on the other side. The two markets interactively affect each other through market penetration, information quality, and spatial distribution of congestion, which are all endogenously determined in our model. In the vehicle market, two-stage decision-making is considered to describe various vehicle choices users may face in the future. In the first stage, users between each origin-destination (OD) pair choose a vehicle type between HV and CAV. In the second stage, CAV users further choose a vehicle automaton level. To account for the similarity of CAVs with different automation levels, we use a nested logit (NL) model to capture the two-stage decision-making. A vehicle choice with a higher market penetration provides higher-quality information, which affects the traffic equilibrium market. For the traffic equilibrium, route choices of users with different information quality are described by a multinomial logit (MNL) model. The spatial distribution of congestion determined by the traffic equilibrium also affects vehicle choices in the vehicle market. Specifically, users with higher quality information are more likely to choose routes with the lowest travel time. Consequently, a vehicle choice with a lower expected travel time attracts more users. The two-sided market equilibrium is formulated as a combined NL-MNL model so as to solve the two interactive market equilibria simultaneously. Then, we explore the properties of the equilibrium state. Sufficient and necessary conditions for the path flow pattern and demand pattern at equilibrium are derived, respectively. Based on the properties of the equilibrium state, we derive an equivalent variational inequality (VI) for the combined NL-MNL model. A new approach is provided to deriving two sufficient conditions, either of which guarantees the uniqueness of the VI solution. To solve the proposed problem efficiently, we develop a path-based modified self-regulated averaging (PMSRA) algorithm embedded with a modified K-shortest path method. Finally, numerical experiments are conducted to analyze the effects of CAV technology and demonstrate algorithm efficiency. Sensitivity analysis of parameters in the algorithm is also performed. Our results show that the market penetration of CAVs at the early stage of introduction is low due to the high purchase cost. With the development of CAV technology and mass production, fully automated CAVs may gradually dominate the market, while partially automated CAVs tend to be squeezed out of the market. In addition, our results reveal that the travel time saving from CAV technology and high-quality information is more pronounced for long trips and congested networks.

AB Notwithstanding the growing presence of AGVs in the industry, there is a lack of research about multi-wheeled AGVs which offer higher maneuverability and space efficiency. In this letter, we present generalized path continuity conditions as a continuation of previous research done for vehicles with more constrained kinematic capabilities. We propose a novel approach for analytically defining various kinematic modes (motion modes), that AGVs with multiple steer&drive wheels can utilize. This approach enables deriving vehicle kinematic equations based on the vehicle configuration and its constraints, path shape, and corresponding motion mode. Finally, we derive general continuity conditions for paths that multi-wheeled AGVs can follow, and show through examples how they can be utilized in layout design methods.

AB Car-sharing has experienced a significant boom in recent years, with estimates suggesting that car-sharing programs are now operating in over 30 countries worldwide, serving around five million users. The potential to reduce individual vehicle ownership rates is frequently cited as a motive for promoting car-sharing. While some previous studies have argued that customers are indeed willing to reduce the total number of vehicles owned after becoming car-sharing members, the reliability of these findings is tenuous given that many are based on self-selected samples of car-sharing users, resulting in biased estimates. In theory, the availability of car-sharing programs could have limited effect on the general public's car ownership decisions-or at least have no effect on a large portion of travelers. Whether or not traveler decision processes are significantly influenced by specific attributes of different car-sharing options (e.g., access time, vehicle size, fuel type, etc.) remains an unanswered question, as there are limited quantitative studies on this issue. To contribute to filling this research gap, this paper discusses the findings of a study of 1,500 private households across major Australian cities. A nested logit model is used to investigate the impacts of car-sharing on respondents' household vehicle ownership decisions. In contrast to the results of some previous studies, we find that the stated availability of car-sharing appears to have minimal impact on respondents' decision to own a vehicle or not, leading to important policy implications. We agree with prior investigations that car-sharing could potentially reduce private car ownership. However, because this study finds limited impact of the availability of car-sharing on vehicle ownership, and because the majority of respondents did not self-identify as car-sharing users, education and awareness campaigns could be important factors in improving the general public's preferences towards car-sharing and fully realizing car-sharing's benefits to society.

AB Unmanned aerial vehicle use continues to increase, including operating beyond line of sight in unknown environments where the vehicle must autonomously generate a trajectory to safely navigate. In this article, we develop a trajectory generation algorithm for vehicles with second-order dynamics in unknown environments with bounded wind disturbances in which the vehicle only relies on its on-board distance sensors and communication with other vehicles to navigate. The proposed algorithm generates smooth trajectories and can be used with high-level planners and low-level motion controllers. The algorithm computes a maximum safe cruise velocity for the vehicle in the environment and guarantees that the trajectory does not violate the vehicle's thrust limitation, sensor constraints, or user-defined clearance radius around other vehicles and obstacles. Additionally, the trajectories are guaranteed to reach a stationary goal position in finite time given a finite number of bounded obstacles. Simulation results demonstrate the algorithm properties through two scenarios. First, a quadrotor navigating through a moving obstacle field to a goal position and, second, multiple quadrotors navigating into a building to different goal positions.

AB Autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) equipped with online visual inspection systems can detect underwater targets during underwater operations, which is of great significance to subsea exploration. However, the undersea scene has some instinctive challenging problems, such as poor lighting conditions, sediment burial, and marine biofouling mimicry, which makes it difficult for traditional target detection algorithms to achieve online, reliable, and accurate detection of underwater targets. To solve the above issues, this paper proposes a real-time object detection algorithm for underwater targets based on a lightweight convolutional neural network model. To improve the imaging quality of underwater images, contrast limited adaptive histogram equalization with the fused multicolor space (FCLAHE) model is designed to enhance the image quality of underwater targets. Afterwards, a spindle-shaped backbone network is designed. The inverted residual block and group convolutions are used to extract depth features to ensure the target detection accuracy on one hand and to reduce the model parameter volume on the other hand under complex scenarios. Through extensive experiments, the precision, recall, and mAP of the proposed algorithm reached 91.2%, 90.1%, and 88.3%, respectively. It is also noticeable that the proposed method has been integrated into the embedded GPU platform and deployed in the AUV system in the practical scenarios. The average computational time is 0.053s, which satisfies the requirements of real-time object detection.

TI Machine Learning-Based Detection for Cyber Security Attacks on Connected

AB Connected and Autonomous Vehicle (CAV)-related initiatives have become some of the fastest expanding in recent years, and have started to affect the daily lives of people. More and more companies and research organizations have announced their initiatives, and some have started CAV road trials. Governments around the world have also introduced policies to support and accelerate the deployments of CAVs. Along these, issues such as CAV cyber security have become predominant, forming an essential part of the complications of CAV deployment. There is, however, no universally agreed upon or recognized framework for CAV cyber security. In this paper, following the UK CAV cyber security principles, we propose a UML (Unified Modeling Language)-based CAV cyber security framework, and based on which we classify the potential vulnerabilities of CAV systems. With this framework, a new CAV communication cyber-attack data set (named CAV-KDD) is generated based on the widely tested benchmark data set KDD99. This data set focuses on the communication-based CAV cyber-attacks. Two classification models are developed, using two machine learning algorithms, namely Decision Tree and Naive Bayes, based on the CAV-KDD training data set. The accuracy, precision and runtime of these two models when identifying each type of communication-based attacks are compared and analysed. It is found that the Decision Tree model requires a shorter runtime, and is more appropriate for CAV communication attack detection.

AB Emerging autonomous vehicles (AVs) and shared mobility systems per se will transform urban passenger transportation. Coupled together, shared AVs (SAVs) can facilitate widespread use of shared mobility services by providing flexible public travel modes comparable to private AV. Hence, it may be conjectured that future urban mobility is likely an on-demand service and AV private ownership is unappealing. Nonetheless, it is still unclear what observable and latent factors will drive public interest in (S)AVs, the answer to which will have important implications on transportation system performance. This paper aims to jointly model public interest in private AVs and multiple SAV configurations (carsharing, ridesourcing, ridesharing, and access/egress mode) in daily and commute travels with explicit treatment of the correlations across the (S)AV types. To this end, multivariate ordered outcome models with latent variables are employed, whereby latent attitudes and preferences describing traveler safety concern about AV, green travel pattern, and mobility-on-demand savviness are accounted for using structural and measurement equations. Drawing from a stated preference survey in the State of Washington, important insights are gained into the potential user groups based on the socio-economic, built environment, and daily/commute travel behavior attributes. Key policies are also offered to promote public interest in (S)AVs by scrutinizing the marginal effects of the latent variables.

It aims to detect and track suspicious targets. The proposed system perceives the surrounding environment and avoids obstacles while tracking. The proposed system is evaluated with accuracy, precision, recall, P-R curve, and F1 score. The empirical results showed a robust target tracking for the unmanned surface vehicles. The proposed approach contributes to the intelligent management and control required by today's ships, and also provides a new tracking network architecture for the unmanned surface vehicles.

AB In this paper, we consider the cooperative adaptive cruise control problem of connected autonomous vehicles networked by heterogeneous wireless channel transmission. The cooperative adaptive cruise control model with variable input delays is established to describe the varying time-delays induced from vehicular actuators and heterogeneous channel transmission. Then a set of decentralized time-delay feedback cooperative adaptive cruise control controllers is computed in such way that each vehicle evaluates its own adaptive cruise control strategy using only neighborhood information. In order to establish string stability of the connected vehicle platoon with the decentralized controllers, the sufficient conditions are obtained in the form of linear matrix inequalities. The scenarios, consisting of four different cars with three heterogeneous wireless channels, are used to demonstrate the effectiveness of the presented method.

AB This paper presents a navigation system that enables small-scale unmanned aerial vehicles to navigate autonomously using a 2D laser range finder in foliage environment without GPS. The navigation framework consists of real-time dual layer control, navigation state estimation and online path planning. In particular, the inner loop of a quadrotor is stabilized using a commercial autopilot while the outer loop control is implemented using robust perfect tracking. The navigation state estimation consists of real-time onboard motion estimation and trajectory smoothing using the GraphSLAM technique. The onboard real-time motion estimation is achieved by a Kalman filter, fusing the planar velocity measurement from matching the consecutive scans of a laser range finder and the acceleration measurement of an inertial measurement unit. The trajectory histories from the real-time autonomous navigation together with the observed features are fed into a sliding-window based pose-graph optimization framework. The online path planning module finds an obstacle-free trajectory based the local measurement of the laser range finder. The performance of the proposed navigation system is demonstrated successfully on the autonomous navigation of a small-scale UAV in foliage environment.

AB A fundamental aspect of autonomous vehicle guidance is planning trajectories. Historically, two fields have contributed to trajectory or motion planning methods: robotics and dynamics and control. The former typically have a stronger focus on computational issues and real-time robot control, while the latter emphasize the dynamic behavior and more specific aspects of trajectory performance. Guidance for Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs), including fixed- and rotary-wing aircraft, involves significant differences from most traditionally defined mobile and manipulator robots. Qualities characteristic to UAVs include non-trivial dynamics, three-dimensional environments, disturbed operating conditions, and high levels of uncertainty in state knowledge. Otherwise, UAV guidance shares qualities with typical robotic motion planning problems, including partial knowledge of the environment and tasks that can range from basic goal interception, which can be precisely specified, to more general tasks like surveillance and reconnaissance, which are harder to specify. These basic planning problems involve continual interaction with the environment. The purpose of this paper is to provide an overview of existing motion planning algorithms while adding perspectives and practical examples from UAV guidance approaches.

AB This paper describes the design, industrial application, and field testing of a technique for autonomous wheeled-vehicle path following that uses iterative learning control (ILC) in a feedback linearized space. One advantage of this approach is that ILC is used without having to employ approximate linearization at every time step. The main contribution of this paper is the unique field experiments that used two large industrial-scale center-articulated underground mining vehicles. The described field work not only tested the underlying technique on commercial vehicles, but also presents a method for parallel speed learning, wherein the speed is adjusted over subsequent learning trials to improve cycle productivity. Finally, presented are field results for an approach to prelearning through simulation before deployment in the field to reduce the initial path-following errors.

AB Considering the fact that it is very difficult to fully model an autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) in the complex water environment, this paper presents a model-free tracking control strategy for an AUV in the presence of unknown disturbances. We first formulate an optimized control problem by defining a track -ing Hamilton-Jacobi-Isaac (HJI) equation. Then, we present a reinforcement learning (RL) algorithm to compute an optimized solution by learning from the HJI equation online. It is noted that during the learn-ing period, no information about the AUV's dynamics is needed. In order to demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed strategy, numerical simulation is considered, results are validated and discussed. (c) 2021 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB The Deep Q-Network (DQN) is one of the key methods in the deep reinforcement learning algorithm, which has a deep neural network structure used to estimate Q-values in Qlearning methods. We have previously implemented a simulation system considering DQN for control of actuator nodes in Wireless Sensor and Actuator Networks (WSANs). In addition, we have designed and implemented a DQN based Autonomous Aerial Vehicle (AAV) testbed. In this paper, we propose and evaluate a Tabu List Strategy based DQN (TLS-DQN) for AAV mobility control. For evaluation, we compared the simulation results of the mobility control of AAV in indoor single-path environment using normal DQN and the TLS-DQN. The simulation results show that the TLS-DQN has a better performance than the normal DQN. (C) 2021 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB This paper proposes a strategy to improve the efficiency of a low-frequency Wireless Power Transfer (WPT) system used to charge the battery of an Autonomous Underwater Vehicle (AUV) through an Inductive Power Transfer (IPT). The IPT system uses a Split-Core Transformer (SCT) to transfer power from the docking base to the AUV, without electric contact. Under gap variation, the efficiency is changed because the variation of SCT parameters. Therefore, the input frequency is changed in order to improve the efficiency of the system trough the Maximum Efficiency Point Tracking algorithm (MEPT) without communication between primary and secondary sides. Experimental results are presented to validate the theoretical analysis and to demonstrate the behaviour of the transformer under different values of gap and excitation frequency.

AB For the purpose of localization and time synchronization of underwater sensor networks, buoys are generally distributed on the sea surface of the area of interest, serving as fixed anchors. However, this method is not economical and has poor scalability. An alternative is to employ an autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) as a mobile anchor. By receiving the periodical broadcast signals from the AUV, any sensor in the communication range can measure time of arrival of received packets and obtain a series of nonlinear equations. In this letter, we proposed an efficient linear algorithm to solve the nonlinear equations, and gave closedform positioning and synchronization error analysis. Besides, we show that the proposed method can approach the Cramer-Rao lower bound by both theoretical analysis and simulation.

SO JOURNAL OF MARINE ENGINEERING AND TECHNOLOGY

DT Article
AB This paper presents a Lyapunov-based backstepping approach for developing cooperative motion control for multiple autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs). The cooperative motion is achieved using a leader-follower (LF) formation strategy in the presence of discrete data transmission between the leader AUV and the follower AUVs. To address the problem of sampled data transmission between the leader and the followers, an estimator is designed for each follower to estimate the states of the leader AUV. The proposed backstepping control algorithm enables the follower AUVs to successfully follow the desired virtual frames provided by the leader AUV. Thus, a formation shape is maintained by the followers while traversing the desired path. The simulation results suggest that the proposed Lyapunov-based backstepping controller is effective for achieving successful cooperative motion control of multiple AUVs in the presence of discrete data transmission.

DT Article
AB Guidance and navigation of airborne missiles has been reported extensively in the literature; however, little attention has been paid to the issue of guidance and docking of an autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV). The retrieval of an AUV to a mother submarine (target) is conceived as a target interception problem and is considered herein. The design problem is solved in two stages: first, the guidance technique is demonstrated assuming zero lag AUV dynamics; next, the AUV-controller dynamics is included in the guidance loop. Thus, the issue of guidance, navigation and control is solved in a unified framework. This is necessaryfora realistic evaluation of the AUV-target engagement envelope without causing the actuators to saturate. The effectiveness of the guidance law is demonstrated in simulation studies with various AUV-target engagement geometries. Finally, the effectiveness of the guidance scheme in presence of disturbances is also illustrated.

AB In this paper, a hierarchical system, in which each level is composed by a neural-based classifier, is proposed to recognize objects in underwater images. The system has been designed to help an autonomous underwater vehicle in sea-bottom survey operations, like pipeline inspections. The input image is divided into square regions (macro-pixels) and a neural tree is used to classify each region into different object classes (pipeline, sea-bottom, or anodes). Each macro-pixel is then analyzed according to some geometric and environment constraints: macro-pixels with doubt classification are divided into four parts and re-classified. The process is iterated until the desired accuracy is reached. Experimental results, which have been performed on a large set of real underwater images acquired in different sea environments, demonstrate the robustness and the accuracy of the proposed system.

AB Lane detection is an essential task in autonomous driving. A good lane detection model should achieve many objectives, such as high accuracy, rapid detection, and low memory. In this article, a grid-based network (G-NET) is designed to realize the aforementioned goals. In G-NET, the traditional pixel-level semantic segmentation is replaced with the area-level grid segmentation to release the detection burden. Then, a position vector is introduced to indicate where lane key point is in the grid. Meanwhile, the novel rolling convolution layer following with the down-sampling and up-sampling convolution layer has been designed for good feature extraction, ensuring each feature grid perceives all other grid features in the feature map. Then, an adaptive hyperparameter branch is introduced to calculate the binary threshold effectively. Finally, the detected lane points are classified into different lanes by introducing distance-based quaternion. G-NET is extensively evaluated on three most widely datasets: TuSimple, CULane, and CurveLanes. The results show that G-NET has a state-of-the-art performance. Meanwhile, field tests are conducted.

AB This paper is focused on planning fast, accurate, and optimal trajectories for autonomous parking. Nominally, this task should be described as an optimal control problem (OCP), wherein the collision-avoidance constraints guarantee travel safety and the kinematic constraints guarantee tracking accuracy. The dimension of the nominal OCP is high because it requires the vehicle to avoid collision with each obstacle at every moment throughout the entire parking process. With a coarse trajectory guiding a homotopic route, the intractably scaled collision-avoidance constraints are replaced by within-corridor constraints, whose scale is small and independent from the environment complexity. Constructing such a corridor sacrifices partial free spaces, which may cause loss of optimality or even feasibility. To address this issue, our proposed method reconstructs the corridor in an iterative framework, where a lightweight OCP with only box constraints is quickly solved in each iteration. The proposed planner, together with several prevalent optimization-based planners are tested under 115 simulation cases w.r.t. the success rate and computational time. Real-world indoor experiments are conducted as well.

AB An ad hoc network is a decentralized network that consists of mobile nodes with wireless communication devices without the aid of access points. A Vehicular Ad-hoc NETwork (VANET) is one of the representative applications of the ad hoc network. Epidemic routing has been proposed as a routing protocol based on Store-Carry-Forward mechanism for VANET environment. However, in Epidemic Routing, network resources such as packet buffer of a node are significantly consumed because data packets are spread across the network. Therefore, this paper proposes a new autonomous clustering-based data transfer scheme using positions and moving direction of vehicles for VANETs. The autonomous clustering configures multiple clusters in the network and then only the cluster head that manages the cluster stores data packets. Whenever the cluster meets a new cluster, the cluster head of the cluster decides whether it should forward data packets to the new cluster based on its own position, the destination node's position, and moving direction of the cluster. Finally, this paper presents the simulation results to show the effectiveness of the proposed scheme.

AB Vehicles are extremely vulnerable to single-vehicle accidents under some hazardous driving conditions (i.e. strong wind, icy or snowy road surface). An integrated framework is proposed to assess single-vehicle traffic safety performance of stochastic traffic flow under hazardous driving conditions. Different from most existing studies focusing on a single vehicle moving at a constant speed, for the first time, the proposed work evaluates individual vehicle safety performance based on the time-dependent simulation results of stochastic traffic flow, including instantaneous speeds and positions of each vehicle as a part of simulated traffic flow. Simultaneously, complex geometric and other environmental conditions of the highway system are also considered realistically, not only during the safety assessment process, but also in quantifying the wind loads applied on the vehicles. Finally, with the safety information of each individual vehicle, an overall safety performance index of the whole traffic flow on the highway system is further introduced, which serves as a potential traffic safety performance measure and resilience indicator of transportation infrastructure systems under various hazards. This study has potential applications to not only regular vehicles, but also advanced traffic management and control algorithms for connected and autonomous vehicles in hazardous driving environments.

AB A theoretical analysis of on-line autonomous intelligent adaptive tracking controller based on emotional learning model in mammalians brain (BELBIC) for aerospace launch vehicle is presented. The control algorithm is provided with some sensory inputs and reward signal, subsequently it autonomously seeks the proper control signal to be executed by actuators, thus eliminating tracking error without pre-knowledge of the plant dynamics. The algorithm is very robust and fast in adaptation with dynamical change in the plant, due to its on-line learning ability. Development and application of this algorithm for an aerospace launch vehicle during atmospheric flight in an experimental setting is presented to illustrate the performance of the control algorithm.

AB Planning a feasible, and safe trajectory is a crucial procedure for autonomous parking which remains to be fully solved. Generally, a trajectory is depicted by a sequence of configurations which include positions, and orientations. However, existing approaches usually design parking trajectories without considering the evolution from one configuration to the next. Hence, these trajectories are practically infeasible in some scenarios, and safety risks may exist. In this paper, a guaranteed collision-free trajectory planning method is proposed for autonomous parking. A dynamic optimisation problem is built, which includes vehicle kinematics, collision avoidance constraints, and physical restraints. Then the dynamic optimisation problem is discretised into a finite-dimensional nonlinear programming problem. To describe collision avoidance constraints, the concepts of the virtual protection frame, and the magnification parameter are introduced. It is highlighted that a novel collision detection criterion is raised from the view of geometry. Tests in three common scenarios, and a complex scenario illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach. Moreover, the stability of the algorithm is discussed in this paper. Via the proposed approach, an integrated design of planning, and control is possible.

AB Highly accurate, camera-based object detection is an essential component of autonomous navigation and assistive technologies. In particular, for on-road applications, localization quality of objects in the image plane is important for accurate distance estimation, safe trajectory prediction, and motion planning. In this paper, we mathematically formulate and study a strategy for improving object localization with a deep convolutional neural network. An iterative region-of-interest pooling framework is proposed for predicting increasingly tight object boxes and addressing limitations in current state-of-the-art deep detection models. The method is shown to significantly improve the performance on a variety of datasets, scene settings, and camera perspectives, producing high-quality object boxes at a minor additional computational expense. Specifically, the architecture achieves impressive gains in performance (up to 6% improvement in detection accuracy) at fast run-time speed (0.22 s per frame on 1242 x 375 sized images). The iterative refinement is shown to impact subsequent vision tasks, such as object tracking in the image plane and in ground plane.

AB The recent development of new offshore projects in pre-salt deepwater fields has placed offshore loading operations as the main production outflow alternative, increasing the operational complexity and risks. Numerous dangerous situations are associated with oil offloading, such as the messenger line transfer during the mooring stage. Nowadays, this critical task is realized by launching a thin messenger cable using the pneumatic line throwing apparatus. This is a complex and slow process since the operation usually occurs with the ship opposite to the wind. This work proposes a hybrid flight methodology based on computer vision and sensor fusion techniques for autonomous unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs). The UAV takes off from an oil rig and precisely reaches a specific point in the shuttle tanker without using expensive positioning devices and augmenting UAV's orientation (yaw) precision since the compass can suffer from severe interference due to naval metallic structures near the vehicle. The proposed framework was tested in a realistic simulated environment considering several practical operational constraints. The results demonstrated both the robustness and efficiency of the methodology.

AB Docking safety is a key problem during the docking phase of the unmanned aerial vehicle probe-drogue autonomous aerial refueling (UAV-PD-AAR). To solve this problem, a novel and effective method based on docking success-probability and docking reachability is presented in this paper. Firstly, by employing the location of the drogue with respect to the probe, a docking success-probability estimation algorithm is proposed to give the probe-drogue docking success-probability in real time, with UAV control and drogue attitude considered. Secondly, considering UAV longitudinal dynamics, a docking reachability calculation algorithm for docking reachable set is designed to ensure the UAV can safely reach the docking target set, by using Hamilton-Jacobi equation. Finally, the docking safety algorithm during the docking phase of UAV-PD-AAR is constructed, based on the estimated docking success-probability and the calculated docking reachability. The experiments of docking success-probability estimation and docking reachability calculation were conducted, which can be used towards docking safety analysis during the docking phase of UAV-PD-AAR.

AB People's mindset and attitudes exert a strong influence on how quickly a new technology is adopted, thus also affecting how well the benefits resulting from automated vehicles can be realised. In previous studies on people's attitudes towards automated vehicles, the number of respondents surveyed has been small, or alternatively survey's sample has not been representative. By describing the results of a large citizen survey (N = 2036), this study aims to fill this identified research gap and to reveal, whether people are ready for automated vehicles and what concerns people have that hinder the adoption of these vehicles. The study's results indicate that people's attitudes towards automated vehicles reflect the general adoption of technology well. We can assume that those who currently view automated vehicles positively are most likely to belong in the group of early adopters. We found that men, highly educated individuals, people living in densely populated area and those living in households without a car had a more positive attitude to automated vehicles than the other respondents did. The results indicate that traffic safety and ethical perspectives have a key role in the acceptance of automated vehicles. Developers of automated vehicles should also take into account the finding that currently most people consider that all automated vehicles must have the option of manual drive. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

AB On-demand ridesharing has been recognised as an effective way to meet travel needs while significantly reducing the number of required vehicles. As the growth of on-demand mobility services and the advent of shared autonomous vehicles are envisioned to boost the presence of ridesharing vehicles, these may soon significantly affect traffic patterns in our cities. However, most previous studies investigating dynamic ridesharing systems overlook the effects on travel times due to the assignment of requests to vehicles and their routes. In order to assign the ridesharing vehicles while considering network traffic dynamics, we propose a strategy that incorporates time-dependent link travel time predictions into the request-vehicle assignment to avoid or mitigate traffic congestion. In particular, we formulate an efficient linear assignment problem that considers multiple path alternatives and accounts for the impact on travel times, which may be potentially caused by vehicles assigned to specific routes. Simulation experiments reveal that using an appropriate congestion avoidance ridesharing strategy can remarkably reduce passenger average travel and waiting times by alleviating endogenous congestion caused by ridesharing fleets.

AB The constant growth of the number of vehicles in today's world demands improvements in the safety and efficiency of roads and road use. This can be in part satisfied by the implementation of autonomous driving systems because of their greater precision than human drivers in controlling a vehicle. As result, the capacity of the roads would be increased by reducing the spacing between vehicles. Moreover, greener driving modes could be applied so that the fuel consumption, and therefore carbon emissions, would be reduced. This paper presents the results obtained by the AUTOPIA program during a public demonstration performed in June 2012. This driverless experiment consisted of a 100-kilometre route around Madrid (Spain), including both urban and motorway environments. A first vehicle - acting as leader and manually driven - transmitted its relevant information - i.e., position and speed - through an 802.11p communication link to a second vehicle, which tracked the leader's trajectory and speed while maintaining a safe distance. The results were encouraging, and showed the viability of the AUTOPIA approach.

TI Uncertainty estimation of LiDAR matching aided by dynamic vehicle
   detection and high definition map
SO ELECTRONICS LETTERS

DT Article
AB LiDAR matching between real-time point clouds and pre-built points map is a popular approach to provide accurate localisation service for autonomous vehicles. However, the performance is severely deteriorated in dense traffic scenes. Unavoidably, dynamic vehicles introduce additional uncertainty to the matching result. The main cause is that the pre-built map can be blocked by the surrounding dynamic vehicles from the view of LiDAR of ego vehicle. A novel uncertainty of LiDAR matching (ULM) estimation method aided by the dynamic vehicle (DV) detection and high definition map is proposed in this Letter. Compared to the conventional Hessian matrix-based ULM estimation approach, the proposed method innovatively estimates the ULM by modelling surrounding DV. Then the authors propose to correlate the ULM with the detected DV and convergence feature of matching algorithm. From the evaluated real-data in an intersection area with dense traffic, the proposed method has exhibited the feasibility of estimating the ULM accurately.

DE internet of vehicles; information sharing; DAG blockchain
AB Information sharing in vehicular networks has great potential for the future Internet of Vehicles (IoV). Vehicles and roadside units (RSUs) can exchange perceptual information and driving experience to enable intelligent transportation applications such as autonomous driving and road condition analysis. However, ensuring secure and efficient information sharing among vehicles is challenging. While traditional blockchain can guarantee the tamper-proof nature of shared information, it cannot be directly applied in large-scale vehicle networks due to its slow consensus process. Therefore, we propose an information sharing approach based on a directed acyclic graph (DAG), in which shared information is encapsulated into sites instead of blocks. We also propose a driving decision-based tip selection algorithm (DDB-TSA) and design a reputation-based rate control strategy (RBRCS) to ensure secure and efficient information sharing. Simulation results show that our approach reduces consensus latency, improves information sharing efficiency, and provides a more secure information sharing environment compared to existing DAG-enabled blockchain systems.

AB Recent developments in vehicle stability control and active safety systems have led to an interest in reliable vehicle state estimation on various road conditions. This paper presents a novel method for tire force and velocity estimation at each corner to monitor tire capacities individually. This is entailed for more demanding advanced vehicle stability systems and especially in full autonomous driving in harsh maneuvers. By integrating the lumped LuGre tire model and the vehicle kinematics, it is shown that the proposed corner-based estimator does not require knowledge of the road friction and is robust to model uncertainties. The stability of the time varying longitudinal and lateral velocity estimators is explored. The proposed method is experimentally validated in several maneuvers on different road surface frictions. The experimental results confirm the accuracy and robustness of the state estimators.

AB This paper presents a methodology based on a variation of the Rapidly-exploring Random Trees (RRTs) that generates feasible trajectories for a team of autonomous aerial vehicles with holonomic constraints in environments with obstacles. Our approach uses Pythagorean Hodograph (PH) curves to connect vertices of the tree, which makes it possible to generate paths for which the main kinematic constraints of the vehicle are not violated. These paths are converted into trajectories based on feasible speed profiles of the robot. The smoothness of the acceleration profile of the vehicle is indirectly guaranteed between two vertices of the RRT tree. The proposed algorithm provides fast convergence to the final trajectory. We still utilize the properties of the RRT to avoid collisions with static, environment bound obstacles and dynamic obstacles, such as other vehicles in the multi-vehicle planning scenario. We show results for a set of small unmanned aerial vehicles in environments with different configurations.

AB NASA has developed a free-flying camera known as AERCam to assist Space Shuttle and Space Station operations. The first AERCam vehicle was controlled from within the Space Shuttle using a hand-held controller. We have developed a system for controlling AERCam remotely from the ground, which involves significant communication delays. We have tested its use with NASA's AERCam dynamics simulation in place of the actual vehicle. Our ground system uses a predictive display(1) that is based on a similar simulation of Shuttle and AERCam dynamics. For both physical and numeric reasons, the behavior of the remote vehicle may drift from what is expected by the predictive display system. We have developed a mechanism to periodically re-establish correspondence of the ground simulation with the remote vehicle using tracking data that reports AERCam's recent behavior. Our system also provides a basis for future development of more advanced autonomous ground control for space vehicles such as AERCam.

AB The automotive industry is undergoing major transformation, with the emergence of vehicular networks, intelligent transportation systems, and autonomous cars over the last decade. These technologies are made possible by recent advances of software, hardware, and communication systems, along with the development of various applications and standards. Today, new technologies are incorporated into cars that detect potential road hazards and improve the driving experience. There are three key components being integrated into cars: sensors, information systems, and communication technologies to create connected vehicle networks. Vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) communication is being used in connected networks to reduce traffic congestion, improve passengers' safety, and enable the efficient management of vehicles on roads. Here, we present recent research developments and current trends in V2V communications. We discuss architectural issues and wireless technologies that support V2V. We also present recently proposed security solutions for V2V. Finally, we discuss outstanding challenges for enabling the deployment and adoption of V2V technology.

AB An integrated GPS and GIS based vehicle dispatching system was presented. The system uses GIS technology for the development of digital mine map database and GPS for vehicle positioning. The system consists of five modules: position module incorporated GPS and dead reckoning (DR); a map database structure for displaying and guidance purposes; a routing module based on the map database is able to give out the best route for the vehicles; map matching and route guidance module put the vehicle position to its exact location on the road despite of errors in positioning and map data; and the client-server module allows client exchange information between driver and control centre. The system can be operated in client-server level in which users can request routing and guidance with devices such as hand phone and PDA by communicating their current positions to the server or runs in autonomous mode when users cannot reach the server.

AB Cooperative driving is widely viewed as a promising method to better utilize limited road resources and alleviate traffic congestion. In recent years, several cooperative driving approaches for idealized traffic scenarios (i.e., uniform vehicle arrivals, lengths, and speeds) have been proposed. However, theoretical analyses and comparisons of these approaches are lacking. In this study, we propose a unified group-by-group zipper-style movement model to describe different approaches synthetically and evaluate their performance. We derive the maximum throughput for cooperative driving plans of idealized unsignalized intersections and discuss how to minimize the delay of vehicles. The obtained conclusions shed light on future cooperative driving studies.

AB A case study of an open-source low-cost reconfigurable autopilot design for small unmanned aerial vehicles (the Remotely operated Aerial Model Autopilot (RAMA) control system) is presented in this paper. A novel distributed hierarchical architecture, implementing graceful degradation and run-time system reconfiguration techniques, is introduced. RAMA is capable of reconfiguration in case of emergency, meaning that the most critical functions, needed for vehicle controllability, can be taken over by another node of the system if the primary node fails, sacrificing some noncritical functionality. RAMA also utilizes a novel control scheme and controller implementation. Some of the results, obtained during several hundred test flights performed so far, are presented at the end.

AB In this paper we introduce a roadmap algorithm for generating collision-free paths in terms of cubic B-spline curves for unmanned vehicles used in mining operations. The algorithm automatically generates collision-free paths that are curvature continuous with an upper bounded curvature and a small slope discontinuity of curvature at knots, when we are given the locations of the obstacles, the boundary geometry of the working area, positions and directions of the vehicle at the start, loading, and the goal points. Our algorithm also allows us to find a switch back point where the vehicle reverses its direction to enter the loading area. Examples are provided to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithms. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB New generations of small advanced aircraft may soon transform how people and freight are transported. Thus, ensuring safe and reliable operation of these systems, in all plausible scenarios, is of utmost priority. In this paper, we address this problem by proposing a method to verify the safety of an autonomous aircraft controller following a navigational policy. The policy is encoded using discrete vector fields that are meant to drive the vehicle to a goal state and away from obstacles or restricted airspace. The solution presented in this paper provides the ability to verify the policy, catching unsafe scenarios which may be missed by random Monte Carlo methods or general reachability analysis. After illustrating the main theoretical principles, a possible practical implementation is described and compared with analysis based on Monte Carlo simulations. The comparison shows an insightful example where Monte Carlo simulations fail to detect several corner cases that are uncovered by the proposed method. In the conclusion of the paper, we provide insights about possible future research to implement the proposed solution obtaining higher accuracy and efficiency.

AB Current carbon measurement strategies leave spatiotemporal gaps that hinder the scientific understanding of the oceanic carbon biogeochemical cycle. Data products and models are subject to bias because they rely on data that inadequately capture mesoscale spatiotemporal (kilometers and days to weeks) changes. High-resolution measurement strategies need to be implemented to adequately evaluate the global ocean carbon cycle. To augment the spatial and temporal coverage of ocean-atmosphere carbon measurements, an Autonomous Surface Vehicle CO2 (ASVCO(2)) system was developed. From 2011 to 2018, ASVCO(2) systems were deployed on seven Wave Glider and Saildrone missions along the U.S. Pacific and Australia's Tasmanian coastlines and in the tropical Pacific Ocean to evaluate the viability of the sensors and their applicability to carbon cycle research. Here we illustrate that the ASVCO(2) systems are capable of long-term oceanic deployment and robust collection of air and seawater pCO(2) within +/- 2 mu atm based on comparisons with established shipboard underway systems, with previously described Moored Autonomous pCO(2) (MAPCO(2)) systems, and with companion ASVCO(2) systems deployed side by side.

AB Divers operate in harsh and poorly monitored environments, in which the slightest unexpected disturbance, technical malfunction, or lack of attention can have catastrophic consequences. Motivated by these considerations, the CADDYCognitive Autonomous Diving Buddy FP7 project sets forth the main goal of developing a cooperative autonomous underwater robotic system to monitor and assist human divers, thus affording them increased levels of safety during the execution of challenging scientific and commercial missions. This article presents the main results obtained in the first 2 years of the project along the following main research topics: Seeing the Diver, where the focus is placed on the 3D reconstruction of a diver's model (pose estimation and recognition of hand gestures) through remote and local sensing technologies, thus enabling behavior interpretation; Understanding the Diver, with the objective of interpreting the model and physiological measurements of the diver in order to determine the state of the diver; and Diver-Robot Cooperation and Control, aimed at investigating the interaction of the diver with underwater vehicles endowed with rich sensory motor skills, focusing on cooperative control and optimal formation with the diver as an integral part of the overall vehicle-diver formation.

AB This article proposes an inertial navigation algorithm intended to lower the negative consequences of the absence of GNSS (Global Navigation Satellite System) signals on the navigation of autonomous fixed wing low SWaP (Size, Weight, and Power) UAVs (Unmanned Air Vehicles). In addition to accelerometers and gyroscopes, the filter takes advantage of sensors usually present onboard these platforms, such as magnetometers, Pitot tube, and air vanes, and aims to reduce the attitude error and position drift (both horizontal and vertical) with the dual objective of improving the aircraft GNSS-Denied inertial navigation capabilities as well as facilitating the fusion of the inertial filter with visual odometry algorithms. Stochastic high fidelity Monte Carlo simulations of two representative scenarios involving the loss of GNSS signals are employed to evaluate the results, compare the proposed filter with more traditional implementations, and analyze the sensitivity of the results to the quality of the onboard sensors. The author releases the C++ implementation of both the navigation filter and the high fidelity simulation as open-source software [1]. (C) 2021 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Masson SAS.

AB Autonomous navigation in unknown environment is still a hard problem for small Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs). Recently, some neural network-based methods are proposed to tackle this problem, however, the trained network is opaque, non-intuitive and difficult for people to understand, which limits the real-world application. In this paper, a novel explainable deep neural network-based path planner is proposed for quadrotor to fly autonomously in unknown environment. The navigation problem is modelled as a Markov Decision Process (MDP) and the path planner is trained using Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) method in simulation environment. To get better understanding of the trained model, a novel model explanation method is proposed based on the feature attribution. Some easy-to-interpret textual and visual explanations are generated to allow end-users to understand what triggered a particular behaviour. Moreover, some global analyses are provided for experts to evaluate and improve the trained network. Finally, real-world flight tests are conducted to illustrate that our path planner trained in the simulation is robust enough to be applied in the real environment directly.

AB Recent work have successfully employed a low-cost Multisensor Data Fusion application based on Hybrid Adaptive Computational Intelligence (HACI) - the cascaded use of Fuzzy-based Computational Intelligence algorithms. The methodology has been shown able to improve considerably the accuracy of current positioning estimation systems for real-time Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) autonomous navigation - which are not robust - reducing the error in more than 45.19%. However, HACI methodology was found to have a sensitivity to noise in some parts of the estimated trajectories and, therefore, loss of performance. The problem is that none of these recent work assesses the impact of noise present on input signals and the potential benefits of their treatment prior to fusion itself. This is the main contribution of this work. Noise treatment is performed in two approaches: noise removal and noise filtering. It has been shown that for the studied dataset, the noise has a negative impact and that the chosen techniques are capable of adequately handling the noise so as to improve the original GPS precision by almost 57%.

AB Platinum nanourchins supported on microfibrilated cellulose films (MFC) were fabricated and evaluated as hydrogen peroxide catalysts for small-scale, autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) propulsion systems. The catalytic substrate was synthesized through the reduction of chloroplatinic acid to create a thick film of Pt coral-like microstructures coated with Pt urchin-like nanowires that are arrayed in three dimensions on a two-dimensional MFC film. This organic/inorganic nanohybrid displays high catalytic ability (reduced activation energy of 50-63% over conventional materials and 13-19% for similar Pt nanoparticle-based structures) during hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) decomposition as well as sufficient propulsive thrust (>0.5 N) from reagent grade H2O2 (30% w/w) fuel within a small underwater reaction vessel. The results demonstrate that these layered nanohybrid sheets are robust and catalytically effective for green, H2O2-based micro-AUV propulsion where the storage and handling of highly explosive, toxic fuels are prohibitive due to size-requirements, cost limitations, and close person-to-machine contact.

AB A conceptual design of autonomous underwater glider (AUG) is introduced, with a pair of bio-inspired hydro wings undergoing travelling wave motion. Hydrodynamic performance of current AUG is investigated by numerically solving the incompressible viscous Navier Stokes equations of its surrounding flow coupling with the immersed boundary method to capture the moving boundaries. The force balance along the stream direction is guaranteed by adjusting the kinematic parameters of the travelling wave motion, thus the cruise state of the AUG with a constant velocity can be achieved. The propulsive efficiency under cruise state is therefore directly and well defined. The effects of kinematic parameters on propulsive performance are investigated, and the non-dimensional Strouhal number, as a combination of these kinematic parameters, turns to be a dominant parameter of the propulsive efficiency. There is an optimum range of Strouhal number, in which the AUG achieves its maximum efficiency. The results obtained in current study can provide certain technical supports for the design and development of small submersible vehicle.

AB Autonomous vehicles (AVs) are quickly advancing and show promise to be a transformative mode of transportation. However, the prevailing consensus suggests that AVs will not be capable of addressing every traffic situation, necessitating remote human intervention in certain edge case scenarios. To facilitate the development of future teleoperation solutions, it is imperative to establish a clear and comprehensive set of intervention scenarios. To achieve this, we undertook a thorough investigation employing in-depth semi-structured interviews with 14 experts specializing in AV teleoperation. Employing thematic analysis to organize and classify the collected data, our study offers a comprehensive compilation of use cases that may require remote human assistance. By doing so, our findings provide a solid groundwork for the design and implementation of future teleoperation user interfaces. These interfaces may play a crucial role in enabling effective and efficient collaboration between humans and AVs in situations where remote intervention becomes necessary. Ultimately, our research contributes to the advancement of AV technology by identifying critical areas where human involvement can augment the capabilities of autonomous systems, thereby ensuring safer and more reliable transportation solutions.

AB Three-dimensional mapping is an essential component of autonomous Micro Aerial Vehicle (MAV) navigation. The paper focuses on the 3D spatial representation method of MAV to overcome the collision problem caused by soft constraints, control error, and planning with the center of mass by inflating the occupancy grid map. A fast incremental inflated map construction method is proposed, which reduces the time-consumption caused by the increase of map range and inflated size. The method focuses on areas of the map that occupied state changes and introduces two arrays that record newly appearing and disappearing obstacles. Then, a series of breadth-first search algorithms are used to traverse the parts of the inflated map that need local modification to update the inflated map. Moreover, a sliding map model is designed based on the MAV position, which is suitable for large-range autonomous flight. The effectiveness of the proposed approach is verified with simulated and actual flight data. The proposed method takes about 3 ms to construct the inflated map with a local update range of 16 m x 16 m x 6 m.

AB The autonomous mobility-on-demand (AMoD) system provides an alternative solution for sustainable and economical transportation system. Meanwhile, battery swapping could become a promising approach to sustain the efficient operation of EV fleet. This article proposes a combined operation scheme for battery swapping station (BSS) and AMoD system. To maximizing the profit of AMoD system, an expanded network flow model is employed to determine swapping scheduling and vehicle rebalancing for EV fleet in AMoD system. The interaction between the shared mobility-on-demand system and BSS is modeled by the swapping demand and swapping price. Specifically, swapping demand is determined in the AMoD system and introduced as known parameters in the BSS problem. Fleet management operation in AMoD system will be influenced by swapping price provided by BSS. The BSS management problem is formulated as a mixed-integer linear programming model, which optimizes refueling decisions for depleted batteries. Simulation experiments based on real-world data from New York City are provided. The results demonstrate the effectiveness of this proposed integrated operation model.

AB An interesting current research field related to autonomous robots is mobile manipulation performed by cooperating robots (in terrestrial, aerial and underwater environments). Focusing on the underwater scenario, cooperative manipulation of Intervention-Autonomous Underwater Vehicles (I-AUVs) is a complex and difficult application compared with the terrestrial or aerial ones because of many technical issues, such as underwater localization and limited communication. A decentralized approach for cooperative mobile manipulation of I-AUVs based on Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) is proposed in this article. This strategy exploits the potential field method; a multi-layer control structure is developed to manage the coordination of the swarm, the guidance and navigation of I-AUVs and the manipulation task. In the article, this new strategy has been implemented in the simulation environment, simulating the transportation of an object. This object is moved along a desired trajectory in an unknown environment and it is transported by four underwater mobile robots, each one provided with a seven-degrees-of-freedom robotic arm. The simulation results are optimized thanks to the ANNs used for the potentials tuning.

AB Updating the most recent set of point cloud data is critical in autonomous driving environments. However, existing systems for point cloud data management often fail to ensure real-time updates or encounter situations in which data cannot be effectively refreshed. To address these challenges, this study proposes a distributed hybrid transactional/analytical processing architecture designed for the efficient management and real-time processing of point cloud data. The proposed architecture leverages both columnar and row-based tables, enabling it to handle the substantial workloads associated with its hybrid architecture. The construction of this architecture as a distributed database cluster ensures real-time online analytical process query performance through query parallelization. A dissimilarity analysis algorithm for point cloud data, built by utilizing the capabilities of the spatial database, updates the point cloud data for the relevant area whenever the online analytical process query results indicate high dissimilarity. This research contributes to ensuring real-time hybrid transactional/analytical processing workload processing in dynamic road environments, helping autonomous vehicles generate safe, optimized routes.

AB Autonomous technologies have developed incrementally, especially in the car industry. Countries worldwide are giving impetus to developing automated driving (AD) and autonomous vehicles (AVs). China is used as an example of an innovative development model for autonomous driving that has significant practical implications for AD's development in the global context. Germany also keeps its role as a global hub for the AVs industry, and it has released the most advanced AD laws. This research conducted a thorough comparison of related policies, regulations, and industries in China and Germany in an effort to support the development of AD in China. Further, AD's advantages, disadvantages, opportunities, and threats in China and Germany are discussed. It sought to identify any shortages of AD in China and find an efficient way to enhance AD cooperation between China and Germany. Based on the dissimilarity of the current status and the disparity in policies, a series of countermeasures and suggestions for the development of the Chinese AD are presented in this study.

AB Future ocean observing systems will rely heavily on autonomous vehicles to achieve the persistent and heterogeneous measurements needed to understand the ocean's impact on the climate system. The day-to-day maintenance of these arrays will become increasingly challenging if significant human resources, such as manual piloting, are required. For this reason, techniques need to be developed that permit autonomous determination of sampling directives based on science goals and responses to in situ, remote-sensing, and model-derived information. Techniques that can accommodate large arrays of assets and permit sustained observations of rapidly evolving ocean properties are especially needed for capturing interactions between physical circulation and biogeochemical cycling. Here we document the first field program of the Satellites to Seafloor project, designed to enable a closed loop of numerical model prediction, vehicle path-planning, in situ path implementation, data collection, and data assimilation for future model predictions. We present results from the first of two field programs carried out in Monterey Bay, California, over a period of three months in 2016. While relatively modest in scope, this approach provides a step toward an observing array that makes use of multiple information streams to update and improve sampling strategies without human intervention.

AB A current challenge for autonomous vehicles is the detection of irregularities on road surfaces in order to prevent accidents; in particular, speed bump detection is an important task for safe and comfortable autonomous navigation. There are some techniques that have achieved acceptable speed bump detection under optimal road surface conditions, especially when signs are well-marked. However, in developing countries it is very common to find unmarked speed bumps and existing techniques fail. In this paper a methodology to detect both marked and unmarked speed bumps is proposed, for clearly painted speed bumps we apply local binary patterns technique to extract features from an image dataset. For unmarked speed bump detection, we apply stereo vision where point clouds obtained by the 3D reconstruction are converted to triangular meshes by applying Delaunay triangulation. A selection and extraction of the most relevant features is made to speed bump elevation on surfaces meshes. Results obtained have an important contribution and improve some of the existing techniques since the reconstruction of three-dimensional meshes provides relevant information for the detection of speed bumps by elevations on surfaces even though they are not marked.

ID DESIGN
AB In this article, simultaneous longitudinal and lateral flight control systems design for both passive and active morphing unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) is first time applied for autonomous flight performance maximization. For this purpose, an UAV whose wing and tail unit can be assembled to fuselage from different points in a prescribed interval and whose wing and tail can move forward and backward independently in tail to nose direction is manufactured. Following this, an autopilot is purchased and it lets change of P, I, D coefficients in certain intervals. First, dynamic model and longitudinal and lateral state space models of UAV are obtained and then simulation model is reached. At the same time, block diagram of autopilot system and modeling of it in MATLAB/Simulink environment are found. After these, using these two models and adaptive stochastic optimization method, namely, SPSA, simultaneous design of UAV and autopilot is applied in order to minimize a cost function consisting of rise time, settling time and maximum overshoot. Therefore, primarily autonomous performance is maximized in computer environment. Moreover, high performance is observed at simulation responses.

AB We report our development of a vision-based motion planning system for an autonomous motorcycle designed for desert terrain, where uniform road surface and lane markings are not present. The motion planning is based on a vision vector space (V-2-Space), which is a unitary vector set that represents local collision-free directions in the image coordinate system. The V-2-Space is constructed by extracting the vectors based on the similarity of adjacent pixels, which captures both the color information and the directional information from prior vehicle tire tracks and pedestrian footsteps. We report how the V-2-Space is constructed to reduce the impact of varying lighting conditions in outdoor environments. We also show how the V-2-Space can be used to incorporate vehicle kinematic, dynamic, and time-delay constraints in motion planning to fit the highly dynamic requirements of the motorcycle. The combined algorithm of the V-2-Space construction and the motion planning runs in O(n) time, where n is the number of pixels in the captured image. Experiments show that our algorithm outputs correct robot motion commands more than 90% of the time.

AB Autonomous vehicle (AV) systems must be comprehensively tested and evaluated before they can be deployed. Highfidelity simulators such as CARLA or LGSVL allow this to be done safely in very realistic and highly customizable environments. Existing testing approaches, however, fail to test simulated AVs systematically, as they focus on specific scenarios and oracles (e.g., lane following scenario with the "no collision" requirement) and lack any coverage criteria measures. In this paper, we propose AVUnit, a framework for systematically testing AV systems against customizable correctness specifications. Designed modularly to support different simulators, AVUnit consists of two new languages for specifying dynamic properties of scenes (e.g., changing pedestrian behaviour after waypoints) and fine-grained assertions about the AV's journey. AVUnit further supports multiple fuzzing algorithms that automatically search for test cases that violate these assertions, using robustness and coverage measures as fitness metrics. We evaluated the implementation of AVUnit for the LGSVL+Apollo simulation environment, finding 19 kinds of issues in Apollo, which indicate that the open-source Apollo does not perform well in complex intersections and lane-changing related scenarios.

AB The adoption of autonomous delivery robots (ADRs) across various delivery applications has rapidly accelerated in recent years. This growth can be attributed to advancements in technology and legislation, exacerbated conventional delivery challenges, and pandemic-mediated need for contactless deliveries. A growing number of studies have investigated the various aspects pertaining to ADR-based delivery operations. Nevertheless, there is a lack of extensive literature review that holistically reports on various problems in ADR-based delivery operations, adopted methodologies, novel findings, and future needs. This paper aims to systematically survey the existing research on ADR-based delivery systems and associated operations. Foremost, we discuss various technology, design, and legal factors that impact ADR operations. Subsequently, we are the first to review the state-of-the-art research in ADR-based deliveries concerning the following areas-routing, infrastructure and fleet planning, factors affecting efficiency, technology acceptance, and social intelligence. Finally, we anticipate potential challenges from an operations management perspective, identify research gaps, and delineate future research opportunities for ADR-based deliveries.

ID PATH PLANNING ALGORITHM
AB Autonomous exploration is an important application of multi-vehicle systems, where a team of networked robots are coordinated to explore an unknown environment collaboratively. This technique has earned significant research interest due to its usefulness in search and rescue, fault detection and monitoring, localization and mapping, etc. In this paper, a novel cooperative exploration strategy is proposed for multiple mobile robots, which reduces the overall task completion time and energy costs compared to conventional methods. To efficiently navigate the networked robots during the collaborative tasks, a hierarchical control architecture is designed which contains a high-level decision making layer and a low-level target tracking layer. The proposed cooperative exploration approach is developed using dynamic Voronoi partitions, which minimizes duplicated exploration areas by assigning different target locations to individual robots. To deal with sudden obstacles in the unknown environment, an integrated deep reinforcement learning based collision avoidance algorithm is then proposed, which enables the control policy to learn from human demonstration data and thus improve the learning speed and performance. Finally, simulation and experimental results are provided to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed scheme.

AB The obstacle-avoidance problem of automated vehicles is a hot topic in the community of autonomous driving. The majority of the existing studies focused on the obstacle-avoidance of a single automated vehicle. The connected vehicles technology provides the possibility of controlling a vehicle swarm to avoid the obstacle cooperatively. Through cooperation, the vehicle swarm not only can avoid an obstacle safely but also can minimize traffic delays. Therefore, this paper proposes a cooperative obstacle-avoidance model for the automated vehicle swarm driving on the freeway based on the A2C reinforcement learning. The proposed model considers the efficiencies of both the individual and swarm in the learning, and a cooperative lane-changing execution model is proposed to ensure that the optimal decision made by the A2C algorithm can be performed by the vehicles. Furthermore, simulations are conducted to verify the proposed model. The results indicate that the proposed model can significantly improve the overall traffic efficiency compared with the existing models. In a congested state, when the proposed model is applied to control vehicles, an optimal control range can be found (i.e. 700 m here), and within this optimal range, the traffic efficiency increases with the increment of the number of the vehicles controlled by the proposed model.

AB Self-driving vehicles are a maturing technology with the potential to reshape mobility by enhancing the safety, accessibility, efficiency, and convenience of automotive transportation. Safety-critical tasks that must be executed by a self-driving vehicle include planning of motions through a dynamic environment shared with other vehicles and pedestrians, and their robust executions via feedback control. The objective of this paper is to survey the current state of the art on planning and control algorithms with particular regard to the urban setting. A selection of proposed techniques is reviewed along with a discussion of their effectiveness. The surveyed approaches differ in the vehicle mobility model used, in assumptions on the structure of the environment, and in computational requirements. The side by side comparison presented in this survey helps to gain insight into the strengths and limitations of the reviewed approaches and assists with system level design choices.

AB Turning behavior classification of oncoming vehicles is a critical step toward high-level scene understanding and motion planning tasks for autonomous vehicles. In this paper, we propose a new method for classifying an oncoming vehicle's turning behavior at intersection using 3D LIDAR, i.e., a Velodyne HDL-64E LIDAR, which collects rich point clouds from the surrounding environment. First, the vehicle pose is measured via a novel rectangle-based multi-frame fitting method applied to the vehicle point cloud extracted by a data pre-process procedure. Then, a Kalman filter integrates these measured vehicle poses to estimate and update vehicle kinematic parameters. Next, a hidden Markov model and Bayesian filtering are combined to recognize the vehicle's turning behavior using the heading angle and the acceleration components of the kinematic model. Real point clouds from intersection environments are used to train and validate the proposed turning behavior classification algorithm in the experiments. The results of the performance analysis and classification time measurements confirm that the proposed method can recognize the behavior of the oncoming vehicle at intersections correctly at an early stage of entering an intersection.

AB Accurate ambient perception via multi-object detection and tracking is instrumental for autonomous vehicles. This article addresses two main challenges when operating solely on 3-D light laser detection and ranging (LiDAR) point clouds: the classification of objects with similar geometric structures and tracking under the commonplace setting of low-frequency sensing. First, we design a semantically enhanced feature aggregation module that fuses features learned from two branches with different resolutions and depths. Subsequently, the extracted semantic information combined with our proposed Margin Loss allows the re-identification module to extract time-invariant geometric features. These features are fused with the positional information provided by the detector by a cluster-based Earth's mover distance algorithm along with conflation to improve the tracking stability. Extensive experiments on nuScenes demonstrate that our proposed model outperforms the state-of-the-art methods for both LiDAR-based 3-D object detection and tracking. In particular, we report an increase of 1.1% in average multi-object tracking accuracy, as well higher mean average precision for detection by 6.2% and 7.5% on motorcycle and bicycle, respectively.

   decision-making; uncertainty; uncontrolled intersection
AB Reinforcement learning (RL) has been widely used in the decision-making of autonomous vehicles (AVs) in recent studies. However, existing RL methods generally find the optimal policy by maximizing the expectation of future returns, which lacks distributional treatments of risky situations. Additionally, various uncertainties arising from the environment could also cause unreliable decisions, particularly in some complex urban environments. In this paper, the fully parameterized quantile network (FPQN) is utilized to estimate the full return distribution. Then, the conditional value-at-risk (CVaR) is utilized with the return distribution information to generate uncertainty-aware driving behavior. Additionally, an uncontrolled four-way intersection is developed by the Simulation of Urban Mobility (SUMO) simulation platform, which considers both the surrounding vehicles (SVs) and pedestrians. More specifically, to simulate the real-world traffic environment, the uncertainty arising from the occlusion, and the behavior uncertainty of surrounding traffic participants are also considered. The experiment results suggest that the proposed method outperforms the baseline methods in terms of safety. Furthermore, the results also indicate that the proposed method can make reasonable decisions in some challenging driving cases in the presence of uncertainty.

AB This paper develops a novel control method for solving the challenging problem of simultaneous collision avoidance and target tracking for an unmanned ground vehicle with velocity and heading rate constraints. The problem is formulated as an optimization problem where the trajectory tracking is treated as a soft constraint via control Lyapunov functions and obstacles avoidance is treated as hard constraint via control barrier functions. Two constraints are naturally unified in the context of quadratic programs which ensure that the hard constraint, soft constraint, velocity and heading rate constraints are satisfied simultaneously. Under the proposed strategy, an unmanned ground vehicle can avoid the stationary and moving obstacles while tracking the desired trajectory precisely and smoothly. Finally, three representative simulations are provided to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.

ID OPTIMIZATION
AB In this paper, a multidisciplinary performance analysis model of a small intelligent ocean exploration underwater vehicle is established, which involves six disciplines such as the hull form, structure, propulsion, energy, maneuverability and general arrangement. Based on the radial basis function based high dimensional model, a design optimization is performed by using the concurrent subspace design method, which yields a set of design variables to address design requirements (weight, diving depth, and range). The construction of the corresponding approximate computational model is analyzed in detail. Performances of the vehicle before and after optimization are also compared. The results shows that the optimization lead to an decrease of vehicle weight as much as 27%., and the sea test results show that the designed underwater vehicle satisfies the design requirements of weight, diving depth and range, moreover, the navigation performance is improved significantly, which proves the effectiveness of the design method.

AB The autonomous positioning of a vehicle predominantly relies on the global positioning system (GPS). However, in indoor environments, such as tunnels and indoor parking lots, the accuracy of GPS-based positioning can be significantly reduced due to weak GPS signals. To this end, we develop an accurate indoor vehicle positioning system using multiple fish-eye surveillance cameras. Our system first extracts vehicle segments from the top-view image of each fish-eye camera. These segments are then integrated into a common undistorted coordinate system. The center of the vehicle is finally determined using our simple but effective box fitting method. Moreover, a 1/18 scale indoor parking lot is designed to evaluate the performance of the proposed system. Throughout our experiments, we obtained average positioning errors of 30 or 24 cm in the regions covered by a single camera or multiple cameras, respectively.

AB Grid-connected vehicles (GCVs)-e.g., electric trains, metros, trains, and trolley buses-are propelled by electric motors directly connected to remote power sources. Their low at-vehicle energy consumption and ability to use a wide range of renewable energy sources make them strong contenders for urban and interurban transport systems in an era of energy constraints that favours use of renewable fuels, which may lie ahead. Needs for autonomous motorised mobility could be acceptably met in large measure by deployment of personal GCVs, also known as personal rapid transit (PRT). Alternatives, including fuel-cell vehicles and dual-drive vehicles fuelled with ethanol, will be less feasible. The 'car of the future' may not be an automobile so much as a PRT element of a comprehensive GCV-based system that offers at least as Much utility and convenience as today's transport systems.

AB Cooperative attack with unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) plays a critical role in modern military warfare. To achieve multi-swarm cooperative attack with obstacle avoidance of formation, this paper proposes a cooperative control strategy that integrates flight control and autonomous marshaling. Firstly, an improved dynamics model with virtual leader-following mode is constructed to achieve obstacle avoidance of the formation. And an improved interference fluid dynamic system (IIFDS) is applied to improve path selectivity during multi-swarm attack. Secondly, a two-layer attack framework based on distributed swarm coordinated trajectory tracking with heading angle constraints is designed to achieve autonomous clustering of the UAVs and target striking. Finally, the proposed improved dynamics model is compared with the particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm and artificial potential field (APF) method in terms of obstacle avoidance of formation to demonstrate its superiority, which can obtain better benefits. Furthermore, two simulations of multi-swarm cooperative attack are conducted to validate the effectiveness of the control strategy. The proposed method expands the application of UAVs attack with obstacle avoidance of formation and provides a valuable reference for modern military operations.

ID TRACKING; TECHNOLOGY
AB Lidar is a key sensor of autonomous driving systems, but the spatial distribution of its point cloud is uneven because of its scanning mechanism, which greatly degrades the clustering performance of the traditional density-based spatial clustering of application with noise (DSC). Considering the outline feature of detected objects for intelligent vehicles, a DSC-based adaptive clustering method (DAC) is proposed with the adoption of an elliptic neighborhood, which is designed according to the distribution properties of the point cloud. The parameters of the ellipse are adaptively adjusted with the location of the sample point to deal with the uniformity of points in different ranges. Furthermore, the dependence among different parameters of DAC is analyzed, and the parameters are numerically optimized with the KITTI dataset by considering comprehensive performance. To verify the effectiveness, a comparative experiment was conducted with a vehicle equipped with three IBEO LUX8 lidars on campus, and the results show that compared with DSC using a circular neighborhood, DAC has a better clustering performance and can notably reduce the rate of over-segmentation and under-segmentation.

AB Autonomous emergency braking (AEB) systems play an important role in reducing front to rear-end collisions. To evaluate the performance of AEB systems, different countries have recently published their own new car assessment programs (NCAPs). This study firstly develops a set of test equipment to evaluate the performance of AEB systems in field tests according to the China New Car Assessment Program (C-NCAP-2018). Then, the test accuracy of the AEB test equipment is debugged and verified by comparing the test results with those from IIHS. Finally, field tests are performed to evaluate the AEB systems performance on collision avoidance speeds in CCRs test scenarios and actuation time of warning function and braking of five vehicles using the developed test equipment. Additionally, some underlying causes are discussed for the trade-off between driving comfort and braking effectiveness. The field tests confirm that the developed equipment can effectively evaluate the performance of AEB systems and thus improve the active safety technology for vehicles.

AB Micro Aerial Vehicles (MAVs) have great potentials to be applied for indoor search and rescue missions. In this paper, we propose a modular lightweight design of an autonomous MAV with integrated hardware and software. The MAV is equipped with the 2D laser scanner, camera, mission computer and flight controller, running all the computation onboard in real time. The onboard perception system includes a laser-based SLAM module and a custom-designed visual detection module. A dual Kalman filter design provides robust state estimation by multiple sensor fusion. Specifically, the fusion module provides robust altitude measurement in the circumstance of surface changing. In addition, indoor-outdoor transition is explicitly handled by the fusion module. In order to efficiently navigate through obstacles and adapt to multiple tasks, a task tree-based mission planning method is seamlessly integrated with path planning and control modules. The MAV is capable of searching and rescuing victims from unknown indoor environments effectively. It was validated by our award-winning performance at the 2017 International Micro Air Vehicle Competition (IMAV 2017), held in Toulouse, France. The performance video is available on .

ID DESIGN
AB In this work, a method for the dynamic reconfiguration of autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) propulsion system is developed and tested in simulation. Global optimization is used to find suitable propulsive configurations and control parameters in order to achieve successive robotic tasks. This is done using a genetic algorithm used here as a task-based design method, Evaluation of the AUV configuration is made using a dynamic simulation of the robot performing its mission involving a non linear control (computed torque method). The objective function minimizes the trajectory tracking error and the energy consumption. The results of this optimization could be used as a preliminary design step for a specialized AUV, finding the fittest propulsive configuration. Here, we propose the dynamic reconfiguration of a multitasking AUV that adapts its propulsion configuration to the changing task specifications during its mission. The method implementation is based on the dynamic model of an existing AUV (IRDL-RSM 4-fixed thrusters under-actuated robot), but searching for new thrusters directions and controller parameters to perform successive tasks.

ID GLOBAL LOCALIZATION; REGISTRATION
AB Detecting buildings in the surroundings of an urban vehicle and matching them to building models available on map services is an emerging trend in robotics localization for urban vehicles. In this paper, we present a novel technique, which improves a previous work by detecting building facade, their positions, and finding the correspondences with their 3D models, available in OpenStreetMap. The proposed technique uses segmented point clouds produced using stereo images, processed by a convolutional neural network. The point clouds of the facades are then matched against a reference point cloud, produced extruding the buildings' outlines, which are available on OpenStreetMap (OSM). In order to produce a lane-level localization of the vehicle, the resulting information is then fed into our probabilistic framework, called Road Layout Estimation (RLE). We prove the effectiveness of this proposal, testing it on sequences from the well-known KITTI dataset and comparing the results concerning a basic RLE version without the proposed pipeline.

AB Synthesis of control design is an essential part for vehicle suspension systems. This paper addresses the issue of robust reliable H-infinity control for active vehicle suspension system with input delays and linear fractional uncertainties. By constructing an appropriate Lyapunov-Krasovskii functional, a set of sufficient conditions in terms of linear matrix inequalities (LMIs) are derived for ensuring the robust asymptotic stability of the active vehicle suspension system with a H-infinity disturbance attenuation level gamma. In particular, the uncertainty appears in the sprung mass, unsprung mass, damping and stiffness parameters are assumed in linear fractional transformation (LFT) formulations. More precisely, the designed controller is presented in terms of the solution of LMIs which can be easily checked by MATLAB-LMI toolbox. Finally, a quarter-car suspension model is considered as an example to illustrate the effectiveness and applicability of the proposed control strategy.

   Blur Effect
AB The future mobility of urban areas is changing constantly; ideally, vehicles should be able to drive autonomously through traffic. Unfortunately, autonomous vehicles are not yet fully capable of matching human performance. Therefore, the teleoperation of vehicles presents a solution for this task. During teleoperation, a human driver is responsible for driving the vehicle using information transmitted from the vehicle to a working station. Unfortunately, because of the artificial environment in which the operator is located, it is very difficult to achieve high telepresence and accurate speed estimation. It is known that in order to safely drive a vehicle, it is very important to be able to correctly estimate the vehicle's speed. This paper presents a study conducted to quantify the speed perception tendency of a human operator at the working station. Additionally, it is shown that a training process can at least temporarily improve speed perception. Furthermore, the implementation of zoom blur to increase optical flow is shown to positively influence speed perception. Four hypotheses are defined and analysed to study speed perception at an operator's working station. The results are presented and discussed.

AB In the investigation of moral judgments of autonomous vehicles (AVs), the paradigm of the sacrificial dilemma is a widespread and flexible experimental tool. In this context, the sacrifice of the AV's passenger typically occurs upon enactment of the utilitarian option, which differs from traditional sacrificial dilemmas, in which the moral agent's life is often jeopardized in the non-utilitarian counterpart. The present within-subject study (n = 183) is aimed at deepening the role of self-sacrifice framing, comparing autonomous- and human-driving text-based moral dilemmas in terms of moral judgment and intensity of four moral emotions (shame, guilt, anger, and disgust). A higher endorsement of utilitarian behavior was observed in human-driving dilemmas and for self-protective utilitarian behaviors. Interestingly, the utilitarian option was considered less moral, shameful, and blameworthy in the case of concurrent self-sacrifice. The present study collects novel information on how different levels of driving automation shape moral judgment and emotions, also providing new evidence on the role of self-sacrifice framing in moral dilemmas.

AB This paper is concerned with the autonomous effective collision avoidance strategy for multiple unmanned aerial vehicles (multi-UAV) in limited airspace under the framework of proximal policy optimization (PPO) algorithm. An end-to-end deep reinforcement learning (DRL) control strategy and a potential-based reward function are designed. Next, the CNN-LSTM (CL) fusion network is constructed by fusing the convolutional neural network (CNN) and the long short-term memory network (LSTM), which realizes the feature interaction among the information of multi-UAV. Then, a generalized integral compensator (GIC) is introduced into the actor-critic structure, and the CLPPO-GIC algorithm is proposed by combining CL and GIC. Finally, we validate the learned policy in various simulation environments by performance evaluation. The simulation results show that the introduction of the LSTM network and GIC can further improve the efficiency of collision avoidance, and the robustness and accuracy of the algorithm are verified in different environments.(c) 2023 Elsevier Ltd.

AB Facial emotion recognition (FER) systems play a significant role in identifying driver emotions. Accurate facial emotion recognition of drivers in autonomous vehicles reduces road rage. However, training even the advanced FER model without proper datasets causes poor performance in real-time testing. FER system performance is heavily affected by the quality of datasets than the quality of the algorithms. To improve FER system performance for autonomous vehicles, we propose a facial image threshing (FIT) machine that uses advanced features of pre-trained facial recognition and training from the Xception algorithm. The FIT machine involved removing irrelevant facial images, collecting facial images, correcting misplacing face data, and merging original datasets on a massive scale, in addition to the data-augmentation technique. The final FER results of the proposed method improved the validation accuracy by 16.95% over the conventional approach with the FER 2013 dataset. The confusion matrix evaluation based on the unseen private dataset shows a 5% improvement over the original approach with the FER 2013 dataset to confirm the real-time testing.

AB To embrace safety while bringing autonomous vehicles (AVs) to public roads, AV manufacturers need to validate and verify the functionality and reliability of the control software. Real-road testing is time-consuming, tedious, costly, and unsafe for validation. Hence, simulation testing has been playing an important role in the market as a viable solution. This paper presents an approach that exploits both methods to find edge case scenarios and evaluates the software reliability of an existing AV shuttle, iseAuto, currently operating at the Tallinn University of Technology campus. To show the method's effectiveness, a range of scenarios are generated and simulated for avoidance maneuvers by means of a low-fidelity simulator. Then, the scenarios that are found to be jeopardizing the AV are filtered and simulated by a high-fidelity simulator with the AV control software in the loop. Finally, to investigate the methodology and simulation reliability, a real study case is proposed using the AV shuttle. Results of the study suggest that the proposed toolchain is capable of tuning simulation models for automated driving development as well as validating safe AV operations.

AB In recent years there has been an increasing trend for autonomous vehicles (AV) to feature an external human-machine interface (eHMI). This study investigates the usability issues of an eHMI composed of light bands and displays that need to communicate with multiple types of road users and how designers intend to map all this and cover all these needs in one user interface design. In the first experiment, a physical prototype was built in a conventional car and shown to 18 participants. In the second experiment, the same eHMI concept, with improvements made from the first usability test, was shown to 500 participants in a digital prototype. In both tests, the usability of eHMIs, as well as the overall acceptance level of AVs before and after reviewing the eHMI concept, were evaluated. The results indicate that our eHMI designs positively influenced overall acceptance because they have clearer driving information and sense the visibility of the AV system. In close traffic negotiations when AVs communicate on the basis of what they sense and perceive, people felt uncomfortable with AVs perceiving them, which will be an increasingly important issue in the design conversation between fully autonomous AVs and general road users.

AB Disengagement of advanced driver-assist systems (ADAS) has significant safety implications in partially automated vehicles where drivers may not be paying attention; this requires rigorous testing to ensure vehicles can safely transfer control to drivers. Existing testing and regulation on this topic are minimal, and do not address the role of difficult-to-measure but potentially important variables relating to individual vehicle differences or variations in environmental conditions. This study assessed variability in takeover alerting performance in three Model 3 Tesla vehicles in a demanding driving setting on a closed track. Results revealed that once an alerting sequence had begun, the ADAS systems performed as designed, but the vehicles were highly variable in the timing of alert initiation following the loss of lane marking tracking. In addition, luminosity and sun angle were found to potentially have a role in alert initiation, but dashboard-mounted cameras may be insufficient for measuring variations in atmospheric brightness. We recommend that future work studies brightness, as well as more comprehensive sampling guidelines for vehicle test protocols to ensure differences are adequately considered.

AB To support the emerging vehicle-to-everything (V2X) communication for autonomous vehicles and smart transportation services, 3rd Generation Partnership Project (3GPP) has recently introduced cellular V2X (C-V2X) standards. In C-V2X, radio resources can be managed not only centrally by the cellular network base station, but also in a completely distributed manner (Mode 4) without any cellular support. However, Mode 4 may suffer significant collisions and interference in a dense environment since each vehicle selects its own resources to transmit V2X messages autonomously without adapting appropriately to vehicle density. To address this challenge, we propose ATOMIC, an Adaptive Transmission pOwer and Message Interval Control scheme for C-V2X Mode 4, in which each vehicle utilizes real-time channel sensing and neighbor information to reduce channel contention for improved reliability and latency. Through analysis and extensive simulations, we show that ATOMIC outperforms the standard Mode 4 in both urban and highway scenarios especially in highly dense environments.

AB Uncrewed autonomous vehicles (UAVs) have made significant contributions to reconnaissance and surveillance missions in past US military campaigns. As the prevalence of UAVs increases, there has also been improvements in counter-UAV technology that makes it difficult for them to successfully obtain valuable intelligence within an area of interest. Hence, it has become important that modern UAVs can accomplish their missions while maximizing their chances of survival. In this work, we specifically study the problem of identifying a short path from a designated start to a goal, while collecting all rewards and avoiding adversaries that move randomly on the grid. We also provide a possible application of the framework in a military setting, that of autonomous casualty evacuation. We present a comparison of three methods to solve this problem: namely we implement a Deep Q-Learning model, an 6-greedy tabular Q-Learning model, and an online optimization framework. Our computational experiments, designed using simple grid-world environments with random adversaries showcase how these approaches work and compare them in terms of performance, accuracy, and computational time.

AB An autonomous vessel uses multiple different radio technologies such as satellites, mobile networks and dedicated narrowband systems, to connect to other ships, services, and the remote operations center (ROC). In-ship communication is mainly implemented with wired technologies but also wireless links can be used. In this survey paper, we provide a short overview of autonomous and remote-controlled systems. This paper reviews 5G-related standardization in the maritime domain, covering main use cases and both the role of autonomous ships and that of people onboard. We discuss the concept of a connectivity manager, an intelligent entity that manages complex set of technologies, integrating satellite and terrestrial technologies together, ensuring robust in-ship connections and ship-to-outside connections in any environment. This survey paper describes the architecture and functionalities of connectivity management required for an autonomous ship to be able to operate globally. As a specific case example, we have implemented a research environment consisting of ship simulators with connectivity components. Our simulation results on the effects of delays to collision avoidance confirm the role of reliable connectivity for safety. Finally, we outline future research directions for autonomous ship connectivity research, providing ideas for further work.

AB Autonomous vehicles (AVs) can potentially compensate for human error whilst driving. Thus, the number of accidents and the amount of congestion, emissions and fuel consumption could be reduced. For such reduction to occur, insights into public acceptance of AVs must be considered because they are a crucial factor for the successful implementation of AVs in existing traffic systems.
   Purpose: This study aims to explore (1) the mobility behaviour of current passengers, (2) the perception of the public of how AVs can be applied, (3) the perceived challenges of AVs in terms of integration into existing traffic systems, (4) the general attitude of the public towards AVs and (5) the perceived safety of passengers after riding an autonomous shuttle with a maximum SAE level of 3 in the setting of mixed traffic.
   Method: This qualitative study was conducted in Carinthia (Austria) in September 2018. Interviews were conducted with 19 participants aged between 20 and 75 years. The participants were recruited through purposeful sampling, and data were collected through in-depth, semistructured interviews which were recorded, transcribed, organised and analysed using systematic, qualitative content analysis.
   Results: Results show that transport mobility plays an important role in social life. In rural areas, AVs can shift transportation modes from private cars to public transportation. The respondents perceive AVs as an alternative more than as a substitute for existing means of transportation. With the integration of AVs into existing traffic systems, the transportation of goods and people could be improved despite related uncertainties. This study explores different aspects of societal, technical, legal and economic challenges. Overall, the respondents feel positive about AVs. Responses regarding safety show that experience with AVs and speed are key factors.
   Originality/Value: This study is one of the first to explain qualitatively public perceptions of AVs after an actual ride in an AV under real-life conditions. The results, which help understand AVs from the public's perspective, may also provide guidelines for the successful integration of AVs in Austria. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

ID AUTOMATED EXTRACTION
AB The commercialization of automated driving vehicles promotes the development of safer and more efficient autonomous driving technologies including lane marking detection strategy, which is considered to be the most promising feature in environmental perception technology. To reduce the tradeoff between time consumption and detection precision, we propose a real-time lane marking detection method by using LiDAR point clouds directly. A constrained RANSAC algorithm is applied to select the regions of interest and filter the background data. Further, a road curb detection method based on the segment point density is also proposed to classify the road points and curb points. Finally, an adaptive threshold selection method is proposed to identify lane markings. In this investigation, five datasets are collected from different driving conditions that include the straight road, curved road, and uphill, to test the proposed method. The proposed method is evaluated under different performance metrics such as Precision, Recall, Dice, Jaccard as well as the average detection distance and computation time for the five datasets. The quantitative results show the efficiency and feasibility of this proposed method.

   model; Unmanned ground vehicle
AB Unmanned ground vehicles (UGVs) are most commonly characterized as dealing with "3D" tasks-dull, dirty, and dangerous with automations. Although most of the UGVs are designed to a high degree of autonomy, human operators will still intervene in the robot operations and tele-operate them to achieve their missions. Thus, operator capacity, together with robot autonomy and user interface, is one of the important design factors in research and development (R&D) of UGVs. This paper presents the implementation of an agent-based human-robot interaction simulation model (called "HRISim"). HRISim was developed to analyze operator capacity of UGVs and its resulting mission effectiveness in the supervisory control of UGVs. HRISim incorporates 1) UGV mission scenario, 2) operator's task processes, human resources (visual, auditory, cognition, psychomotor), and associated user interface, 3) UGV automation level, such as autonomous unmanned operation, autonomous manned operation, and autonomous command & control operation, together with UGV functionalities including move, fire, and rescue. We further demonstrate some experimental results to show its applicability to the resolution of practical problems to be evaluated during R&D of UGVs.

ID AVOIDANCE; NAVIGATION; SYSTEMS
AB Safe autonomous flight is essential for widespread acceptance of aircraft that must fly close to the ground. We have developed a method of collision avoidance that can be used in three dimensions in much the same way as autonomous ground vehicles that navigate over unexplored terrain. Safe navigation is accomplished by a combination of online environmental sensing, path planning and collision avoidance. Here we outline our methodology and report results with an autonomous helicopter that operates at low elevations in uncharted environments, some of which are densely populated with obstacles such as buildings, trees and wires. We have recently completed over 700 successful runs in which the helicopter traveled between coarsely specified waypoints separated by hundreds of meters, at speeds of up to 10 ms(-1) at elevations of 5-11 m above ground level. The helicopter safely avoids large objects such as buildings and trees but also wires as thin as 6 mm. We believe this represents the first time an air vehicle has traveled this fast so close to obstacles. The collision avoidance method learns to avoid obstacles by observing the performance of a human operator.

AB Due to its flexibility and high maneuverability, Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) is able to quickly provide wireless connections to the ground vehicles in mobile environment. In this paper, a multi-UAV enabled mobile Internet of Vehicles (IoV) model is proposed, where the UAVs track to serve the mobile vehicles and send downlink information to the vehicles during the flight time. Considering the constraints of anti-collision and communication interference between the UAVs, the system throughput is maximized by jointly optimizing vehicle communication scheduling, UAV power allocation and UAV trajectory. The formulated non-convex optimization problem is separated into three subproblems, including communication scheduling optimization, power allocation optimization and UAV trajectory optimization, which can be solved by successive convex approximation (SCA). A joint iterative optimization algorithm of the three subproblems is put forward to get the optimal solution. Then, a fairness optimization problem is proposed to guarantee the fair communications for each vehicle. The numerical results reveal the excellent performance of the multi-UAV enabled mobile IoV by joint communication and trajectory optimization.

AB Five UK cities will implement clean air zones to improve air quality (AQ), specifically in relation to oxides of nitrogen, and 253 UK local authorities have declared AQ management areas. Extended range electric vehicles can offer zero emission (ZE) operation but cities lack the ability to monitor and control when vehicles can switch from engine to battery. Project Autonomous and Connected vehicles for CleaneR Air (ACCRA) aims to develop and demonstrate a system allowing hybrid vehicle to become part of a city's urban traffic management control system; monitoring the vehicles' location and operational state, and controlling the strategy to ensure ZE operation through geofenced zones with poor AQ. This study demonstrates a new methodology to model emissions using state-of-the-art instantaneous vehicle emissions modelling, geographic information system (GIS) and a new method for capturing vehicle behaviour using global positioning system. Probe vehicles were used for the pilot study in Leeds, UK, to capture drive-cycle data and the emissions are modelled. A GIS interface is used to match these emissions to the network. Finally, a high-resolution emissions map is generated to be used as input for AQ dispersion models and the ACCRA decision-making engine for the generation of geofencing AQ zones.

AB With the development of autonomous vehicle, the autonomous valet parking has been attracting extensive attention, by relieving users' inconvenience from parking. Compared with shortrange autonomous valet parking, long-range autonomous valet parking extends parking features with bridge of long-range travelling and parking in a user-friendly cycle. However, due to the uncertainty of trip routes, the performance of single reservation mechanism on parking lot status prediction is limited. Besides, unified parking pricing intensifies parking competition and causes local congestion. Therefore, we propose a long-range autonomous valet parking framework based on Two-step Reservation Mechanism. The proposed scheme provides the first reservation service before arriving at Drop-off spots (regular step), so as to anticipate parking demand of parking lot. Then, it provides the second reservation service when arriving at Drop-off spots (extra step) for updating the optimality of parking decision. The future parking lot status can be predicted with the impact of concurrent requests and reservation execution probability. Meanwhile, we propose a heterogeneous pricing strategy, in which the parking lots with higher parking demands would be adjusted with higher prices. Simulation results show that our scheme outperforms literature works on reducing parking cost and balancing parking demand.

AB This paper proposes a spatial-temporal recurrent neural network architecture for deep Q-networks that can be used to steer an autonomous ship. The network design makes it possible to handle an arbitrary number of surrounding target ships while offering robustness to partial observability. Furthermore, a state-of-the-art collision risk metric is proposed to enable an easier assessment of different situations by the agent. The COLREG rules of maritime traffic are explicitly considered in the design of the reward function. The final policy is validated on a custom set of newly created singleship encounters called 'Around the Clock' problems and the commonly used Imazu (1987) problems, which include 18 multi-ship scenarios. Performance comparisons with artificial potential field and velocity obstacle methods demonstrate the potential of the proposed approach for maritime path planning. Furthermore, the new architecture exhibits robustness when it is deployed in multi-agent scenarios and it is compatible with other deep reinforcement learning algorithms, including actor-critic frameworks. & COPY; 2023 Elsevier Ltd.

DE Localization; multi-modal fusion; Dempster-Shafer theory; road
   environment analysis; autonomous vehicle
AB A highly accurate and robust real-time localization process is crucial for autonomous driving applications. Numerous methods for localization have been proposed, which combine various kinds of input, such as data from environmental sensors, inertial measurement units (IMU), and the Global Positioning System (GPS). Because reliance on a single environmental sensor is a vulnerable approach, the use of multiple environmental sensors is a better alternative. However, the fusion methods from previous studies have not adequately compensated for the drawbacks due to the lack of sensor diversity nor have the methods considered the fail-safe issue. In this paper, we propose a multi-modal fusion-based localization framework that uses multiple map matching sources. The framework contains two independent map matching sources and integrates them in a stochastic situational analysis model. By applying a probabilistic model, the more reliable map matching between the multiple sources is determined and the system stability is verified via a fail-safe action. A number of experiments with autonomous vehicles within actual driving environments have shown that combining multiple map matching sources yield more robust results than the use of a single map matching.

AB Many marine species exhibit capabilities that would be desirable for manmade systems operating in the maritime environment. However, without detracting from the potential, if bioinspiration is to prove beneficial, it is important to have a consistent set of metrics that allow fair comparison, without bias, when comparing the performance of engineered and biological systems. In this study we focus on deriving an unbiased metric of performance applicable to marine animals and engineered subsea vehicles for one of the most fundamental of properties; that of the energy cost of locomotion. We present a rational analytical model of the physics behind the total energy cost of locomotion applicable to both biological and engineered autonomous underwater marine systems. This model proposes the use of an equivalent spheroid efficiency as a fair metric to compare engineered and biological systems. The model is then utilised to identify how changes in mass, speed, spheroid efficiency and hotel load impact the performance of the system. (C) 2015 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB The design of underwater unmanned vehicles is an interdisciplinary study that includes several fields, such as computational fluid dynamics, modeling and control of systems, robotics, image processing, and electronic card design. The operational cost of such vehicles is high because it is dependent on variable fluid properties like salinity and high pressure while its' mobility must be resistant to environmental conditions such as undersea. The study describes an operating platform, called Lucky Fin, on which the students can develop various control algorithms and can test and extract hydrodynamic parameters of the underwater vehicle. The platform consists of an underwater vehicle and two testing tanks. The control card, the user control program interface, and a manipulator's arm are designed to be used for a series of control applications such as depth, heading, target tracking, and capturing. The results of several tests are illustrated in this article.

DE V2V communication; message contents plausibility; power control
AB Although the IEEE Wireless Access in Vehicular Environment (WAVE) and 3GPP Cellular V2X deployments are imminent, their standards do not yet cover an important security aspect; the message content plausibility check. In safety-critical driving situations, vehicles cannot blindly trust the content of received safety messages, because an attacker may have forged false values in it in order to cause unsafe response from the receiving vehicles. In particular, the attacks mounted from remote, well-hidden positions around roads are considered the most apparent danger. So far, there have been three approaches to validating V2X message content: checking based on sensor fusion, behavior analysis, and communication constraints. This paper discusses the three existing approaches. In addition, it discusses a communication-based checking scheme that supplements the existing approaches. It uses low-power transmission of vehicle identifiers to identify remote attackers. We demonstrate its potential address in the case of an autonomous vehicle platooning application.

AB Autonomous decision-making for ships to avoid collision is core to the autonomous navigation of intelligent ships. In recent years, related research has shown explosive growth. However, owing to the complex constraints of navigation environments, the Convention of the International Regulations for Preventing Collisions at Sea, 1972 (COLREGs), and the underactuated characteristics of ships, it is extremely challenging to design a decision-making algorithm for autonomous collision avoidance (CA) that is practically useful. Based on the investigation of many studies, current decision-making algorithms can be attributed to three strategies: alteration of course alone, alteration of speed alone, and alteration of both course and speed. This study discusses the implementation methods of each strategy in detail and compares the specific ways, applicable scenes, and limiting conditions of these methods to achieve alteration of course and/or speed to avoid collision, especially their advantages and disadvantages. Additionally, this study quantitatively analyzes the coupling mechanisms of alterations of course and speed for autonomous CA decision-making under different encounter situations, supplementing and optimizing the decision-making theory for ship autonomous CA. Finally, several feasible algorithms and improvement schemes for autonomous CA decision-making, combined with course and speed alterations, are discussed.

AB Recent advancements in unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) have proven UAVs to be an inevitable part of future networking and communications systems. While many researchers have proposed UAV-assisted solutions for improving traditional network performance by extending coverage and capacity, an in-depth study on aspects of artificial intelligence-based autonomous UAV network design has not been fully explored yet. The objective of this paper is to present a comprehensive survey of AI-based autonomous UAV networks. A careful survey was conducted of more than 100 articles on UAVs focusing on the classification of autonomous features, network resource management and planning, multiple access and routing protocols, and power control and energy efficiency for UAV networks. By reviewing and analyzing the UAV networking literature, it is found that AI-based UAVs are a technologically feasible and economically viable paradigm for cost-effectiveness in the design and deployment of such next-generation autonomous networks. Finally, this paper identifies open research problems in the emerging field of UAV networks. This study is expected to stimulate more research endeavors to build low-cost, energy-efficient, next-generation autonomous UAV networks.

AB The inspection of underwater structures and facilities by autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) is of an increasing interest in the offshore industry. The big advantage of AUVs compared to the currently used method of deploying remotely operated vehicles (ROVs) or divers is, that AUVs require significantly less operational overhead and can be operated in parallel to other tasks. Currently AUVs are primary used for hydrographic and scientific applications and are therefore not suited for the demands of inspection tasks. The autonomous inspection unit developed within the CSurvey project and presented in this paper acts as an intelligent sensor package, allowing the deployment of a sensor package suitable for different tasks on a commercial AUV. The main focus of this article is to introduce the mechatronics and control of this inspection system and present the results of experiments done with its primary highresolution sensor, which is based on laser-projected structured light. The main focus of these experiments was to quantify the impact of water quality on the sensor system, especially within respect to sensing range. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

ID DESIGN
AB The rendezvous and formation problem is a significant part for the unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) autonomous aerial refueling (AAR) technique. It can be divided into two major phases: the long-range guidance phase and the formation phase. In this paper, an iterative computation guidance law (ICGL) is proposed to compute a series of state variables to get the solution of a control variable for a UAV conducting rendezvous with a tanker in AAR. The proposed method can make the control variable converge to zero when the tanker and the UAV receiver come to a formation flight eventually. For the long-range guidance phase, the ICGL divides it into two sub-phases: the correction sub-phase and the guidance sub-phase. The two sub-phases share the same iterative process. As for the formation phase, a velocity coordinate system is created by which control accelerations are designed to make the speed of the UAV consistent with that of the tanker. The simulation results demonstrate that the proposed ICGL is effective and robust against wind disturbance. (C) 2014 Production and hosting by Elsevier Ltd. on behalf of CSAA & BUAA.

AB The maritime industry has been continuously transforming the nature of its business and striving to embrace technology in many aspects. In this context, autonomous technologies have been receiving momentum with a potential to revolutionise the landscape of shipping industry. After conducting a comprehensive literature review on the issues facing by the short sea shipping (SSS) industry, a model is developed to explore the potential savings of removing crew and use of autonomous technologies through a Continuously Unmanned Ship (CUS) that is operated by a Shore Control Centre (SCC). The analysis shows that autonomous technologies are viable to the challenges that the shipping industry is facing in terms of crew costs and skill shortage. To validate this statement, a case study is selected and various scenarios were tested based on relevant operational and financial considerations, including crew arrangement, cargo utilisation levels and shore wage coefficients. The results suggest that the savings occur in demand-uncertain markets and where a network of vessels are operated via a control centre. While autonomous technology use in shipping holds promise, there remain several limitations that this research addresses in terms of implementation, commercial attractiveness, risk profile, legislative, workforce planning and port operations.

ID DRIVER BEHAVIOR; TIME; FIELD; MODEL
AB In this paper, we propose the novel concept of stimuli-induced equilibrium point to synthesize the speed and position references for automatic on-ramp merging systems. Based on the psychological field theory, the intensity of the stimuli that act upon a driver between two vehicles in a three-vehicle platooning configuration is mathematically modeled to calculate a point at which the stimuli resultant becomes zero. This approach intends to mimic drivers' decision process when certain distance separation with respect to the leader and follower vehicles is attained for safety. The location of this point is continuously updated according to the speed of the middle vehicle and the current traffic scenario. Such stimuli-induced equilibrium point has shown to improve the performance of existing automatic merging control schemes while increasing safety conditions by providing enough reaction time for drivers to avoid an eventual collision.

AB In this paper, the problem of robust stabilization of a wheeled vehicle is addressed. The configuration (position and orientation) set of the vehicle is divided into two parts: global and local configuration sets. The novelty of this paper is the design of a hybrid feedback controller that assigns different objectives in the vehicle's global and local behaviors. Two Lyapunov functions for individual objectives are introduced that allow a hybrid feedback control law to pursue different objectives. In the global sense, it is important to reach the target point as quickly as possible, but once the vehicle reaches is near the goal, a precise maneuvering by rejecting disturbances including tire slippage and measurement noise becomes important. The asymptotical stability and robustness of the closed loop system are assured. The derived control law is validated by simulations and experiments using an autonomous forklift.

AB Purpose - Development and demonstration of an autonomous, mobile welding robot capable of fabricating large-scale customised structures.
   Design/methodology/approach - An autonomous welding robot has been developed under the EC Framework V Growth program. The system comprises a global vision system for part location and orientation, and a robot transport vehicle (RTV) which carries a 6-axis robot, robot controller, welding equipment, and local sensors at the welding torch. The RTV path, robot arm motion and weld process programming are performed automatically using sensors and specially customised simulation software.
   Findings - The technology developed within the project was demonstrated, in November 2004, to be capable of identifying and welding large scale customised structures as found in the earth moving equipment and bridge fabrication industries.
   Research limitations/implications - The project demonstrated that current sensor technology is capable of being applied successfully to autonomous robots, but further developments in sensor technology are required to improve accuracy and joint access.
   Practical implications - The NOMAD concept of autonomous mobile robots provides an alternative solution to welding mass customised structures.
   Originality/value - This project demonstrated, for the first time, the capability of autonomous robots to weld large scale customised structures.

AB This paper is motivated by the autonomous shuttle service that operates in the geo-fenced Linden Residential Area of Columbus, Ohio that links residents to the two nearby locations of opportunity of a community center and a transit hub. This paper focuses on path planning and path tracking of an autonomous shuttle which are its most fundamental autonomous driving functions. Path planning is based on improving efficiency of computation and smoothness of path. Velocity planning is based on obeying speed limits, limiting longitudinal acceleration along straight segments and lateral acceleration during curved segments for improved ride comfort of the passengers. Path tracking control focuses on robust implementation that keeps accuracy of path following in the presence of uncertainties and variations in speed. A realistic, 3D virtual simulation environment of the actual geo-fenced urban area used here is built for evaluating and developing the path planning and path tracking functions of this paper. The same environment can also be used for developing and evaluating other autonomous driving functions with the capability of generating complicated traffic scenarios. The path tacking control results are compared with those of the pure pursuit path tracking algorithm of the open source and publicly available Autoware autonomous driving interface for the Robot Operating System.

AB Autonomous buses can improve the efficiency of public transportation and offer great benefits for developing sustainable mobility transportation. To realise the potential of autonomous buses in public transportation, understanding the public's intention to use the new technology-based mobility concept is necessary. Therefore, this study synthesises three theories to explain public intention to use autonomous buses, namely, unified theory of acceptance and usage of technology (UTAUT), task technology fit (TTF) theory and trust theory. A survey instrument (n = 277) is adopted to validate the theoretical model. The results indicate that (1) performance expectancy (e.g., economic benefits, environmental friendliness and safety), effort expectancy (e.g., ease to use, availability and accessibility), social influence (e.g., attitudes of around people and information from society) and perceived risk (e.g., injuries, damages and privacy issues) lead to the formation of trust; and (2) trust has direct and indirect (via TTF) effects on behavioural intention to use autonomous buses. Furthermore, bootstrapping analysis is conducted, and the significance of the mediation effect of TTF is verified. The findings enrich the existing theoretical research on the adoption of autonomous buses and guide the future integration of autonomous buses into the public transportation system.

TI Effect of propeller torque on minimum-control airspeed
SO JOURNAL OF AIRCRAFT
LA English
DT Article
AB Relations are developed for absolute static minimum-control airspeed, without the bank angle restrictions imposed on manned aircraft by regulatory agencies. Absolute static minimum-control airspeed can be important in the design of modern unmanned aerial vehicles, because autonomous computer controlled flight systems do not impose the same constraints as those imposed by human pilots. It is shown that, for a three-channel unmanned aerial vehicle, absolute static minimum-control airspeed always provides the critical constraint for static minimum-control airspeed. Even for the case of a conventional aircraft configuration with both rudder and ailerons, absolute static minimum-control airspeed can be a critical concern for small high-powered propeller-driven unmanned aerial vehicles.

AB The invention and implementation of smart connected cars will change the way how the transportation networks in cities around the world operate. This technological shift will not happen instantaneously-for many years, both human-driven and smart connected vehicles will coexist. In this paper, using a multiagent simulation framework, we model a complex urban transportation system that involves heterogeneous participants. Vehicles are assigned into two groups: the first one consists of smart cars and the second one involves regular ones. Vehicles in the former group are capable of rerouting in response to changes in the observed traffic while regular ones rely on historical information only. The goal of the paper is to analyze the effect of changing smart cars penetration on system characteristics, in particular, the total travelling time. The smart car routing algorithm proposed in this paper reduced travelling time up to 30%. Analysis has shown that the behaviour of the system and optimal configuration of underlying algorithms change dynamically with smart vehicles penetration level.

AB With the advance of emerging vehicle technologies, more and more work has been devoted to analyzing the resulting impacts in traffic efficiency and energy savings, whereas relatively limited studies have investigated the impact of emerging vehicles on traffic safety. To bridge the research gap, this study selected two emerging vehicle technologies, adaptive cruise control (ACC) of automated vehicles (AVs) and cooperative and adaptive cruise control (CACC) of connected automated vehicles (CAVs), to analyze the impact of emerging vehicles on traffic safety in both homogeneous and heterogeneous traffic. In homogeneous traffic, theoretical linear stability analysis and simulation both indicated that CACC has more robust string stability and is safer compared to ACC due to the fact that CACC is able to transmit acceleration information to the following vehicle. For heterogeneous traffic, microscopic simulations with different vehicle classes were conducted with consideration of downgradation and platooning intensity. Simulation results showed that for mixed CAV and human-driven vehicle (HV) traffic, the collision risk tended to increase first and then fall with the market penetration rate (MPR) of CAVs, which indicates that the moderate deployment stage is the most dangerous stage. In addition, results showed that higher platooning intensity led to lower collision risk in both mixed CAV and HV and AV and HV traffic. As a consequence, this study suggests that vehicle platooning and strengthening the connectivity for emerging vehicles can improve the longitudinal traffic safety of emerging vehicles.

AB This paper introduces a new kinematic model to describe the planar motion of an autonomous underwater vehicle moving in constant current flows. The vehicle is modeled as a rigid body moving at maximum attainable forward velocity with symmetric bounds on the control input for the steering rate. The model approximates the effect a flow will induce on the steering rate of the vehicle due to the asymmetric geometry of the vehicle. By imposing restrictions on the magnitude of the flow, the model is then used to characterize and construct the minimum-time paths that guide the vehicle from a given initial to a final configuration in the plane. Algorithms for the time-optimal path synthesis problem are also introduced, along with several simulations to validate the proposed method. Lastly, insights into how one would approach the energy-optimal problem are given, highlighting the fundamental differences in formulation and methods used to solve for the optimal paths.

AB In logistics and freight distribution, scheduling and cost efficiency are two crucial issues for transportation companies that look with favour at the innovation introduced by Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS). Moreover, an infrastructure level of service, safety and environmental defence are important for planners and public administrations. In this sense, terminal capacity and landside operations at the maritime infrastructure represent an interesting task for the community. Thus, this paper contributes to the research by: (i) proposing a generic framework for the integration of autonomous and connected vehicles with physical infrastructures; (ii) evaluating the opportunity to manage traffic arrivals according to vehicles' priority and testing the effects of the introduction of a buffer zone outside the maritime port; (iii) improving efficiency and security within the terminal area by reducing waiting time and avoiding interference between flows. Moreover, the proposal for a discrete-event simulation model to assess terminal capacity in a ro-ro terminal is presented. Therefore, the paper contributes to some critical aspects towards sustainable development. First, regarding policy measures and actions, it proposes a valuable tool to assess what-if scenarios. Secondly, it represents a step forward in the process of smart corridor design for freight vehicles; in fact, it proposes a tool for managing landside operations at maritime ports and focuses on intervention in solving specific barriers and bottlenecks for freight who cross a ro-ro terminal daily. Furthermore, it offers a viable solution for managing connected vehicles in a context where full automation still needs to be achieved. The results evidenced the framework's capability to deal with the traffic demand, thus improving the efficiency of the terminal landside operations.

TI Cellular-V2X Communications for Platooning: Design and Evaluation

DE V2X; cellular V2X; VANETs; cooperative driving; 3GPP; platooning
AB Platooning is a cooperative driving application where autonomous/semi-autonomous vehicles move on the same lane in a train-like manner, keeping a small constant inter-vehicle distance, in order to reduce fuel consumption and gas emissions and to achieve safe and efficient transport. To this aim, they may exploit multiple on-board sensors (e.g., radars, LiDARs, positioning systems) and direct vehicle-to-vehicle communications to synchronize their manoeuvres. The main objective of this paper is to discuss the design choices and factors that determine the performance of a platooning application, when exploiting the emerging cellular vehicle-to-everything (C-V2X) communication technology and considering the scheduled mode, specified by 3GPP for communications over the sidelink assisted by the eNodeB. Since no resource management algorithm is currently mandated by 3GPP for this new challenging context, we focus on analyzing the feasibility and performance of the dynamic scheduling approach, with platoon members asking for radio resources on a per-packet basis. We consider two ways of implementing dynamic scheduling, currently unspecified by 3GPP: the sequential mode, that is somehow reminiscent of time division multiple access solutions based on IEEE 802.11p-till now the only investigated access technology for platooning-and the simultaneous mode with spatial frequency reuse enabled by the eNodeB. The evaluation conducted through system-level simulations provides helpful insights about the proposed configurations and C-V2X parameter settings that mainly affect the reliability and latency performance of data exchange in platoons, under different load settings. Achieved results show that the proposed simultaneous mode succeeds in reducing the latency in the update cycle in each vehicle's controller, thus enabling future high-density platooning scenarios.

AB In recent years, interest in smart and green vehicles has increased. There are many cases where engine net torque related control is performed when building smart and green car systems. Speed tracking control in autonomous driving, or optimal transmission shift control is an example. The engine net torque is the sum of the engine indicated torque, accessory load torque, and fictional torque, and the starter motor torque in the case of a parallel hybrid vehicle. However, the estimation error of these torque items can cause the estimation error of the engine net torque. In this paper, a compensation method for the slowly varying uncertainty of the engine net torque in a parallel hybrid vehicle using a multiplicative constant is proposed. The adaptation of the multiplicative constant is conducted using the amount of change in the engine net torque estimated in the backward direction of the driveline. The proposed algorithm is verified based on production vehicle data.

AB This study explored the economic influence of introducing fully autonomous trucks (ATs) on the total cost of operation (TCO) from the viewpoint of freight transport operators. We utilized the cost-benefit analysis and scenario planning frameworks using a case study of a middle-mile route between a port and a large logistics distribution center in South Korea, where an autonomous truck pilot project has been running for several years. We employed a data source obtained from Hanjin Transportation Co., LTD., which enables us to reflect the actual expenses of operating freight transportation in the context of the study route. The findings of this study indicate that ATs would attain substantial operation cost savings for freight transport operators across all five scenarios, ranging from the most pessimistic to the most optimistic. Specifically, results of the base scenario reveal that monthly TCO decreases by 56.25, 47.04, 42.97, and 41.73 percent for 1-, 5-, 12-, and 25-ton trucks, respectively. The cost reduction per month was USD 2399 for a 1-ton truck, USD 2891 for a 5-ton truck, and USD 3438 for a 12-ton truck. Even in the most pessimistic scenario, the operation cost savings for operating with ATs in the route are USD 1415, USD 1642, USD 1985, and USD 2222 per month for 1-, 5-, 12-, and 25-ton trucks, respectively. When factoring in changes in cost, the wage reduction for vehicle drivers was substantial (USD 2430, USD 2835, USD 3240, and USD 3645 for 1-, 5-, 12-, and 25-ton trucks, respectively). However, remote operation was a new cost factor that increased TCO, which increased by USD 243,384,357 in the base case. This study's findings have multiple implications, including (1) informing economic efficiency and productivity of operating autonomous vehicles (AVs), (2) providing insights on indicative cost estimates for AV operations, (3) providing valuable information for making informed investment decisions, and (4) supporting the notion that freight transport is an especially attractive market for AVs.

AB We present a terrain traversability mapping and navigation system (TNS) for autonomous excavator applications in an unstructured environment. We use an efficient approach to extract terrain features from RGB images and 3D point clouds and incorporate them into a global map for planning and navigation. Our system can adapt to changing environments and update the terrain information in real-time. Moreover, we present a novel dataset, the Complex Worksite Terrain dataset, which consists of RGB images from construction sites with seven categories based on navigability. Our novel algorithms improve the mapping accuracy over previous methods by 4.17-30.48% and reduce MSE on the traversability map by 13.8-71.4%. We have combined our mapping approach with planning and control modules in an autonomous excavator navigation system and observe 49.3% improvement in the overall success rate. Based on TNS, we demonstrate the first autonomous excavator that can navigate through unstructured environments consisting of deep pits, steep hills, rock piles, and other complex terrain features. In addition, we combine the proposed TNS with the autonomous excavation system (AES), and deploy the new pipeline, TNES, on a more complex construction site. With minimum human intervention, we demonstrate autonomous navigation capability with excavation tasks.

AB The present study investigates the environmental benefits of phasing-in autonomous ships in global maritime transportation along major dry bulk and tanker routes using Bayesian probabilistic forecasting algorithm. The focus is on the simulations and calibrations on the navigational behavior of autonomous ships at both port and high-sea, as well as the potential emission abatement of atmospheric pollutants compared to the conventional fleet along the sailing routes. We use historical data on major international tanker and dry bulk trade routes to characterize the ship movements and trends in ship emission. Different scenarios are evaluated with a combination of autonomous ship phase-in rates (25, 75, 100%) and cleaner fuel choices in Years 2030 and 2050 (from the baseline Year, 2020). The results show that the magnitude of the emission reduction generally increases with a higher level of autonomous ships in the fleet as expected, and the magnitude ranges from small increments to major reductions of 37-64% along the different routes. Overall, we hope that our findings can contribute towards the realization of environmental benefits with the adoption of autonomous shipping along the major shipping routes in the future.

AB The connected vehicle (CV) that integrates vehicle intelligence and communication network technology is one of the main methods to approach intelligent transportation, which is of great significance in solving the problem of road congestion and traffic accidents. As an important application field of CVs, multi-vehicle formation driving can realize the collaboration of perception, decision making, and control among vehicles, which has a great promotion effect on improving road traffic safety, reducing fuel consumption, and improving traffic congestion. In order to ensure the safe, reliable, and efficient operation of the CV platoon under the actual road network, weather, and various application scenarios, a large number of tests need to be conducted to validate the platoon before it is applied. Simulation studies are still indispensable considering the cost and risk of real vehicle testing. This paper reviews the current status of research and application of vehicle group behavior simulation in a CV environment from four aspects: simulation tools, modeling methods, evaluation indicators, and application scenarios, and discusses the development direction of CV simulation testing, which provides a framework, method, and technology reference for future research and application of vehicle group behavior simulation in a CV environment.

AB Autonomous technology is on the rise, allowing customers to delegate shopping tasks and decisions to such artificial intelligence-based systems. However, trust and privacy issues are impeding the adoption of such technology. This study examines the factors affecting the adoption of autonomous shopping systems. A conceptual framework is developed by adding trust and moderating variables of privacy concern to the UTAUT model. Using a quantitative research design, data is collected from 454 respondents and analysed using covariance-based structural equation modelling. Results show that performance expectancy, effort expectancy, social influence, and facilitating conditions positively impact perceived trust in autonomous shopping systems. Privacy concern as a moderator dampens the positive relationship between performance expectancy and perceived trust. Also, privacy concerns dampen the positive relationship between social influence and perceived trust. This study is one of the first to empirically examine customers' autonomous shopping system intention by revising the UTAUT with trust and privacy concerns. These findings generate valuable insights into an under-researched area of customer behaviour and artificial intelligence.

DT Review
AB Autonomous driving decision is a critical component of automatic driving system, which informs and updates the unmanned vehicle of object movements. However, end-to-end autonomous driving decision is still a great challenge due to the different scales of traffic target in the wild dynamic traffic scenes. To solve these problems, this paper proposes a novel model with attention mechanism and spatiotemporal features extraction. Specifically, for the important spatial information of traffic targets with scale differences, the spatial dimensions of height H, width W and channel C are independent of each other to build sparse spatial attention map. Moreover, different sparse masks are trained for spatial network by pruning elements of feature maps at the end of each block of backbone, which improves the accuracy of the two subnetworks of spatial network by 2.3% and 3.9%, respectively. Then the extracted spatial information is introduced jointly to the time sequence network with previous speed as input to obtain the vehicle steering angle and speed. Experiments on public virtual datasets show that the prediction accuracy of the model reaches 85.8%. Compared with other state-of-the-art models, our model increased by 4.8% and 2.2%, respectively.

AB We developed and tested a comprehensive method for measuring the three-dimensional distribution of tubeworm colonies using an autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV). We derived volumetric measurements such as the volume, area, average height, and number of tubes for colonies of Lamellibrachia satsuma, the world's shallowest-dwelling vestimentiferan tubeworm discovered at a depth of 82 m, at the Haorimushi site in Kagoshima Bay, japan, by processing geometric and visual data obtained through low-altitude surveys using the AUV Tri-Dog 1. According to the results, the tubeworm colonies cover an area of 151.9 m(2), accounting for 5.8% of the observed area (2600 m(2)). The total number of tubes was estimated to be 99,500. Morphological parameters such as area, volume, and average height were estimated for each colony. On the basis of average height, colonies could be clearly separated into two groups, short (0.1-0.3 m) and tall (0.6-0.7 m), independent of the area. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

   Ground Vehicle Localization
SO JOURNAL OF FIELD ROBOTICS
LA English
DT Article
AB Autonomous ground vehicles navigating on road networks require robust and accurate localization over long-term operation and in a wide range of adverse weather and environmental conditions. GPS/INS (inertial navigation system) solutions, which are insufficient alone to maintain a vehicle within a lane, can fail because of significant radio frequency noise or jamming, tall buildings, trees, and other blockage or multipath scenarios. LIDAR and camera map-based vehicle localization can fail when optical features become obscured, such as with snow or dust, or with changes to gravel or dirt road surfaces. Localizing ground penetrating radar (LGPR) is a new mode of a priori map-based vehicle localization designed to complement existing approaches with a low sensitivity to failure modes of LIDAR, camera, and GPS/INS sensors due to its low-frequency RF energy, which couples deep into the ground. Most subsurface features detected are inherently stable over time. Significant research, discussed herein, remains to prove general utility. We have developed a novel low-profile ultra-low power LGPR system and demonstrated real-time operation underneath a passenger vehicle. A correlation maximizing optimization technique was developed to allow real-time localization at 126Hz. Here we present the detailed design and results from highway testing, which uses a simple heuristic for fusing LGPR estimates with a GPS/INS system. Cross-track localization accuracies of 4.3cm RMS relative to a truth RTK GPS/INS unit at speeds up to 100km/h (60mph) are demonstrated. These results, if generalizable, introduce a widely scalable real-time localization method with cross-track accuracy as good as or better than current localization methods.

AB An autonomous vessel train features several autonomous vessels sailing together, piloted by a conventional, manned leader vessel. It is a promising transitional solution at the present technological level before full au-tonomy is realized. We develop mixed-integer programming models for jointly optimizing the autonomous vessel assignment to vessel trains and vessel train routes and schedules in a hub-and-spoke network. Solutions to these models capture the optimal tradeoff between vessel trains' added detour and delay costs and the lower sailing cost of autonomous ships. Numerical case studies are carried out for a real-world short-sea shipping network around the Bohai Bay of China. Results reveal sizeable cost savings of vessel train operations compared to the case where only conventional ships are used. Sensitivity analyses are performed to unveil how the benefit of vessel trains is affected by key operating factors, e.g., the fleet composition, the vessel train size limit, and the network topology. The results inform practitioners of suitable and profitable scenarios for implementing the vessel train strategy. This study can be viewed as the first step toward real implementation of the economically competitive and environmentally friendly autonomous freight ships via vessel trains.

AB Vehicle trajectory data play an important role in autonomous driving and intelligent traffic control. With the widespread deployment of roadside sensors, such as cameras and millimeter-wave radar, it is possible to obtain full-sample vehicle trajectories for a whole area. This paper proposes a general framework for reconstructing continuous vehicle trajectories using roadside visual sensing data. The framework includes three modules: single-region vehicle trajectory extraction, multi-camera cross-region vehicle trajectory splicing, and missing trajectory completion. Firstly, the vehicle trajectory is extracted from each video by YOLOv5 and DeepSORT multi-target tracking algorithms. The vehicle trajectories in different videos are then spliced by the vehicle re-identification algorithm fused with lane features. Finally, the bidirectional long-short-time memory model (LSTM) based on graph attention is applied to complete the missing trajectory to obtain the continuous vehicle trajectory. Measured data from Donghai Bridge in Shanghai are applied to verify the feasibility and effectiveness of the framework. The results indicate that the vehicle re-identification algorithm with the lane features outperforms the vehicle re-identification algorithm that only considers the visual feature by 1.5% in mAP (mean average precision). Additionally, the bidirectional LSTM based on graph attention performs better than the model that does not consider the interaction between vehicles. The experiment demonstrates that our framework can effectively reconstruct the continuous vehicle trajectories on the expressway.

AB Vehicle localization is essential for intelligent and autonomous vehicles. To improve the accuracy of vehicle stand-alone localization in highly dynamic driving conditions during GNSS (Global Navigation Satellites Systems) outages, this paper proposes a vehicle localization system based on vehicle chassis sensors considering vehicle lateral velocity. Firstly, a GNSS/On-board sensors fusion localization framework is established, which could estimate vehicle states such as attitude, velocity, and position. Secondly, when the vehicle has a large lateral motion, nonholonomic constraint in the lateral direction loses fidelity. Instead of using nonholonomic constraint, we propose a vehicle dynamics/kinematics fusion lateral velocity estimation algorithm, which combines the advantage of vehicle dynamic model in low dynamic driving conditions and the advantage of kinematic model in highly dynamic driving conditions. Thirdly, vehicle longitudinal velocity estimated by WSS (Wheel Speed Sensor) and lateral velocity estimated by proposed method are as measurements for the localization system. All information is fused by an adaptive Kalman filter. Finally, vehicle experiments in U-turn maneuver and left-turn maneuver at a traffic intersection are conducted to verify the proposed method. Four different methods are compared in the experiments, and the results show that the estimated position accuracy of our method is below half a meter during a 5s GNSS outage and could keep a sub-meter-level during a 20s GNSS outage while the vehicle has a relatively large lateral motion.

AB In the process of the continuous development and improvement of modern military systems, military unmanned vehicles play an important role in field reconnaissance and strategic deployment. In this paper, the precise tracking algorithm of a military unmanned vehicle, based on GPS navigation, is studied. Firstly, the optimal preview point is obtained according to the data points of a differential GPS signal. Secondly, the pure tracking algorithm is used to calculate the demand steering angle, and a variable universe fuzzy sliding mode controller is designed to control the lateral motion of the vehicle, which is verified by the joint simulation platform of Simulink and CarSim, under multiple working conditions. Finally, the actual vehicle is verified by using the Autobox platform. The results show that the lateral motion control of path tracking designed in this paper can achieve an accurate and effective control effect, and has real-time performance for engineering applications.

AB As the automotive industry has progressed in recent years, in-vehicle networks have also changed. In contrast to traditional vehicles, modern vehicles communicate through connecting interfaces, Electronic Control Units (ECUs), sensors, and gateways over different communication channels called buses. While LIN, CAN, FlexRay, MOST, and Automotive Ethernet protocols facilitate vehicle communication, they expose vehicles to various security risks. Electronics in vehicles must be advanced to improve passenger safety, comfort, and vehicle performance. However, security issues must also be addressed to ensure vehicle resilience. This paper presents an in-depth and comprehensive analysis of the security issues associated with in-vehicle network protocols. We examine the feasibility, severity, and potential consequences of these security issues, which can be used to better understand the risks and vulnerabilities within in-vehicle networks. Furthermore, the paper examines existing solutions that aim to mitigate the identified attacks, including intrusion detection systems (IDSs), firewalls, authentication, and schedulers, while evaluating their effectiveness and drawbacks. Hence, we enable automotive security engineers to comprehend the current state of security measures used to protect in-vehicle networks and identify areas where further research is needed to develop more effective and tailored security solutions. Finally, the paper provides recommendations for future research and the development of security solutions that researchers can use to guide their research efforts for in-vehicle network security.(c) 2023 Elsevier Inc.

AB Machine learning techniques have accelerated the development of autonomous navigation algorithms in recent years, especially algorithms for on-road autonomous navigation. However, off-road navigation in unstructured environments continues to challenge autonomous ground vehicles. Many off-road navigation systems rely on LIDAR to sense and classify the environment, but LIDAR sensors often fail to distinguish navigable vegetation from non-navigable solid obstacles. While other areas of autonomy have benefited from the use of simulation, there has not been a real-time LIDAR simulator that accounted for LIDAR-vegetation interaction. In this work, we outline the development of a real-time, physics-based LIDAR simulator for densely vegetated environments that can be used in the development of LIDAR processing algorithms for off-road autonomous navigation. We present a multi-step qualitative validation of the simulator, which includes the development of an improved statistical model for the range distribution of LIDAR returns in grass. As a demonstration of the simulator's capability, we show an example of the simulator being used to evaluate autonomous navigation through vegetation. The results demonstrate the potential for using the simulation in the development and testing of algorithms for autonomous off-road navigation.

AB Sharing vehicles and rides may become the norm with public use of fully-automated self-driving vehicles in the near future, assuming pandemic-related health concerns fade. Dynamic ride sharing (DRS) or ride-pooling of trips can significantly improve system performance by lowering empty vehicle-miles traveled (eVMT) and increasing average vehicle occupancy (AVO). With several cities looking to promote efficient curb space use, especially with the use of pickup and drop-off locations (PUDOs), this study explores the impacts of PUDOs on DRS rates and AVO values. Various PUDO spacings and trip-demand densities were studied, across the Bloomington, Illinois region, using the agent-based simulator POLARIS. Results reveal that greater PUDO spacing or distances between stops and higher levels of SAV use or trip demand increase AVO (by up to 20% per 4-seater SAV, on average) and decrease SAV VMT (by up to 27%) compared to door-to-door SAV fleet operations without DRS or PUDOs. A quarter-mile PUDO spacing is recommended in downtown regions, similar to current transit stop spacing, to keep walking trips short and demand relatively high. At 0.25 mi PUDO spacings (thoughtfully placed, using origin and destination clusters), travelers walked less than 5 min at either trip end, on average, while 0.5 mi spacings led to another 1 min (approximately) of walking. More evenly distributed and higher SAV demand can save up to 39% total VMT from use of DRS and PUDO stops. It is also important to prepare for queuing areas at PUDOs in settings of high trip density, to limit curbside congestion.

AB In vehicle-to-grid (V2G) network, electric vehicles (EVs) can store greenpower from renewable energy sources and inject excess power to the grid during the peak hours for monetary benefits. Since transactions are involved in this process, it is pertinent to secure any transmitted packet and protect users' privacy to ensure fairness in the energy market and combat any privacy issues that can expose the users' energy profile and hinder the deployment of autonomous vehicle networks (AVNs). In this research article, a lightweight privacy-aware power injection and communication (LPPC) scheme suitable for deployment over vehicular networks and 5G smart grid slice is proposed. In LPPC, each EV prepares its bids and computes two secret keys shared with the utility company and gateway to blind the bids for different time slots. A novel aggregation technique based on elliptic curve cryptography (ECC) is utilized to aggregate the blinded bids. A hash function-based technique which allows the utility company to verify the authenticity and integrity of the aggregated bid while concealing the individual bids is developed. We demonstrate the security of LPPC in the random oracle model based on the intractability of the computational Diffie-Hellman and Discrete Logarithm problems. Our analysis shows that LPPC can protect the individual bids and achieve secure vehicular communication. The performance evaluation shows that LPPC is much more efficient than the state-of-the-art schemes. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Techniques for detecting a vanishing point (VP) which estimates the direction of a vehicle by analyzing its relationship with surrounding objects have gained considerable attention recently. VPs can be used to support safe vehicle driving in areas such as for autonomous driving, lane-departure avoidance, distance estimation, and road-area detection, by detecting points in which parallel extension lines of objects are concentrated at a single point in a 3D space. In this paper, we proposed a method of detecting the VP in real time for applications to intelligent safe-driving support systems. In order to support safe driving of autonomous vehicles, it is necessary to drive the vehicle with the VP in center of the road image in order to prevent the vehicle from moving out of the road area while driving. Accordingly, in order to detect the VP in the road image, a method of detecting a point where straight lines intersect in an area where edge directional feature information is concentrated is required. The visual attention model and image segmentation process are applied to quickly identify candidate VPs in the area where the edge directional feature-information is concentrated and the intensity contrast difference is large. In the proposed method, VPs are detected by analyzing the edges, visual-attention regions, linear components using the Hough transform, and image segmentation results in an input image. Our experimental results have shown that the proposed method could be applied to safe-driving support systems.

TI A 3D Evaluation Method for Rail-Highway Hump Crossings
SO COMPUTER-AIDED CIVIL AND INFRASTRUCTURE ENGINEERING
LA English
DT Article
AB Rail-highway grade crossing crashes may be caused by long vehicles with low clearances becoming stranded when attempting to negotiate rail-highway crossings with steeply graded profiles-hump crossings. Although design standards have been established to encourage the construction that most vehicles are able to successfully navigate, the combination of grade profile and cross-section interacting with unique vehicle dimensions may lead to instances where vehicles may have difficulty crossing. This article describes a three-dimensional (3D)-based (LiDAR) methodology to identify and evaluate the severity of hump crossings. A five-level criterion is proposed to rate the magnitude of contact. The methodology is demonstrated by modeling seven common low-clearance vehicle types at three types of hump crossings. Field testing indicates a good correlation between the predicted degree of vehicle-crossing conflicts and those observed in the field. Results are applicable to operations (e.g., truck routing) or for maintenance and reconstruction programs. Future research could extend the methodology to tunnel and bridge clearances, real-time warning systems, autonomous vehicles, or even non-transportation applications.

DT Article

ID LATERAL CONTROL; DISTANCE
AB The vehicle-following concept has been widely used in several intelligent-vehicle applications. Adaptive cruise control systems, platooning systems, and systems for stop-and-go traffic employ this concept: The ego vehicle follows a leader vehicle at a certain distance. The vehicle-following concept comes to its limitations when obstacles interfere with the path between the ego vehicle and the leader vehicle. We call such situations dynamic driving situations. This paper introduces a planning and decision component to generalize vehicle following to situations with nonautomated interfering vehicles in mixed traffic. As a demonstrator, we employ a car that is able to navigate autonomously through regular traffic that is longitudinally and laterally guided by actuators controlled by a computer. This paper focuses on and limits itself to lateral control for collision avoidance. Previously, this autonomous-driving capability was purely based on the vehicle-following concept using vision. The path of the leader vehicle was tracked. To extend this capability to dynamic driving situations, a dynamic path-planning component is introduced. Several driving situations are identified that necessitate responses to more than the leader vehicle. We borrow an idea from robotics to solve the problem. Treat the path of the leader vehicle as an elastic band that is subjected to repelling forces of obstacles in the surroundings. This elastic-band framework offers the necessary features to cover dynamic driving situations. Simulation results show the power of this approach. Real-world results obtained with our demonstrator validate the simulation results.

AB The rapid development of green charging and refueling stations is vital for the widespread adoption of fuel cell electric vehicles and battery electric vehicles. This paper investigates the challenge of selecting the most optimal autonomous station design among various 100 % renewable-based options, considering techno-economic and socio-political factors. A globally applicable systematic framework is presented, encompassing 14 performance criteria, a microgrid optimization tool, and a hybrid multicriteria decision method. Focusing on the pressing needs of Karachi, Pakistan, the study showcases the application of the framework to evaluate 7 renewable-based autonomous designs. Among these, the photovoltaic and biogas generator-powered station emerges as the most optimal option for Karachi, with a levelized cost of energy (LCOE) of 0.31 $/kWh, levelized cost of hydrogen (LCOH) of 4.281 $/kg and payback period of 8.3 years. The optimal design avoids 2,455 tonnes of carbon dioxide (CO2)/year compared to the grid and 5,642 tonnes of CO2/year compared to diesel generators. When compared with the grid extension, the breakeven distance is found to be 4.6 km. Sensitivity analysis shows a 3.6 % decrease in LCOE and a 13.7 % decrease in LCOH with a 20 % increase in charging and refueling load, highlighting scalability benefits. This study contributes to various united nations' sustainability goals (7, 8, 9, 11, 12, 13), striving to provide a clear pathway for selecting optimal station designs.

ID NARRAGANSETT BAY; FLOW
AB An autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV), the U.S. Navy's Large Diameter Unmanned Underwater Vehicle (LDUUV), was used as a stable platform for rapid, repeated, near-synoptic CTD measurements of estuarine variability in Narragansett Bay. Surveys were made in lawnmower-like patterns at middepth to obtain horizontal profiles and maps, and in vertical yo-yo patterns to obtain vertical profiles. These observations were ground-truthed using standard CTDs on the fixed position of the launch cage and on ship-based surveys around the perimeter of the study area before and after the runs. For the horizontal surveys, a comparison of temperature and salinity time series from the LDUUV and the launch cage CTDs shows that differences are within the range of lateral variability around the study area observed at run depth from the ship. For the yo-yo surveys, a comparison of LDUUV CTD and standard CTD profiles shows indications of hysteresis in the vehicle-obtained data, which can be minimized with improved sampling techniques. Horizontal profiles and maps were obtained for a 2000 m x 300 m area, which was repeatedly sampled during 1994. An example of a time series from the vehicle shows three crossings of a salinity front with no significant temperature variability. Accompanying platform data show the effects of turns and speed changes on the data acquisition process. In the maps, temperature and salinity variability were observed with horizontal scales of order 100 m, finestructure advected by the tidal current. Temperature-salinity relationships in the AUV-derived data show unique differences related to seasonal changes in Narragansett Bay, including the winter-spring and the subsequent summer-fall transition of 1994. These measurements show the viability of the AUV as a unique tool for hydrographic characterization, under vehicle, environmental, and oceanographic constraints.

AB The rapid development of artificial intelligence, especially deep learning technology, has advanced autonomous driving systems (ADSs) by providing precise control decisions to counterpart almost any driving event, spanning from antifatigue safe driving to intelligent route planning. However, ADSs are still plagued by increasing threats from different attacks, which could be categorized into physical attacks, cyberattacks and learning-based adversarial attacks. Inevitably, the safety and security of deep learning-based autonomous driving are severely challenged by these attacks, from which the countermeasures should be analyzed and studied comprehensively to mitigate all potential risks. This survey provides a thorough analysis of different attacks that may jeopardize ADSs, as well as the corresponding state-of-the-art defense mechanisms. The analysis is unrolled by taking an in-depth overview of each step in the ADS workflow, covering adversarial attacks for various deep learning models and attacks in both physical and cyber context. Furthermore, some promising research directions are suggested in order to improve deep learning-based autonomous driving safety, including model robustness training, model testing and verification, and anomaly detection based on cloud/edge servers.

AB Specially arranged external stimuli or carefully designed geometry are often essential for realizing continuous autonomous motion of active structures without self-carried power. As a consequence, it is usually very challenging to further integrate those structures as active building blocks into a system with a complex form and multiple functions. In this letter, we report an autonomous motion of a surprisingly simple setup: a cylindrical elastomer rod on a flat hot surface or under homogeneous illumination of visible light. We further show that the rod can roll continuously without any sign of a pause after 6 h, if an obstacle is put in front of it. We demonstrate that such nonintuitive autonomous rolling results from a combination of large thermal actuation of the elastomer and heat transfer between the rod and its surroundings. Quantitative predictions of the rolling speed from the developed thermomechanics model agree reasonably well with experimental measurements. Using the autonomous rolling rods as main building blocks, we further design and fabricate a light-powered vehicle and a thermally powered conveyor for mass transport in both air and water environments.

AB Built-in autonomous stereo vision devices play a critical role in the autonomous docking instruments of space vehicles. Traditional stereo cameras for space autonomous docking use charge-coupled device (CCD) image sensors, and it is difficult for the overall size to be reduced due to the size of the CCD. In addition, only the few outermost elements of the camera lens use radiation-resistant optical glass material. In this paper, a complementary metal-oxide semiconductor (CMOS) device is used as the image sensor, and radiation-resistant optical glass material is introduced to all lens elements in order to make a compact and highly reliable space grade instrument. Despite the limited available material, a fixed focus module with 7 lens elements and overall length of 42 mm has been achieved, while meeting all the required performance demands for the final vision-guided docking process.

AB An accurate vehicle trajectory prediction promotes understanding of the traffic environment and enables task criticality assessment in advanced driver assistance systems (ADASs) in autonomous vehicles and intelligent connected vehicles. Nevertheless, conventional prediction models are characterized by low prediction accuracy, the inability of long-term prediction, and a single-road section adaptation. To tackle these limitations, this study proposes a trajectory prediction model based on a deep encoder-decoder and a deep neural network (DNN). One modification included introducing an attention mechanism into the traditional encoder-decoder framework. Overall, 1794,1400,2100 trajectory samples from highways, intersections, and roundabouts are used to train the proposed framework and obtain optimal deep encoder-decoder architectures for different road section types. Since the experiments revealed no significant advantages of using the attention mechanism in deep encoder-decoder, the mechanism is not included in the optimal architecture. Next, to achieve higher prediction accuracy and better longterm prediction capability, different DNN structures are tested as trajectory correction networks, and the optimal DNN structure is selected. Finally, the experiments are conducted using the proposed deep encoder-decoder framework and the optimal DNN. The results show that the proposed model reaches 92.87%, 86.65%, and 89.15% average trajectory fit ratio (TFR) on a highway, intersection, and a roundabout, respectively. Therefore, the model enables accurate long-term predictions of vehicle trajectories in these road segments. The proposed model and presented results provide a basis for ADASs' trajectory prediction algorithms. (c) 2022 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Traditional methods for ocean observation are often inadequate for detecting large-scale biogeochemical processes. This Perspective discusses the advantages of implementing autonomous observation platforms in complementing traditional observation methods and generating global biogeochemical data sets.
   Human activities have altered the state of the ocean, leading to warming, acidification and deoxygenation. These changes impact ocean biogeochemistry and influence ecosystem functions and ocean health. The long-term global effects of these changes are difficult to predict using current satellite sensing and traditional in situ observation techniques. Autonomous platforms equipped with biogeochemical sensors allow for the observation of marine biogeochemical processes and ecosystem dynamics, covering a wide range of spatial and temporal scales. The international Biogeochemical-Argo (BGC-Argo) project is currently building a global, multidisciplinary ocean-observing network of autonomous Argo floats equipped with an extensive range of biogeochemical sensors. Other autonomous platforms, such as gliders and surface vehicles, have also incorporated such sensors, mainly operating on regional scales and near the ocean surface. Autonomous mobile assets, along with remotely sensed data, will provide the 4D information required to improve model simulations and forecasts of ocean conditions and ecosystem health.

AB Federated learning using fog computing can suffer from the dynamic behavior of some of the participants in its training process, especially in Internet-of-Vehicles where vehicles are the targeted participants. For instance, the fog might not be able to cope with the vehicles' demands in some areas due to resource shortages when the vehicles gather for events, or due to traffic congestion. Moreover, the vehicles are exposed to unintentionally leaving the fog coverage area which can result in the task being dropped as the communications between the server and the vehicles weaken. The aforementioned limitations can affect the federated learning model accuracy for critical applications, such as autonomous driving, where the model inference could influence road safety. Recent works in the literature have addressed some of these problems through active sampling techniques, however, they suffer from many complications in terms of stability, scalability, and efficiency of managing the available resources. To address these limitations, we propose a horizontal-based federated learning architecture, empowered by fog federations, devised for the mobile environment. In our architecture, fog computing providers form stable fog federations using a Hedonic game-theoretical model to expand their geographical footprints. Hence, providers belonging to the same federations can migrate services upon demand in order to cope with the federated learning requirements in an adaptive fashion. We conduct the experiments using a road traffic signs dataset modeled with intermodal traffic systems. The simulation results show that the proposed model can achieve better accuracy and quality of service than other models presented in the literature.

AB In recent days, an unrivaled proliferation of autonomous driving becomes an active area of research in the field of smart city applications. Millions of autonomous cars emerge as ubiquitous in smart cities in the foreseeable future. Vehicle detection and tracking is one of the important cases in smart city applications. It clarifies that the efficient scene parsing methods will be a huge potential. There were several traditional methods employed for the detection of object for the purpose of vehicle detection and road segmentation. However, there were some drawbacks such as reduced rate of detection accuracy, improper road segmentations, and missing detections of occluded objects exist. To overcome the existing issues, we propose an effective multi focus object detector (MFOD) that retrieves spatiotemporal data and considers multiple cues of an object for detection and tracking. The proposed MFOD performs lane detection, vehicle detection, and tracking. To accomplish this task, modified Hough transform is proposed for lane detection and road segmentation. Residual attention unit (RAU) with shared convolutional neural network layers is deployed for vehicle detection and tracking. It makes use of motion model to update the network and creates visualization map to explore the visibility of occluded objects and spatial attention map for accurate prediction of object location. The proposed MFOD is also extended for scene parsing task. We performed extensive analysis of the proposed MFOD with standard evaluation metrics on two different datasets, such as KITTI for object detection and tracking task and cityscapes for scene parsing task. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed MFOD achieves 3% to 4% improvement compared with the existing methods. (c) 2023 Society of Photo-Optical Instrumentation Engineers (SPIE)

AB Cellular vehicle-to-everything (C-V2X) has been gaining momentum due to its advantages on vehicle safety, autonomous driving, and modern intelligent driving experience. Faced with these features, we introduce a novel C-V2X framework based on network slicing and spatial reuse, which supports simultaneous transmissions for both ultra-reliable low-latency communication (URLLC) and enhanced mobile broadband (eMBB) services. We adopt the punctured scheduling for arriving URLLC packets and propose a matching and replacement strategy with the consideration of tailored on-demand service requirements. Numerical results demonstrate the feasibility of our proposed mechanism.

AB Safety evaluation method for the intersection forward collision-avoidance assist (I-FCA) function is presented in this work. The I-FCA function can prevent traffic accidents in intersections by applying warning and brake when the radar and vision sensor can detect risk of collision. To specify safety evaluation, the actual vehicle tests are conducted. For ensuring repeatability and safety probability, a low-profile robot was used for the tests. Straight crossing path scenario at intersection is established by using NCAP and NHTSA studies. By using actual vehicle test data for the straight crossing path situation, the I-FCA operation boundary condition is suggested.

AB This study presents a Rao-Blackwellised particle filter (RBPF)-based encoder/inertial navigation system (INS)/global navigation satellite system (GNSS) integration method for improving the navigation performance of an autonomous land vehicle (ALV) with wheel slipping. In contrast to traditional integration methods, the proposed integration method introduces an overall wheel slip consideration for the ALV, which greatly improves the accuracy of the velocity estimation, especially when the inertial sensor is low cost. Additionally, the proposed integrated system uses double-difference pseudorange measurements instead of single point positioning results provided by low-cost GNSS receivers, which greatly improves the accuracy of the position estimation. To verify the navigation performance of the proposed integrated system, comparisons between the states estimated by the proposed system, the EKF-based integrated system and the joint wheel-slip and motion-estimation system are provided. The results of the experiment show that the proposed integrated system has the highest accuracy in both the position estimation and the velocity estimation among the three compared systems, and can improve the navigation performance during GNSS signals outages.

AB This paper focuses on platoon control of autonomous vehicles (AVs) equipped with V2X technology and the phenomenon that the large platoons are split into multiple sub-platoons due to the communication restrictions. At the same time, with the popularity of AVs and connected humandriven vehicles (CVs), this paper also carries out the research of mixed traffic flow mixed with AV platoons, CVs and regular human-driving vehicles (RVs). According to the characteristics of the different types of vehicles, this paper extends the corresponding car-following models based on intelligent driver model (IDM), and considers the functional degradation of AVs under different car-following modes. In this paper, the AVs are classified into the second-level degenerated AV (D2AV), the first-level degenerated AV (D1AV) and the normal functioning AV (NAV) based on the differences in car-following modes. The degradation of AVs is represented via the change of communication topologies and models. Linear stability analysis is conducted. Numerical simulation shows that the higher level of AV degradation, the worse the stability of traffic flow. Under the same conditions, the more sub-platoons and the larger maximum size of sub-platoons, the better the stability of the traffic flow. The increase in communication strength of AVs is also beneficial to stability of traffic flow. In order to compensate for degradation, an adaptive gain feedback control strategy is proposed. Simulation shows that the adaptive gain feedback strategy can effectively improve the ability of the traffic flow to resist disturbances, reduce the fluctuations of velocity and acceleration, and contribute to the stability of platoon system and traffic flow.

AB To reduce the communication burden and enhance the data processing capability of the multiple unmanned underwater vehicle (multi-UUV) recovery system, a distributed event-triggered multi-UUV coordinated control method under time-delay conditions is proposed. The multi-UUV recovery problem can be transferred into a leader-following consensus problem. For each UUV to be recovered, the controller updates depend on its own trigger function. Also, sufficient conditions and boundary conditions on leader-following consensus are presented, respectively. The simulation results show that the proposed controller is effective, robust, and energyefficient for the multi-UUV recovery system.

AB Because operational environments change over time and technology upgrades are common in fleets of ground vehicles, a large number of vehicles quickly become obsolete. A possible solution is to develop fleets of modular vehicles, which are built with interchangeable components, i.e. modules. This paper evaluates the performance of a future reconfigurable and autonomous vehicle fleet in a high fidelity military operation scenario. The military fleet operates in a hostile environment under a high risk of damage and needs to react to adversarial actions in real-time. The operation decisions are numerous including vehicle reconfiguration, relocation, damage recovery, and dispatch decisions. Given the limited resources and time delays in the operation, decision effectiveness and foresightedness are necessities, which require a good understanding of the adversary, close collaboration among commanders, and breaking of the equilibrium between adversaries. To capture these characteristics, we formulate an intelligent agent-based model for the decision-making process during fleet operations by combining real-time optimization with artificial intelligence. With continuous updating of learning models, the intelligent agents refine their decisions during interactions with the environment and other agents, and evolve their competition strategies according to adversarial historical behaviors. With the same level of resources, the conventional fleet wins when the dispatch decisions are stochastic. However, once each fleets start to learn from each other's behavior, the modular fleet outperforms the conventional fleet. The strategic and operational benefits of fleet modularity are revealed and discussed in terms of win rate, adaptability, unpredictability and damage recovery. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V.

AB We consider the problem in which a supervisor or remote pilot provides a real-time linear velocity reference to a multirotor aerial robot, either through a traditional remote control handset, a modern haptic interface, or semi-autonomous guidance control system. In all such cases, the goal is to servo-control the vehicle's velocity to the set point as quickly and as efficiently as possible. The challenge is to achieve this robustly in the presence of unknown wind disturbances and in situations in which the vehicle moves into global position system (GPS) denied environments (indoors, urban canyons, forests) where estimation of the vehicle's velocity is challenging. These situations include unclutterred environments, poor visibility environments caused by poor lighting, and poorly textured visual environments where laser-and vision-based sensors become unreliable. The approach taken is to develop a coupled nonlinear complementary velocity aided attitude filter that provides estimates of both the inertial and body-fixed frame linear velocities, as well as the attitude of a multirotor aerial vehicle, that functions effectively even when only the inertial measurement unit and barometric sensor measurements are available. When full inertial velocity measurements are available (from GPS, Vicon, or a vision system), the filter additionally estimates the external wind speed. In this paper, we formally present the proposed filter along with experimental results and a comparison of the filter to recent results in the literature and in situations in which inertial reference frame velocities are available intermittently. The proposed filter is computationally simple to implement, easy to calibrate and tune, and provides an excellent base level functionality for modern multirotor aerial robotic systems that will be required to function robustly in a variety of environments.

AB Safety evaluation is a critical aspect through the future stages of automation development. Since there is a lack of historical and generalizable safety data in high levels of Connected and Autonomous Vehicles (CAVs), a possible approach to follow is the microscopic simulation method. Through microsimulation, vehicle trajectories are able to be exported and traffic conflicts to be identified using the Surrogate Safety Assessment Model (SSAM). Therefore, it is crucial to develop techniques in order to analyze conflict data extracted from microsimulation and evaluate crash data aiming to support road safety applications of automation technologies. This paper attempts to propose a safety evaluation approach for estimating crash rate of CAVs through microsimulation. For this purpose, the city center of Athens (Greece) was modelled using the Aimsun Next software paying attention to the calibration and validation of the model using real data of traffic characteristics. Moreover, different scenarios were formulated concerning different market penetration rates (MPRs) of CAVs and two fully automated gen-erations (1st and 2nd generation) were simulated for modelling them. Subsequently, the SSAM software was used in order traffic conflicts to be identified and then converted to crash rate. Analysis of the outputs along with traffic data and network geometry characteristics were then conducted. The results indicated that in higher CAV MPRs, crash rates will be significantly lower as well as when the following-vehicle in the occurred conflict is a 2nd generation CAV. Lane change conflicts caused the highest crash rates compared to rear-end conflicts, which presented the lowest rates.

AB While collisions and groundings still represent the most important source of accidents involving ships, autonomous vessels are a central topic in current research. When dealing with autonomous ships, collision avoidance and compliance with COLREG regulations are major vital points. However, most state-of-the-art literature focuses on offline path optimisation while neglecting many crucial aspects of dealing with real-time applications on vessels. In the framework of the proposed motion-planning, navigation and control architecture, this paper mainly focused on optimal path planning for marine vessels in the perspective of real-time applications. An RRT*-based optimal path-planning algorithm was proposed, and collision avoidance, compliance with COLREG regulations, path feasibility and optimality were discussed in detail. The proposed approach was then implemented and integrated with a guidance and control system. Tests on a high-fidelity simulation platform were carried out to assess the potential benefits brought to autonomous navigation. The tests featured real-time simulation, restricted and open-water navigation and dynamic scenarios with both moving and fixed obstacles.

AB Accurate and reliable prediction of future motions of the nearby agents and effective environment understanding will contribute to high-quality and meticulous path planning for the automated vehicles under uncertainty and guarantee traffic safety for future real-world deployments. This task becomes more challenging in highly dynamic and complex scenarios such as unsignalized intersections where no lights exist to control vehicles behavior, or there are not multiple lines for the vehicles to anticipate drivers' future intentions based on the lane in which they are driving. In this study, we introduce a novel deep learning-based methodology to anticipate vehicles path at unsignalized intersections. The method provides multimodal outputs to take into account the inherited uncertainty and multimodality nature of vehicles behavior. Our proposed model works based on dilated convolutional networks in combination with a mixture density layer. We then cluster various existing mixes into possible paths that are ranked based on probability. We assess the performance and generalization capability of our vehicle path prediction model using several metrics over a large naturalistic dataset containing more than 23800 vehicle trajectories. The obtained results reveal the higher performance of our path prediction approach compared with several baselines and benchmarks.

AB Automated vehicles (AVs) may have broad uses in society, but some applications may be more acceptable than others. Determining contexts in which AVs can acceptably operate is a substantial challenge for policy makers. In an online YouGov survey (N = 1175) with text-and-image vignettes of a one-or three-lane road section, AV convoys that shared lanes with a normal vehicle were perceived less positively and led to greater blame toward their owning institutions than lone AVs. AVs affiliated with a private commercial company were perceived less positively than those affiliated with a public transit agency. AVs used to regulate traffic of the vehicles behind them were blamed more than AVs used to navigate through traffic to reach a destination. These results suggest that numerical balance, vehicle affiliation and intended purpose are aspects of future AV policies for mixed traffic in shared lanes that will influence people's impressions of automated vehicles on public roads.

AB Visual-based vehicle detection has been extensively applied for autonomous driving systems and advanced driving assistant systems, however, it faces great challenges as a partial observation regularly happens owing to occlusion from infrastructure or dynamic objects or a limited vision field. This paper presents a two-stage detector based on Faster R-CNN for high occluded vehicle detection, in which we integrate a part-aware region proposal network to sense global and local visual knowledge among different vehicle attributes. That entails the model simultaneously generating partial-level proposals and instance-level proposals at the first stage. Then, different parts belong to the same vehicle are encoded and reconfigured into a compositional entire proposal through a part affinity fields, allowing the model to generate integral candidates and mitigate the impact of occlusion challenge to the utmost extent. Extensive experiments conducted on KITTI benchmark exhibit that our method outperforms most machine-learning-based vehicle detection methods and achieves high recall in the severely occluded application scenario.

AB A teleoperation system for a hydro-static transmission (HST) drive crawler-type robotic vehicle is described in this paper. The system was developed to satisfy the needs of various farm operations and teleoperation in unknown agricultural fields. The controller has a layered architecture and supports two degrees of cooperation between the operator and robot, direct and supervisory control. The vehicle can travel autonomously by using an RTK-GPS and a fiber-optic gyroscope during supervisory control, and the operator interface also provides a field navigator based on Google Map technology. The vehicle's position and heading direction was capable of 1 Hz update using precise satellite image maps. The results of field tests using direct control showed that it is difficult for the operator to control the movement of the vehicle along the target lines. On the other hand, the vehicle could travel in a straight line with a maximum lateral error of 0.3 m by using supervisory control. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Model Predictive Controller (MPC) is widely used as a technique for path tracking control since it allows for dealing with system constraints and future forecasts. However, the performance of MPC is directly affected by the adopted model. A complex dynamic model can guarantee accuracy in path tracking but may not be suitable in computational terms. On the other hand, a simplified model may not capture essential nonlinear aspects. Thus, to cope with these problems, this paper deals with data-driven tire modeling to improve autonomous ground vehicle path tracking control. The main contribution of the present work is to show that neural tires can capture the nonlinearities present in the interaction between lateral and longitudinal vehicle dynamics, with a reduced computational cost for predictive controllers. Simulated and experimental tire data are approximate to design data-driven tire models using radial basis function and multilayer perceptron neural networks. Then, based on ground vehicles with neural tires, model predictive controllers are designed to regulate wheel torque and steering angle inputs. Comparative tests were conducted to compare the proposed data-driven MPC approach with the classical nonlinear MPC controller. The results show that the neural tires approximate nonlinear tire models and experimental data with arbitrary precision in terms of accuracy and error-based metrics. The proposed methodology was successfully applied to perform trajectory and velocity tracking of ground vehicles. In addition, MPC with a neural tire model as prediction inference reduces the computational effort compared to traditional approaches.

AB We derive optimal control policies for a Connected Automated Vehicle (CAV) cooperating with neighboring CAVs in order to implement a lane change maneuver consisting of a longitudinal phase where the CAV properly positions itself relative to the cooperating neighbors and a lateral phase where it safely changes lanes. For the first phase, we optimize the maneuver time subject to safety constraints and subsequently minimize the associated surrogate energy consumption of all cooperating vehicles in this maneuver. For the second phase, we jointly optimize time and energy approximation and provide three different solution methods including a real-time approach based on Control Barrier Functions (CBFs). We prove structural properties of the optimal policies which simplify the solution derivations and, in the case of the longitudinal maneuver, lead to analytical optimal control expressions. The solutions, when they exist, are guaranteed to satisfy safety constraints for all vehicles involved in the maneuver. Simulation results where the controllers are implemented show their effectiveness in terms of significant performance improvements compared to maneuvers performed by human-driven vehicles.

AB Connected and autonomous vehicles (CAVs) have situational awareness that can be exploited for optimal power and thermal management. In this article, we develop a hierarchical model predictive control (H-MPC) strategy for eco-cooling of CAVs, which reduces energy consumption through real-time prediction and multi-timescale and multi-layer optimization. The application of the proposed H-MPC is studied for battery thermal and energy management of an electric vehicle (EV). Our H-MPC approach addresses the uncertainty in the long-term preview of the vehicle speed through robust constraint handling to prevent constraint violation. The simulation results show that compared with a conventional battery thermal management (BTM) strategy, the proposed robust H-MPC saves the battery energy by up to 5.4% under the uncertainties in the long-term vehicle speed predictions in an urban CAV operation scenario.

AB Automatic guidance systems and autonomous vehicles require tested methods of path generation to ensure successful maneuvers (such as automatic trajectory correction and headland turn management). In this study, an evolution of Zakin's kinematic modeling, as applied in the automobile industry, is proposed for an agricultural poly-articulated vehicle (representing a tractor or other type of towing vehicle with one or more towed implements attached with an articulated hitch). Geometry, vehicle ground speed, and angular steering velocity are considered in the generation of maneuvering paths. Based on the specifics of real field conditions (slope, plant residue, resistance due to soil compaction, etc.), the initial model was improved by introducing correction coefficients. An experimental setup is proposed using a tractor with two towed implements and a testing method involving point-to-point path comparison. The modeling method has potential for integrating more complex procedures (such as path generation, geolocation, and following) into the design of a maneuvering management system for agricultural machines, which can contribute to the efficiency of field operations.

AB The efficiency of the continuously variable transmission (CVT) is within 70-95%, so the effects on the fuel consumption cannot be ignored. In this paper, we first analyze the quantitative relationship between the running states of inertial combustion engine with CVT and the fuel consumption, and then propose a fuel-optimal driving strategy for a vehicle with CVT. In the strategy, the vehicle speed and acceleration, the engine torque and speed, and the CVT ratio in the processes of acceleration, uniform motion and deceleration are calculated. The numerical results show that when the driving distance is less than a critical value, this vehicle experiences an acceleration-deceleration process, otherwise this vehicle experiences an acceleration-constant-deceleration process. The results can provide a fuel-optimal strategy for a vehicle under different driving distance, which can be used to the human driving guidance, the driving assistance system and the autonomous vehicles.

   Acoustic Doppler Current Profiler (ADCP); Velocity profile; Riverine;

AB Autonomous vehicles (AVs) are commonly used in oceanic and more recently estuarine and riverine environments because they are small, versatile, efficient, moving platforms equipped with a suite of instruments for measuring environmental conditions. However, moving vessel observations, particularly those associated with Acoustic Doppler Current Profiler (ADCP) measurements, can be problematic owing to instrument noise, flow fluctuations, and spatial variability. A range of ADCPs manufactured by different companies were integrated on to an Unmanned Surface Vehicle (USV), an Unmanned Underwater Vehicle (UUV), and some additional stationary platforms and were deployed in a number of natural riverine and estuarine environments to evaluate the quality of the velocity profile over the depth, minimum averaging time interval requirements, and AV mission planning considerations. Measurements were obtained at fixed locations to eliminate any spatial variations in the mean flow characteristics. The USV has the unique capability to station-keep to within 1 m owing to its dual-propeller design, providing the best setup for spatially mapping velocity profiles. Single-propeller UUVs can perform a quasi-station-keeping (<10 m) operation, but are designed for traveling underwater at speeds >1 m/s. An appropriate averaging window, T-*, was determined using the Kalman Algorithm with a Kalman gain equal to 1%. T-* was found to be independent of depth, flow velocity, and environment. There was no correlation (R-2 = 0.18) for T-* between flow magnitude and direction. Results from all measurements had a similar T-* of approximately 3 min. Based on this, an averaging window of 4 min is conservatively suggested to obtain a statistically confident measure of the mean velocity profile.

AB Object detection for autonomous driving in smart transportation systems requires comprehensive consideration of accuracy, speed and sensitivity for detecting multi-objects. The one-stage algorithm, Single Shot MultiBox Detector (SSD), can basically satisfy the above requirements. However, there are still rooms for improvement of the overall precision due to its dissatisfactory detection rate of small objects, which are abundant in autonomous driving scenarios. In order to solve the inherent defect problem of one-stage algorithm in processing the extreme foreground-background class imbalance encountered during training of dense detectors, we propose a Balanced Atrous Net (BANet) to significantly improve the performance of the SSD for autonomous driving. The BANet combines the atrous convolution and the feature fusion to improve the network structure of the SSD, thereby expanding receptive field and enriching semantic information in shallow layers. Meanwhile, a new loss that alleviates the class imbalance is designed to replace the standard cross entropy loss in the original algorithm. The experimental results show that the BANet outperforms the original SSD in mAP on KITTI with a relatively high speed retained.

The kinematic analysis of bioinspired long-fin propulsion is conducted, and the maximum thrust of this propulsion derived from our thrust measurement platform can be up to 25 N. Bioinspired long-fin propulsion is introduced to construct the BUVMS for inspection and manipulation tasks, and the system architecture of the BUVMS is described. Moreover, real-time dynamic dubins-helix path planning and tracking of the biomimetic vehicle are proposed to realize the arrival of the desired pose. The tracking error is less than 0.23 body length. Finally, coordinated control between the biomimetic vehicle and the manipulator is developed to achieve autonomous manipulation. The reaction of the manipulator served as feedforward compensation is added into the closed-loop control of the biomimetic vehicle. The experimental results are provided to illustrate the validity of the proposed methods.

AB Last-mile delivery with autonomous robots launched from dedicated delivery trucks is a promising ap-proach to reducing logistics costs and inner-city traffic. Current literature for this innovative concept bases upon the use of a single truck to pick up multiple robots from robot depots and release them for delivery. This limits the practical use for industry applications in bigger cities. The demand for home deliveries is steadily increasing, and with that, the requirements for potential delivery by robots. The truck-and-robot concept therefore needs to be refined to meet these requirements by a fleet of delivery trucks.We generalize the truck-and-robot delivery with robot depots for the simultaneous routing of multiple trucks. This means that a fleet of trucks is available, and customer orders and robot deliveries must be assigned to delivery tours. We formulate this problem as multi-vehicle truck-and-robot routing problem . This extension includes routing multiple trucks and the corresponding clustering decisions while choos-ing the optimal drop-off points for robots and their delivery. We develop a tailored heuristic solution approach based on a novel neighborhood search, the Set Improvement Neighborhood Search (SINS). We show that transportation costs can be reduced by up to 24% using our integrated multi-vehicle routing and robot scheduling approach compared to a sequential cluster-first-route-second approach. Comple-mentary experiments show a 62% savings potential compared to conventional truck delivery. We derive structural insights into the novel delivery system by analyzing the impact of changing customer distribu-tions, delivery time windows, and truck or robot availability.& COPY; 2023 Elsevier B.V.

How should these systems be designed and integrated into the modern automobile? What are the needed functions, key architectural elements and their relationships? We created a reference architecture that systematically answers these questions and validated it in real world usage scenarios. Key findings concern required services and enabling them via the architecture. We present the reference architecture and discuss how it can influence the design and implementation of such features in automotive systems. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB For enhancing the intelligence of urban traffic, connected automated vehicle (CAV) is recognised as the leading technology in the near future. With on-board sensors and communication devices, status of the vehicles can be obtained to better coordinate the traffic. However, the limited environmental perception range cannot lead to the best efficiency of the global urban traffic. In this study, a three-step evolution strategy of the CAV perception mode is proposed, from autonomous perception to interactive perception to networked perception. Key technologies in these three steps are studied. In autonomous perception, vehicle positioning and dynamic target tracking approaches are proposed. In interactive perception, a reliable multi-mode information exchange mechanism is studied. Finally, a new traffic big data storage and advanced analytics solution in networked perception is introduced. Related experiments about the above key issues are designed, implemented, and verified based on the hardware platform, open source dataset, and cloud platform, respectively. The results show that the positioning distance root mean square achieves 3.9m, object tracking speed reaches 30fps, and communication average packet loss rate is 2%. As can be seen from testing and simulation results, our proposed approaches can meet technical requirements and support environment perception mode evolution of CAV.

AB In this paper, we describe how vehicle systems and the vehicle motion control are affected by automated driving on public roads. We describe the redundancy needed for a road vehicle to meet certain safety goals. The concept of system safety as well as system solutions to fault tolerant actuation of steering and braking and the associated fault tolerant power supply is described. Notably restriction of the operational domain in case of reduced capability of the driving automation system is discussed. Further we consider path tracking, state estimation of vehicle motion control required for automated driving as well as an example of a minimum risk manoeuver and redundant steering by means of differential braking. The steering by differential braking could offer heterogeneous or dissimilar redundancy that complements the redundancy of described fault tolerant steering systems for driving automation equipped vehicles. Finally, the important topic of verification of driving automation systems is addressed.

ID MULTIPLE-TARGET TRACKING; UNSCENTED KALMAN
AB Precise and accurate localization is important for safe autonomous driving. Given a traffic scenario which has multiple vehicles equipped with internal sensors for self-localization, and external sensors from the infrastructure for vehicle localization, vehicle-infrastructure communication can be used to improve the accuracy and precision of localization. However, as the number of vehicles in a scenario increases, associating measurement data with the correct source becomes increasingly challenging. We propose a solution utilizing the symmetric measurement equation filter (SME) for cooperative localization to address data association issue, as it does not require an enumeration of measurement-to-target associations. The principal idea is to define a symmetrical transformation which maps measurements to a homogeneous function, thereby effectively addressing several challenges in vehicle-infrastructure scenarios such as data association, bandwidth limitations and registration/configuration of the external sensor. To the best of our knowledge, the proposed solution is among the first to address all these issues of cooperative localization simultaneously, by utilizing the topology information of the vehicles.

AB Pedestrian deaths account for the highest percentage of fatality caused by traffic accidents in Japan. Increasing pedestrian safety is a key objective for reducing such deaths. For pedestrian fatality caused by vehicles at low speed, turning the vehicle toward the right was the most common behavior under left-hand traffic. Autonomous emergency braking (AEB) systems for pedestrian safety have great potential to mitigate pedestrian injuries and fatalities in traffic accidents. However, pedestrian-AEB systems, especially for vehicles turning right, are still under development. This study identified the characteristics of dangerous traffic scenarios between vehicles turning right and pedestrians, focusing on two directions of pedestrian crossing: from the left to the right side (Left-Pedestrian) and from the right to the left side (Right-Pedestrian). The ego vehicle recorded near-miss incidents using a drive recorder. The results revealed that the Left-Pedestrian and Right-Pedestrian scenarios had different features for both the width of roads going to and through the intersection and the average of the travel speeds of the ego vehicles. They had similar characteristics in terms of the presence of other vehicle categories, but differences in the relationship of numbers and/or travel directions of other vehicles. The findings of this study will contribute to the development and evaluation of safety systems for preventing collisions between right-turning vehicles and pedestrians at intersections.

AB With the vigorous development of automobile industry, in-vehicle network is also constantly upgraded to meet data transmission requirements of emerging applications. The main transmission requirements are low latency and certainty especially for autonomous driving. Time sensitive networking (TSN) based on Ethernet gives a possible solution to these requirements. Previous surveys usually investigated TSN from a general perspective, which referred to TSN of various application fields. In this paper, we focus on the application of TSN to the in-vehicle networks. For in-vehicle networks, we discuss all related TSN standards specified by IEEE 802.1 work group up to now. We further overview and analyze recent literature on various aspects of TSN for automotive applications, including synchronization, resource reservation, scheduling, certainty, software and hardware. Application scenarios of TSN for in-vehicle networks are analyzed one by one. Since TSN of in-vehicle network is still at a very initial stage, this paper also gives insights on open issues, future research directions and possible solutions.

AB This paper investigates connected cruise control (CCC) based on the deep reinforcement learning algorithm to mitigate oscillations and improve traffic safety in stop-and-go waves. A proximal policy optimization (PPO)-based control strategy is proposed for connected and autonomous vehicles (CAVs) in a heterogeneous longitudinal car-following platoon. The method receives the velocity and position signals of n human-driven vehicles ahead through wireless vehicle-to-vehicle communication to obtain an appropriate driving behavior and improve traffic efficiency and safety in real-time. The effectiveness and advantage of the proposed strategy are verified by using traffic simulation software (Simulation of Urban Mobility) for two simulation scenarios of trajectory curves with noticeable acceleration changes of the leading vehicle and two sections of actual traffic speed data. The results show that the proposed PPO-CCC method can successfully suppress the speed oscillations and improve the travel efficiency of CAVs in the car platoon.

AB As the need for autonomous reconnaissance and surveillance missions in cluttered urban environments has been increasing, this paper describes a cooperative path planning algorithm for tracking a moving target in urban environments using both unmanned air vehicles (UAVs) and unmanned ground vehicles (UGVs). The novelty of the algorithm is that it takes into account vision occlusions due to obstacles in the environment. The algorithm uses a dynamic occupancy grid to model the target state, which is updated by sensor measurements using a Bayesian filter. Based on the current and predicted target behavior, the path planning algorithm for a single vehicle (UAV/UGV) is first designed to maximize the sum of the probability of detection over a finite look-ahead horizon. The algorithm is then extended to multiple vehicle collaboration scenarios, where a decentralized planning algorithm relying on an auction scheme is designed to plan finite look-ahead paths that maximize the sum of the joint probability of detection over all vehicles.

AB The key advantage of unmanned swarm operation is its autonomous cooperation. How to improve the proportion of cooperators is one of the key issues of autonomous collaboration in unmanned swarm operations. This work proposes a strategy dominance mechanism of autonomous collaboration in unmanned swarm within the framework of public goods game. It starts with the requirement analysis of autonomous collaboration in unmanned swarm; and an aspiration-driven multiplayer evolutionary game model is established based on the requirement. Then the average abundance function and strategy dominance condition of the model are constructed by theoretical derivation. Furthermore, the evolutionary mechanism of parameter adjustment in swarm cooperation is revealed via simulation, and the influences of the multiplication factor r, aspiration level a, threshold $m$ and other parameters on the strategy dominance conditions were simulated for both linear and threshold public goods games (PGGs) to determine the strategy dominance characteristics; Finally, deliberate proposals are suggested to provide a meaningful exploration in the actual control of unmanned swarm cooperation.

AB In this paper, we propose a deep learning-based perception method in autonomous driving systems using a Light Detection and Ranging(LiDAR) point cloud data, which is called a simultaneous segmentation and detection network (SSADNet). SSADNet can be used to recognize both drivable areas and obstacles, which is necessary for autonomous driving. Unlike the previous methods, where separate networks were needed for segmentation and detection, SSADNet can perform segmentation and detection simultaneously based on a single neural network. The proposed method uses point cloud data obtained from a 3D LiDAR for network input to generate a top view image consisting of three channels of distance, height, and reflection intensity. The structure of the proposed network includes a branch for segmentation and a branch for detection as well as a bridge connecting the two parts. The KITTI dataset, which is often used for experiments on autonomous driving, was used for training. The experimental results show that segmentation and detection can be performed simultaneously for drivable areas and vehicles at a quick inference speed, which is appropriate for autonomous driving systems.

AB This paper presents computational and experimental studies of an Autonomous Underwater Vehicle (AUV) undergoing prescribed lateral and angular acceleration manoeuvres (pure sway and pure yaw). The Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) modelling is based on the Unsteady Reynolds-averaged Navier-Stokes (URANS) equations with the use of a hybrid meshing scheme through systematic grid refinement. The obtained CFD predictions were validated through Experimental Fluid Dynamics (EFD) utilising a captive model fitted to a Horizontal Planar Motion Mechanism (HPMM). The present investigation will contribute to the identification of force and moment coefficients for the development of control system algorithms for underwater vehicles.

AB In this paper, we address the problem of localizing extrema points and iso-contours of ambient environmental fields (specifically, ocean bottom landscape and underwater plumes) using a networked formation of autonomous underwater vehicles. We propose the use of the Nelder-Mead extension to the basic simplex nonlinear optimization algorithm. In these robust gradient-free strategies, decisions are solely made based on field values measured by the individual vehicles, while measurements are fused and actions decided according to the algorithm. A main goal of this paper is to trigger interest in direct search methods as pertains to this type of robotic problem.

AB High Definition (HD) maps are becoming key elements of the autonomous driving because they can provide information about the surrounding environment of the autonomous car without being affected by the real-time perception limit. To provide the most recent environmental information to the autonomous driving system, the HD map must maintain up-to-date data by updating changes in the real world. This paper presents a simultaneous localization and map change update (SLAMCU) algorithm to detect and update the HD map changes. A Dempster-Shafer evidence theory is applied to infer the HD map changes based on the evaluation of the HD map feature existence. A Rao-Blackwellized particle filter (RBPF) approach is used to concurrently estimate the vehicle position and update the new map state. The detected and updated map changes by the SLAMCU are reported to the HD map database in order to reflect the changes to the HD map and share the changing information with the other autonomous cars. The SLAMCU was evaluated through experiments using the HD map of traffic signs in the real traffic conditions.

ID TIME CONSENSUS TRACKING
AB This article investigates a fixed-time simultaneous arrival (FTSA) problem in terms of the equilibrium of path lengths of unmanned vehicles. A novel trajectory elliptical homotopy method (TEHM) is designed to solve the FTSA problem of unmanned vehicles in a multi-objective constrained environment. Considering the constraints of obstacle avoidance and kinematics of unmanned vehicles, the trajectories elliptical homotopy is selected for path planning. The obtained trajectory homotopy guarantees obstacle avoidance and motion stability at the same time. To handle the non-cooperative and dynamic obstacle avoidance, a trajectory elliptical homotopy decomposition (TEHD) algorithm is proposed with an FTSA constraint. Based on the TEHM and TEHD, a multiple unmanned vehicle fixed-time regular-triangle formation algorithm is designed and implemented on real vehicles. Simulations and experiments validate the performance of the proposed methods and show how fixed-time arrival formation under obstacles and kinematic constraints was obtained.

AB Autonomous cars are undergoing rapid development. In order to gain acceptance and adoption, there is a need to understand how users will respond to the technology, and what possible benefits or difficulties they perceive. A prerequisite for eliciting this information is the involvement of users. Having said that, several studies have demonstrated the problems associated with investigating the future'. In a pilot study, two different qualitative approaches for exploring users' expectations for future automotive technology were applied in two studies. The first study encompassed drawing, collaging and interviewing while the second study used drawing and enactment of expected use to mediate a shift from today to tomorrow. A content analysis revealed that the first study provided information on social implications, trust and every-day activities in autonomous cars, whereas the second study provided further in-depth details about the interaction and interior design expectations, as well as trust and anticipated activities. The results contribute to the author's knowledge on how different studies of the same topic can elicit different types of data.

AB We consider the problem of an operator controlling a fleet of electric vehicles for use in a ride-hailing service. The operator, seeking to maximize profit, must assign vehicles to requests as they arise as well as recharge and reposition vehicles in anticipation of future requests. To solve this problem, we employ deep reinforcement learning, developing policies whose decision making uses Q-value approximations learned by deep neural networks. We compare these policies against a reoptimization-based policy and against dual bounds on the value of an optimal policy, including the value of an optimal policy with perfect information, which we establish using a Benders-based decomposition. We assess performance on instances derived from real data for the island of Manhattan in New York City. We find that, across instances of varying size, our best policy trained with deep reinforcement learning outperforms the reoptimization approach. We also provide evidence that this policy may be effectively scaled and deployed on larger instances without retraining.

AB With the recent surge in autonomous driving vehicles, the need for accurate vehicle detection and tracking is critical now more than ever. Detecting vehicles from visual sensors fails in non-line-of-sight (NLOS) settings. This can be compensated by the inclusion of other modalities in a multi-domain sensing environment. We propose several deep learning based frameworks for fusing different modalities (image, radar, acoustic, seismic) through the exploitation of complementary latent embeddings, incorporating multiple state-of-the-art fusion strategies. Our proposed fusion frameworks considerably outperform unimodal detection. Moreover, fusion between image and non-image modalities improves vehicle tracking and detection under NLOS conditions. We validate our models on the real-world multimodal ESCAPE dataset, showing 33.16% improvement in vehicle detection by fusion (over visual inference alone) over test scenarios with 30-42% NLOS conditions. To demonstrate how well our framework generalizes, we also validate our models on the multimodal NuScene dataset, showing similar to 22% improvement over competing methods.

AB We address optimal placement of vehicles with simple motion to intercept a mobile target that is generated stochastically on a line segment. The optimality of vehicle placement is measured through a cost function associated with intercepting the target. With a single vehicle, we assume that the target moves (i) with fixed speed and in a fixed direction perpendicular to the line segment, or (ii) to maximize the distance from the line segment, or (iii) to maximize intercept time. In each case, we show that the cost function is strictly convex, its gradient is smooth, and the optimal vehicle placement is obtained by a standard gradient-based optimization technique. With multiple vehicles, we assume that the target moves with fixed speed and in a fixed direction perpendicular to the line segment. We present a discrete-time partitioning and gradient-based algorithm, and characterize conditions under which the algorithm asymptotically leads the vehicles to a set of critical configurations of the cost function.

AB To enhance safety and traffic efficiency, a driver assistance system and an autonomous vehicle system are being developed. A preceding vehicle recognition method is important to develop such systems. In this paper, a vision-based preceding vehicle recognition method, based on supervised learning from sample images is proposed. The improvement for Modified Quadratic Discriminant Function (MQDF) classifier that is used in the proposed method is also shown. And in the case of road environment recognition including the preceding vehicle recognition, many researches have been reported. However in those researches, a quantitative evaluation with large number of images has rarely been done. Whereas, in this paper, over 1,000 sample images for passenger vehicles, which are recorded on a highway during daytime, are used for an evaluation. The evaluation result shows that the performance in a low order case is improved from the ordinary MQDF. Accordingly, the calculation time is reduced more than 20% by using the proposed method. And the feasibility of the proposed method is also proved, due to the result that the proposed method indicates over 98% as classification rate.

AB The concept of autonomous road vehicles has recently gained a great deal of technical respectability. Expected advantages over normal driver-controlled vehicles are through increased safety, reliability and fuel efficiency. This paper presents a novel experimental study enabling for the first time a full understanding of the aerodynamic flow development of a long vehicle platoon. Moving model experiments were carried out at the University of Birmingham Transient Aerodynamic Investigation (TRAIN) rig facility on a 1/20th scale eight lorry platoon with three constant vehicle spacings. Slipstream velocity and pressures, as well as simultaneous on-board vehicle surface pressure measurements were made. Results indicated a highly turbulent boundary layer development, with slipstream pulse peaks near the front of each lorry; similar to previous findings on flows around container freight trains. The drag coefficient of an isolated lorry was in agreement with previous studies. There are substantial reductions in aerodynamic drag for the non-leading platoon vehicles. Drag results plateaued towards a constant value within the platoon. Vehicle spacing affected drag values, with decreases of 57% observed for the closest spacing of half a vehicle length, demonstrating the aerodynamic benefits of platooning.

AB Tractor-trailer vehicles are affected by jackknifing, a phenomenon that consists in the divergence of the trailer hitch angle and ultimately causes the vehicle to fold up. For the case of backward motions, in which jackknifing can occur at any speed, we present a control method that drives the vehicle along generic reference Cartesian trajectories while avoiding the divergence of the hitch angle. This is obtained thanks to a feedback control law that combines two actions: a tracking term, computed using input-output linearization, and a corrective term, generated via IS-MPC, an intrinsically stable MPC scheme which is effective for stable inversion of non-minimum phase systems. The successful performance of the proposed anti-jackknifing control is verified through simulations and experiments on a purposely built one-trailer prototype. To show the generality of the approach, we also apply and test the proposed method on a two-trailer vehicle.

ID AUTONOMOUS UNDERWATER VEHICLE; IDENTIFICATION; OPTIMIZATION
AB High-speed supercavitating vehicles are surrounded by a huge cavity of gas and only a small portion of the nose and the tail of the vehicle are in contact with the water which leads to a considerable reduction in skin friction drag and reaching very high speeds. High-speed supercavitating vehicles are usually controlled by the cavitator at the nose which controls the pitch and depth of the vehicle and the control surfaces or fins which control the roll and heading angle of the vehicle using the bank-to-turn maneuvering method. However, control surfaces have disadvantages such as the high drag force and ineffectiveness due to the supercavity. Therefore, the purpose of the present study is to eliminate the fins from high-speed supercavitating vehicles and propose a new bank-to-turn heading control of this novel finless high-speed supercavitating vehicle which is composed of the cavitator at the nose and an oscillating pendulum as the internal actuator. Sliding mode control as a robust method is used for the six-degrees-of-freedom model of this finless high-speed vehicle against exposed disturbances. Some design criteria for the design of the internal pendulum in this finless supercavitating vehicle are presented for the damping coefficient, pendulum mass, and radius.

AB In the context of automotive applications, complex tasks such as automatic driving of electric vehicles are handled through the composition of several components, each offering a different service. Such component composition is not straightforward and is often subject to bugs that might stem mainly from the incompatibility of services. In other words, in this context, which includes critical services and in which people's life is at stake, detecting and eliminating bugs early at the design stage is crucial and even mandatory. To remedy this issue, we propose in this paper a formal approach for modeling and verifying the reliability of electric self-driving vehicles that are continuously communicating with off-road infrastructures. First, for the modeling phase, SysML language is used to model the system architecture and to specify the connections between its embedded components. Second, we present a formal verification approach based on the extended interface automata formalism to verify the compatibility between the interacting components, and to check whether this set of components achieve their required tasks. This formalism allows to specify component interfaces that exhibit component protocols and system non-functional constraints. The proposed approach permits an algorithmic verification to decide whether a set of components, when assembled together, fulfill compatibility conditions. Results in this paper show, on one hand, that SysML and extended interface automata formalism are relevant to model and capture component features in the context of automotive systems, on the other hand, that our methodology allows to develop autonomous electric vehicle systems correct-by-design, regarding to component compatibility.

AB We have revealed physical features of automated driving in the framework of the three-phase traffic theory for which there is no fixed time headway to the preceding vehicle. A comparison with the classical model approach to automated driving for which an automated driving vehicle tries to reach a fixed (desired or "optimal") time headway to the preceding vehicle has been made. It turns out that automated driving in the framework of the three-phase traffic theory can exhibit the following advantages in comparison with the classical model of automated driving: (i) The absence of string instability. (ii) Considerably smaller speed disturbances at road bottlenecks. (iii) Automated driving vehicles based on the three-phase theory can decrease the probability of traffic breakdown at the bottleneck in mixed traffic flow consisting of human driving and automated driving vehicles; on the contrary, even a single automated driving vehicle based on the classical approach can provoke traffic breakdown at the bottleneck in mixed traffic flow.

It allows one to evaluate the direct effect that real road traffic conditions have on environmental pollution. Among the variables to be simultaneously measured are: (a) from vehicle activity: regime engine and temperature, fuel consumption, global position, instantaneous and average speed and acceleration, frontal and lateral inclination; (b) related to route features: weather conditions, slope and camber of the road, traffic density; and (c) derived from driver activity: clutch, throttle and brake pedal actions. The designed prototype can be on boarded in conventional or industrial vehicles, working in both urban and inter-urban conditions. The paper describes the integration with pollutant emissions meters. Besides, it includes experimental results carried out in real traffic conditions relating vehicle-driver-route activity with gasses emissions. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB A multimodal teleoperation interface is introduced, featuring an integrated virtual reality (VR) based simulation augmented by sensors and image processing capabilities onboard the remotely operated vehicle. The proposed virtual reality interface fuses an existing VR model with live video feed and prediction states, thereby creating a multimodal control interface. VR addresses the typical limitations of video based teleoperation caused by signal lag and limited field of view, allowing the operator to navigate in a continuous fashion. The vehicle incorporates an onboard computer and a stereo vision system to facilitate obstacle detection. A vehicle adaptation system with a priori risk maps and a real-state tracking system enable temporary autonomous operation of the vehicle for local navigation around obstacles and automatic re-establishment of the vehicles teleoperated state. The system provides real time update of the virtual environment based on anomalies encountered by the vehicle. The VR based multimodal teleoperation interface is expected to be more adaptable and intuitive when compared with other interfaces. [DOI:10.1115/1.3086030]

AB The aim of this work has been the implementation and testing in real conditions of a new algorithm based on the cell-mapping techniques and reinforcement learning methods to obtain the optimal motion planning of a vehicle considering kinematics, dynamics and obstacle constraints. The algorithm is an extension of the control adjoining cell mapping technique for learning the dynamics of the vehicle instead of using its analytical state equations. It uses a transformation of cell-to-cell mapping in order to reduce the time spent during the learning stage. Real experimental results are reported to show the satisfactory performance of the algorithm.

AB The safety and effectiveness of transportation systems could be improved significantly through edge computing which can be relied on to assist intelligent and connected vehicles (ICVs). However, with the rapid increase in the number of ICVs, traffic congestion worsens as a result of demand exceeding the capacity of a specific roads. To solve the issues, a cooperative route planning transportation system is proposed for edge computing-enabled multi-connected vehicles. This system is intended to achieve the cross-domain load balancing of connected vehicles and traffic flow domains. Furthermore, an iterative interior point is proposed to minimize the overall probability of traffic congestion by directing the routes of multi-connected vehicles in a coordinated way. According to the simulation results, the suggested scheme reduces the average travel time by 4.85%, 15.62%, 35.54% and 63.11% compared with others. Meanwhile, there is a significant improvement of performance in terms of traffic congestion rate and traffic load.

AB Identifying and evaluating the potential risks in the surrounding environment is critical for intelligent vehicles' safety and user experience. This paper provides a comprehensive overview of the state-of-the-art research on the surrounding vehicles' lane change maneuver prediction and detection. First, various driver behavior modeling and classification methods are reviewed and analyzed, which gives a general understanding of what the lane change maneuver is and how to predict or detect the lane change maneuver. Next, the primary sensing devices equipped on intelligent vehicles and their impacts on lane change inference systems are discussed. Then, a series of representative research works in recent years are selected, introduced, and compared regarding their input feature selection, inference algorithms, and performance evaluation methods. Finally, some potential future research directions are proposed. This paper aims to help the relevant researchers and institutions summarize the current studies on the surrounding vehicles' lane change maneuver inference and recognize its future development directions.

AB A distributed flocking control scheme is presented for a swarm of non-holonomic vehicles modeled as linear parameter varying (LPV) systems. The vehicles are assumed to perform tasks that arise when exploring scalar fields on Double-struck capital R3$$ {\mathbb{R}}<^>3 $$, which may represent, for example, concentration levels of a toxic substance in air or water. Here we consider in particular level surface tracking and level surface monitoring missions. It is assumed that agents can sense gradient and Hessian information of the scalar field at their current position. The control architecture of each vehicle is structured into two modules: a flocking filter which represents a virtual layer of the network, and local tracking controllers for vehicles on the physical layer. The flocking filter receives data from neighboring vehicles and generates a reference signal. An LPV tracking controller for the vehicles, and a network flocking filter that stabilizes the whole network, are designed separately. Simulated mission scenarios with swarm of autonomous underwater vehicles demonstrate the practicality of the proposed approach.

AB Active safety features and functions are built into a vehicle to automatically detect collision risks and prevent the occurrence of collisions. These functions are difficult to validate by using the traditional safety assessment methods. Therefore, evaluation methods and systems are developed for testing active safety systems. We developed a system for evaluating the active safety of advanced driver assistance system vehicles. This system consisted of an unmanned robot with a height of 100 mm and cloaked under a target dummy vehicle, which was made of balloons. This setup enabled the robot to pass through the underside of the test vehicle. In this manner, the evaluation system and test vehicle avoided possible damage during the collision test. The evaluation system could generate vehicular paths by using a differential global positioning system to enact a collision scenario for the assessment of the active safety function. Actual vehicle experiments were conducted to verify the system via the collision scenarios established by the Euro new car assessment program.

AB Vehicle viewpoint estimation from monocular images is a crucial component for autonomous driving vehicles and for fleet management applications. In this paper, we make several contributions to advance the state-of-the-art on this problem. We show the effectiveness of applying a smoothing filter to the output neurons of a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) when estimating vehicle viewpoint. We point out the overlooked fact that, under the same viewpoint, the appearance of a vehicle is strongly influenced by its position in the image plane, which renders viewpoint estimation from appearance an ill-posed problem. We show how, by inserting in the model a CoordConv layer to provide the coordinates of the vehicle, we are able to solve such ambiguity and greatly increase performance. Finally, we introduce a new data augmentation technique that improves viewpoint estimation on vehicles that are closer to the camera or partially occluded. All these improvements let a lightweight CNN reach optimal results while keeping inference time low. An extensive evaluation on a viewpoint estimation benchmark (Pascal3D+) and on actual vehicle camera data (nuScenes) shows that our method significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art in vehicle viewpoint estimation, both in terms of accuracy and memory footprint.

AB With recent increased interest in autonomous vehicles and the associated technology, the prospect of realizing a personal aerial vehicle seems closer than ever. However, there is likely to be a continued requirement for any occupant of an air vehicle to be comfortable with both the automated portions of the flight and their ability to take manual control as and when required. This paper, using the approach to landing as an example maneuver, examines what a comfortable trajectory for personal aerial vehicle occupants might look like. Based upon simulated flight data, a "natural" flight trajectory is designed and then compared to constant deceleration and constant optic flow descent profiles. It is found that personal aerial vehicle occupants with limited flight training and no artificial guidance follow the same longitudinal trajectory as has been found for professionally trained helicopter pilots. Further, the final stages of the approach to hover can be well described using the Tau theory. For automatic flight, personal aerial vehicle occupants prefer a constant deceleration profile. For approaches flown manually, the newly designed natural profile is preferred.

ID IMPACTS
AB Introduction: The presence of connected and automated vehicles (CAV) in mixed traffic flows with different market penetration rates (MPRs) in urban road scenarios has a significant effect on fuel consumption and exhaust emissions.Methods: Therefore, in this study, real-world road networks and traffic data are simulated using SUMO based on actual data from a survey. The fuel consumption and emission benefits of CAVs in mixed traffic flows are well-evaluated, and the energy-saving performance of CAVs under low-speed vehicle interference is tested. In addition, this study explores both the energy consumption and emissions of purely electric vehicles.Results: The results show that with 100% CAV penetration, fuel vehicles have a maximum reduction in fuel consumption of 18% and a maximum increase in average speed of 31.6%, while the energy consumption of electric vehicles increases due to communication, detection, and collaboration between CAVs.Discussion: However, the results clearly demonstrate that the carbon emissions of electric vehicles are significantly lower than fuel vehicles. In addition, the increase in low-speed vehicles will result in an increase in energy consumption and emissions. Therefore, increasing the percentage of electric vehicles on the roads and transitioning from manual to autonomous driving systems is crucial to curbing carbon emissions.

AB In car-following scenarios, accurate previews of the preceding vehicle's trajectory are essential for minimizing the energy consumption of a following automated vehicle. This work presents a novel design strategy for data-driven vehicle speed predictors to increase the energy efficiency of the following connected and automated vehicle. The loss function is formulated as a weighted-mean-squared error, where the weights are tuned based on the influence of uncertainty at an individual prediction step on the energy consumption of the automated following vehicle. The efficacy of the proposed loss function is validated by applying it to training representative predictors and testing the predictors in the energy-optimal control of the following vehicle. The energy saving of the optimal controller is evaluated by comparing the electricity consumption of a battery electric vehicle with the human driver following, emulated by an intelligent driver model. Simulation results show that the energy consumption of an electric vehicle is reduced by an average of 12% compared to a human driver following demonstrated by an intelligent driver model, whereas using a conventional loss function, a mean-squared error loss function, reduces by 10%.

AB This paper investigates a trajectory planning and tracking control scheme to implement the autonomous obstacle avoidance for wheeled inverted pendulum (WIP) vehicles, which enable the mobile platform to avoid obstacles rapidly and stabilise the vehicle body simultaneously. In the first place, an obstacle avoidance trajectory planning method suitable for the WIP vehicle is proposed, which, in particular, is capable of planning an obstacle avoidance trajectory with the merits of continuous curvature and approximately zero longitudinal acceleration in vehicle body-fixed frame system. Then, aiming the feature of the each subsystem, a nonsingular terminal sliding mode control and a nested saturation approach are employed to construct the trajectory tracking algorithm for fully actuated steering subsystem and underactuated longitudinal subsystem of the WIP vehicle, respectively. Besides, the closed-loop system's stability and asymptotical convergence of tracking error are proven in the sense of Lyapunov stability theory. In the end, numerical simulations are performed to demonstrate the feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed scheme for obstacle avoidance of WIP vehicles.

AB Unmanned aerial vehicle in surveillance and reconnaissance operations are well known with its flight operations confining to the lateral and longitudinal plane where the altitude is maintained constant. The objective in these operations is to have a wide field of view when camera is mounted underneath the aircraft. However, in obstacle detection algorithms as well as in weapon-target assignments by an unmanned combat air vehicle, the sensors such as cameras and radars are mounted along the X direction of the body fixed frame. The unmanned vehicles with such sensor locations are expected to offer obstacle-camera and weapon-target line-of-sight engagements. These operations by the unmanned vehicles are referred as targeting tasks. In this paper, a procedure to use unmanned vehicles as targeting systems in pitch plane is presented with respect to a fixed order controller at the inner loop. The remote pilot's inputs at the outer loop is disengaged and to mimic these inputs, various flight path angles are scheduled thus depicting autonomous characteristics. Illustrations to depict targeting tasks are provided.

AB Antarctic sea ice is known to provide unique ecosystem habitat at the ice-ocean interface. Mapping sea ice characteristics-such as thickness and roughness-at high resolution from beneath the ice is difficult due to access. A Geoswath Plus phase-measuring bathymetric sonar mounted on an autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) was employed in this study to collect data underneath the sea ice at Cape Evans in Antarctica in November 2014. This study demonstrates how acoustic data can be collected and processed to resolutions of 1 m for acoustic bathymetry and 5 cm for acoustic backscatter in this challenging environment. Different ice textures such as platelet ice, smooth ice, and sea ice morphologies, ranging in size from 1 to 50 m were characterized. The acoustic techniques developed in this work could provide a key to understanding the distribution of sea ice communities, as they are nondisruptive to the fragile ice environments and provide geolocated data over large spatial extents. These results improve our understanding of sea ice properties and the complex, highly variable ecosystem that exists at this boundary.

AB The use of underwater vehicle manipulator systems (UVMS) equipped with cameras has gained significant attention due to their capacity to perform underwater tasks autonomously. However, controlling both the manipulator and the remotely operated vehicle (ROV) based on the vision system information is not an easy task, especially in situations where the vehicle cannot be parked/held stationary. Most of the existing approaches work based on complex matrix calculations for the inverse kinematics (IK), which can lead to high computational costs and the need to deal with singularity problems. A problem arises when the amount of time needed to calculate the UVMS configuration can result in reduced frequency of target pose estimation, beyond the point where the target has moved out of the camera field of view. Therefore, this paper proposes an autonomous visual servoing approach for UVMS, including an extension of a heuristic technique named M-FABRIK (Mobile - Forward and Backward Reaching IK) to calculate the UVMS inverse kinematics in a simple and fast way. This approach aims to control both the configuration of the manipulator and ROV position in order to allow underwater intervention in situations where the ROV cannot be parked/held stationary. This solution allows the vehicle to be positioned according to additional criteria, besides avoiding matrix inversion and being robust to singularities. Trials have been performed with a manipulator mounted on a work-class ROV for an autonomous underwater monitoring task and results demonstrate a simple and fast approach, which is able to set the configuration of the manipulator as well as the ROV for visual servoing applications in real-time, such as for monitoring, tracking and intervention tasks underwater.

AB This paper presents a new generalized super-twisting algorithm (GSTA) controller with a time-delay estimator (TDE) for the tracking control of an autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) under disturbances. For exploration tasks in confined areas, AUVs are typically equipped with sensors such as Doppler velocity logs (DVL) or acoustic modems to measure their position and speed. However, these sensors have a disadvantage in that their acquisition rates are low. This disadvantage, combined with the influence of external disturbances, directly influences position control because it requires partial knowledge of the system for proper operation. To solve this problem, the introduction of a TDE that estimates the vehicle hydrodynamics with delayed sensor information, and consequently, improves the controller performance is proposed. For controller validation, a stability analysis is presented, and two results are provided in the simulation. In the first test, the AUV is controlled to track a parameterized spiral-shaped path to validate the vehicle movement in the three directions of the plane (x, y, z). In the second test, the AUV performs path tracking in yaw and depth motions. In all numerical simulations, three types of disturbances/uncertainties are considered: (i) system parameters, (ii) sensor readings, and (iii) control.

AB This paper develops distributed optimization-based, platoon-centered connected and autonomous vehicle (CAV) car-following schemes, motivated by the recent interest in CAV platooning technologies. Various distributed optimization or control schemes have been developed for CAV platooning. However, most existing distributed schemes for platoon centered CAV control require either centralized data processing or centralized computation in at least one step of their schemes, referred to as partially distributed schemes. In this paper, we develop fully distributed optimization based, platoon centered CAV platooning control under the linear vehicle dynamics via the model predictive control approach with a general prediction horizon. These fully distributed schemes do not require centralized data processing or centralized computation through the entire schemes. To develop these schemes, we propose a new formulation of an objective function and a decomposition method that decomposes a densely coupled central objective function into the sum of multiple locally coupled functions whose coupling satisfies the network topology constraint. We then exploit locally coupled optimization and operator splitting methods to develop fully distributed schemes. Control design and stability analysis is carried out to achieve desired traffic transient performance and asymptotic stability. Numerical tests demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed fully distributed schemes and CAV platooning control.

AB In this article, combined active flow control system and flight control system design for morphing unmanned aerial vehicles is applied for the first time for autonomous flight performance maximization. For this purpose, longitudinal and lateral dynamics modeling of morphing unmanned aerial vehicle having active flow control manufactured in Erciyes University, Faculty of Aeronautics and Astronautics, Model Aircraft Laboratory is considered in order to obtain simulation environments. Our produced morphing unmanned aerial vehicle is called as ZANKA-II, which has a mass of 6.5 kg, range of 30 km, endurance of 0.5 h, and ceiling altitude of 6000 m. von Karman turbulence modeling is used in order to model atmospheric turbulence during flight in both longitudinal and lateral simulation environments. A stochastic optimization method called as simultaneous perturbation stochastic approximation is also applied for the first time in order to obtain optimum dimensions of morphing parameters (i.e. extension ratios of wingspan and tail span), optimum positions of blowers, and optimum magnitudes of longitudinal and lateral controllers' gains (i.e. P, I, and D gains) while minimizing cost index capturing terms for both longitudinal and lateral autonomous flight performances and there exist lower and upper constraints on all optimization variables in the literature.

AB The advent of driverless vehicles, including automobiles and buses, may considerably affect the competitiveness and ridership of public transportation services in negative as well as positive ways. Since driverless vehicles may be widely used in the fairly near future, public transit operators and transportation planners should prepare to deal with their anticipated effects. In this paper, (1) we formulate modular optimization models for both human-driven and automated bus services with fixed routes as well as flexible routes. These models are solved analytically. Their results can be used to abstract the essential characteristics of the transportation system and analyze system behavior. (2) We develop preliminary quantitative assessments of those effects, showing that without drivers, the introduction of automated vehicles can reduce the competitiveness of bus transit. (3) We conduct sensitivity analyses to explore how changes in input parameters affect the results. (4) We identify insights that may help prepare transit operators, transportation planners, and other transportation system stakeholders for effectively adapting to the introduction of driverless vehicles.

AB For some flight missions, such as autonomous landing on mobile platforms, the demands on indicators such as target-tracking accuracy and so on are relatively high. To achieve this, a guidance system with excellent precision is necessary. An asymmetric tracking differentiator based on a tracking differentiator is proposed to establish the guidance system. On the basis of the proposed asymmetric tracking differentiator, an altitudinal and horizontal helicopter guidance system structure is designed. In this paper, a guidance law is designed in order to meet the accuracy and precision requirements in the autonomous landing and transition process. Apart from that, a plane-motion-guidance law is also designed to realize static and dynamic point tracking, linear route tracking and circular route tracking to improve the trajectory smoothness and accuracy. Finally, simulations of the autonomous landing process on moving platforms, including three stages, namely approaching, tracking and landing, are completed. The application effects and precision of the autonomous landing guidance algorithm under different wave heights and period conditions are analyzed through the obtained simulation curves.

TI Offloading of Interdependent Computing Subtasks Based on VANET in the

SO IEEE NETWORK
LA English
DT Article
ID CHALLENGES
AB Inter-vehicle communication is crucial in many severe weather or natural disaster situations. However, the wireless link quality is worse than the wired in that the network topology between vehicles changes frequently as vehicles move at high speeds. This also seriously affects the quality of inter-vehicle communication and corresponding services. Emerging computing-intensive service tasks like autonomous driving are extremely time-dependent, which poses large issues for resource allocation between vehicles. In particular, vehicles driving will face greater obstacles when severe weather causes a serious shortage of roadside computing resources. Therefore, we develop appropriate offloading strategies for interdependent computation tasks in the harsh environment. To reduce the overall task completion time within the cost budget limitations, we study a dynamic offloading strategy based on vehicle distribution probability and revenue discount factor, where subtasks are offloaded to the appropriate vehicle by cellular vehicle-to-everything communication. Simultaneously, for small tasks with smaller amounts of calculation, we propose a quasi-static offloading strategy based on branch and bound. Simulation results for varying amounts of calculation, vehicle arrival rates, and average speeds show that the suggested strategies can enhance revenues while getting lower time complexity. Furthermore, our solutions are more adaptable to the extremely dynamic vehicular ad hoc network environment.

AB Human eye movements while driving reveal that visual attention largely depends on the context in which it occurs. Furthermore, an autonomous vehicle which performs this function would be more reliable if its outputs were understandable. Capsule Networks have been presented as a great opportunity to explore new horizons in the Computer Vision field, due to their capability to structure and relate latent information. In this article, we present a hierarchical approach for the prediction of eye fixations in autonomous driving scenarios. Context-driven visual attention can be modeled by considering different conditions which, in turn, are represented as combinations of several spatio-temporal features. With the aim of learning these conditions, we have built an encoder-decoder network which merges visual features' information using a global-local definition of capsules. Two types of capsules are distinguished: representational capsules for features and discriminative capsules for conditions. The latter and the use of eye fixations recorded with wearable eye tracking glasses allow the model to learn both to predict contextual conditions and to estimate visual attention, by means of a multi-task loss function. Experiments show how our approach is able to express either frame-level (global) or pixel-wise (local) relationships between features and contextual conditions, allowing for interpretability while maintaining or improving the performance of black-box related systems in the literature. Indeed, our proposal offers an improvement of 29% in terms of information gain with respect to the best performance reported in the literature.

AB With the advancement in AI and related technologies, we are witnessing more remarkable use of intelligent vehicles. Intelligent vehicles use smart automatic features that make travel happier, safer, and efficient. However, not many studies examine their adoption or the influence of intelligent vehicles on user behavior. In this study, we specifically examine how intelligent vehicles' sensing and acting abilities drive their adoption from the lens of psychological empowerment theory. We identify three dimensions of users' perceived empowerment (perceived cognitive empowerment, perceived emotional empowerment, and perceived behavioral empowerment). Based on this theory, we argue that product features (sensing and acting in intelligent vehicles) empower users to use the product. Our proposed model is validated by an online survey of 312 car owners who are familiar with driving conditions, the results of this study reveal that driver's perceived empowerment is vital for using automatic features of intelligent vehicles. Theoretically, this study combines the concept of empowerment with the intelligent-driving scenario and reasonably explains the mechanism of the intelligence of vehicles on users' behavior intention.

AB Automatic guidance vehicles (AGV) are industrial vehicles that play an important role in the development of smart manufacturing systems and Industry 4.0. To provide these autonomous systems with the flexibility that is required today in these industrial workspaces, AGV computational models are necessary in order to analyze their performance and design efficient planning and control strategies. To address these issues, in this work, the mathematical model and the algorithm that implement a computational control-oriented simulation model of a hybrid tricycle-differential AGV with multi-trailers have been developed. Physical factors, such as wheel-ground interaction and the effect of vertical and lateral loads on its dynamics, have been incorporated into the model. The model has been tested in simulation with two different controllers and three trajectories: a circumference, a square, and an s-shaped curve. Furthermore, it has been used to analyze extreme situations of slipping and capsizing and the influence of the number of trailers on the tracking error and the control effort. This way, the minimum lateral friction coefficient to avoid slipping and the minimum ratio between the lateral and height displacement of the center of gravity to avoid capsizing have been obtained. In addition, the effect of a change in the friction coefficient has also been simulated.

AB In this paper, the state-of-the-art concerning new methodologies for surveying in coastal areas in order to obtain an efficient quantification of submerged and emerged environments is described and evaluated. This work integrates an interdisciplinary approach involving both geomatics and robotics and focuses on definition, implementation, and development of a methodology to execute integrated aerial and underwater survey campaigns in shallow water areas. A preliminary test was performed at Gorzente Lakes near Genoa (Italy), to develop and integrate different survey techniques, enabling working in a smarter way, reducing costs and increasing safety for the operators. In this context, Remote Sensing techniques were integrated with a UAV (Unmanned Aerial Vehicle) carrying an aerial optical sensor for photogrammetry and with an ASV (Autonomous Surface Vehicle) expressly addressed to work in extremely shallow water with underwater acoustic sensors (single echo sounder). The obtained continuous seamless DSM (Digital Surface Model) for the entire environment was reconstructed by the combination of different sensing systems by limiting reliance on the GNSS (Global Navigation Satellite System) support. The obtained DSM was displayed in a 3D model leading to the evaluation of the water flow volume and rendering of 3D visualization.

   Wireless Power Transfer (WPT)
AB Wireless power transfer (WPT) technology has been applied to fields as diverse as medical, electronic devices and transportation because of its convenience, safety and aesthetics. In particular, electric vehicles (EVs) that have emerged to replace internal combustion engines, which cause environmental pollution problems, are most suitable for applying WPT. Not only does convenience increase by eliminating charging cables, but the issue of heavy batteries can also be resolved by using dynamic WPT technology, which allows charging of batteries while driving. Furthermore, if dynamic WPT technology and autonomous driving technology are applied together to EVs, the driver's convenience with regard to charging as well as driving will be greatly improved. In this paper, we propose a multi-purpose sensor coil system for use with dynamic WPT in an EV. Sensor coils detect any misalignment between the source coil and the load coil that occurs while the vehicle is being driven. Furthermore, the proposed system uses sensor coils and ferrite bars to transfer information, such as the lanes which vehicles are being driven. By transferring information, the proposed system can provide the benefits of autonomous driving technology as well as WPT technology. We theoretically analyze the proposed method and confirm that it can play two roles through simulations and experiments.

AB Vehicle platooning has been proposed as one of the potential technologies for intelligent transport systems to improve transportation and energy efficiency in urban cities. Despite extensive studies conducted on the platooning of heavy-duty trucks, literature on the analysis of urban vehicle platoons has been limited. To analyse the impact of platooning in urban environments, this paper studies the influence of intervehicle distance, platoon size and vehicle speed on the drag coefficient of the vehicles in a platoon using computational fluid dynamics (CFD). Two vehicle models-a minibus and a passenger car-are analysed to characterise the drag coefficients of the respective platoons. An analysis of energy consumption is conducted to evaluate the energy savings with platooning using a longitudinal dynamics simulation. The results showed a reduction in the average drag coefficient of the platoon of up to 24% at an intervehicle distance of 1 m depending on the number of vehicles in the platoon. With a larger intervehicle distance of 4 m, the reduction in the drag coefficient decreased to 4% of the drag coefficient of the isolated vehicle. Subsequently, energy savings with platooning were calculated to be up to 10% depending on the driving cycle, intervehicle distance and platoon size.

AB Antilock braking system (ABS), traction control system, etc. are used in modern automobiles for enhanced safety and reliability. Autonomous ABS system can take over the traction control of the vehicle either completely or partially. An antilock braking system using an on-off control strategy to maintain the wheel slip within a predefined range is studied here. The controller design needs integration with the vehicle dynamics model. A single wheel or a bicycle vehicle model considers only constant normal loading on the wheels. On the other hand, a four wheel vehicle model that accounts for dynamic normal loading on the wheels and generates correct lateral forces is suitable for reliable brake system design. This paper describes an integrated vehicle braking system dynamics and control modeling procedure for a four wheel vehicle. The vehicle system comprises several energy domains. The interdisciplinary modeling technique called bond graph is used to integrate models in different energy domains and control systems. The bond graph model of the integrated vehicle dynamic system is developed in a modular and hierarchical modeling environment and is simulated to evaluate the performance of the ABS system under various operating conditions.

AB Uncoordinated driving behavior is one of the main reasons for bottlenecks on freeways. This paper presents a novel cyber-physical framework for optimal coordination of connected and automated vehicles (CAVs) on multi-lane freeways. We consider that all vehicles are connected to a cloud-based computing framework, where a traffic coordination system optimizes the target trajectories of individual vehicles for smooth and safe lane changing or merging. In the proposed framework, the vehicles are coordinated into groups or platoons, and their trajectories are successively optimized in a receding horizon control (RHC) approach. Optimization of the traffic coordination system aims to provide sufficient gaps when a lane change is necessary while minimizing the speed deviation and acceleration of all vehicles. The coordination information is then provided to individual vehicles equipped with local controllers, and each vehicle decides its control acceleration to follow the target trajectories while ensuring a safe distance. Our proposed method guarantees fast optimization and can be used in real-time. The proposed coordination system was evaluated using microscopic traffic simulations and benchmarked with the traditional driving (human-based) system. The results show significant improvement in fuel economy, average velocity, and travel time for various traffic volumes.

AB An optimal path provides efficient operation of unmanned ground vehicles (UGVs) for many kinds of tasks such as transportation, exploration, surveillance, and search and rescue in unstructured areas that include various unexpected obstacles. Various onboard sensors such as LiDAR, radar, sonar, and cameras are used to detect obstacles around the UGVs. However, their range of view is often limited by movable obstacles or barriers, resulting in inefficient path generation. Here, we present the aerial online mapping system to generate an efficient path for a UGV on a two-dimensional map. The map is updated by projecting obstacles detected in the aerial images taken by an unmanned aerial vehicle through an object detector based on a conventional convolutional neural network. The proposed system is implemented in real-time by a skid steering ground vehicle and a quadcopter with relatively small, low-cost embedded systems. The frameworks and each module of the systems are given in detail to evaluate the performance. The system is also demonstrated in unstructured outdoor environments such as in a football field and a park with unreliable communication links. The results show that the aerial online mapping is effective in path generation for autonomous UGVs in real environments.

AB This paper introduces a custom-built unmanned aerial vehicle that is capable of autonomous exploration in urban environments. It consists of a multicopter, an inertial navigation system, and two two-dimensional laser range finders. In addition to a description of the hardware architecture and individual components being used, the authors also discuss challenges and problems that arose during its construction, as well as optimizations and workarounds applied in the course of its development. Also presented is the software architecture, with a focus on a novel algorithm capable of generating multiple next best views, sorted by achievable information gain. Although the vehicle was designed for application on airborne platforms in urban environments, it works directly on raw point clouds and thus can be used with any sensor generating spatial occupancy information (e. g., LIDAR, RGBD, or time-of-flight-cameras). To satisfy constraints introduced by real-time operation on unmanned aerial vehicles, the algorithm is implemented on a highly parallel single-instruction multiple-data architecture and benchmarked using graphics processing units from multiple hardware generations, using data from real flights. It is also compared with the previous, CPU-based proof of concept. As the underlying hardware imposes limitations with regard to memory access and concurrency, necessary data structures and further performance considerations are explained in detail.

ID MODEL; VEHICLES
AB Mixed traffic flow consisting of vehicles equipped with adaptive cruise control (ACC) and manually driven vehicles is analyzed using car-following simulations. Simulations of merging from an on-ramp onto a freeway reported in the literature have not thus far demonstrated a substantial positive impact of ACC. In this paper cooperative merging for ACC vehicles is proposed to improve throughput and increase distance traveled in a fixed time. In such a system an ACC vehicle senses not only the preceding vehicle in the same lane but also the vehicle immediately in front in the other lane. Prior to reaching the merge region, the ACC vehicle adjusts its velocity to ensure that a safe gap for merging is obtained. If on-ramp demand is moderate, cooperative merging produces significant improvement in throughput (20%) and increases up to 3.6 km in distance traveled in 600 s for 50% ACC mixed flow relative to the flow of all-manual vehicles. For large demand, it is shown that autonomous merging with cooperation in the flow of all ACC vehicles leads to throughput limited only by the downstream capacity, which is determined by speed limit and headway time.

ID TRAJECTORY PREDICTION; FRAMEWORK
AB Autonomous vehicles need to have the ability to predict the future behaviour of surrounding vehicles, which helps with proper trajectory planning and tracking. Many behaviour prediction methods have limited application because they have a very limited prediction horizon. This paper proposes a deep learning-based hybrid model for behaviour prediction over long-time periods, including manoeuvre recognition and a behaviour prediction module. In manoeuvre recognition module, the CNN extracts the social characteristics of the target vehicle and LSTM outputs the manoeuvre probability vector to form a contextual feature vector with the social features. In the behaviour prediction module, LSTM and Attention are based on the contextual feature vector to capture multi-time step information in the behaviour time window to complete the prediction of the target vehicle behaviour. Real-car collection and open-source vehicle trajectory datasets were used for training and testing. The results show that the proposed algorithm could predict vehicle behaviour with an accuracy of 89.73% and an average prediction time of 2.032 s, which has a high engineering application value.

ID INJURY SEVERITY; ALGORITHM
AB The deployment of autonomous vehicles on public roads calls for the development of methods that are reliably able to mitigate injury severity in case of unavoidable collisions. This study proposes a data-driven motion planning method capable of minimizing injury severity for vehicle occupants in unavoidable collisions. The method is based on establishing a metric that models the relationship between impact location and injury severity using real accident data, and subsequently including it in the cost function of a motion planning framework. The vehicle dynamics and associated constraints are considered through a precomputed trajectory library, which is generated by solving an optimal control problem. This allows for efficient computation as well as an accurate representation of the vehicle. The proposed motion planning approach is evaluated by simulation, and it is shown that the trajectory associated with the minimum cost mitigates the collision severity for occupants of passenger vehicles involved in the collision.

AB Under the sharp turn condition, especially on low adhesion coefficient roads, drift motion can improve vehicle agility and ensure safety. During drift motion, the large sideslip angle and rear wheel slip as well as the saturation of lateral tyre force result in the complex nonlinear dynamic behaviour, such as non-unique equilibrium point and unstable vehicle dynamic. Therefore, this paper focuses on the analysis of dynamic characteristics and the design of both the equilibrium point and feedback controller for drift motion. First, a dynamics model, in which the rear wheel slip ratio is treated as a parametric variable and the influence of rear wheel lateral force on the drift motion is explicitly expressed, is established. Then the expression of steady-state yaw rate and the virtual control input is derived, and the error dynamic model is presented furthermore. To design the equilibrium point, in this paper the effect of rear tyre slip angle and slip ratio on the equilibrium point is discussed, and the condition of stable equilibrium point is proposed. In addition, the design of desired rear tyre slip angle by synthesising the cornering performance during drift motion is presented. For the drift controller design, the main idea is to design the stabilisation controller for the nonlinear dynamic system with the stable equilibrium point and to calculate static feedback gain by means of Lyapunov stability theory. To illustrate the characteristics of drift motion, the influence of the vehicle speed and rear wheel slip ratio on the vehicle path and the low damping characteristics of the dynamic system on the control performance are analysed by different simulation conditions. Moreover, the performance and effectiveness of the proposed drift control are verified by simulation.

AB Driving automation is becoming an increasing trend in the automotive industry as vehicles become more and more intelligent, while information is shared among them and with the infrastructure via wireless communication. Vehicle organization in swarms is considered an interesting approach for future traffic management, since it could significantly improve road efficiency and safety, while saving resources and increasing system resiliency. In this work, modelling and simulation of swarm traffic flow have been addressed. A decision support simulation tool for swarm intelligence traffic flow modelling including different types of vehicles and roads has been implemented using MATLAB. Functionalities such as driving, lane changing, overtaking and swarm cooperation are included. The behaviour of swarms of multi-brand platooning vehicles on different roads and driving conditions has been analyzed. The parameters that define the automated vehicle swarm have also been studied, such as its size, desired speed, inter vehicle distance, etc., and how the swarm configuration depends on the application (highway traffic, traffic jam assist, ...). The result of this research shows how traffic flow can be maximized when vehicles are managed in a swarm configuration. (c) 2022 Published by Elsevier B.V.

AB The gradual deployment of Connected and Automated Vehicles (CAV) in traffic will result in a transition period in which vehicles with various levels of automation and connectivity will have to co-exist with non-connected and non-automated road users for quite some time. Consequently, new types of interactions will emerge (and old types of interactions are likely to become more complicated) between vehicles at different levels of automation and other road users which could have significant implications on traffic safety and efficiency. Understanding the nature of these interactions, how humans might adapt their behavior, how connectivity can be utilized to proactively enhance drivers char63 driving performance, and how automated vehicles can be programmed to behave in different driving situations to guarantee safety and efficiency remain among the key knowledge gaps that require scientific research. This knowledge is crucial for the development of adequate integration policies of connected and automated vehicles in mixed traffic environment, for updating and improving automated vehicles char63 algorithms and software, for designing the physical and digital road infrastructure, and for operating and managing traffic on the road network.

AB Connected vehicle (CV) and vehicle-to-everything (V2X) technologies enhance connectivity among vehicle, road user, and road infrastructure and can provide timely and concisely coordination information among drivers. Currently, there are far more studies on the technical aspects of V2X than on the demands of users. This study investigated the attitudes and preferences of drivers concerning the design of connected vehicle information system (CVIS) in this context. Focus group discussions followed by a questionnaire survey were conducted to gather driver's attitudes and preferences information. Results indicate that participants believed CVISs would help improve the efficiency of roadway communication, thereby improving safety, efficiency, and convenience of the overall traffic system. Visual warning signals and descriptive verbal speech were preferred over tactile warnings. Safety-related information (e.g., rescue services, reminding vehicle malfunction, and information about surroundings hazards) was valued most. Furthermore, age, gender, risk perception, privacy expectations, and technology inclination played essential roles in associating the attitudes toward CVISs. The outcome of this research provides an overview of the opinion of Chinese drivers toward CVISs and suggests practical implications regarding the design of CVISs for intelligent transportation.

AB The unmanned ground vehicle is supposed to replace humans for various applications in both civilian and military area, including transport, delivery, shuttle, clean, patrol, scout, and battle. It has been widely expected that the unmanned ground vehicle will greatly change the human life and the land combat form in the near future. The key techniques of the unmanned ground vehicle are environment perception, motion planning, chassis dynamics control, and cloud control. In this paper, the state of the art of the development of the military and civilian unmanned ground vehicle is introduced, and many classic ones are reviewed in detail in different application categories. The overall design and X-by-wire dynamics control technique of the civilian and military unmanned ground vehicle are reviewed. The X-by-wire technique plays an important role in improving the maneuverability, mobility, and handling performance of the unmanned ground vehicle. Therefore, the chassis dynamics control is considered as a core technique of the X-by-wire unmanned ground vehicle. In addition, as a research trend of the unmanned ground vehicle dynamics control, the cloud-based dynamics control approach of future unmanned ground vehicle based on big data and cloud control techniques is described according to the authors' work.

AB The security of cyber-physical systems, such as vehicle platoons, is critical to ensuring their proper operation and acceptance to society. In platooning, vehicles follow one another according to an agreed-upon control law that determines vehicle separation. We show that a vehicle within a platoon and under the control of a malicious actor could cause collisions or decrease the efficiency of surrounding vehicles. This paper focuses on detecting, identifying, and mitigating so-called destabilizing attacks that could cause vehicle collisions. Our approach is decentralized and requires only local sensor information for each vehicle to identify the vehicle responsible for the attack and then deploy an appropriate mitigating controller that prevents collisions. We use a Deep Learning approach (Convolutional Neural Network) with various data preprocessing techniques to detect and identify the malicious vehicle. Results indicate that even with decent noise levels in range and relative speed data, we achieve accuracy up to 96.3%. Also, once the adversarial vehicle is localized, we derive conditions for controller gains using the Routh Hurwitz criterion to mitigate the attack and ensure the stability of the platoon. Realistic simulator CARLA and MATLAB simulation results validate the effectiveness of our proposed approaches.

AB Motivated by the potentially high downlink traffic demands of commuters in future autonomous vehicles, we study a network architecture where vehicles use Vehicle-to-Vehicle (V2V) links to form relay network clusters, which in turn use Vehicle-to-Infrastructure (V2I) links to connect to one or more Road Side Units (RSUs). Such cluster-based multihoming offers improved performance, e.g., in coverage and per user shared rate, but depends on the penetration of V2V+V2I capable vehicles and possible blockage, by legacy vehicles, of line of sight based V2V links, such as those based on millimeter-wave and visible light technologies. This paper provides a performance analysis of a typical vehicle's connectivity and throughput on a highway in the free-flow regime, exploring its dependence on vehicle density, sensitivity to blockages, number of lanes and heterogeneity across lanes. The results, backed up by simulations of realistic vehicular traffic, show that even with moderate vehicle densities and penetration of V2V+V2I capable vehicles, such architectures can achieve substantial improvements in connectivity and reduction in per-user rate variability as compared to V2I based networks. The typical vehicle's performance is also shown to improve considerably in the multilane highway setting as compared to a single lane road. This paper also sheds light on how the network performance is affected when vehicles can control their relative positions, by characterizing the connectivity-throughput tradeoff faced by the clusters of vehicles.

AB Technological innovation has been reshaping all walks of life, and the marine shipping industry is no exception. Autonomous vessels have gained significant attention due to their numerous advantages. However, regulatory constraints and expensive manufacturing costs are impeding the application of autonomous vessels. To overcome these challenges, this research conducts experiments with autonomous ships on national waterways with less regulation and develops a model to investigate their impact on shipping company operations. The model simultaneously optimizes ship routing, fleet sizing, fleet deployment, and demand fulfillment, taking into account demand uncertainty. Two solution methods, i.e., sample average approximation and a two-phase Bendersbased branch-and-cut algorithm, are proposed to solve the problem with acceleration strategies, including column generation and variable fixing. The performance of several solution techniques is tested through numerical experiments using real-world data. Besides, sensitivity analyses are conducted to further discuss the influence of key factors and derive constructive managerial insights for shipping companies.

AB The homing problem of autonomous underwater vehicle with constraints and bounded disturbances is studied in this paper. More specifically, a nonlinear model predictive control (NMPC) framework based on adaptive integral event-triggered (AIET) mechanism is designed for AUV tracking mobile docking station (DS). Firstly, according to the characteristics of AUV homing, a guidance system based on mobile DS is designed, which can provide a feasible reference trajectory for the subsequent AUV tracking independent of the vehicle model. Then, in the framework of AIET-NMPC control, the designed tracking controller can reduce the computational cost while guaranteeing the control accuracy. The proposed AIET mechanism can dynamically adjust the trigger threshold according to the integral error between the real state and the optimal state of the system. In addition, by designing exponential robust constraints in the NMPC optimization problem, the system stability margin is increased. Finally, it strictly proves the Zeno free behavior, the feasibility of the algorithm, and the stability of the system. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed control approach yields better effects in terms of tracking control performance and computational performance compared to other methods.

AB Simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) represents a crucial algorithm in the autonomous navigation of ground vehicles. Several studies were conducted to improve the SLAM algorithm using various sensors and robot platforms. However, only a few works have focused on applications inside low-illuminated featureless tunnel environments. In this work, we present an improved SLAM algorithm using wheel encoder data from an autonomous ground vehicle (AGV) to obtain robust performance in a featureless tunnel environment. The improved SLAM system uses FAST-LIO2 LiDAR SLAM as the baseline algorithm, and the additional wheel encoder sensor data are integrated into the baseline SLAM structure using the extended Kalman filter (EKF) algorithm. The EKF algorithm is used after the LiDAR odometry estimation and before the mapping process of FAST-LIO2. The prediction step uses the wheel encoder and inertial measurement unit (IMU) data, while the correction step uses the FAST-LIO2 LiDAR state estimation. We used an AGV to conduct experiments in flat and inclined terrain sections in a tunnel environment. The results showed that the mapping and the localization process in the SLAM algorithm was greatly improved in a featureless tunnel environment considering both inclined and flat terrains.

AB The transport sector is experiencing a fast and revolutionary development, moving toward the deployment of autonomous vehicles. Thus, the accuracy of the position information and the integrity of the navigation system have become key factors. In this article, we address the problem of the enhancement of the integrity of the position provided by a global navigation satellite system receiver by exploiting sensor fusion. To this aim, we estimate the lateral offset and heading of the vehicle with respect to a georeferenced roadway centerline from the images supplied by an on-board camera. Moreover, we perform integrity monitoring based on the implementation of the solution separation in the parity space. The numerical results indicate that the use of sensor fusion and digital map allows us to attain a longitudinal protection level reduction with respect to the case in which sensor fusion is not exploited. More specifically, a decrease of about 70% is achieved when a single constellation is used, while reduction is less relevant, about 15%, when two constellations are employed.

AB Autonomous vehicles (AVs) are expected and demonstrated to increase local traffic throughput and improve traffic stability. However, their car-following behaviour is not fully understood due to variations in their often black-box controllers. In this study, we calibrate the Intelligent Driver Model (IDM), as a widely used car-following model, for mixed autonomy traffic using real-world experimental trajectory data. We introduce a new variant of IDM, called adaptive IDM, by enabling real-time changes of its parameters based on prevailing traffic condition. We also include the standard deviation of velocity in the calibration objective function to capture the stop-and-go traffic behaviour. While the adaptive IDM parameters improve the AVs simulated driving behaviour, the inclusion of the standard deviation of velocity within the objective function enables reproducing the traffic oscillations observed in the experimental data. The results show that the proposed adaptive IDM and the calibration method successfully reproduce traffic patterns in mixed autonomy traffic.

ID FRAMEWORK; SYSTEMS
AB Internet of Vehicle (IoV) is an important paradigm to realize the intelligent transportation system. However, with the increasing number of vehicular applications, how to satisfy the ubiquitous requirements of communication and computation is challenging. Fog computing provides the real-time transportation services to local users timely through close-proximity data processing, rather than routing data to a remote central data center in the cloud. More importantly, the fog computing will facilitate the autonomous driving (AD) revolutionarily. This paper investigates the problem of optimal deployment and dimensioning (ODD) of fog computing-based IoV infrastructure for AD. For the ODD problem, we present two diverse architecture modes, i.e., the coupling mode (CRF) and the decoupling mode (DRF), and formulate the ODD problem into two integer linear programming formulations with the objective of minimizing the deployment cost. A heuristic algorithm is also proposed to achieve the sub-optimal deployment solution for large-scale fog computing-based IoV. Numerical results show that the DRF is more cost-effective and flexible than the CRF for deployment in practice.

DE Hydrodynamic interaction; Underwater vehicle; Submarine; CFD
AB When an Autonomous Underwater Vehicle (AUV) operates close to a submarine, interaction with the flow and pressure fields of the submarine can adversely affect the motion of the AUV. These interactions can result in uncontrollable motions of the AUV, which in extreme cases can lead to mission failure due to collision with the submarine or the inability of the AUV to maintain the desired trajectory. This paper outlines the steady-state interaction forces and moments acting on the AUV at different fixed speeds and relative positions to the submarine, with an aim to identify the regions where adverse effects due to interaction are minimal. The results presented in this paper are from a series of model scale and full scale Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) simulations on axisymmetric AUV and submarine models at diameter ratios between the two vehicles models of 2.239, 5.723 and 14.634. Validation was carried out for the lower diameter ratio at model scale using captive model experiments. Results show that the adverse effects of the interaction forces and moments were minimal when the AUV's centre of buoyancy is around amidships of the submarine, providing a relatively safe operating path for the AUV.

AB In this paper, we design distributed multi-modal localization approaches for Connected and Automated vehicles. We utilize information diffusion on graphs formed by moving vehicles, based on Adapt-then-Combine strategies coupled with the Least-Mean-Squares and the Conjugate Gradient algorithms. We treat the vehicular network as an undirected graph, where vehicles communicate with each other by means of Vehicle-to-Vehicle communication protocols. Connected vehicles perform cooperative fusion of different measurement modalities, including location and range measurements, in order to estimate both their positions and the positions of all other networked vehicles, by interacting only with their local neighborhood. The trajectories of vehicles were generated either by a well-known kinematic model, or by using the CARLA autonomous driving simulator. The proposed distributed and diffusion localization schemes significantly reduced the GPS error and do not only converged to the global solution, but they even outperformed it. Extensive simulation studies highlight the benefits of the various methods, which in turn outperform other state of the art approaches. The impact of the network connections and the network latency are also investigated.

AB This article presents a simulation-based framework to model the potential benefits from dynamic vehicle on-line routing in a distributed traffic information system based upon a vehicle-to-vehicle information-sharing architecture. Within this framework, certain vehicles with specific inter-vehicle communication equipment in the traffic network are capable of autonomous traffic surveillance and peer- to- peer information sharing. Based on real-time and historical traffic information, they independently optimize their routes, forming a self- organizing traffic information overlay to the existing vehicular roadway network. In-trip rerouting decisions arising from drivers' interactions with this distributed information system are modeled according both to a rational-boundary model and to a binary-logit model under the assumption that each driver is a rational entity. A path-based microscopic traffic simulation model is developed to study on-line vehicle navigation in the distributed traffic information system, testing nonrecurrent congestion cases on two different networks representing typical roadway scenarios in daily commuting. Based on simulation study results, potential benefits both for travelers with access to the traffic information system as well as for the traffic system as a whole are demonstrated.

AB To fully realize future autonomous driving scenarios, Internet of Vehicles (lay) has attracted wide attention from both academia and industry. However, suitable cost and stable connectivity cannot be strongly guaranteed by existing architectures such as cellular networks, vehicular ad hoc networks, etc. With the prosperous development of artificial intelligence, cloud/edge computing and 5G network slicing, a more intelligent vehicular network is under deliberation. In this paper, an innovative paradigm called Cognitive Internet of Vehicles (CIoV) is proposed to help address the aforementioned challenge. Different from existing works, which mainly focus on communication technologies, CIoV enhances transportation safety and network security by mining effective information from both physical and network data space. We first present an overview of Cloy including its evolution, related technologies, and architecture. Then we highlight crucial cognitive design issues from three perspectives, namely, intra-vehicle network, inter-vehicle network and beyond-vehicle network. Simulations are then conducted to prove the effect of CIoV and finally some open issues will be further discussed. Our study explores this novel architecture of Cloy, as well as research opportunities in vehicular network.

AB Night-time vehicle detection plays a vital role due to the high incidence of abnormal events in our daily security field. However, existing studies mainly focus on vehicle detection in autonomous driving and traffic intersection scenes, but ignore urban scenes. There are vast differences between these scenes, such as viewpoint, position, illumination, etc. In this paper, the authors present a night-time vehicle detection dataset collected from urban scenes, named Vehicle Detection in Night-Time Urban Scene (VD-NUS). The VD-NUS dataset consists of more than 100 K challenging images, comprising a total of about 500 K labelled vehicles. This paper introduces a vehicle detection framework via an active auxiliary mechanism (AAM) to reduce the annotation workload. The proposed AAM framework can actively select the informative sample for annotation by estimating its uncertainty and locational instability. Furthermore, this paper proposes a computer-assisted detection module embedded in the AAM framework to help human annotators to rapidly and accurately label the selected data. AAM outperformed the baseline method (random sampling) by up to 0.91 AP and 3.0 MR-2 on the VD-NUS dataset.

AB Conventional map-matching (MM) algorithms take blind eyes to the complexity in realistic traffic conditions and hence present significant limitations in distinguishing the detailed driving paths of vehicles within complex urban road networks. The popularity of vehicle-borne cameras and advances in image recognition technologies provide an opportunity to remedy the gap through integrating vehicle-borne image semantic information with MM algorithms. Following this logic, this article proposes a novel MM algorithm with semantic fusion from vehicle-borne images (VIS-MM) suited to the parallel road scenes. First, a multipath output algorithm is developed using the hidden Markov model to obtain candidate paths. Second, image recognition techniques are employed to extract vehicle-borne image semantics. Finally, the entropy weight method is performed to determine the most promising driving path among the candidate paths. The experimental results show that semantic fusion from vehicle-borne images contributes to a significant improvement of accuracy from 66.18% to 99.88% against the parallel road scenes. The proposed map-matching algorithm can be applied into the fields of unmanned autonomous navigation and crowdsourcing updating of high-definition maps.

AB This paper proposes a novel control method based on the virtual mass-spring-damper (MSD) theory to improve the platoon's system safety in mixed traffic flows consisting of connected and automated vehicles (CAVs) and human-driven vehicles (HDVs). To validate the proposed control method, two kinds of mixed platoons composed of five CAVs and one HDV are modelled and simulated by using CarSim and Matlab/Simulink. The simulation results demonstrate that when the HDV is at the head of the platoon, the maximum spacing error is 1.73 m; while the HDV is in the middle of the platoon, it increases to 3.59 m. Meanwhile, the inter-vehicle spacing errors do not amplify as they propagate along the platoon. Therefore, by selecting the appropriate stiffness constants and damping coefficients of the virtual MSD system according to platoon forms, the proposed control method can effectively ensure the stability and improve the safety of the mixed vehicular platoon.

AB Traffic congestion has become a serious issue worldwide due to the rapid increase in population and traffic demands. Advances in connected automated vehicle (CAV) technology demonstrate the potential to improve traffic mobility and safety performance at intersections. An advanced intersection control system is proposed in this study to coordinate vehicle trajectories and ensure safety and operation efficiency at intersections. A temporal-spatial dimension extension-based trajectory coordination model is developed by formulating all possible trajectories of vehicles at the intersection. Correspondingly, according to the trajectory coordination model, two signal-free control algorithms, including the priority-based algorithm and the Discrete Forward-Rolling Optimal Control (DFROC) algorithm are proposed in this study to manage vehicles at the intersection. These two algorithms, together with the FCFS policy, are compared with the conventional signal control method in a SUMO-based simulation platform. Experimental results indicate that the proposed algorithms outperform the signal control method in terms of reducing total traffic delays at intersections and increasing intersection capacity and operation efficiency.

AB This brief presents an embedded vehicle dynamics (VD) aiding technique to enhance position, velocity, and attitude error estimation in low-cost inertial navigation systems (INSs), with application to underwater vehicles. The model of the VD provides motion information that is complementary to the INS and, consequently, the fusion of both systems allows for a comprehensive improvement of the overall navigation system performance. In this brief, the specific VD equations of motion are directly embedded in an extended Kalman filter, as opposed to classical external vehicle models that act as secondary INSs. A tightly-coupled inverted ultrashort baseline is also adopted to enhance position and attitude estimation using measurements of relative position of a transponder located in the vehicle mission area. The improvement of the overall navigation system is assessed in simulation using a nonlinear model of the INFANTE autonomous underwater vehicle, resorting to extensive Monte Carlo runs that implement perturbed versions of the nominal dynamics. The results show that the vehicle dynamics produce relevant performance enhancements, and that the accuracy of the system is robust to modeling uncertainties.

ID FUZZY CONTROL
AB These days, mass-produced vehicles benefit from research on Intelligent Transportation System (ITS). One prime example of ITS is vehicle Cruise Control (CC), which allows it to maintain a pre-defined reference speed, to economize on fuel or energy consumption, to avoid speeding fines, or to focus all of the driver's attention on the steering of the vehicle. However, achieving efficient Cruise Control is not easy in roads or urban streets where sudden changes of the speed limit can happen, due to the presence of unexpected obstacles or maintenance work, causing, in inattentive drivers, traffic accidents. In this communication we present a new Infrastructure to Vehicles (I2V) communication and control system for intelligent speed control, which is based upon Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) technology for identification of traffic signals on the road, and high accuracy vehicle speed measurement with a Hall effect-based sensor. A fuzzy logic controller, based on sensor fusion of the information provided by the I2V infrastructure, allows the efficient adaptation of the speed of the vehicle to the circumstances of the road. The performance of the system is checked empirically, with promising results.

AB In this work, we solve the distributed formation control problem for heterogeneous spatial underactuated vehicle networks subject to switching topologies. We consider the spatial rigid body model of underwater and aerial vehicles with one translational actuator for propulsion and three rotational actuators, without any simplification. A distributed finite-time sliding mode observer is designed to estimate the ranges between vehicles based on the bearing angles, and thus, the control design does not require relative position or distance measurements. A coordinate transformation is proposed to define continuous reference velocity trajectories under switching topologies. Then, based on the cascade structure, a distributed formation protocol is presented which guarantees the global asymptotic convergence for the closed-loop system. The formation controller has a simple structure, requires only neighbor-to-neighbor information exchange, and all the measurements may be obtained using simple onboard sensors. Numerical simulations for a group of heterogeneous spatial underactuated vehicles including autonomous underwater vehicles and quadrotors are presented.

DE boundary detection; rivers; unmanned surface vehicles
AB The detection of river boundaries is a crucial branch of the intelligent perception of unmanned surface vehicles (USVs), it can be used to determine the driving areas of USVs, and also to ensure driving safety by limiting the effective drivable areas of USVs in the river areas. Aiming to detect the boundaries of incompletely structured river channels, this study proposes a real-time detection method for river boundaries based on a Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) sensor. The point clouds that are disturbed by the water surface noise are filtered firstly, and then the spatial and geometric features are extracted separately from the point cloud detected above the water surface. To prevent the error detection and missing detection, the boundary point information is predicted and calibrated in real time by Extended Kalman Filter (EKF). A planning track generation algorithm for coastal autonomous cruise without relying on high-precision maps, and a heading and distance adaptive control method by Proportional-Integral-Derivative (PID), and different driving line generation methods for driving along the narrow river and wide river are proposed respectively. The experimental data verification of river boundary detection shows that the algorithm is accurate, real-time, and robust.

AB Autonomous driving technology is expected to be applied to various applications with unmanned vehicles (UVs), such as small deliv-ery vehicles for office supplies and smart wheelchairs. UV remote control by a cloud server (CS) would achieve cost-effective applications with a large number of UVs. In general, dead time in real-time feedback control reduces the control accuracy. On remote path tracking control by the CS, UV con-trol accuracy deteriorates due to transmission delay and jitter through the Internet. Digital twin computing (DTC) and jitter buffer are effective to solve this problem. In our previous study, we clarified effectiveness of them in UV remote control by CS. The jitter buffer absorbs the transmission delay jitter of control signals. This is effective to achieve accurate UV remote control. Adaptive buffering time optimization according to real-time transmission characteristics is necessary to achieve more accurate UV control in CS-based remote control system with DTC and jitter buffer. In this study, we proposed a method for the adaptive optimization according to real-time transmission delay characteristics. To quantitatively evaluate the effectiveness of the method, we created a UV remote control simulator of the control system. The results of simulations quantitatively clarify that the adaptive optimization by the proposed method improves the UV control accuracy.

AB The tire forces of vehicles will fall into the non-linear region under extreme handling conditions, which cause poor path tracking performance. In this paper, a model predictive controller based on a nonlinear tire model is designed. The tire forces are characterized with nonlinear composite functions of the magic formula instead of a simple linear relation model. Taylor expansion is used to linearize the controller, the first-order difference quotient method is used for discretization, and the partial derivative of the composite function is used for matrix transformation. Constant velocity and variable velocity conditions are selected to compare the designed controller with the conventional controller in Carsim/Simulink. The results show that when the tire forces fall in the nonlinear region, two controllers have good stability, and the tracking accuracy of the controller designed in this paper is slightly better. However, after the tire forces become nonlinear, the controller with linear tire force becomes worse, the tracking accuracy is far worse than the controller with the nonlinear tire model, and the vehicle stability is also degraded. In addition, an active steering test platform based on LabVIEW-RT is established, and hardware-in-the-loop tests are carried out. The effectiveness of the designed controller is verified.

AB This study addresses subsea search applications where an autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) is tasked with finding the target density in a given search region within finite time. We assume that AUV is equipped with a side-scan sonar sensor that detects the targets at the sampled location. We consider that sensor performance is dependent on local environmental conditions (e.g., clutter density, sediment type) that vary throughout the search region, and we presume that environmental conditions are unknown or partially known. Due to uncertain and varying environmental conditions, resulting search performance is also uncertain and it varies by location. This paper specifically considers the cases where environmental information can be acquired either by a separate vehicle or by the same vehicle that performs the search task. Our main contribution is to formally derive a decision-theoretic cost function to compute the locations where the environmental information should be acquired so that the performance of the search task can be improved. For the cases where computing the optimal locations to sample the environment is computationally expensive, we offer an approximation approach that yields provable near-optimal paths. We show that our decision-theoretic cost function outperforms the information-maximization approach, which is often employed in similar applications.

ID SHARED CONTROL; SYSTEM; DESIGN
AB Run-off-Road crashes are often associated with excessive speed in curves, which may happen when a driver is distracted or fails to compensate for reduced surface friction. This work introduces an Automated Emergency Cornering (AEC) system to protect against the major effects of over-speeding on curves, especially lateral deviation leading to lane or road departure. The AEC architecture has two levels: an upper level to perform motion planning, based on the optimal control of a nonlinear particle model, and a lower level to distribute the resulting two-dimensional acceleration reference to the available actuators. The lower level adopts the recently introduced Modified Hamiltonian Algorithm (MHA), which continuously adjusts the priority between mass-centre acceleration and yaw moment demands derived from lateral stability targets. AEC makes use of a high precision map and triggers control interventions based on vehicle kinematic states and detailed road geometry. To avoid false-positive interventions, AEC is triggered only when excessive road departure is predicted for the optimal particle motion. AEC then takes control of steering and individual wheel brake actuators to perform autonomous motion control for speed and path curvature at the limits of available friction. The AEC system is tested and evaluated using the high-fidelity simulation software CarMaker.

AB Detection and classification of moving objects is essential for autonomous driving. To tackle this problem, this paper proposes an object classification method at detection level using a single LiDAR sensor. The aim is to extract and classify all the moving vehicles, bicyclists, and pedestrians in front of the sensor. First, the point clouds are segmented to produce distinct groups of points representing different objects, where the line segments are extracted. A segmentation combination strategy is conducted to address the over-segmentation caused by occlusion. Then, considering the object geometry and reflection intensity, several features for classification are defined and extracted from different hand-labelled object classes. Reference ranges of all the features are generated on a set of experiment samples. Finally, the object class can be decided by checking if its features match with the existing feature reference ranges of a certain class. The proposed method was evaluated using datasets gathered by the vehicle demonstrator, and the experiment results show considerable improvement of classification performance compared to an existing object classification method based on the object matching framework.

TI Underwater vehicle design using integrated plant-controller optimization

SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF SYSTEMS SCIENCE
LA English
DT Article
AB This paper addresses the problem of integrated design of autonomous underwater vehicle (A UV) plant parameters and feedback controllers to meet mission performance requirements with minimum energy expenditure. This research topic has been motivated by the fact that significant energy savings and increased dynamic performance can in principle be obtained if the process of control system design is integrated with the design of the vehicle itself, thus departing considerably front the classical approach whereby the plant structure is essentially fixed a priori. As a first step towards the solution of this general problem, the following simpler problem is addressed and solved: given an AUV(with a fixed baseline configuration) that is required to operate over a finite set of representative trim conditions in the vertical plane in the course of a given mission scenario, determine the optimal size of the bow and stern planes so that the average propulsion power required to execute that mission is minimized. The minimization process is subject to open-loop stability requirements, and to the existence of stabilizing feedback controllers that can meet time and frequency closed-loop requirements about each trim condition. The paper introduces a methodology to solve this combined plant-controller optimization problem in the framework of convex optimization theory and describes its application to the selection of the optimal size of bow and stern planes for a prototype autonomous vehicle.

AB The effectiveness of Autonomous Underwater Vehicles (AUVs) in diverse underwater tasks is heavily reliant on their ability to perform accurate trajectory tracking. However, due to uncertainties in AUVs modeling and the complex underwater environment disturbances, designing effective trajectory tracking controllers and disturbance observers for AUVs is still a major challenge. To address these uncertainties and enable faster convergence of tracking errors, a trajectory-tracking controller based on fixed-time sliding mode control (FTSMC) and a Radial Basis function neural network (RBFNN) observer are used in this paper. In most cases, the AUV platform carries limited computational resources. In most cases, AUV platforms carry limited computational resources, which restricts the practical use of online neural network methods, and it is particularly important to reduce the complexity of computational neural networks and enhance the real-time performance of the observer. Therefore, we adopted a fast online weight update strategy based on a single parameter. Considering actuator faults and input saturation, passive fault-tolerant control (PFTC) is used in this scheme to further reduce the computational burden. Furthermore, the Lyapunov method is used to demonstrate the fixed-time stability of the individual signals of the system. Finally, simulation results and theoretical analysis demonstrate the superiority and effectiveness of the proposed method.

AB Limitations of crash data and crash-based methods have given rise to the study of alternate measures of safety that are not predicated on the occurrence of a crash such as traffic conflicts. The popularity of these alternative safety measures will likely play a prominent role in road safety analysis in the forthcoming era of connected and autonomous vehicles because of the vast amount of real-time vehicle data that are likely to be available. While traffic conflicts and crashes share the same failure mechanism in the driving process, which allows models of crash frequency and severity to be applied to model conflict frequency and severity, modeling traffic conflicts has new challenges because of their distinct characteristics. This paper provides a comprehensive review of research studies that have used traffic conflicts as a safety measure, and to present conceptual and methodological issues associated with these studies. It is found that although substantial progress has been made in the modeling methodologies of traffic conflicts over the years, more research efforts are needed. Some promising directions for future research are outlined and discussed. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB This paper addresses the time-optimal trajectory planning for autonomous underwater vehicles. A detailed mixed integer nonlinear programming (MINLP) model is presented, explicitly taking into account vehicle kinematic constraints, obstacle avoidance, and a nonlinear flow field to represent the ocean current. MINLP problems pose great challenges because of the combinatorial complexity and nonconvexities introduced by the nature of the flow field. A novel solution approach in an optimization framework is developed to address associated difficulties. The main benefit of the proposed methodology is the ability to find multiple local minima. The contribution of the paper is fourfold: (1) a novel approach to integrate the flow field into the MINLP model; (2) a diversified initialization strategy using multiple waypoints, different solvers and approximated models, namely, a mixed integer linear programming model and the MINLP model with and without the flow field; (3) an algorithm that forces the solver to seek improved solutions; and (4) a parallel computing approach capitalizing on diversified initialization. The performance of the resulting methodology is illustrated on idealized case studies, and the results are used to gain insight into trajectory planning in the presence of flow fields.

AB A sliding mode controller with a nonlinear disturbance observer is proposed and developed to control a farm vehicle to accurately track a specified path. The vehicle is subjected to lateral and longitudinal slips at front and rear wheels. The unpredictability of ground contact forces which occur at the wheels while traversing undulating, rough and sloping terrains require the controllers to be sufficiently robust to ensure stability. The work presented in this paper is directed at the practicality of its application with both matched and unmatched uncertainties considered in the controller design. The controller is designed using an offset model derived from the kinematic model and its operation is verified by simulation and field experiments. In the simulations, the kinematic model based controller is used to control both a kinematic model and a dynamic model of a tractor to verify the performance of the kinematic model based controller. The proposed controller is compared with two other nonlinear controllers, namely, back stepping control and model predictive control. In the field experiments, the three controller were used to control the physical tractor to follow a specified path. Simulation and experimental results are presented to show that the proposed controller demonstrated the required robustness and accuracy at all times.

ID IMAGE SEGMENTATION
AB Nowadays, the surveillance and inspection of underwater installations, such as power and telecommunication cables and pipelines, is carried out by operators that, being on the surface, drive a remotely operated vehicle (ROV) with cameras mounted over it. This is a tedious and high time-consuming task, easily prone to errors mainly because of loss of attention or fatigue of the human operator. Besides, the complexity of the task is increased by the lack of quality of typical seabed images, which are mainly characterised by blurring, non-uniform illumination, lack of contrast and instability in the vehicle motion. In this study, the development of a vision system guiding an autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) able to detect and track automatically an underwater power cable laid on the seabed is the main concern. The vision system that is proposed tracks the cable with an average success rate above 90%. The system has been tested using sequences coming from a video tape obtained in several tracking sessions of various real cables with a ROV driven from the surface. These cables were installed several years ago, so that the images do not present highly contrasted cables over a sandy seabed; on the contrary, these cables are partially covered in algae or sand, and are surrounded by other algae and rocks, thus making the sequences highly realistic.

AB Information flow topology is crucial in the control of connected autonomous vehicles. It substantially influences the platoon's performance. This study provides a real-time switching topology technique for improving the platoon's performance under poor communication. First, a discrete sliding mode controller with a double power reaching law is designed for a nonlinear heterogeneous vehicle dynamic model with packet loss. Then, Lyapunov analysis is applied to ensure the platoon's stability and string stability. Finally, a two-step switching topology framework is introduced. The first step is to search for Pareto optimal topology offline with predicted imperfect communication scenarios. Then, the platoon's overall performance is optimised using a multi-objective evolutionary algorithm. In the second step, the optimal topology is selected and switched in real-time to reduce the control cost. The proposed method maximises the advantages of information flow topology. It deals with poor communication, improves the platoon's performance, and ensures stability. Numerical simulations were conducted to validate the proposed approach. Compared to a standard robust sliding mode controller, the suggested technique enhances platoon tracking ability by 97.73 percent, fuel efficiency by 9.96 percent, and driving comfort by 20.18 percent, respectively.

AB With the increasing popularity of electric vehicles, the number of end-of-life (EOF) electric vehicle batteries (EVBs) is also increasing day by day. Efficient dismantling and recycling of EVBs are essential to ensure environmental protection. There are many types of EVBs with complex structures, and the current automatic dismantling line is immature and lacks corresponding dismantling equipment. This makes it difficult for some small parts to be disassembled precisely. Screws are used extensively in batteries to fix or connect modules in EVBs. However, due to the small size of screws and differences in installation angles, screw detection is a very challenging task and a significant obstacle to automatic EVBs disassembly. This research proposes a systematic method to complete screw detection called "Active Screw Detection". The experimental results show that with the YOLOX-s model, the improved YOLOX model achieves 95.92% and 92.14% accuracy for both mAP(50) and mAP(75) positioning after autonomous adjustment of the robotic arm attitude. Compared to the method without autonomous adjustment of the robotic arm, mAP(50) and mAP(75) improved by 62.81% and 57.67%, respectively. In addition, the improved YOLOX model improves mAP(50 )and mAP(75) by 0.19% and 3.59%, respectively, compared to the original YOLOX model.

AB In this paper, an adaptive neural network-based feedback-linearizing controller is proposed to force an under -actuated autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) to follow a target with desired relative distance and angles in three-dimensional space. Towards this end, a new input-output model of the AUV is developed by defining a proper set of look-ahead position variables in a cone-shaped area in the front of the vehicle. Then, a nonlinear saturated PID-type controller is designed such that target tracking errors converge to a neighborhood of the zero while the prescribed transient and steady-state performance characteristics including desirable overshoot/un-dershoot, convergence rate and steady-state accuracy are guaranteed. This technique effectively prevents un-desirable transient state behaviour of the vehicle while reducing the risk of actuators saturation. A combination of multi-layer neural networks (NNs) and adaptive robust control (ARC) techniques is used to handle the compensation of model uncertainties including unknown parameters, time-varying environmental disturbances induced by waves and ocean currents and NN approximation errors. A Lyapunov-based stability synthesis is presented to ensure the semi-global uniform ultimate boundedness of the proposed closed-loop control system with a guaranteed prescribed performance. Finally, simulation results are given to show the effective perfor-mance of the AUV for practical applications.

AB Autonomous robots that assist humans in day to day living tasks are becoming increasingly popular. Autonomous mobile robots operate by sensing and perceiving their surrounding environment to make accurate driving decisions. A combination of several different sensors such as LiDAR, radar, ultrasound sensors and cameras are utilized to sense the surrounding environment of autonomous vehicles. These heterogeneous sensors simultaneously capture various physical attributes of the environment. Such multimodality and redundancy of sensing need to be positively utilized for reliable and consistent perception of the environment through sensor data fusion. However, these multimodal sensor data streams are different from each other in many ways, such as temporal and spatial resolution, data format, and geometric alignment. For the subsequent perception algorithms to utilize the diversity offered by multimodal sensing, the data streams need to be spatially, geometrically and temporally aligned with each other. In this paper, we address the problem of fusing the outputs of a Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) scanner and a wide-angle monocular image sensor for free space detection. The outputs of LiDAR scanner and the image sensor are of different spatial resolutions and need to be aligned with each other. A geometrical model is used to spatially align the two sensor outputs, followed by a Gaussian Process (GP) regression-based resolution matching algorithm to interpolate the missing data with quantifiable uncertainty. The results indicate that the proposed sensor data fusion framework significantly aids the subsequent perception steps, as illustrated by the performance improvement of a uncertainty aware free space detection algorithm.

AB Machine Learning has played a major role in various applications including Autonomous Vehicles and Intelligent Transportation Systems. Utilizing a deep convolutional neural network, the article introduces a zero-calibration 3D Object recognition and tracking system for traffic monitoring. The model can accurately work on urban traffic cameras, regardless of their technical specification (i.e. resolution, lens, the field of view) and positioning (location, height, angle). For the first time, we introduce a novel satellite-ground inverse perspective mapping technique, which requires no camera calibrations and only needs the GPS position of the camera. This leads to an accurate environmental modeling solution that is capable of estimating road users' 3D bonding boxes, speed, and trajectory using a monocular camera. We have also contributed to a hierarchical activity/traffic modeling solution using short-and long-term Spatio-temporal video analysis to understand the heatmap of the traffic flow, bottlenecks, and high-risk zones. The experiments are conducted on four datasets: MIO-TCD, UA-DETRAC, GRAM-RTM, and Leeds-Dataset including various use cases and traffic scenarios.

AB In terms of the non-singular terminal sliding mode control (SMC) method, this paper investigates a formation control problem for a swarm of autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) with nonlinear dynamic uncertainties and environmental disturbances. Based on the leaderless consensus framework, a distributed finite-time event -triggered formation control method is proposed for AUVs by considering collision avoidance. First, a novel finite -time extended state observer (FTESO) is proposed to estimate the system uncertainties of the multiple AUV systems. Then, based on the definition of cross-coupling control, a non-singular terminal sliding surface is constructed by a collection of position cross-coupling errors. It synchronizes the relative position errors of the multi-AUVs in finite-time specified trajectory tracking during simultaneous collision avoidance ability for multi-AUVs. Finally, the event-triggered control mechanism is designed for the formation controller to save commu-nication transmission resources. Then, the derived results are validated via comparative numerical simulations.

AB With the outstanding performance of unmanned surface vehicles (USVs) in maritime missions with scientific and commercial applications, increasing numbers of ships have begun to carry USVs to perform tasks. For the autonomous recovery of a USV along a preset trajectory to the docking station under various sea conditions, we propose a new navigation strategy with dual-attention-based optical terminal guidance. Monocular vision systems with creatively designed identification light sources are mounted on the docking station and USV, respectively. Thus, the azimuth angle, heading angle and relative distance between the docking station and the USV can be accurately measured. This method achieves centimeter-level homing accuracy and a 0.1-degree angle measurement error. A tracking control algorithm based on a line-of-sight method is suggested , and the control quantity of the USV is directly generated. Sea trials were conducted under various weather conditions to validate the proposed algorithm. This method provides reliable USV guidance to the docking station with a stern ramp from the maximum capture distance of approximately 100 meters. The proposed dual-attention method provides convenient implementation and transplantation to various unmanned platforms.

AB Both advanced driver assistance systems (ADAS) applied to the improvement of road safety, and autonomous navigation vehicle systems require more and more complex sensors and algorithms capable of obtaining and interpreting the information of the road environment. The greatest difficulties arise in analysing the information of the urban environments, because of the large number of elements which have different characteristics in urban areas. These systems require to interpret the information in real time to improve the decision-making. On the other hand, the stereo vision is usable in modeling systems because of the great amount of information that it provides, but at the same time, the algorithms based on this technique have a high computation time which makes difficult its implementation in real time applications. This paper presents an algorithm based on stereo vision for detecting obstacles and free spaces in urban environments and it has been implemented principally in GPU (Graphic Processing Unit) to reduce the computation time and achieving that it works in real time.

DT Article
DE Autonomous agents; chance constraints; optimization under uncertainty;

ID PREDICTIVE CONTROL; ROBUST; OPTIMIZATION
AB Autonomous vehicles need to plan trajectories to a specified goal that avoid obstacles. For robust execution, we must take into account uncertainty, which arises due to uncertain localization, modeling errors, and disturbances. Prior work handled the case of set-bounded uncertainty. We present here a chance-constrained approach, which uses instead a probabilistic representation of uncertainty. The new approach plans the future probabilistic distribution of the vehicle state so that the probability of failure is below a specified threshold. Failure occurs when the vehicle collides with an obstacle or leaves an operator-specified region. The key idea behind the approach is to use bounds on the probability of collision to show that, for linear-Gaussian systems, we can approximate the nonconvex chance-constrained optimization problem as a disjunctive convex program. This can be solved to global optimality using branch-and-bound techniques. In order to improve computation time, we introduce a customized solution method that returns almost-optimal solutions along with a hard bound on the level of suboptimality. We present an empirical validation with an aircraft obstacle avoidance example.

ID BEHAVIOR; MIDBLOCK; MODEL
AB Accurate recognition of pedestrian crossing intentions is essential for the safe operation of autonomous vehicles on urban roads. However, the current pedestrian crossing intention recognition model has the problems of relatively low recognition accuracy and short recognition advance time. Based on the above problems, this paper carried out a study on the recognition model of pedestrian crossing intention. Firstly, the pedestrian and vehicle crossing data were collected through laser radar and a high-definition monitor, and 1980 groups of valid samples were selected. Secondly, the pedestrian crossing intention characterization parameter set was determined through statistical analysis. Finally, this paper proposes a pedestrian crossing intention recognition model based on stacking ensemble learning. The ensemble learning framework integrates random forest (RF), support vector machine (SVM), long short-term memory network (LSTM), an attention mechanism, and bidirectional LSTM (AT-Bi-LSTM). Compared with traditional machine learning methods, the proposed method shows greater advantages in recognition accuracy. The model recognition accuracy reaches 95.36% when the model is recognized at 0.5 s before crossing the zebra crossing, and the model recognition accuracy is 89.27% when the model is recognized at 1s before crossing the zebra crossing. The research in this paper is of great significance for building a more intelligent pedestrian-vehicle collaboration and promoting the industrial application of the autonomous vehicle.

To create this kind of system, the following work was carried out: (a) a real time lane detection system is proposed, based on vision system functions, using webcam camera; (b) In order to detect curve lanes, deep learning is applied for lane detection, based on fully Convolutional Neural Network (CNN); (c) The cubic spline interpolation method is used for path generation, based on Global Positioning System (GPS) data, where distance between two adjacent path generation points is same. Compared with the connection method of the cubic polynomial fitting algorithm, the curve fitted path by the cubic spline interpolation method is smoother and more satisfied with the vehicle motion pattern; (d) Based on frenet coordinate frame, optimize trajectory planning method is used to plan safe, easy and comfort trajectory. Compared to the Cartesian coordinate frame, frenet coordinate frame simplifies the solution of road curve fitting problems, especially in the case of complex road environment; (e) Fuzzy sliding mode control method is proposed for vehicle steering control. Finally, the simulation and experiment results are used to prove the effectiveness of the proposed methods.

ID ALGORITHM; FUSION
AB For driving safely and comfortably, the long-term trajectory prediction of surrounding vehicles is essential for autonomous vehicles. For handling the uncertain nature of trajectory prediction, deep-learning-based approaches have been proposed previously. An on-road vehicle must obey road geometry, i.e., it should run within the constraint of the road shape. Herein, we present a novel road-aware trajectory prediction method which leverages the use of high-definition maps with a deep learning network. We developed a data-efficient learning framework for the trajectory prediction network in the curvilinear coordinate system of the road and a lane assignment for the surrounding vehicles. Then, we proposed a novel output-constrained sequence-to-sequence trajectory prediction network to incorporate the structural constraints of the road. Our method uses these structural constraints as prior knowledge for the prediction network. It is not only used as an input to the trajectory prediction network, but is also included in the constrained loss function of the maneuver recognition network. Accordingly, the proposed method can predict a feasible and realistic intention of the driver and trajectory. Our method has been evaluated using a real traffic dataset, and the results thus obtained show that it is data-efficient and can predict reasonable trajectories at merging sections.

TI Posterior Representation with a Multi-Modal Likelihood Using the
   Gaussian Sum Filter for Localization in a Known Map
SO JOURNAL OF FIELD ROBOTICS
LA English
DT Article
ID AIDED LOCALIZATION; SLAM; TRACKING; GPS
AB A Gaussian sum filter (GSF) with component extended Kalman filters (EKF) is proposed as an approach to localizing an autonomous vehicle in an urban environment with limited GPS availability. The GSF uses vehicle-relative vision-based measurements of known map features coupled with inertial navigation solutions to accomplish localization in the absence of GPS. The vision-based measurements have multimodal measurement likelihood functions that are well represented as weighted sums of Gaussian densities. The GSF is used because of its ability to represent the posterior distribution of the vehicle pose with better efficiency (fewer terms, less computational complexity) than a corresponding bootstrap particle filter with various numbers of particles because of the interaction with measurement hypothesis tests. The expectation-maximization algorithm is used off line to determine the representational efficiency of the particle filter in terms of an effective number of Gaussian densities. In comparison, the GSF, which uses an iterative condensation procedure after each iteration of the filter to maintain real-time capabilities, is shown through a series of in-depth empirical studies to more accurately maintain a representation of the posterior distribution than the particle filter using 37 min of recorded data from Cornell University's autonomous vehicle driven in an urban environment, including a 32 min GPS blackout.

AB This work provides a provably safe feedback control for nonholonomic vehicles that autonomously operate in an obstacle field. A barrier function with a tunable, exponential decay rate is used to obtain a safe steering envelope for the vehicle. The safe steering envelope adapts, in real-time, to the vehicle's velocity and its distance to the static obstacles. The safety control corrects steering commands provided by a nominal tracking control and prevents collisions between the vehicle and the obstacles. The safety and stability of the algorithm are proved analytically and verified via multiple experiments. The resulting safety control is modular and can work well with obstacles of different footprints. Since quick steering control is essential for successful vehicle navigation, a two-layer predictor is proposed to compensate for the time-delay in the vehicle dynamics. The two-layer predictor improves the control response time by as much as a factor of four. The safety and tracking control act on the vehicle kinematics, and the two-layer predictor improves the vehicle's dynamic performance. The proposed control structure has a closed-form with eight tunable parameters, which facilitates control calibration and tuning in large systems of vehicles. Extensive experiments are carried out on a nonholonomic vehicle to verify the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm.

AB Three dimensional path planner is crucial for the safe navigation of autonomous vehicles (AV), such as unmanned aerial vehicles or unmanned underwater vehicles, which operate in three dimensions. In this paper, we develop a novel 3D path planner, which is fast in generating a near-optimal solution path. The planner generates the 3D path considering the size of an AV so that as the AV traverses the constructed path, it does not collide with an obstacle. This paper introduces a 3D path planner with novel concepts, such as a virtual agent and virtual sensors. In order to generate a 3D path to the goal as fast as possible, we let the virtual agent deploy virtual sensors iteratively, such that the connected sensor network can be formed. The constructed sensor network serves as a topological map for the AV, and we find a shortest path from the start to the goal utilizing the network. The virtual agent's maneuver is biased towards the goal, in order to find a path to the goal as fast as possible. Moreover, the size of the agent is set considering the safety margin of the generated path. Through MATLAB simulations, we demonstrate the outperformance (low computational load and short path length) of our 3D path planner by comparing it with the 3D RRT-star algorithm.

AB A critical concern of autonomous vehicles is safety. Different approaches have tried to enhance driving safety to reduce the number of fatal crashes and severe injuries. As an example, Intelligent Speed Adaptation (ISA) systems warn the driver when the vehicle exceeds the recommended speed limit. However, these systems only take into account fixed speed limits without considering factors like road geometry. In this paper, we consider road curvature with speed limits to automatically adjust vehicle's speed with the ideal one through our proposed Dynamic Speed Adaptation (DSA) method. Furthermore, 'curve analysis extraction' and 'speed limits database creation' are also part of our contribution. An algorithm that analyzes GPS information off-line identifies high curvature segments and estimates the speed for each curve. The speed limit database contains information about the different speed limit zones for each traveled path. Our DSA senses speed limits and curves of the road using GPS information and ensures smooth speed transitions between current and ideal speeds. Through experimental simulations with different control algorithms on real and simulated datasets, we prove that our method is able to significantly reduce lateral errors on sharp curves, to respect speed limits and consequently increase safety and comfort for the passenger.

AB This paper presents a behavior-based intelligent control architecture for designing controllers which, based on their observation of sensor signals, compute the discrete control actions. These control actions then serve as the "set-points" for the lower level controllers. The behavior-based approach yields an intelligent controller which is a cascade of a perceptor and a response controller. The perceptor extracts the relevant symbolic information from the incoming continuous sensor signals, which enables the execution of one of the behaviors. The response controller is a discrete event system that computes the discrete control actions by executing one of the enabled behaviors. The behavioral approach additionally yields a hierarchical two layered response controller, which provides better complexity management. The inputs from the perceptor are used to first compute the higher level activities, called behaviors, and next to compute the corresponding lower level activities, called actions. This paper focuses on the discrete event subsystem, namely, the response controller. We illustrate the intelligent control architecture by discussing its application to the design of intelligent controllers for autonomous underwater vehicles used for ocean sampling missions. A complete set of discrete event models of the response controller of the underwater vehicles for the above application has been given, and their formal verification discussed.

DE Doppler velocity log/inertial navigation system (DVL/INS) fusion;
   loosely coupled; tightly coupled; autonomous underwater vehicle six
   degrees of freedom (AUV 6DOF) simulation; partial measurement
AB The Technion autonomous underwater vehicle (TAUV) is an ongoing project aiming to develop and produce a small AUV to carry on research missions, including payload dropping, and to demonstrate acoustic communication. Its navigation system is based on an inertial navigation system (INS) aided by a Doppler velocity log (DVL), magnetometer, and pressure sensor (PS). In many INSs, such as the one used in TAUV, only the velocity vector (provided by the DVL) can be used for aiding the INS, i.e., enabling only a loosely coupled integration approach. In cases of partial DVL measurements, such as failure to maintain bottom lock, the DVL cannot estimate the vehicle velocity. Thus, in partial DVL situations no velocity data can be integrated into the TAUV INS, and as a result its navigation solution will drift in time. To circumvent that problem, we propose a DVL-based vehicle velocity solution using the measured partial raw data of the DVL and additional information, thereby deriving an extended loosely coupled (ELC) approach. The implementation of the ELC approach requires only software modification. In addition, we present the TAUV six degrees of freedom (6DOF) simulation that includes all functional subsystems. Using this simulation, the proposed approach is evaluated and the benefit of using it is shown.

AB This paper proposes a capacity analysis model for a mixed traffic flow environment that considers the heterogeneity and maximum platoon size of connected vehicles. Firstly, we explore how the organization mode of platoon affects car-following characteristics in mixed traffic flow with connected and automated vehicles, connected human-driven vehicles, automated vehicles, and human-driven vehicles. Different car-following models are used to describe the car-following characteristics of different types of vehicles. Secondly, the probability distribution model is developed for the size of platoons considering the penetration rate and the maximum platoon size of connected and automated vehicles, connected human-driven vehicles. Thirdly, the fundamental diagram of mixed traffic flow is further derived based on the probability distribution of platoon size and car-following models. Then, the capacity model of mixed traffic flow is proposed. Finally, a numerical experiment is designed to evaluate the impact of different penetration rates and maximum platoon sizes of connected and automated vehicles, connected human-driven vehicles on the capacity of the mixed traffic flow. The results show that (1) with a low penetration rate of connected and automated vehicles, connected human-driven vehicles, the change in the maximum platoon size has no noticeable effect on the distribution of platoon size of connected and automated vehicles, connected human-driven vehicles. (2) Road capacity increases with the maximum platoon size and the penetration rate of connected vehicles. (3) Compared with connected human-driven vehicles, the penetration rate of connected and automated vehicles has a more significant impact on road capacity.

AB In this paper, a new sliding mode controller is proposed for the heading control of the submersible vehicle. Within a fixed boundary layer around the switch surface, since the fuzzy logic is applied, the chattering phenomenon is eliminated by smoothing the switch signal. Outside the boundary, the sliding mode control is applied to driving the system states into the boundary layer. Moreover, the switching surface with integral component is adopted for compensating the outside constant disturbances and eliminating the steady state error. In order to prove the effectiveness of the new controller, several,methods are compared and the simulation results show that the proposed new controller owns good performance of the heading control in the presence of uncertainties about the dynamics and hydrodynamic disturbances.

AB Robust detection and recognition of water surfaces are critical for autonomous navigation of unmanned surface vehicles (USVs), since any none-water region is likely an obstacle posing a potential danger to the sailing vehicle. A novel water region visual detection method is proposed in this paper. First, the input image pixels are clustered into different regions and each pixel is assigned a label tag and a confidence value by adaptive multistage segmentation algorithm. Then the resulting label map and associated confidence map are fed into a convolutional neural network (CNN) as training samples to train the network online. Finally, the online trained CNN is used to segment the input image again but with greater precision and stronger robustness. Compared with other deep-learning image segmentation algorithms, the proposed method has two advantages. Firstly, it dispenses with the need of manual labeling training samples which is a costly and painful task. Secondly, it allows real-time online training for CNN, making the network adaptive to the navigational environment. Another contribution of this work relates to the training process of neuro network. An effective network training method is designed to learn from the imperfect training data. We present the experiments in the lake with a various scene and demonstrate that our proposed method could be applied to recognize the water region in the unknown navigation environment automatically.

AB Rice is a globally important crop that will continue to play an essential role in feeding our world as we grapple with climate change and population growth. Lodging is a primary threat to rice production, decreasing rice yield, and quality. Lodging assessment is a tedious task and requires heavy labor and a long duration due to the vast land areas involved. Newly developed autonomous crop scouting techniques have shown promise in mapping crop fields without any human interaction. By combining autonomous scouting and lodged rice detection with edge computing, it is possible to estimate rice lodging faster and at a much lower cost than previous methods. This study presents an adaptive crop scouting mechanism for Autonomous Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAV). We simulate UAV crop scouting of rice fields at multiple levels using deep neural networks and real UAV energy profiles, focusing on areas with high lodging. Using the proposed method, we can scout rice fields 36% faster than conventional scouting methods at 99.25% accuracy.

TI Autonomous UAVs for Structural Health Monitoring Using Deep Learning and
   an Ultrasonic Beacon System with Geo-Tagging
SO COMPUTER-AIDED CIVIL AND INFRASTRUCTURE ENGINEERING
LA English
DT Article
ID DAMAGE DETECTION; NEURAL-NETWORKS; IDENTIFICATION
AB Visual inspection has traditionally been used for structural health monitoring. However, assessments conducted by trained inspectors or using contact sensors on structures for monitoring are costly and inefficient because of the number of inspectors and sensors required. To date, data acquisition using unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) equipped with cameras has become popular, but UAVs require skilled pilots or a global positioning system (GPS) for autonomous flight. Unfortunately, GPS cannot be used by a UAV for autonomous flight near some parts of certain structures (e.g., beneath a bridge), but these are the critical locations that should be inspected to monitor and maintain structural health. To address this difficulty, this article proposes an autonomous UAV method using ultrasonic beacons to replace the role of GPS, a deep convolutional neural network (CNN) for damage detection, and a geo-tagging method for the localization of damage. Concrete cracks, as an example of structural damage, were successfully detected with 97.7% specificity and 91.9% sensitivity, by processing video data collected from an autonomous UAV.

AB In the upcoming decades, connected vehicles will join regular vehicles on the road, and the characteristics of traffic flows will change accordingly. To better understand mixed traffic flow (regular vehicles and connected vehicles) characteristics, a generic car-following modeling framework for this new mixed traffic flow on an urban road under a connected vehicle environment is proposed in this paper. Considering a vehicle's speed, which is affected by the speed of the preceding vehicle, an improved intelligent driver model (IDM) is used as the car-following model for regular vehicles. An extended cooperative adaptive cruise control (CACC) based on the nonlinear dynamic headway strategy was established as the car-following model for connected vehicles. The fundamental diagram model of mixed traffic flow under different market penetration rates of CACC vehicles is investigated, and the traffic flow operation mechanism of connected vehicles is analyzed to improve the capacity. In addition, simulation experiments on urban roads are designed to evaluate the queue time and length of vehicles passing through congested sections under different market penetration rates of CACC vehicles. The results demonstrate that the proposed model can effectively describe the current situation of traffic flow on urban roads under different market penetration rates of CACC vehicles. The increase in the market penetration rates of CACC vehicles can significantly improve the traffic flow efficiency. When CACC vehicles reach 100% of all vehicles, the queue length on congested roads can be shortened by 64.6%, and the total travel time on congested roads can be reduced by 48.3%.

AB Following the successful development of advanced driver assistance systems (ADAS), the current research directions focus on highely automated vehicles aiming at reducing human driving tasks, and extending the operational design domain, while maintaining a higher level of safety. Currently, there are high research demands in academia and industry to predict driver intention and understating driver readiness, e.g. in response to a "take-over request" when a transition from automated driving mode to human mode is needed. A driver intention prediction system can assess the driver's readiness for a safe takeover transition. In this study, a novel deep neural network framework is developed by adopting and adapting the DenseNet, long short-term memory, attention, FlowNet2, and RAFT models to anticipate the diver maneuver intention. Using the public "Brain4Cars" dataset, the driver maneuver intention will be predicted up to 4 s in advance, before the commencement of the driver's action. The driver intention prediction is assessed based on 1) in-cabin 2) out-cabin (road) and 3) both in-out cabin video data. Utilizing K-fold cross-validation, the performance of the model is evaluated using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score metrics. The experiments show the proposed DIPNet model outperforms the state-of-the-art in the majority of the driving scenarios.

AB A resilient positioning, navigation, and timing (PNT) system is a necessity for the robust navigation of autonomous vehicles (AVs). A global navigation satellite system (GNSS) provides satellite-based PNT services. However, a spoofer can tamper the authentic GNSS signal and could transmit wrong position information to an AV. Therefore, an AV must have the capability of real-time detection of spoofing attacks related to PNT receivers, whereby it will help the end-user (the AV in this case) to navigate safely even if the GNSS is compromised. This paper aims to develop a deep reinforcement learning (RL)-based turn-by-turn spoofing attack detection method using low-cost in-vehicle sensor data. We have utilized the Honda Research Institute Driving Dataset to create attack and non-attack datasets to develop a deep RL model and have evaluated the performance of the deep RL-based attack detection model. We find that the accuracy of the deep RL model ranges from 99.99% to 100%, and the recall value is 100%. Furthermore, the precision ranges from 93.44% to 100%, and the f1 score ranges from 96.61% to 100%. Overall, the analyses reveal that the RL model is effective in turn-by-turn spoofing attack detection.

AB We develop an accurate partial differential equation-based methodology that predicts the time-optimal paths of autonomous vehicles navigating in any continuous, strong, and dynamic ocean currents, obviating the need for heuristics. The goal is to predict a sequence of steering directions so that vehicles can best utilize or avoid currents to minimize their travel time. Inspired by the level set method, we derive and demonstrate that a modified level set equation governs the time-optimal path in any continuous flow. We show that our algorithm is computationally efficient and apply it to a number of experiments. First, we validate our approach through a simple benchmark application in a Rankine vortex flow for which an analytical solution is available. Next, we apply our methodology to more complex, simulated flow fields such as unsteady double-gyre flows driven by wind stress and flows behind a circular island. These examples show that time-optimal paths for multiple vehicles can be planned even in the presence of complex flows in domains with obstacles. Finally, we present and support through illustrations several remarks that describe specific features of our methodology.

However, the Global Positioning System (GPS) signal is usually denied in environments near or under bridges, which makes the manual operation of a UAV difficult and unreliable in these areas. This paper addresses a novel hierarchical graph-based simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) method for fully autonomous bridge inspection using an aerial vehicle, as well as a technical method for UAV control for actually conducting bridge inspections. Due to the harsh environment involved and the corresponding limitations on GPS usage, a graph-based SLAM approach using a tilted 3D LiDAR (Light Detection and Ranging) and a monocular camera to localize the UAV and map the target bridge is proposed. Each visual-inertial state estimate and the corresponding LiDAR sweep are combined into a single subnode. These subnodes make up a "supernode" that consists of state estimations and accumulated scan data for robust and stable node generation in graph SLAM. The constraints are generated from LiDAR data using the normal distribution transform (NDT) and generalized iterative closest point (G-ICP) matching. The feasibility of the proposed method was verified on two different types of bridges: on the ground and offshore.

ID COOPERATIVE OPTIMAL-CONTROL; OPTIMIZATION; CONSENSUS; SYSTEMS
AB The need for less fuel consumption and the trend of higher level of autonomy together urge the power optimization in multihybrid autonomous vehicles. Both the multivehicle coordination control and the hybrid powertrain energy management should be optimized to maximize fuel savings. In this paper, we intend to have a computationally efficient framework to optimize them individually and then evaluate the overall control performance. The optimization is conducted in series. First is at the multivehicle system's level where the distributed locally optimal solution is given for vehicles with nonlinear dynamics. Second, the powertrain management optimization is conducted at the hybrid powertrain level. We provide an analytical formulation of the powertrain optimization for each hybrid vehicle by using Pontryagin's minimum principle (PMP). By approximating the optimal instantaneous fuel consumption rate as a polynomial of the engine speed, we can formulate the optimization problem into a set of algebraic equations, which enables the computationally efficient real-time implementation. To justify the applicability of the methodology in real-time, we give directions on numerical iterative solutions for these algebraic equations. The analysis on the stability of the method is shown through statistical analysis. Finally, further simulations are given to confirm the efficacy and the robustness of the proposed optimal approach. An off-road example is given in the simulation, although the framework developed can be applied to on-road scenario as well.

AB This paper discusses a real-time obstacle avoidance algorithm and its implementation for an underactuated flat-fish type autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) in 3D space. The algorithm has been developed using multi-point potential field (MPPF) method and its real-time testing is carried out using hardware-in-loop (HIL) simulations. In MPPF method, a region of predefined radius on a hemisphere in the positive x-axis around the bow of an AUV is discretized into equiangular points with centre as the current position. By determining the point at which the minimum total potential exists, the vehicle can be moved towards that point. Here the analytical gradient of the total potential function is not calculated as it is not essentially required for moving the vehicle to the next position. The MPPF method is interfaced with dynamic model of an underactuated flat-fish type AUV and it is tested and verified using HIL simulation tool. The details of the dynamics of AUV, MPPF method and its implementation, development of HIL test bench and the simulation results are presented in this paper. The results show that the proposed MPPF method is very effective for obstacle avoidance in 3D space and can be used in the real-time control of the AUV.

AB This study examined the optimal sampling durations for in-vehicle data recorder (IVDR) data analysis, focusing on professional bus drivers. Vision-based technology (VBT) from Mobileye Inc. is an emerging technology for monitoring driver behavior and enhancing safety in advanced driver assistance systems (ADASs) and autonomous driving. VBT detects hazardous driving events by assessing distances to vehicles. This naturalistic study of 77 male bus drivers aimed to determine the optimal duration for monitoring professional bus driving patterns and the stabilization point in risky driving events over time using VBT and G-sensor-equipped buses. Of the initial cohort, 61 drivers' VBT data and 66 drivers' G-sensor data were suitable for analysis. Findings indicated that achieving a stable driving pattern required approximately 130 h of VBT data and 170 h of G-sensor data with an expected 10% error rate. Deviating downward from these durations led to higher error rates or unreliable data. The study found that VBT and G-sensor data are both valuable tools for driving assessment. Moreover, it underscored the effective application of VBT technology in driving behavior analysis as a way of assessing interventions and refining autonomous vehicle algorithms. These results provide practical recommendations for IVDR researchers, stressing the importance of adequate monitoring durations for reliable and accurate outcomes.

ID UNDERACTUATED VESSELS; PATH; AVOIDANCE; TRACKING
AB Docking trajectory planning for unmanned surface vehicles is challenging due to complicated obstacle-avoidance in the harbor and highly nonlinear motion equations. In this paper, a two-stage (i.e., searching and optimization) hierarchical method is developed for a safe and efficient solution. In the searching stage, we establish a grid map for the harbor environment. The unmanned surface vehicle is represented by multiple featured discs and an artificially-guided Hybrid A* algorithm is implemented to search a coarse collision-free path. In the optimization stage, we first estimate the total sailing time under time-optimal maneuvering assumptions. Given the discretization scheme, we resample state and control variables along the coarse path by interpolation. Then, we construct a series of safe sailing corridors along the interpolated results. The within-corridor constraints are used to reformulate the optimal control problem, and the interpolated results are used for warm-start. The developed method is numerically validated by two docking scenarios, where high-quality trajectory as well as profiles of control inputs can be obtained with satisfactory computational efficiency. Meanwhile, it shows superiority in robustness over traditional planning techniques in the presence of narrow waterways and concave harbor shores. An animation of the simulation results is available at www.bilibili.com/video/BV14D4y1t7QL/.

AB Several volcanic islands and submarine volcanoes exist in the sea connecting the Izu-Bonin Islands with the Mariana Islands, with trenches and islands formed by the submergence of the Pacific Plate under the Philippine Sea Plate. Although designated as a Marine Protected Area (MPA) in December 2020, the seamounts' biodiversity has not been sufficiently researched. Therefore, direct observations and specimen sampling were conducted on four seamounts in this area using a remotely operated vehicle (ROV), autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV), and baited cameras (BCs). The ROV survey was conducted for 2-4 days on each seamount and divided into shallow and deep areas. During the expedition, 20 orders and 51 families of 81 deep-sea fish species were observed, including several potentially undescribed species, new genus or species records from Japanese waters, new depth records, new ecological information, and several rare fishes. The fish fauna and biodiversity abundance clearly differed among the seamounts; the seamount with a hydrothermal vent had the lowest diversity among the four seamounts. In shallow water, 23, 7, and 12 species were recorded only by ROV, AUV, and BC, respectively, indicating that combining these methods is beneficial for understanding the fish fauna of seamounts.

AB Target detection plays a key role in the safe driving of autonomous vehicles. At present, most studies use single sensor to collect obstacle information, but single sensor cannot deal with the complex urban road environment, and the rate of missed detection is high. Therefore, this paper presents a detection fusion system with integrating LiDAR and color camera. Based on the original You Only Look Once (YOLO) algorithm, the second detection scheme is proposed to improve the YOLO algorithm for dim targets such as non-motorized vehicles and pedestrians. Many image samples are used to train the YOLO algorithm to obtain the relevant parameters and establish the target detection model. Then, the decision level fusion of sensors is introduced to fuse the color image and the depth image to improve the accuracy of the target detection. Finally, the test samples are used to verify the decision level fusion. The results show that the improved YOLO algorithm and decision level fusion have high accuracy of target detection, can meet the need of real-time, and can reduce the rate of missed detection of dim targets such as non-motor vehicles and pedestrians. Thus, the method in this paper, under the premise of considering accuracy and real-time, has better performance and larger application prospect.

AB A guidance strategy conforming to the International Regulations for Preventing Collisions at Sea (COLREGs) is introduced in this paper such that its objective effectively combines unmanned surface vehicle (USV) dynamics with the obstacle avoidance process. The strategy is divided into the global path-guided and local reactive layers based on expanded Theta* (ETheta*) and improved artificial potential field (IAPF). The global layer constructs a nominal mapping relation (NMR) through running the ETheta* reversely. The USV is guided by sub-targets extracted from the NMR to steer clear of all stationary obstacles and reach the destination. The local layer generates the double-attractive potential of adjacent sub-targets and grid-based repulsive potential of irregular shape stationary obstacles. A COLREGs-compliant repulsive potential is additionally created when the USV detects the danger of collision. Taking the gradient of steepest descent in total potential field as the desired heading, PID method is used to control the USV navigation and realize the autonomous obstacle avoidance. The whole guidance strategy is modeled and simulated on unblocked and real maps respectively for some complicated scenarios. The results show that, with this guidance strategy, the vehicle avoids other target ships and obeys COLREGs with appropriate USV dynamics.

AB Demand for precise vehicle positioning (VP) increases as autonomous vehicles have recently been drawing attention. This paper proposes a scheme for positioning vehicles on the move based on optical camera communication (OCC) technology in the vehicle-to-infrastructure (V2I) environment. Light-emitting diode (LED) streetlights and vehicle cameras are used as transmitters and receivers respectively. Regions of streetlights are detected and traced by examining images that are obtained from cameras of vehicles. Then, a scheme for analyzing visible light data extracted from the images is proposed. The proposed vehicle positioning scheme uses information on angles between vectors that are formed under the collinearity conditions between the absolute coordinates of at least three received streetlights, and the coordinates of an image sensor. The experiments are performed under stationary state and moving state at a speed of 5 and 20 km/h. To verify the reliability of the proposed scheme, a comparison is made between the actual and estimated location of the camera in the stationary state. In addition, the path of a moving vehicle and the estimated path of the vehicle are compared to check the performance of the scheme. The performance of the proposed technique is analyzed and experimental demonstration confirms that the proposed OCC-based VP scheme achieves positioning accuracy of under 1 m.

AB This paper addresses some of the existing research gaps in the practical use of acoustic waves for navigation of autonomous air and surface vehicles. After providing a characterisation of ultrasonic transducers, a multistatic sensor arrangement is discussed, with multiple transmitters broadcasting their respective signals in a round-robin fashion, following a time division multiple access (TDMA) scheme. In particular, an optimisation methodology for the placement of transmitters in a given test volume is presented with the objective of minimizing the position dilution of precision (PDOP) and maximizing the sensor availability. Additionally, the contribution of platform dynamics to positioning error is also analysed in order to support future ground and flight vehicle test activities. Results are presented of both theoretical and experimental data analysis performed to determine the positioning accuracy attainable from the proposed multistatic acoustic navigation sensor. In particular, the ranging errors due to signal delays and attenuation of sound waves in air are analytically derived, and static indoor positioning tests are performed to determine the positioning accuracy attainable with different transmitter-receiver-relative geometries. Additionally, it is shown that the proposed transmitter placement optimisation methodology leads to increased accuracy and better coverage in an indoor environment, where the required position, velocity, and time (PVT) data cannot be delivered by satellite-based navigation systems.

AB This paper addresses the problem of distributed cooperative longitudinal control of automated vehicle platoons subject to a variety of uncertainties, including unknown engine time lags, external disturbances, measurement noises, and actuator anomaly in follower vehicles as well as unknown leader control. First, a unified framework is proposed for accomplishing resilient vehicle platooning, which empowers longitudinal vehicle state estimation, anomaly signal estimation and compensation, and adaptive platoon controller design to be addressed in a comprehensive way. Second, a novel scalable platooning control design approach is developed to guarantee desired platoon stability and resilience over generic communication topologies and various spacing policies. A salient feature of the approach is that the design procedure does not depend on any global information of the associated topology, and thus preserves essential scalability for large and/or size-varying platoons. Third, it is shown that the proposed longitudinal platooning control approach is promising for performing flexible cooperative maneuvers such as platoon splitting and merging that are beyond the capacity of most existing longitudinal platooning strategies. Finally, simulation results for different platoon maneuvers are elaborated to substantiate the efficacy of the proposed approach.

AB For the dynamic collision avoidance problem of an unmanned surface vehicle (USV), a dynamic collision avoidance control method based on an improved cuckoo search algorithm is proposed. The collision avoidance model for a USV and obstacles is established on the basis of the principle of the velocity obstacle method. Simultaneously, the Convention on the International Regulations for Preventing Collisions at Sea (COLREGS) is incorporated in the collision avoidance process. For the improvement of the cuckoo algorithm, the adaptive variable step-size factor is designed to realize the adaptive adjustment of flight step-size, and a mutation and crossover strategy is introduced to enhance the population diversity and improve the global optimization ability. The improved cuckoo search algorithm is applied to the collision avoidance model to obtain an optimal collision avoidance strategy. According to the collision avoidance strategy, the desired evasion trajectory is obtained, and the tracking controller based on PID is used for the Lanxin USV. The experimental results show the feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed collision avoidance method, which provides a solution for the autonomous dynamic collision avoidance of USVs.</p>

AB A novel dynamic resource allocation model is introduced for efficient sharing of services provided by ad hoc assemblies of heterogeneous autonomous vehicles. A key contribution is the provision of capability to dynamically select sensors and platforms within constraints imposed by time dependencies, refueling, and transportation services. The problem is modeled as a connected network of nodes and formulated as an integer linear program. Solution fitness is prioritized over computation time. Simulation results of an illustrative scenario are used to demonstrate the ability of the model to plan for sensor selection, refueling, collaboration, and cooperation between heterogeneous resources. Prioritization of operational cost leads to missions that use cheaper resources but take longer to complete. Prioritization of completion time leads to shorter missions at the expense of increased overall resource cost. Missions can be successfully replanned through dynamic reallocation of new requests during a mission. Monte Carlo studies on systems of increasing complexity show that good solutions can be obtained using low time resolutions, with small time windows at a relatively low computational cost. In comparison with other approaches, the developed integer linear program model provides best solutions at the expense of longer computation time.

TI Resilient path-following control of autonomous vehicles subject to

ID LATERAL MOTION CONTROL; THE-ART; SYSTEMS
AB An autonomous vehicle (AV) is a cyber-physical system (CPS) incorporating dynamics, perception sensors (e.g. camera and radar), embedded electronic control units (ECUs) and in-vehicle networking (e.g. CAN, LIN and FlexRay).Achieving path-following control of an AV to track a desired path is therefore a highly non-linear task that is naturally vulnerable to denial-of-service (DoS) attacks. Considering that DoS attacks can inhibit the services of a control system by overwhelming the performance capabilities of the ECUs or the bus, this paper investigates the cyber-physical system problem of path-following control for AVs under intermittent DoS attacks. To solve this problem, we propose resilient observer-based non-linear control based on the triple-step approach. The core ideas behind this method are the integrated design of the observer and feedback gains incorporating the DoS duration and the convex design of controller parameters by solving a set of linear matrix inequalities. The proposed control scheme guarantees that the closed-loop system maintains input-to-stable stability, while the error signals theoretically converge to a small neighbourhood of the origin. The effectiveness of the proposed approach is confirmed by the simulation results obtained for a high-fidelity veDYNA full-vehicle model with different driving tests and DoS attacks.

ID OBSTACLE AVOIDANCE; HORIZON
AB The collision avoidance (CA) system is a pivotal part of the autonomous vehicle. Ability to navigate the vehicle in various hazardous scenarios demands reliable actuator interventions. In a complex CA scenario, the increased nonlinearity requires a dependable control strategy. For example, during collisions with a sudden appearing obstacle (i.e. crossing pedestrian, vehicle), the abrupt increment of vehicle longitudinal and lateral forces summation during the CA maneuver demands a system with the ability to handle coupled nonlinear dynamics. Failure to address the aforementioned issues will result in collisions and near-miss incidents. Thus, to solve these issues, a nonlinear model predictive control (NMPC)-based path tracking strategy is proposed as the automated motion guidance for the host vehicle CA architecture. The system is integrated with the artificial potential field (APF) as the motion planning strategy. In a hazardous scenario, APF measures the collision risks and formulates the desired yaw rate and deceleration metrics for the path replanning. APF ensures an optimal replanned trajectory by including the vehicle dynamics into its optimization formulation. NMPC then acts as the coupled path and speed tracking controller to enable vehicle navigation. To accommodate vehicle comfort during the avoidance, NMPC is constrained. Due to its complexity as a nonlinear controller, NMPC can be time-consuming. Therefore, a move blocking strategy is assimilated within the architecture to decrease the system's computational burden. The modular nature of the architecture allows each strategy to be tuned and developed independently without affecting each others' performance. The system's tracking performance is analyzed by computational simulations with several CA scenarios (crossing pedestrian, parked bus, and sudden appearing moving vehicle at an intersection). NMPC tracking performance is compared to the nominal MPC and linear controllers. The effect of move blocking strategies on NMPC performance are analyzed, and the results are compared in terms of mean squared error values. The inclusion of nonlinear tracking controllers in the architecture is shown to provide reliable CA actions in various hazardous scenarios. The work is important for the development of a reliable controller strategy for multi-scenario CA of the fully autonomous vehicle.

AB In marine robotics, data-collection operations often require an autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) to collaborate with an unmanned surface vehicle (USV). The mission for the AUV is to reach many goal locations, avoid obstacles and unsafe areas, and maintain communication with the USV. The goals, however, are not known a priori, but are dynamically discovered by the USV as it moves along a predefined path. The USV communicates the discovered goals to the AUV along with rewards for reaching each goal to incentivize the AUV to increase the sum of the rewards when obstacles, time, and communication constraints make it impossible to reach all the goals. We develop a framework comprised of an execution module and a multi-layered planner to enable the AUV to avoid collisions, maintain communication with the USV, and increase the sum of the rewards by reaching many of the discovered goals. The execution module enables the AUV to follow the planned motions, invoking the planner when new goals are discovered. To facilitate navigation, the planner constructs a 3D roadmap that captures the connectivity of the environment by sampling and connecting waypoints in the free space. The high-level planning layer is based on informed discrete search to find roadmap paths that satisfy the communication constraints and increase the sum of the goal rewards. The low-level layer uses sampling-based motion planning to expand a tree of feasible motions along these roadmap paths. The layers interact to update the planned motions as new goals are discovered. Experiments using 3D environments and an increasing number of goals demonstrate the efficiency of the approach to solve dynamic multi-goal motion-planning problems with communication constraints.Note to Practitioners-This paper is motivated by the problem of at-sea data collection using unmanned vehicles where inter-vehicle communications constraints must be maintained. This is a challenging problem that has generally required significant human monitoring and intervention due to the communication constraints and planning challenges. In this paper, we leverage recent advances in underwater communications and focus on new problems that arise in the planning space, specifically, how we generate trajectories for an AUV that satisfies communication range constraints while still performing an underlying task. We show that it is possible to plan for an AUV in real-time while considering these constraints. This paper suggests that our approach can support these complex at-sea missions. Future research will focus on field deployments and introducing more uncertainty into the underlying sensor models during planning.

DT Article
AB In this paper, synergies between the recognition and tracking processes for autonomous vehicle driving are studied. Object recognition is periodically performed to focus attention on specific parts of the visual signal and to assign them symbolic meanings. Tracking is used to maintain correspondences between objects identified at successive recognition instants as well as to provide further features (e,g,, spatio-temporal trajectories) on which to base object-pose estimation. Results obtained by using complex road scenes are reported, which demonstrate the validity of the approach in terms of robustness, accuracy, and time responses.

AB Reinforcement learning (RL) is revolutionizing the artificial intelligence (AI) domain and significantly aiding in building autonomous systems with a higher level comprehension of the world as we observe it. Deep learning (DL) facilitates RL to scale and resolve previously intractable problems, for instance, allowing supervision principles designed for robots to be acquired directly from visual data, developing video game proficiency from pixel-level information, etc. Recent research shows that RL algorithms help represent problems dealing with high-dimensional, unprocessed data input and can have successful applications in computer vision, pattern identification, natural language analysis, and speech parsing. This research paper focuses on training a simulation model of a car to navigate autonomously on a racetrack using RL. The study explores several fundamental algorithms in Deep RL, namely Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO), Deep Q-network (DQN), and Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (DDPG). The paper documents a comparative analysis of these three prominent algorithms-based on their speed, accuracy, and overall performance. After a thorough evaluation, the research indicates that the DQN surpassed the other existing algorithms. This study further examined the performance of the DQN with and without & epsilon;-decay and observed that the DQN with & epsilon;-decay is better suited for our objective and is significantly more stable than its non & epsilon;-decay counterpart. The findings from this research could assist in improving the performance and stability of autonomous vehicles using the DQN with & epsilon; -decay. It concludes by discussing the fine-tuning of the model for future real-world applications and the potential research areas within the field of autonomous driving.

TI Fault-Tolerance by Resilient State Transition for Collaborative
   Cyber-Physical Systems
SO MATHEMATICS
LA English
DT Article
DE cyber-physical systems; platoon driving; resilient system
AB Collaborative Cyber-Physical Systems (CCPS) are systems where several individual cyber-physical systems collaborate to perform a single task. The safety of a single Cyber-Physical System (CPS) can be achieved by applying a safety mechanism and following standard processes defined in ISO 26262 and IEC 61508. However, due to heterogeneity, complexity, variability, independence, self-adaptation, and dynamic nature, functional operations for CCPS can threaten system safety. In contrast to fail-safe systems, where, for instance, the system leads to a safe state when an actuator shuts down due to a fault, the system has to be fail-operational in autonomous driving cases, i.e., a shutdown of a platooning member vehicle during operation on the road is unacceptable. Instead, the vehicle should continue its operation with degraded performance until a safe state is reached or returned to its original state in case of temporal faults. Thus, this paper proposes an approach that considers the resilient behavior of collaborative systems to achieve the fail-operational goal in autonomous platooning systems. First, we extended the state transition diagram and introduced additional elements such as failures, mitigation strategies, and safe exit to achieve resilience in autonomous platooning systems. The extended state transition diagram is called the Resilient State Transition Diagram (R-STD). Second, an autonomous platooning system's perception, communication, and ego-motion failures are modeled using the proposed R-STD to check its effectiveness. Third, VENTOS simulator is used to verify the resulting resilient transitions of R-STD in a simulation environment. Results show that a resilient state transition approach achieves the fail-operational goal in the autonomous platooning system.

AB The use of unmanned surface vehicles (USVs) to protect strategic maritime facilities is one of the directions of development of state security systems. The reliable operation of these devices depends on the immunity of their navigation system to targeted interference. This study presents the concept of an autonomous navigation system for the USV. The Doppler effect, which occurs in signals received from radio beacons with known coordinates of position, is the basis for its operation. Analytic expressions that describe the relationship between the coordinates of the current USV position and the frequency Doppler shift of the received signals are presented in this study. The evaluation of the effectiveness of this system is based on simulation tests for the selected research scenario. The navigation error along the entire trajectory of the USV motion is adopted as a measure for this assessment. Obtained results show the possibility of the practical application of the developed navigation procedure.

DE AUV; Design; Optimization; Efficiency
AB The needing to explore the depths of the sea is currently increasing. However, human exploration can be compromised due to dangers that divers face at great depths. The Autonomous Underwater Vehicle (AUV) has allowed underwater research to make a great stride and avoid human accidents. In such situation, designing an optimized AUV's hull is essential. To maximize periods of operation, AUV's hull must be outfitted to withstand harsh environmental conditions and minimize hydrodynamic drag. In this paper, a variant of torpedo body is proposed, with four Degrees Of Freedom (DoF) and capable of exploring the Caribbean Sea at great depths. Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) analysis and empirical methods are used to investigate the hydrodynamic resistance of the designed hull and estimate the drag, employing an optimization process and proving the effectiveness of the optimization algorithm with the profile efficiency analysis. The results demonstrate that CFD optimization methods have an influence on drag estimation. Furthermore, this paper shows that main factors impact the AUV design are the pressure on its body and the hydrodynamic drag. With results obtained based on CFD and empirical estimations, it was possible to achieve optimal parameters concerning the protection of internal hardware, the buoyancy of the vehicle and minimum drag to reach optimal energy consumption. Finally, the variation made to the typical torpedo body does not increase the drag of the vehicle.

AB Underwater gravity-assisted navigation is typically employed by submarines as a navigation method when external navigation information is not easily available, which necessitates the acquisition of gravity information through autonomous measurement. However, underwater gravity measurement research currently relies heavily on high-precision external navigation information, such as acoustic positioning, and lacks autonomy. Therefore, there is a contradiction between the existing underwater gravity measurement technology and the underwater gravity-assisted navigation application scenario. To solve this problem, a real-time, autonomous gravity measurement method specifically designed for underwater gravity-assisted navigation is proposed in this study. The proposed method achieves real-time, autonomous underwater gravity measurement with mGal-level precision by integrating classical gravity measurement principles, which involves a gravimeter, an electromagnetic log (EML), and a depth gauge (DG). To evaluate the proposed method's effectiveness, a semi-physical simulation was conducted through vehicle testing. The experimental results demonstrated that the proposed method achieved a precision of 1.01 mGal at 0.0033 Hz within the repeated measuring line.

AB Self-drive vehicles have the potential to revolutionise transport systems, however their adoption by mainstream users is highly dependent on a range of factors including trust. Moreover, perceptions of self-drive cars are likely to be highly dependent on the lived-experience of different road user types. Motorcyclists have high impressions of road-vulnerability and distrust for other road users. This distrust stems from the evidence that the vast number of motorcycle crashes occur as a consequence of other-driver error. We therefore hypothesised that compared with car drivers, vulnerable road users such as motorcyclists would report high levels of other-driver distrust, but high levels of trust in self-drive cars. We conducted semi-structured interviews with motorcyclists and car drivers and found that motorcyclists are indeed distrustful of other drivers but have higher levels of trust for self-drive cars compared with car drivers, while car drivers have low levels of trust for self-drive cars, but high levels of trust for other drivers. Motorcyclists were also more likely to report a perspective of trust that centred around their own personal safety on the road. This study provides valuable insights into different road user's perceptions of AVs.

AB Autonomous vehicles need to model the behavior of surrounding human driven vehicles to be safe and efficient traffic participants. Existing approaches to modeling human driving behavior have relied on both data-driven and rule-based methods. While data-driven models are more expressive, rule-based models are interpretable, which is an important requirement for safety-critical domains like driving. However, rule-based models are not sufficiently representative of data, and data-driven models are yet unable to generate realistic traffic simulation due to unrealistic driving behavior such as collisions. In this paper, we propose a methodology that combines rule-based modeling with data-driven learning. While the rules are governed by interpretable parameters of the driver model, these parameters are learned online from driving demonstration data using particle filtering. We perform driver modeling experiments on the task of highway driving and merging using data from three real-world driving demonstration datasets. Our results show that driver models based on our hybrid rule-based and data-driven approach can accurately capture real-world driving behavior. Further, we assess the realism of the driving behavior generated by our model by having humans perform a ``driving Turing test,'' where they are asked to distinguish between videos of real driving and those generated using our driver models.

AB Autonomous vehicles (AVs), as one of the cores in future intelligent transportation systems (ITSs), can facilitate reliable and safe traffic operations and services. The ability to automatically perform effective AV motion planning and deploy efficient perception systems is vital for advancing the quality of core transportation services. However, existing research studies have only considered the applications of either of these approaches, which neglect their necessary interactions in real-world AV motion planning systems. To address this problem, we design an AV motion planning strategy based on motion prediction and V2V communication. Specifically, we propose the perception system and V2V communication module to provide real-time traffic and vehicular information to the participated AVs. Then, we formulate the AV lane-change motion planning problem through the scope of model predictive control based problem, as well as proposing the method on learning optimal motion planning by means of a novel deep learning technique. We conduct extensive case studies to evaluate the performance of the proposed system model. Our experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed system model under various traffic conditions. In addition, the robustness of the perception system is guaranteed by utilizing the Car Learning to Act (CARLA) system with available V2V communication.

AB As an additional effort for exploring the unknowns about the ownership behavior of autonomous vehicles (AVs), we implemented an online stated preference (SP) survey in Japan and collected 1728 responses from car users across the whole country in 2016. The SP choice set included three types of AVs (conditional, high, and full automation) and a conventional vehicle. Each respondent answered three SP profiles. SP Attributes of AVs (additional purchase cost, reduction rate of insurance, reduction rate of permanent parking cost, penetration rate in the market, and release timing to the market) were defined relative to the conventional vehicle. Changes in future income were assumed based on each respondent's historical trend for assisting him/her to show more realistic responses. It was found that on average, respondents are willing to pay an additional 402,233 to 793,611 JPY to purchase an AV in the future. Estimating a mixed logit model with repeated choices and correlations between random-effect parameters following a normal distribution confirmed the significant influence of unobserved and correlated heterogeneities with respect to SP attributes. Both expected and unexpected results with respect to the random-effect variables are observed. Policy implications of analysis results are discussed.

AB The integration of cytometers with autonomous surface and underwater vehicles can facilitate a more thorough understanding of ocean plankton types and their spatiotemporal distribution. This paper reviews existing and emerging cytometers that could potentially be integrated, with an eye toward constraints and capabilities. Vehicles have payload size and power constraints that must be considered when evaluating instrument designs for payload integration. The candidate cytometer capabilities, including dynamic range for particle-size detection, must also be taken into account to accomplish mission goals.

AB This paper reports the implementation of a supervisory control framework and modular software architecture built around the lightweight communication and marshalling (LCM) publish/subscribe message passing system. In particular, we examine two diverse marine robotics applications using this modular system: (i) the development of an unmanned port security vehicle, a robotic surface platform to support first responders reacting to transportation security incidents in harbor environments, and (ii) the adaptation of a commercial off-the-shelf autonomous underwater vehicle (the Ocean-Server Iver2) for visual feature-based navigation. In both cases, the modular vehicle software infrastructures are based around the open-source LCM software library for low-latency, real-time message passing. To elucidate the real-world application of LCM in marine robotic systems, we present the software architecture of these two successful marine robotic applications and illustrate the capabilities and flexibilities of this approach to real-time marine robotics. We present benchmarking test results comparing the throughput of LCM with the Mission-Oriented Operating Suite, another robot software system popular in marine robotics. Experimental results demonstrate the capacity of the LCM framework to make large amounts of actionable information available to the operator and to allow for distributed supervisory control. We also provide a discussion of the qualitative tradeoffs involved in selecting software infrastructure for supervisory control.

AB The recent progress in unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV) technology has significantly advanced UAV-based applications for military, civil, and commercial domains. Nevertheless, the challenges of establishing high-speed communication links, flexible control strategies, and developing efficient collaborative decision-making algorithms for a swarm of UAVs limit their autonomy, robustness, and reliability. Thus, a growing focus has been witnessed on collaborative communication to allow a swarm of UAVs to coordinate and communicate autonomously for the cooperative completion of tasks in a short time with improved efficiency and reliability. This work presents a comprehensive review of collaborative communication in a multi-UAV system. We thoroughly discuss the characteristics of intelligent UAVs and their communication and control requirements for autonomous collaboration and coordination. Moreover, we review various UAV collaboration tasks, summarize the applications of UAV swarm networks for dense urban environments and present the use case scenarios to highlight the current developments of UAV-based applications in various domains. Finally, we identify several exciting future research direction that needs attention for advancing the research in collaborative UAVs.

ID NAVIGATION; SYSTEMS
AB Micro air vehicles (MAVs) are ideal for indoor precision farming due to their agility and minimal impact on surrounding objects. To achieve autonomous operations, these vehicles hardly rely on the commonly used Global Positioning System for indoor navigation and monitor plants with severely limited payloads. This paper proposes an autonomous MAV system that incorporates an ultra-wideband (UWB) system and a deep learning method to perform indoor navigation and localize unhealthy plants. The position of the MAV is estimated using an extended Kalman filter based on the trilateration results of the ranging measurements obtained from the UWB system. A multiple bounding box prediction strategy is used to analyze all the leaves of the plants and quickly identify their health conditions. Several deep learning models were selected and trained to detect unhealthy plants using field condition images. The model that achieved the desired combination of the accuracy and efficiency was fine-tuned with various image resolutions and sizes of negative samples to further improve its detection accuracy. Several real-world flight tests were performed successfully using the UWB system, and the plants were classified correctly with the selected model.

AB Artificial intelligence-empowered smart things (e.g., robots, autonomous vehicles, and unmanned aerial vehicles) have been transforming the world. The "brains" of smart things can be abstracted as the agents or cybertwins residing on end devices and edge servers. The next-generation communication networks (i.e., 6G) will become the nervous system for these agents and natively support multiagent cooperation. By sharing local observations and intentions via communication channels, the agents could better understand the environments and make right decisions. Due to the limited channel bandwidth, the communication is considered as a bottleneck of multiagent cooperation. In this article, we propose a graph convolutional communication method (GraphComm) for multiagent cooperation to relive the bottleneck. Specifically, a variational information bottleneck is used to encode the observations and intentions compactly. Furthermore, a graph information bottleneck with the attention-based neighbor sampling mechanism is utilized to improve the effectiveness and robustness of the multiround communication process. The experimental results show that GraphComm can improve the effectiveness, robustness, and efficiency of communication in multiagent cooperative tasks as compared to baseline methods.

AB Realtime localization and mapping in a cluttered and noisy indoor environment is a major problem in autonomous unmanned ground vehicle (UGV) navigation. this article proposes a Heuristic Monte Carlo algorithm (HMCA) based on the Monte Carlo localization and Discrete Hough Transform (DHT) to build an autonomous navigation system. Specifically, a generalized map-processing method is first presented for the Hough Transform Algorithm (HTA), which can extract and cluster important map feature information and preserve the low computational complexity of real-time processing. Then a set of relative rotation angles and corresponding spatial displacements of the robot are obtained by constructing hough spatial energy spectrum correlation functions as global and local 2D occupancy grid maps (OGMs). Finally, the result is used as the guiding particle set of the Monte Carlo location algorithm. In a simulated scene and a real scene, the algorithm is tested several times, the adequacy of the algorithm is verified, and a map with good self-positioning performance is constructed.

TI Edge-Assisted Privacy-Preserving Raw Data Sharing Framework for
   Connected Autonomous Vehicles
SO IEEE WIRELESS COMMUNICATIONS
LA English
DT Article
AB Data sharing among connected and autonomous vehicles without any protection will cause private information leakage. Simply encrypting data introduces a heavy overhead; most importantly, when encrypted data (ciphertext) is decrypted on a vehicle, the receiver will be fully aware of the sender's data, implying potential data leakage. To tackle these issues, we propose an edge-assisted privacy-preserving raw data sharing framework. First, we leverage the additive secret sharing technique to encrypt raw data into two ciphertexts and construct two classes of secure functions. The functions are then used to implement a privacy-preserving convolutional neural network (P-CNN). Finally, two edge servers are deployed to cooperatively execute P-CNN to extract features from two ciphertexts to obtain the same object detection results as the original CNN. We adopt the VGG16 model as a case study to illustrate how to construct P-CNN and employ the KITTI dataset to verify our solution. Experiment results demonstrate that P-CNN offers exactly the same classification results as the VGG16 model with negligible error, and the communication overhead and computational cost on the edge servers are less than existing solutions without leaking private information.

AB Road separations, intersections, and crosswalks, which are important components of highways, are seen as significant areas for autonomous vehicles and advanced driver assistance systems because traffic accident occurrence rate is considerably high in these areas. In this study, an image processing method and a deep learning based approach on real images has been proposed in order to provide instant information for drivers and autonomous vehicles, or to develop warning systems as part of advanced driver assistance systems to prevent or minimize traffic accidents. The information is obtained from the classification of images belonging to the separations, intersections and crosswalks on the road using a new model and VggNet, AlexNet, LeNet based on Convolutional Neural Network(CNN). We have obtained high classification accuracy with our model based on CNN. The result of the study performed on different datasets showed that the proposed method is usable for driver assistance systems and an effective structure that can be used in many areas such as warning both vehicles and drivers.

AB This paper presents a LiDAR-equipped unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) performing semi-autonomous wind-turbine blade inspection which includes traversing to the blade tip and back, while keeping constant relative distance and heading to the blade plane. Plane detection is performed applying the RANSAC method on a subset of the gathered pointcloud. Utilizing the relative distance to the inferred plane as well as its normal vector, the UAV is able to maintain a constant distance and heading towards the plane while moving in parallel with it. The proposed procedure performs successful wind-turbine blade inspections with minimal operator involvement. Inspection results include high-resolution blade images as well as a 3D model of the wind-turbine structure. Finally, to show the feasibility of this approach, simulations are performed on a wind-turbine model and experimental results are presented for an outdoor single-blade inspection scenario both on a mock-up setup and a full-scale wind-turbine blade. It is worth noting that the system's adequacy has been fully validated in real conditions on an operational wind farm.

AB The ability to perform long-range pedestrian detection is essential for autonomous vehicles. However, for 3-D LIDAR, an object's point cloud becomes sparse when it is away, directly affecting its detection as a result. In this paper, a novel density enhancement method is proposed to improve the quality of a sparse point cloud. The input of the method is an object's raw point cloud; first, a high-quality local coordinate system of the point cloud is built using a new evaluation metric, and then radial basis function (RBF)-based interpolation is performed based on the local coordinate system. Finally, a resampling algorithm is used to generate a new point cloud that not only meets a density requirement but also fits the object's geometric shape. Novel features of our method are its evaluation metric of a local coordinate system and method to choose a good shape parameter and kernel in RBF-based interpolation step. The effectiveness of this method is demonstrated using naturalistic data and three experiments.

AB In this paper, we present a new continuous smooth motion planning algorithm for autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) used in complex and dynamic underwater environments. Existing motion planning algorithms in artificial intelligence are not designed to deal with complex and dynamic continuous underwater environments prone to currents. We present a novel Fast Marching (FM) method to address the following issues. First, we develop an algorithm called Hybrid Search Fast Marching (HSFM) method, which gives consideration to both total path cost and computational time, to efficiently generate a 3D continuous smooth path from a discrete representation of underwater environments. Second, we develop a novel anisotropic FM algorithm to deal with underwater currents based on the geometric relationships between characteristic lines and gradient lines in speed profiles. Third, we introduce multiple decision criteria and constraints in complex and dynamic underwater environments such as currents, dynamic obstacles, reefs, shoals and navigation rules in motion planning process. Extensive random simulations for an AUV sail planning task show that the HSFM algorithm meets the time constraints of online replanning and finds continuous smooth paths of better cost in shorter time compared to the MSA* and A* algorithms.

AB The development of a high performance controller for a quadrotor unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) is a challenging issue since a quadrotor is an underactuated and a highly unstable nonlinear system. In this paper, the contribution is focused on the design and optimization of a controller for an autonomous quadrotor UAV. Firstly, the dynamic model of the aerial vehicle is mathematically formulated. Then, an optimal backstepping controller (OBC) is proposed. Conventionally, control parameters of a backstepping controller (BC) are often chosen arbitrarily. To this end, it is necessary to invoke a well-established optimization algorithm in order to find the best parameters. Here, the particle swarm optimization (PSO) is utilized as a new key idea to determine the optimal values of the BC parameters. In the algorithm, the control parameters are computed by minimizing the fitness function defined by using the integral absolute error (JAB) performance index. Since the control law is derived based on the Lyapunov theorem, the asymptotical stability of the system can be guaranteed. Finally, the efficiency of the proposed OBC is illustrated by implementing several simulation experiments.

AB Electric car-sharing services (ECS) have been promoted as a solution to combat negative urban mobility externalities and are expected to be facilitated by fleets of autonomous vehicles. There is little evidence regarding the behavioral intention to use autonomous ECS (AECS), especially on the transition from using ECS. This paper investigates the behavioral intention to use AECS using psychological constructs partially from the extended unified theory of acceptance and use of technology (UTAUT2) and an additional one expressing safety concern. A novel behavioral intention model is presented to capture the transitional behavioral intention to use two adjacent generations of sharing mobility services. Results of structural equation models applied to a survey sample of 2154 respondents from France, Italy, Netherlands, and Spain show that the introduction of AECS is very likely to be accepted by ECS users. Hedonic motivation is found to be a much stronger predictor of behavioral intention to use AECS as opposed to safety concern, while performance expectancy and social influence are strong drivers of intention to use ECS and have indirect effects on the intention to use AECS. Multigroup analysis indicates heterogeneous behavioral intention across countries. The multi-faceted empirical results generate insights into the deployment and management of AECS in various contexts.

AB Information fusion in automated vehicle for various datatypes emanating from many resources is the foundation for making choices in intelligent transportation autonomous cars. To facilitate data sharing, a variety of communication methods have been integrated to build a diverse V2X infrastructure. However, information fusion security frameworks are currently intended for specific application instances, that are insufficient to fulfill the overall requirements of Mutual Intelligent Transportation Systems (MITS). In this work, a data fusion security infrastructure has been developed with varying degrees of trust. Furthermore, in the V2X heterogeneous networks, this paper offers an efficient and effective information fusion security mechanism for multiple sources and multiple type data sharing. An area-based PKI architecture with speed provided by a Graphic Processing Unit (GPU) is given in especially for artificial neural synchronization-based quick group key exchange. A parametric test is performed to ensure that the proposed data fusion trust solution meets the stringent delay requirements of V2X systems. The efficiency of the suggested method is tested, and the results show that it surpasses similar strategies already in use.

AB Intraplatoon information management strategies for dealing with safe and stable operation are proposed in this paper. New algorithms to mitigate communication delays are presented, and Matlab/Simulink-based simulation results are reported. We argue that using anticipatory information from both the platoon's leader and the followers significantly impacts platoon string stability. The obtained simulation results suggest that the effects of communication delays may be almost completely canceled out. The platoon presents a very stable behavior, even when subjected to strong acceleration patterns. When the communication channel is subjected to a strong load, proper algorithms may be selected, lowering network load and maintaining string stability. Upon emergency occurrences, the platoon's timely response may be ensured by dynamically increasing the weight of the platoons' leaders data over the behavior of their followers. The simulation results suggest that the algorithms are robust under several demanding scenarios. To assess if current intervehicle communication technology can cope with the proposed information-updating schemes, research into its operation was conducted through a network simulator.

AB When it comes to climate change, automated vehicles (AV) are often presented as a key factor to reducing emissions related with the transport sector. While studies promise emissions savings of up to 80%, it is often overlooked how AVs will be introduced and which transportation mode changes will arise from their implementation. Therefore, this online survey examined usage intentions regarding private and shared AV types, and underlying attitudes and mobility needs of 136 current users of different main modes of transport. Two main results counteract the general assumption of ecological sustainability benefits of AVs: First, current car drivers prefer private over shared AV types, even though notable sustainability gains can only be expected from shared AVs. Second, current users of more sustainable modes of transport (walking, bike, public transport) would replace theses modes by AVs for substantial shares of their trips, which represents a behavioural rebound effect, since AVs cannot be more sustainable than walking or biking. Group-specific mobility needs and knowledge gaps regarding the sustainability of different AV types are identified as reasons for these results and as starting points for deriving necessary measures accompanying the introduction of AVs into society through motivating ecologically sustainable transportation mode changes.

AB The introduction of Unmanned Arial Vehicles (UAVs) in smart city operations is considered a sustainable technological solution due to the promised significant greenhouse gas emission reductions. This study developed an integrated multi-objective charging infrastructure coverage optimization model that integrates UAV-based operations with solar energy harnessing from building envelopes. This model maximizes UAVs' coverage range and minimizes the total cost of energy and decarbonization. The model is based on a flexible energy use model for UAVs calibrated to experimental measurements to generate a minimum-energy trajectory. We also developed an origin-destination (O-D) demand geo-referenced in a digital-twin model to replicate real-world operation. Overall, 12,532 simulated daily missions in a large-sized city are modelled. The results show that the proposed system can eliminate GHG emissions. Furthermore, the system can significantly reduce the decarbonization price through associated savings and excess generated electricity. The proposed approach demonstrates avenues to advance smart cities and capitalize on renewable energy.

SO IEEE JOURNAL OF OCEANIC ENGINEERING
LA English
DT Article
DE Estimation; ice; marine navigation; marine vehicles; motion estimation;
   terrain mapping
AB This paper presents a method for mapping translating, rotating icebergs with an autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV). To map an iceberg, the AUV first circumnavigates it, collecting multibeam sonar ranges and iceberg-relative Doppler sonar velocities from the submerged iceberg surface. The primary challenge is then to estimate the trajectory of the mapping vehicle in a noninertial reference frame attached to the moving iceberg. The collected multibeam ranges may then be projected from this trajectory to form a map of the iceberg's submerged surface. The approach of the method involves identifying the iceberg-frame locations of all the Doppler sonar measurements made during circumnavigation, allowing the AUV's iceberg-relative trajectory to be computed from those locations. The measurement locations are estimated simultaneously with the trajectory of the iceberg to be most consistent with the inertial-space positions, inertial-space velocities, distances between points on the iceberg surface as measured by the Doppler sonar, and alignment of multibeam ranges measured at the beginning and end of the circumnavigation. The measurements depend nonlinearly on the modeled positions and iceberg trajectory, and the paper presents a solution formulation that deals efficiently with the nonlinearity. By incorporating iceberg-relative vehicle velocity into the estimation, the method achieves two significant advances beyond prior work by the authors. First, and most significantly, the method adds ice-relative vehicle velocity measurements (e.g., using a Doppler velocity logger). This makes the method robust to common vehicle inertial navigation errors. Second, inclusion of iceberg-relative vehicle velocity data allows for the identification of a more general model of iceberg trajectory, making the method robust to changes in iceberg translation and rotation rates. Currently, no iceberg circumnavigation data sets are available that include iceberg-relative velocity from Doppler sonar. However, this paper includes results from simulated free-drifting icebergs, and experimental results from an AUV seafloor mapping dive. The simulation data provide a moving iceberg testbed with known ground truth for the mapping results. The seafloor data provide a qualitative verification that the method works with real vehicle data.

ID STRATEGY; VEHICLE
AB Autonomous Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) landing remains a challenge in uncertain environments, e.g., landing on a mobile ground platform such as an Unmanned Ground Vehicle (UGV) without knowing its motion dynamics. A traditional PID (Proportional, Integral, Derivative) controller is a choice for the UAV landing task, but it suffers the problem of manual parameter tuning, which becomes intractable if the initial landing condition changes or the mobile platform keeps moving. In this paper, we design a novel learning-based controller that integrates a standard PID module with a deep reinforcement learning module, which can automatically optimize the PID parameters for velocity control. In addition, corrective feedback based on heuristics of parameter tuning can speed up the learning process compared with traditional DRL algorithms that are typically time-consuming. In addition, the learned policy makes the UAV landing smooth and fast by allowing the UAV to adjust its speed adaptively according to the dynamics of the environment. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm in a variety of quadrotor UAV landing tasks with both static and dynamic environmental settings.

AB The primary challenges in underwater sensor networks (UWSNs) are energy-efficient data gathering, maximum lifetime of a network, very high energy consumption for data transmission, and constant variation in the topology of the network. Various techniques are proposed to tackle these challenges with different trade-offs. This study presents a novel technique to resolve energy consumption for UWSNs based on intelligent mobility of autonomous underwater vehicles (AUV). The proposed approach enables the AUV to select the best possible location in the network based on a higher number of sensor nodes, less residual energy of the sensor nodes in the specific area, and a limited delivery ratio from the specific area. The vehicle remains in continuous coordination with the base station sinks and based on the aforementioned parameters, it moves to its new position and collects the data from sensor nodes for maximizing the network lifetime and minimizing the propagation delay. The proposed method also focuses on the intelligent selection of transmission range of sensor nodes based on residual energy of the nodes to maximize the network lifetime and stability period.

AB This article presents an effective cruise speed estimation strategy for low-cost autonomous underwater vehicles under the impact of complex ocean currents and the absence of critical navigation sensors. The estimation strategy is based on the motor feedback information, including motor current and propeller speed. The cruise speed estimation strategy requires a rough speed estimation and minor adjustments to ensure that the estimated speed is valuable. In this article, the multiple fuzzy logic is applied to generate the mapping between the motor current deviation, propeller speed, and cruise speed deviation. Afterward, recursive least square is introduced to fine-tune the rough speed based on the reference propeller torque estimated by extended state observer. The experimental results demonstrate that the estimated speed of the proposed method can reach, on average, 96% of the Doppler velocity log measurement accuracy under the ocean currents conditions. The experimental results also illustrate that the method proposed in this article has strong robustness.

AB In this paper, we address the problem of reachable set estimation for continuous-time Takagi-Sugeno (T-S) fuzzy systems subject to unknown output delays. Based on the reachable set concept, a new controller design method is also discussed for such systems. An effective method is developed to attenuate the negative impact from the unknown output delays, which likely degrade the performance/stability of systems. First, an augmented fuzzy observer is proposed to capacitate a synchronous estimation for the system state and the disturbance term owing to the unknown output delays, which ensures that the reachable set of the estimation error is limited via the intersection operation of ellipsoids. Then, a compensation technique is employed to eliminate the influence on the system performance stemmed from the unknown output delays. Finally, the effectiveness and correctness of the obtained theories are verified by the tracking control of autonomous underwater vehicles. (C) 2018 ISA. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB The latest 5G mobile networks have enabled many exciting Internet of Things (IoT) applications that employ unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs/drones). The success of most UAV-based IoT applications is heavily dependent on artificial intelligence (AI) technologies, for instance, computer vision and path planning. These AI methods must process data and provide decisions while ensuring low latency and low energy consumption. However, the existing cloud-based AI paradigm finds it difficult to meet these strict UAV requirements. Edge AI, which runs AI on-device or on edge servers close to users, can be suitable for improving UAV-based IoT services. This article provides a comprehensive analysis of the impact of edge AI on key UAV technical aspects (i.e., autonomous navigation, formation control, power management, security and privacy, computer vision, and communication) and applications (i.e., delivery systems, civil infrastructure inspection, precision agriculture, search and rescue (SAR) operations, acting as aerial wireless base stations (BSs), and drone light shows). As guidance for researchers and practitioners, this article also explores UAV-based edge AI implementation challenges, lessons learned, and future research directions.

AB This paper develops an integrated safety-enhanced reinforcement learning (RL) and model predictive control (MPC) framework for autonomous vehicles (AVs) to navigate unsignalized intersections. Researchers have extensively studied how AVs drive along highways. Nonetheless, how AVs navigate intersections in urban environments remains a challenging task due to the constant presence of moving road users, including turning vehicles, crossing or jaywalking pedestrians, and cyclists. AVs are thus required to learn and adapt to a dynamically evolving urban traffic environment. This paper proposes a design benchmark that allows AVs to sense the real-time traffic environment and perform path planning. The agent dynamically generates curves for feasible paths. The ego vehicle attempts to follow these paths under specific constraints. RL and MPC navigation algorithms run in parallel and are suitably selected to enhance ego vehicle safety. The ego AV is modeled with lateral and longitudinal dynamics and trained in a T-intersection using the Twin Delayed Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (TD3) algorithm under various traffic scenarios. It is then tested on a straight road and a single or multi-lane intersections. All these experiments achieve desirable outcomes in terms of crash avoidance, driving efficiency, comfort, and tracking accuracy. The developed AV navigation system provides a design benchmark for an adaptive AV that can navigate unsignalized intersections.

AB The use of microprocessors to control various automobile operations is now commonplace, and further computerization can be expected as researchers extend their efforts to develop autonomous, self-guided vehicles. One of the most challenging research areas is road following, which requires the two basic functionalities of lane detection and obstacle detection. Thanks to the reduced costs of image acquisition devices and to the increasing computational power of current computer systems, computer vision has recently become a popular method for sensing the surrounding environment. The authors use an approach that extracts and localizes features of interest, thereby limiting the computation-intensive processing of images.
   A geometrical transform called inverse perspective mapping makes a SIMD (single instruction, multiple data) approach practical for processing data captured in stereo images. Besides contributing to obstacle detection, the left stereo image is used in lane detection. The use of a 3D surface called a horopter, moved onto the road plane by electronic vergence, makes it possible to locate obstacles and establish their distance and exact position in 3D world space.
   The authors describe the GOLD system, a stereo vision system developed at the University of Parma, Italy, for generic obstacle detection and lane localization. GOLD was first tested on an experimental land vehicle for more than 3,000 kilometers along extra-urban roads and freeways at speeds up to 80 kilometers per hour and is now being ported to the Argo autonomous passenger vehicle.

AB The problem of simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) in mobile robotics currently remains a crucial issue to ensure the safety of autonomous vehicles' navigation. One approach addressing the SLAM problem and odometry estimation has been through perception sensors, leading to V-SLAM and visual odometry solutions. Furthermore, for these purposes, computer vision approaches are quite widespread, but LiDAR is a more reliable technology for obstacles detection and its application could be broadened. However, in most cases, definitive results are not achieved, or they suffer from a high computational load that limits their operation in real time. Deep Learning techniques have proven their validity in many different fields, one of them being the perception of the environment of autonomous vehicles. This paper proposes an approach to address the estimation of the ego-vehicle positioning from 3D LiDAR data, taking advantage of the capabilities of a system based on Machine Learning models, analyzing possible limitations. Models have been used with two real datasets. Results provide the conclusion that CNN-based odometry could guarantee local consistency, whereas it loses accuracy due to cumulative errors in the evaluation of the global trajectory, so global consistency is not guaranteed.

ID RECOGNITION
AB For many years, Unmanned Aerial Vehicle Swarm (UAVs) have been implemented as stand-alone systems for various applications. Advances in technology necessitate the need for the complexity of the systems to rise to a level higher than ever. The capability needs today require the use of multiple systems to act together to accomplish a common goal that is unachievable with a single system. The use of multiple UAVs in an autonomous, or semi-autonomous, nature to accomplish this higher-level goal is known as a UAV Swarm system of systems. In designing a system with the complexity of a UAV Swarm there are many aspects that must be taken into careful consideration. This article will identify the SoS principles and considerations for developing and deploying a UAV Swarm for Battlefield Mapping using System Modeling Language. The design of the developed battlefield SoS will utilize standard Systems Engineering processes, adapted Systems Engineering processes for Systems of Systems, and architecture representation models. Each of these key utilities will be analyzed to provide guidance and considerations for SoS Engineering of the UAV Swarm.

DE convex decomposition; cellular decomposition; edge extension; coverage
   path planning; aerial surveillance and monitoring
AB To cover an area of interest by an autonomous vehicle, such as an Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV), planning a coverage path which guides the unit to cover the area is an essential process. However, coverage path planning is often problematic, especially when the boundary of the area is complicated and the area contains several obstacles. A common solution for this situation is to decompose the area into disjoint convex sub-polygons and to obtain coverage paths for each sub-polygon using a simple back-and-forth pattern. Aligned with the solution approach, we propose a new convex decomposition method which is simple and applicable to any shape of target area. The proposed method is designed based on the idea that, given an area of interest represented as a polygon, a convex decomposition of the polygon mainly occurs at the points where an interior angle between two edges of the polygon is greater than 180 degrees. The performance of the proposed method is demonstrated by comparison with existing convex decomposition methods using illustrative examples.

AB This letter introduces an intelligent Real-time Dual-functional Radar-Communication (iRDRC) system for autonomous vehicles (AVs). This system enables an AV to perform both radar and data communications functions to maximize bandwidth utilization as well as significantly enhance safety. In particular, the data communications function allows the AV to transmit data, e.g., of current traffic, to edge computing systems and the radar function is used to enhance the reliability and reduce the collision risks of the AV, e.g., under bad weather conditions. The problem of the iRDRC is to decide when to use the communication mode or the radar mode to maximize the data throughput while minimizing the miss detection probability of unexpected events given the uncertainty of surrounding environment. To solve the problem, we develop a deep reinforcement learning algorithm that allows the AV to quickly obtain the optimal policy without requiring any prior information about the environment. Simulation results show that the proposed scheme outperforms baseline schemes in terms of data throughput, miss detection probability, and convergence rate.

AB With the common use of lidar sensors on intelligent vehicles, the simulation of lidar in autonomous driving is necessary. This study proposes an innovative lidar modeling method, and introduces solutions for the simulation of the lidar detection function and its physical mechanism. The model consists of geometric and physical models, and can simulate both point clouds and targets. The geometric model addresses the spatial relationship between lidar and the environment. The physical model describes how the lidar detection mechanism may influence detection results. Signal attenuation and unwanted raw data caused by raindrops are the main consideration in the physical model. Characteristics of lidar signal attenuation in different weather conditions are modeled, and a simplified lidar equation is derived for use by lidar users, as opposed to designers. Unwanted raw data are simulated in a stochastic model employing the Monte Carlo method, where raindrop size and distance are sampled. The model is calibrated and validated with real lidar data. The application of the proposed lidar model for an autonomous emergency braking system is introduced.

ID AUTONOMOUS VEHICLES; MODEL; ALGORITHM
AB The present study proposes a framework for learning the car-following behavior of drivers based on maximum entropy deep inverse reinforcement learning. The proposed framework enables learning the reward function, which is represented by a fully connected neural network, from driving data, including the speed of the driver's vehicle, the distance to the leading vehicle, and the relative speed. Data from two field tests with 42 drivers are used. After clustering the participants into aggressive and conservative groups, the car-following data were used to train the proposed model, a fully connected neural network model, and a recurrent neural network model. Adopting the fivefold cross-validation method, the proposed model was proved to have the lowest root mean squared percentage error and modified Hausdorff distance among the different models, exhibiting superior ability for reproducing drivers' car-following behaviors. Moreover, the proposed model captured the characteristics of different driving styles during car-following scenarios. The learned rewards and strategies were consistent with the demonstrations of the two groups. Inverse reinforcement learning can serve as a new tool to explain and model driving behavior, providing references for the development of human-like autonomous driving models.

AB An innovative, satellite-guided search-and-rescue-system will be presented. This system utilises an autonomous rescue vessel to retrieve overboard personnel. The system acts instantaneously, which significantly increases the chance of survival. It was developed for use on special ships or offshore platforms, where workers are subject to adverse weather conditions and overboard personnel are often discovered too late. A substantial challenge is the automation of the autonomously acting rescue vehicle as well as its integration into the superior search-and-rescue-process. To ensure the fastest possible approach to the casualty without endangering the person, a cascaded control concept has been designed. Two-degree-of-freedom control concepts are used to separate the tracking performance from the disturbance rejection. The inner speed control structure is divided into two parts and consists of the control structure itself with an in-line allocation to the device configuration. The contribution mainly addresses the automation of the rescue vessel, the synthesis of the control system of the autonomously acting vehicle as well as the integration into the superior search-and-rescue-process. Finally, some test results of this complex system are shown.

AB Intelligent vehicles have increased their capabilities for highly and, even fully, automated driving under controlled environments. Scene information is received using onboard sensors and communication network systems, i.e., infrastructure and other vehicles. Considering the available information, different motion planning and control techniques have been implemented to autonomously driving on complex environments. The main goal is focused on executing strategies to improve safety, comfort, and energy optimization. However, research challenges such as navigation in urban dynamic environments with obstacle avoidance capabilities, i.e., vulnerable road users (VRU) and vehicles, and cooperative maneuvers among automated and semi-automated vehicles still need further efforts for a real environment implementation. This paper presents a review ofmotion planning techniques implemented in the intelligent vehicles literature. A description of the technique used by research teams, their contributions in motion planning, and a comparison among these techniques is also presented. Relevant works in the overtaking and obstacle avoidance maneuvers are presented, allowing the understanding of the gaps and challenges to be addressed in the next years. Finally, an overview of future research direction and applications is given.

AB In this paper, we present a visual simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) system which integrates measurements from multiple cameras to achieve robust pose tracking for autonomous navigation of micro aerial vehicles (MAVs) in unknown complex environments. We analyze the iterative optimizations for pose tracking and map refinement of visual SLAM in multi-camera cases. The analysis ensures the soundness and accuracy of each optimization update. A well-known monocular visual SLAM system is extended to utilize two cameras with non-overlapping fields of view (FOVs) in the final implementation. The resulting visual SLAM system enables autonomous navigation of an MAV in complex scenarios. The theory behind this system can easily be extended to multi-camera configurations, when the onboard computational capability allows this. For operations in large-scale environments, we modify the resulting visual SLAM system to be a constant-time robust visual odometry. To form a full visual SLAM system, we further implement an efficient back-end for loop closing. The back-end maintains a keyframe-based global map, which is also used for loop-closure detection. An adaptive-window pose-graph optimization method is proposed to refine keyframe poses of the global map and thus correct pose drift that is inherent in the visual odometry. We demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed visual SLAM system for applications onboard of MAVs in experiments with both autonomous and manual flights. The pose tracking results are compared with ground truth data provided by an external tracking system. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB In this letter, a new method of path planning for unmanned ground vehicles (UGVs) on terrain is developed. For UGVs moving on terrain, path traversability and collision avoidance are important factors. If traversability is not considered, the planned path may lead a UGV into areas that will cause rough vehicle motion or lead to the UGV getting stuck if the traversability is low. The proposed path planning method is based on the Hybrid A* algorithm and uses estimated terrain traversability to find the path that optimizes both traversability and distance for the UGV. The path planning method is demonstrated using simulated traversability maps and is compared to the original Hybrid A* algorithm. The method is also verified through real-time experiments in real terrain, further demonstrating the benefits of terrain traversability optimization using the proposed path planning method. In the experiments, the proposed method was successfully applied for autonomous driving over distances of up to 270 m in rough terrain. Compared with the existing Hybrid A* method, the proposed method produces more traversable paths.

Then, a collision avoidance condition is developed to determine a class of collision-free trajectories. Finally, a performance index is established to find an optimal trajectory from the class. All the steps can be implemented in real-time. The advantages of the proposed approach are: (1) The 3D motion planning problem is reduced to a 2D problem. Instead of directly searching in a 3D space, one only needs to determine two parameters in their plane. Therefore computational efforts are greatly reduced, which is suitable for real-time implementation; (2) The vehicle's kinematic model is explicitly considered, and all boundary conditions are met. After the parameters are determined, the trajectory and controls are explicitly solved in closed forms. This method is shown to be effective by computer simulations.

AB In this article, the fixed-time Nash equilibrium (FTNE) seeking problem of multiple autonomous surface vehicles (ASVs) is considered. As individuals fight for an allocation of specific shared but restricted resources, two novel FTNE seeking algorithms are designed for this topic through an error decomposition method. First, a model-based control algorithm with only one convergence time function in a single-layer structure is designed to achieve Nash equilibrium within a fixed time. Then, a FTNE algorithm with a three-layer structure is presented for multiple ASVs subject to system uncertainties. In particular, this paper proposes a hybrid fixed -time event-triggered approach for reducing controller update frequencies and communication frequencies of two algorithms simultaneously, which is capable of decreasing resource consumption in a constrained resource environment. Furthermore, rigorous sufficient criteria are established for fixed-time convergence through Lyapunov stability analysis, and the upper bound on settling time without the requirement of initial conditions is derived. Finally, simulation examples are given to demonstrate the viability of two algorithms.

ID UNDERWATER; IDENTIFICATION; LOCALIZATION
AB Accurate and robust navigation and localisation systems are critical for Autonomous Underwater Vehicles (AUVs) in order to perform missions in challenging environments. However, since the Global Positioning System (GPS) is not available in the underwater domain, the localisation task is commonly fulfilled by integrating direct linear speed readings provided by a Doppler Velocity Log (DVL) over time. As a consequence, DVL failures or fallacies and DVL-denied environments may arise as unexpected causes for severe malfunctions of the whole navigation system. Motivated by these considerations and the outstanding performance of Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) in supervised regression problems, a Deep Learning (DL)-based approach has been developed to estimate the vehicle's body-frame velocity, without canonically employing DVL measurements, in a Dead-Reckoning (DR) navigation strategy. In particular, this work will describe the whole framework, starting from the data gathered by the AUVs of the National Oceanography Centre (NOC) during different field campaigns, through to the data pre-processing and the inference of the predicted velocity. Finally, a comprehensive offline comparison between different DL-based models is presented to assess the validity of the proposed approach.

ID ROAD DETECTION
AB This paper presents a field-programmable gate array (FPGA) design of a segmentation algorithm based on convolutional neural network (CNN) that can process light detection and ranging (LiDAR) data in real-time. For autonomous vehicles, drivable region segmentation is an essential step that sets up the static constraints for planning tasks. Traditional drivable region segmentation algorithms are mostly developed on camera data, so their performance is susceptible to the light conditions and the qualities of road markings. LiDAR sensors can obtain the 3D geometry information of the vehicle surroundings with high precision. However, it is a computational challenge to process a large amount of LiDAR data in real-time. In this paper, a CNN model is proposed and trained to perform semantic segmentation using data from the LiDAR sensor. An efficient hardware architecture is proposed and implemented on an FPGA that can process each LiDAR scan in 17.59 ms, which is much faster than the previous works. Evaluated using Ford and KITTI road detection benchmarks, the proposed solution achieves both high accuracy in performance and real-time processing in speed.

AB Based on the research and analysis of traffic detectors, it is found that the existing vehicle detection equipment is generally vulnerable to environmental interference and the detection effect cannot meet the current traffic demand. Therefore, an automatic detection method of traffic flow parameters based on symmetrical difference was put forward. This method collects the traffic flow parameters through wireless sensor nodes. Since the safety transmission protocol of VANET (Vehicular Ad Hoc Networks) can maximize the safety channel capacity, it transmits the traffic flow parameters to the data acquisition and control equipment of the upper computer through the cross layer pre-balanced safety transmission protocol of VANET in the wireless communication unit. The data acquisition and control equipment of the upper computer uses the traffic flow detection method based on the symmetrical difference to obtain the details of the moving objects in the traffic flow so as to realize the independent detection of the traffic flow parameters of the vehicle-borne sensor equipment. Experimental results show that the designed method has anti-interference abilities for the noise and light changes. Meanwhile, this method can completely extract moving objects from the traffic flow and can improve the detection effect of the moving objects in the traffic flow. Thus, the effectiveness of the proposed method can be fully verified.

AB The accumulation of navigation errors (drift) is a problem in many applications of autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs), particularly during long-duration underwater surveys. Traditional methods for correcting drift require either surfacing of the vehicle for a global navigation satellite system update or use of an independent acoustic positioning system. These methods may not he desirable or possible due to mission constraints. We propose a solution to this problem completely underwater and without the aid of external navigation systems. The approach is based on an operational concept that uses a modified paired-track survey pattern combined with through-the-sensor navigation corrections from a seafloor imaging sonar. We describe the operational concept, derive a model for its performance limits, validate this model, and demonstrate the concept with real experiments at sea. Using this approach, we provide an opportunity to use either coherent or incoherent through-the-sensor positioning corrections for a mission length increase of only the product of the intratrack spacing and the number of track pairs. We show results from a proof-ofprinciple experiment using data collected by the 300-kHz synthetic aperture sonar of the NATO Centre for Maritime Research and Experimentation's Minehunting Unmanned underwater vehicle for Shallow water Covert Littoral Expeditions.

AB Future networks of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) will be tasked to carry out ever-increasing complex operations that are time-critical and that require accurate localization performance, such as tracking the position of a malicious user. Since there is the need to preserve low UAV complexity while tackling the challenging goals of missions in effective ways, one key aspect is the UAV intelligence. The UAV's intelligence includes the UAV's capability to process information and make decisions, e.g., to decide where to sense and whether to delegate some tasks to other network entities. This article overviews some existing signal processing techniques for distributed estimation and autonomous navigation of UAVs of low complexity. To this end, we show some of the needs of the UAVs for running efficient localization operations for time-limited missions, performed either as a team or individually. Furthermore, we focus on different network configurations, which possibly include assistance with edge computing. We also discuss open problems and future perspectives for these settings.

ID FACIAL-RECOGNITION; FACE RECOGNITION; EIGENFACES
AB Fully autonomous vehicles (FAVs) lack monitoring inside the cabin. Therefore, an in-cabin monitoring system (IMS) is required for surveilling people causing irregular or abnormal situations. However, monitoring in the public domain allows disclosure of an individual's face, which goes against privacy preservation. Furthermore, there is a contrary demand for privacy in the IMS of AVs. Therefore, an intelligent IMS must simultaneously satisfy the contrary requirements of personal privacy protection and person identification during abnormal situations. In this study, we proposed a privacy-preserved IMS, which can reidentify anonymized virtual individual faces in an abnormal situation. This IMS includes a step for extracting facial features, which is accomplished by the edge device (onboard unit) of the AV. This device anonymizes an individual's facial identity before transmitting the video frames to a data server. We created different abnormal scenarios in the vehicle cabin. Further, we reidentified the involved person by using the anonymized virtual face and the reserved feature vectors extracted from the suspected individual. Overall, the proposed approach preserves personal privacy while maintaining security in surveillance systems, such as for in-cabin monitoring of FAVs.

AB Information from connected vehicles, such as the position and speed of individual vehicles, can be used to optimize traffic operations at an intersection. This paper proposes such an algorithm for two one-way-streets assuming that only a certain percentage of cars are equipped with this technology. The algorithm enumerates different sequences of cars discharging from the intersection to minimize the objective function. Benefits of platooning (multiple cars consecutively discharging from a queue) and signal flexibility (adaptability to demand) are also considered. The goal is to gain insights about the value (in terms of delay savings) of using connected vehicle technology for intersection control.
   Simulations are conducted for different total demand values and demand ratios to understand the effects of changing the minimum green time at the signal and the penetration rate of connected cars. Using autonomous vehicle control systems, the signal could rapidly change the direction of priority without relying on the reaction of drivers. However, without this technology a minimum green time is necessary. The results of the simulations show that a minimum green time increases the delay only for the low and balanced demand scenarios. Therefore, the value of using cars with autonomous vehicle control can only be seen at intersections with this kind of demand patterns, and could result in up to 7% decrease in delay. On the other hand, using information from connected vehicles to better adapt the traffic signal has proven to be indeed very valuable. Increases in the penetration rate from 0% up to 60% can significantly reduce the average delay (in low demand scenarios a decrease in delay of up to 60% can be observed). That being said, after a penetration rate of 60%, while the delays continue to decrease, the rate of reduction decreases and the marginal value of information from communication technologies diminishes. Overall, it is observed that connected vehicle technology could significantly improve the operation of traffic at signalized intersections, at least under the proposed algorithm.

AB Nowadays vehicle type classification is a fundamental part of intelligent transportation systems (ITSs) and is widely used in various applications like traffic flow monitoring, security enforcement, and autonomous driving, etc. However, vehicle classification is usually used in supervised learning, which greatly limits the applicability for real ITS. This article proposes a semisupervised vehicle type classification scheme via ensemble broad learning for ITS. This presented method contains two main parts. In the first part, a collection of base broad learning system (BLS) classifiers is trained by semisupervised learning to avoid time-consuming training process and alleviate the increasingly unlabeled samples burden. In the second part, a dynamic ensemble structure constructed by trained classifier groups with different characteristics obtains the highest type probability and determine which the vehicle belongs, so as to achieve superior generalization performance than a single base classifier. Several experiments conducted on the pubic BIT-Vehicle dataset and MIO-TCD dataset demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms single BLS classifier and some mainstream methods on effectiveness and efficiency.

ID CLASSIFICATION; INTERFERENCE
AB Modern autonomous vehicles are being equipped with various automotive sensors to perform special functions. Especially, it is important to predict the heading direction of the front vehicle to adjust the speed of the ego-vehicle and select appropriate actions. Here, we propose a method for estimating the instantaneous heading direction of a vehicle using automotive radar sensor data. First, using a frequency-modulated continuous wave (FMCW) radar in the 77 GHz band, we accumulate the automotive radar sensor data for different movements of the front vehicle (e.g., stop, going ahead, reversing, turning left, and turning right). To distinguish the different movements of the vehicle, we use the convolutional neural network (CNN) and train it using the acquired radar sensor data. Because the CNN algorithm usually uses image data as input, it is essential to convert radar sensor data into image data. Therefore, we apply a high-resolution angle estimation algorithm to the obtained radar data and convert it into a two-dimensional range map. After the CNN model is trained with the obtained radar sensor data, various movements of the front vehicle can be classified with over 94% of accuracy.

AB An autonomous unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) system integrated with a modified faster region-based convolutional neural network (Faster R-CNN) is proposed to identify various types of structural damage and to map the detected damage a GPS-denied environment. The proposed method reduces the number of false positives significantly using a real-time streaming protocol and multi-processing, particularly in the case of very small cracks in blurry videos due to the UAV vibrations. In comparative studies, the modified Faster R-CNN using ResNet-101 as the base network showed superior performance in detecting small and blurry defects with a mean average precision of 93.31% and mean intersection-over-union of 92.16% in video frames captured by the lowcost autonomous UAV. The autonomous flights of the UAV were tested in a real large-scale parking structure to account for the high wind effects during flight. The UAV successfully followed the desired trajectories, and the Faster R-CNN detected defects accurately.

TI Autonomous Bus Fleet Control Using Multiagent Reinforcement Learning
SO JOURNAL OF ADVANCED TRANSPORTATION
LA English
DT Article
ID VEHICLE
AB Autonomous buses are becoming increasingly popular and have been widely developed in many countries. However, autonomous buses must learn to navigate the city efficiently to be integrated into public transport systems. Efficient operation of these buses can be achieved by intelligent agents through reinforcement learning. In this study, we investigate the autonomous bus fleet control problem, which appears noisy to the agents owing to random arrivals and incomplete observation of the environment. We propose a multi-agent reinforcement learning method combined with an advanced policy gradient algorithm for this large-scale dynamic optimization problem. An agent-based simulation platform was developed to model the dynamic system of a fixed stop/station loop route, autonomous bus fleet, and passengers. This platform was also applied to assess the performance of the proposed algorithm. The experimental results indicate that the developed algorithm outperforms other reinforcement learning methods in the multi-agent domain. The simulation results also reveal the effectiveness of our proposed algorithm in outperforming the existing scheduled bus system in terms of the bus fleet size and passenger wait times for bus routes with comparatively lesser number of passengers.

AB With the development of information technology, a variety of mobile devices with large computing requirements and delay constraints are growing rapidly, such as Connected Autonomous Vehicles (CAVs). In addition to the energy consumption required for vehicle driving, the CAV also needs to support the normal operation of sensors and computing platforms, which brings huge energy consumption and affects the endurance of vehicles. In this paper, a Mobile Edge Computing (MEC) system is considered that includes three types of network nodes: connected Autonomous Vehicles, Roadside Units (RSUs), and a Base Station (BS). Considering the task duration of the CAV, tasks on the CAVs are partitioned into three sections, which are executed at CAVs, RSUs, and BS, respectively. It is challenging to correlate resource-limited CAVs with other types of network nodes with high performance and implement partial computation offloading between them to minimize the total energy consumption of CAVs and RSUs under the delay constraint of CAVs. Based on the classical orthogonal-frequency-division multiple-access (OFDMA), a joint computing and communication cooperation offloading protocol is proposed to minimize the total energy consumption of all CAVs and RSUs under delay constraints and is described as a constrained Mixed-Integer Nonlinear Program (MINLP) problem. To address this problem, a Reference Vector-Guided Evolutionary Algorithm for Multi-Objective Optimization based on Prior Experience (RVEAPE) is designed in this paper. RVEAPE jointly optimizes the task division ratio variables and resource allocation variables (computation resources, communication resources). Simulations demonstrate that RVEAPE significantly outperforms the GA, NSGA-II, and NSGA-II algorithms in terms of the total energy consumption of CAVs and RSUs in the whole system consisting of CAVs, RSUs, and a BS.
   Note to Practitioners-This paper is motivated by the use of multi-objective optimization algorithms to improve the efficiency and quality of CAVs in edge computing networks. Our goal is to reduce energy consumption by offloading the computation tasks of the CAV to be computed in the RSU and BS. To this end, this paper proposes the use of the RVEAPE algorithm to jointly optimize offloading decisions and resource allocation variables to achieve the lowest energy consumption. The proposed method is theoretically effective in reducing the energy consumption of the CAV under the time constraint. Experimental studies show that the RVEAPE algorithm can effectively offload the computational tasks of the CAV to the BS, and can thus reduce the total energy consumption of the CAV and the RSU. In future research, we will implement computation offloading in large-scale CAV scenarios and consider a binary offloading model.

AB Recently, there has been growing interest in developing unmanned aircraft systems (UAS) with advanced onboard autonomous capabilities. This paper describes the current state of the art in autonomous rotorcraft UAS (RUAS) and provides a detailed literature review of the last two decades of active research on RUAS. Three functional technology areas are identified as the core components of an autonomous RUAS. Guidance, navigation, and control (GNC) have received much attention from the research community, and have dominated the UAS literature from the nineties until now. This paper first presents the main research groups involved in the development of GNC systems for RUAS. Then it describes the development of a framework that provides standard definitions and metrics characterizing and measuring the autonomy level of a RUAS using GNC aspects. This framework is intended to facilitate the understanding and the organization of this survey paper, but it can also serve as a common reference for the UAS community. The main objective of this paper is to present a comprehensive survey of RUAS research that captures all seminal works and milestones in each GNC area, with a particular focus on practical methods and technologies that have been demonstrated in flight tests. These algorithms and systems have been classified into different categories and classes based on the autonomy level they provide and the algorithmic approach used. Finally, the paper discusses the RUAS literature in general and highlights challenges that need to be addressed in developing autonomous systems for unmanned rotorcraft.

AB Increased interest in the use of autonomous aquatic robots in a variety of applications has led to the need for efficient and precise control of these robots. In particular, accurate trajectory control has become of importance in many of these applications. However, the highly nonlinear and underactuated dynamics of many aquatic robots present significant challenges in control. In this work, we propose a trajectory-tracking control approach for a general class of underactuated aquatic robotic systems undergoing planar motion. We demonstrate how a backstepping-based control scheme can be synthesized to ultimately bound three tracking errors (2-D position and orientation), despite the underactuated nature of the system. Via multi-time-scale analysis of singularly perturbed systems, we prove how the control scheme achieves boundedness and convergence of the tracking errors to a neighborhood of the origin. Finally, we implement the proposed scheme on a robotic fish and demonstrate its efficacy via experimental results. This article is complemented with a video: https://youtu.be/7007tUQd3KI.

AB Featured Application This study designed a warning system for pedestrians with an obstructed view or low situation awareness. Furthermore, it can extend into the autonomous driving environment, giving a warning to a pedestrian when a malfunction happens inside an autonomous vehicle. Warning pedestrians of oncoming vehicles is critical to improving pedestrian safety. Due to the limitations of a pedestrian's carrying capacity, it is crucial to find an effective solution to provide warnings to pedestrians in real-time. Limited numbers of studies focused on warning pedestrians of oncoming vehicles. Few studies focused on developing visual warning systems for pedestrians through wearable devices. In this study, various real-time projection algorithms were developed to provide accurate warning information in a timely way. A pilot study was completed to test the algorithm and the user interface design. The projection algorithms can update the warning information and correctly fit it into an easy-to-understand interface. By using this system, timely warning information can be sent to those pedestrians who have lower situational awareness or obstructed view to protect them from potential collisions. It can work well when the sightline is blocked by obstructions.

AB In the context of autonomous driving in urban environments accurate and reliable information about the vehicle motion is crucial. This article presents a multi-modal sensor fusion scheme that, based on standard production car sensors and an inertial measurement unit, estimates the three-dimensional vehicle velocity and attitude angles (pitch and roll). Moreover, in order to enhance the estimation accuracy, the scheme simultaneously estimates the gyroscope and accelerometer biases. The approach relies on a state-affine representation of a kinematic model with an additional measurement equation based on a single-track model. The sensor fusion scheme is built upon a recently proposed adaptive estimator, which allows a direct consideration of model uncertainties and sensor noise. In order to provide accurate estimates during collision avoidance manoeuvres, a measurement covariance adaptation is introduced, which reduces the influence of he single-track model when its information is superfluous. A validation using experimental data demonstrates the effectiveness of the method during both regular urban drives and collision avoidance manoeuvres.

DE Nonholonomic systems; optimal control; underwater vehicle
AB This note investigates the motion control of an autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV). The AUV is modeled as a nonholonomic system as any lateral motion of a conventional, slender AUV is quickly damped out. The problem is formulated as an optimal kinematic control problem on the Euclidean Group of Motions SE(3), where the cost function to be minimized is equal to the integral of a quadratic function of the velocity components. An application of the Maximum Principle to this optimal control problem yields the appropriate Hamiltonian and the corresponding vector fields give the necessary conditions for optimality. For a special case of the cost function, the necessary conditions for optimality can be characterized more easily and we proceed to investigate its solutions. Finally, it is shown that a particular set of optimal motions trace helical paths. Throughout this note we highlight a particular case where the quadratic cost function is weighted in such a way that it equates to the Lagrangian (kinetic energy) of the AUV. For this case, the regular extremal curves are constrained to equate to the AUV's components of momentum and the resulting vector fields are the d'Alembert-Lagrange equations in Hamiltonian form.

AB Light detection and ranging (LiDAR) can provide continuous and stable pose estimation with the model of normal distribution transform (NDT), which is widely used in autonomous vehicles (AVs), even under adverse weather conditions. However, there are few studies about the influence of inclement weather on LiDAR positioning results. In this article, different weather scenarios (rain, fog, and snow) are composed of synthetic LiDAR datasets based on state-of-the-art weather simulators. Then, the impacts of different adverse weather conditions are quantitatively evaluated in terms of positioning accuracy and uncertainty. Afterward, we perform the first study to qualitatively analyze the relationship between meteorological weather standards and LiDAR positioning performances, which is significant but unexplored. Evaluated results indicate that NDT matching performance will deteriorate in adverse weather conditions, especially when the meteorological level is "Heavy" or "Violent," threatening the AVs' positioning security seriously. Therefore, the results of this article provide more basis for the realization of high-precision positioning in adverse weather conditions, to ensure the positioning safety of AVs.

ID ROBUST
AB The main goal in developing closed loop control system for an Autonomous Underwater Vehicle (AUV) is to make a robust vehicle from natural and exogenous perturbations such as wind, wave, and ocean currents. However a well-known robust control, for instance, Sliding Mode Controller (SMC), gives a chattering effect and it influences the stability of an AUV. Furthermore, some researchers combined other controls to get better result but it tends to present long computational time and causes large energy consumption. Thus, this paper proposed a Super Twisting Sliding Mode Controller (STSMC) with dynamic region concept for an AUV. STSMC or a second order SMC is adopted as a robust controller which is free from chattering effect. Meanwhile, the implementation of dynamic region is useful to reduce the energy usage. As a result, the proposed controller obtains global asymptotic stability which is validated by using Lyapunov-like function. Moreover, some simulations present the efficiency of proposed controller. In conclusion, STSMC with region based control is effective to be applied for the robust tracking of an AUV. It contributes to give a fast response when handling the perturbations, short computational time, and low energy demand.

First, a modular configuration for mimicry of undulatory propulsion is presented, followed by a coordinated control of dual fins for enhancing the maneuverability and stability of the RobCutt-II. Then the vision-based hovering problem is formulated. A dual-loop hovering control framework integrating an image processing module, a tracking differentiator, a hovering controller, a velocity controller, and a fuzzy-based control allocation module is proposed to govern the locomotion of the RobCutt-II. Finally, simulations and experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed mechanical design and control methods.

ID IEEE 802.11P; PERFORMANCE; VEHICLE
AB With the exponential growth in technologies for the vehicular Internet of things applications and high demands for autonomous road vehicles, future transportation systems are projected to be revolutionized on a global scale. This new landscape requires a stable, flexible, and business-friendly base of connectivity, networking, and computing technology, in which Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) can play an important role. A UAV-enabled Intelligent Transportation System (ITS) can provide a cost-effective communication solution to improve the safety and efficiency of the transportation system, particularly if the data traffic is nonhomogeneous and nonstationary. Typically, wireless is the communication medium between vehicles and UAVs in an ITS setting, which is based on the IEEE802.11p MAC protocol adopted by car manufactures. However, the IEEE 802.11p MAC protocol is modified solely for omnidirectional antennas, which restricts network coverage, delay, and throughput. In comparison, the directional antenna has greater network coverage, spatial reuse, and bandwidth. In addition, a multiaccess edge computing (MEC) facility at the backhaul link will provide ultralow latency and high bandwidth services to meet the increasingly growing demand for latency-sensitive vehicle applications such as vehicular video data analytics, autonomous driving, and intelligent navigation. Therefore, this article aims to propose a novel dual-mode MAC protocol that can work in two antenna modes, i.e., directional and omnidirectional. For modeling and simulation purposes, we use the Optimized Network Engineering Tool (OPNET) and aim to seek an evaluation with respect to throughput, media access delay, and retransmission attempts. The results obtained demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed scheme.

ID POLICY
AB Autonomous vehicle (AV) technology has advanced rapidly in recent years with some automated features already available in vehicles on the market. AVs are expected to reduce traffic crashes as the majority of crashes are related to driver errors, fatigue, alcohol, or drugs. However, very little research has been conducted to estimate the safety impact of AVs. This paper aims to investigate the safety impacts of AVs using a simulation-based surrogate safety measure approach. To this end, safety impacts are explored through the number of conflicts extracted from the VISSIM traffic microsimulator using the Surrogate Safety Assessment Model (SSAM). Behaviours of human-driven vehicles (HVs) and AVs (level 4 automation) are modelled within the VISSIM's car following model. The safety investigation is conducted for two case studies, that is, a signalised intersection and a roundabout, under various AV penetration rates. Results suggest that AVs improve safety significantly with high penetration rates, even when they travel with shorter headways to improve road capacity and reduce delay. For the signalised intersection, AVs reduce the number of conflicts by 20% to 65% with the AV penetration rates of between 50% and 100% (statistically significant at p < 0.05). For the roundabout, the number of conflicts is reduced by 29% to 64% with the 100% AV penetration rate (statistically significant at p < 0.05).

AB Most of the current research on autonomous landing of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) focus on rotorcrafts, which can fly horizontally over the landing site and then land vertically, with less landing risk. However, some of the unmanned fixed-wing aircrafts take off and land in the sliding mode of wheel landing gears, and their landing stage is difficult to control and easier to failure. In this paper, the autonomous landing of the fixed wing UAVs based on the visual navigation is studied. We propose a deep learning based Vision Transformer Particle Region-based Convolutional Neural Network (VitP-RCNN). Our VitP-RCNN uses Mobile Vision Transformers (MobileViT) as the backbone to accelerate feature extraction. Regarding the innovation of the present study, it is noticed that candidate boxes are chosen as the particles in our methodology, where the confidence is defined as the particle weight, the spatio-temopral correlation between adjacent image is used in video tracking and the Particle Filter theory is employed into the two-stage detection network to construct the present VitP-RCNN. Based on the spatial-temporal correlation, Our VitP-RCNN is efficient in predicting the particle state in the next frame through the state of the previous frame, so as to realize the continuous tracking of the landing marker. The experimental results show that on the Jetson AGX Xavier drone platform, our speed is up to 51FPS, enabling us to perform the landing marker tracking for the autonomous landing of the fixed-wing drones.

ID INTELLIGENCE
AB The immense growth of Autonomous Vehicles (AVs) and networking technologies have paved the way for advanced Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS). AVs increase data demands from in-vehicle users, which pose a significant risk to the vehicular trajectory data and are extremely vulnerable to security threats. It is challenging to describe and detect the trajectory anomalies in urban motion behavior due to the enormous coverage and complexity of ITS in the V2X environment. Most existing systems rely on a restricted number of single detection strategies, such as determining frequent patterns and have limited accuracy in detecting anomalous trajectories. However, they focus only on outlier detection, failing to consider different patterns of anomalous trajectories. This paper proposes Efficient Trajectory Anomaly Detection and Classification (ETADC) framework in a 6G-V2X environment. The proposed ETADC framework employs the Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient algorithm (DDPG) to improve accuracy and efficiency by analyzing multiple strategies, namely driving speed, driving distance, driving direction, and driving time. The result analysis shows that the proposed ETADC technique outperforms the existing systems by 97% accuracy.

AB A method for evaluating the share of scattering component related to structural components of unmanned air vehicle (UAV) in the field scattered by the UAV is proposed. The method takes into account the scattering interaction of the UAV's dielectric hull with perfectly conducting elements under the hull as well as the scattering contribution of its dielectric components into the scattered field. The latter contributions are evaluated based on the methods of short-wave diffraction. The model of UAV has been designed that includes both metallic elements and dielectric hull. Scattering simulation results are obtained and the UAV model's scattering characteristics are analysed.

AB Advanced driver assistance systems, ADAS, have shown the possibility to anticipate crash accidents and effectively assist road users in critical traffic situations. This is not the case for motorcyclists, in fact ADAS for motorcycles are still barely developed. Our aim was to study a camera-based sensor for the application of preventive safety in tilting vehicles. We identified two road conflict situations for which automotive remote sensors installed in a tilting vehicle are likely to fail in the identification of critical obstacles. Accordingly, we set two experiments conducted in real traffic conditions to test our stereo vision sensor. Our promising results support the application of this type of sensors for advanced motorcycle safety applications.

AB The sensitivity of the response of a typical AUV to changes in hydrodynamic parameters is examined. The analysis is primarily performed using a computer model of an axi-symmetric vehicle typical of many AUVs in service today. The vehicle used is the Canadian Self-Contained Off-the-shelf Underwater Testbed (C-SCOUT), designed and built by graduate and work term students. The fully nonlinear computer model is based on Newton-Euler equations of motion, and uses the component build-up method to describe the excitation forces. The hydrodynamic parameters are varied in a series of simulations with the computer model; the response being analyzed for specific performance indicators.

AB Consideration is given to the management of a fleet of autonomous vehicles (AVs) designed to support freight delivery in urban areas. The fleet of AVs is assumed operating within the general framework of an Intelligent Transportation System (ITS). Creating the technologies necessary for such ITS raises many important and complex problems related to research areas such as automated reasoning, perception, and control among others. Two of them, namely, AVs' routing and AVs' motion planning, are the main themes of this work. In this paper, we propose a novel approach for their formation and composition in the context of an ITS. Routing and motion planning decisions for AVs are assessed considering the latest traffic conditions existing on the road network. Since these conditions are usually vague and therefore difficult to be measured accurately, fuzzy logic concepts are incorporated into ITS to simulate the uncertainty in traffic networks. Solutions to the fuzzy routing and fuzzy motion planning for AVs are finally derived from a hybrid approach that combines the A-star algorithm with two modified genetic algorithms. Simulated experiments over the city of Patras (Greece) show the efficiency of the developed approach.

   detection; Adaptive route planning
ID SONAR; CLASSIFICATION; VEHICLES; IMAGERY; FUSION
AB A new adaptive strategy for performing data collection with a sonar-equipped autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) is proposed. The approach is general in the sense that it is applicable to a wide range of underwater tasks that rely on subsequent processing of side-looking sonar imagery. By intelligently allocating resources and immediately reacting to the data collected in-mission, the proposed approach simultaneously maximizes the information content in the data and decreases overall survey time. These improvements are achieved by adapting the AUV route to prevent portions of the mission area from being either characterized by poor image quality or obscured by shadows caused by sand ripples. The peak correlation of consecutive sonar returns is used as a measure for image quality. To detect the presence of and estimate the orientation of sand ripples, a new innovative algorithm is developed. The components of the overall data-driven path-planning algorithm are purposely constructed to permit fast real-time execution with only minimal AUV onboard processing capabilities. Experimental results based on real sonar data collected at sea are used to demonstrate the promise of the proposed approach.

DE Autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV); hovering AUV; online path planning
   and view planning (VP)
AB This paper proposes the use of path-planning algorithms for hovering autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) in applications where the robot needs to adapt online its trajectory for inspection or safety purposes. In particular, it proposes the platform Sparus II AUV and a set of planning algorithms to conduct these new AUV capabilities. These algorithms generate trajectories under motion constraints, which can be followed without deviations, to ensure the safety even when passing close to obstacles. View planning algorithms are also combined to decide the movements to be executed to discover the unexplored seabed or target, and to cover it with a camera or sonar. Online mapping with profiling sonars and online planning with fast sampling-based algorithms allow the execution of missions without any previous knowledge of the 3-D shape of the environment. Real 2-D results in an artificial harbor structure and simulated natural rocky canyon demonstrate the feasibility of the approach for avoiding or inspecting the underwater environment. These new AUV capabilities can be used to acquire images of the environment that can be used to inspect and map the habitat.

AB In this paper three-dimensional finite element method analysis and experimental flashless cold forging of aluminium front and back hubs, and the blade of an autonomous underwater vehicle propeller are presented. The rigid-plastic finite element simulation is performed using Deform F-3V6.0, to estimate the optimum load required for the flashless cold forging. The complex profiles of the hubs and blade are modelled using Solidworks SP4.02007, which is also used for the modelling of the workpiece and die-punch assembly. The workpiece used is of AISI AL6061 and the die material is die steel (AISI D2). The process is optimized to form the propeller back and front hubs, and the blade. For all the models, three workpieces with different specifications are selected and investigated to obtain the optimum workpiece that gives flashless cold forging with no underfilling. Based on the simulation results, the flashless cold forging is successfully done on a 100 tonne C-type machine. The experimental forged samples conform well with the simulated models.

AB Objective: The aim of this study was to assess the feasibility and quantitative potential benefits of a motorcycle autonomous emergency braking (MAEB) system in fatal rear-end crashes. A further aim was to identify possible criticalities of this safety system in the field of powered 2-wheelers (PTWs; e.g., any additional risk introduced by the system itself).
   Methods: Seven relevant cases from the Swedish national in-depth fatal crash database were selected. All crashes involved car-following in which a non-anti-lock braking system (ABS)-equipped motorcycle was the bullet vehicle. Those crashes were reconstructed in a virtual environment with Prescan, simulating the road scenario, the vehicles involved, their precrash trajectories, ABS, and, alternatively, MAEB. The MAEB chosen as reference for the investigation was developed within the European Commission-funded Powered Two-Wheeler Integrated Safety (PISa) project and further detailed in later studies, with the addition of the ABS functionality. The boundary conditions of each simulation varied within a range compatible with the uncertainty of the in-depth data and also included a range of possible rider behaviors including the actual one. The benefits of the MAEB were evaluated by comparing the simulated impact speed in each configuration (no ABS/MAEB, ABS only, MAEB).
   Results: The MAEB proved to be beneficial in a large number of cases. When applicable, the benefits of the system were in line with the expected values. When not applicable, there was no clear evidence of an increased risk for the rider due to the system.
   Discussion and Limitations: MAEB represents an innovative safety device in the field of PTWs, and the feasibility of such a system was investigated with promising results. Nevertheless, this technology is not mature yet for PTW application. Research in the field of passenger cars does not directly apply to PTWs because the activation logic of a braking system is more challenging on PTWs. The deployment of an autonomous deceleration would affect the vehicle dynamics, thus requesting an additional control action of the rider to keep the vehicle stable. In addition, the potential effectiveness of the MAEB should be investigated on a wider set of crash scenarios in order also to avoid false triggering of the autonomous braking.

ID AUTONOMOUS VEHICLES
AB In a cut-in scenario, traditional adaptive cruise control usually cannot effectively identify the cut-in vehicle and respond to it in advance. This paper proposes an adaptive cruise control (ACC) strategy based on the MPC algorithm for cut-in scenarios. A finite state machine (FSM) is designed to manage vehicle control in different cut-in scenarios. For a cut-in scenario, a method to identify and quantify the possibility of cut-in of a vehicle is proposed. At the same time, a safety distance model of the cut-in vehicle is established as the basis for the state transition of the finite state machine. Taking the quantified cut-in possibility of a vehicle as a reference, the model predictive control (MPC) algorithm, which considers the constraints of driving safety and comfort, is used to realize coordinated control of the host vehicle and the cut-in vehicle. Simulink-Carsim simulation studies show that the ACC strategy for a cut-in scenario can effectively identify a cut-in vehicle and quantify the possibility of cut-in of the vehicle. Faced with a cut-in vehicle, the host vehicle using the ACC strategy can brake several seconds early and switch the following target to the cut-in vehicle. Meanwhile, the acceleration and jerk of the host vehicle changes within a reasonable range, which ensures driving safety and comfort.

   Trajectory planning
AB Autonomous driving offers a convenient and comfortable means of transportation, while the addition of external communication interfaces renders the vehicle communication more vulnerable to cyber attacks. In contrast to conventional attacks, well-designed stealthy attacks are more adept at evading conventional detectors. To address this problem, this paper proposes a robust detector based on controlled invariant subspace to identify stealthy attacks. This paper stands out not only by relying on the vehicle dynamics model for system state estimation, but rather by employing a real-time trajectory space generation method. Our detector develops a rapidly expanding random tree method based on offline incremental learning to generate trajectory subspace, and any trajectories that diverge from this subspace are identified as anomalies. Additionally, this paper designs distance measurement method that combines the linear quadratic regulation algorithm with a radial basis function neural network while also taking into account the vehicle's dynamic performance constraints. To assess the theoretical performance of the proposed detector, this paper presents rigorous proofs that demonstrate the asymptotical optimality of the generated trajectory and the robustness of the stealthy attack detection method based on controlled invariant subspace. Finally, simulation results demonstrate that the proposed robust detector can effectively identify stealthy attacks and outperforms advanced techniques in terms of accuracy and false-positive rate.

AB Prediction of pedestrian crossing behavior is an important issue faced by the realization of autonomous driving. The current research on pedestrian crossing behavior prediction is mainly based on vehicle camera. However, the sight line of vehicle camera may be blocked by other vehicles or the road environment, making it difficult to obtain key information in the scene. Pedestrian crossing behavior prediction based on surveillance video can be used in key road sections or accident-prone areas to provide supplementary information for vehicle decision-making, thereby reducing the risk of accidents. To this end, we propose a pedestrian crossing behavior prediction network for surveillance video. The network integrates pedestrian posture, local context and global context features through a new cross-stacked gated recurrence unit (GRU) structure to achieve accurate prediction of pedestrian crossing behavior. Applied onto the surveillance video dataset from the University of California, Berkeley to predict the pedestrian crossing behavior, our model achieves the best results regarding accuracy, F1 parameter, etc. In addition, we conducted experiments to study the effects of time to prediction and pedestrian speed on the prediction accuracy. This paper proves the feasibility of pedestrian crossing behavior prediction based on surveillance video. It provides a reference for the application of edge computing in the safety guarantee of automatic driving.

AB In this paper, a fixed-time control scheme is presented for trajectory tracking of underactuated autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) subject to external disturbances. An adaptive fixed-time disturbance observer (AFDO) is developed to estimate the external disturbances in fixed time without the prior knowledge of external disturbances. An event-triggered mechanism is introduced to save the bandwidth resources and reduce the communication burden. By synthesizing the developed AFDO and the event-triggered mechanism, an AFDO based event-triggered fixed-time integral sliding mode control (AFDO-EFISMC) scheme is proposed to force the AUV to track the reference trajectory in fixed time. With the aid of the developed AFDO, the gain of discontinuous control part of the designed control scheme is reduced, and therefore the control chattering is alleviated. Stability analysis is given to show that the designed AFDO-EFISMC scheme can make the tracking errors of the AUV converge to arbitrarily small neighborhood of the origin within a fixed-time independent of the initial conditions. The effectiveness of the proposed control scheme is proven by comparative numerical simulations.

AB A water conveyance tunnel is narrow and enclosed with a complex distribution of flow field. The performance of sensors such as Doppler log, magnetic compass, sonar, and depth gauge used by conventional underwater vehicles in the tunnel is greatly affected and can even fail. Aiming at the special operating environment and operational requirements of water conveyance tunnels, this paper designed an architecture suitable for pressurized water conveyance tunnel-detection autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs). The tunnel-detection AUV (called AUV-T in this paper) with the architecture proposed in this paper could easily and smoothly complete inspection tasks in water conveyance tunnels, and field tests have verified the effectiveness of the architecture. Since an AUV in a water conveyance tunnel cannot go to the surface to rescue itself, in order to ensure its safety we designed the heterogeneous dual-CPU (Central Processing Unit) hot redundancy system based on dual communication lines. The reliability analysis showed that the system can significantly reduce the probability of AUV failure and ensure that the AUV can still be recovered even if it fails in the tunnel.

AB Mobile robotics research and deployment is highly challenged by energy limitations, particularly in marine robotics applications. This challenge can be addressed by autonomous transfer and sharing of energy in addition to effective mission planning. Specifically, it is possible to overcome energy limitations in robotic missions using an optimization approach that can generate trajectories for both working robots and mobile chargers while adapting to environmental changes. Such a method must simultaneously optimize all trajectories in the robotic network to be able to maximize overall system efficiency. This letter presents a Genetic Algorithm based approach that is capable of solving this problem at a variety of scales, both in terms of the size of the mission area and the number of robots. The algorithm is capable of re-planning during operation, allowing for the mission to adapt to changing conditions and disturbances. The proposed approach has been validated in multiple simulation scenarios. Field experiments using an autonomous underwater vehicle and a surface vehicle verify feasibility of the generated trajectories. The simulation and experimental validation show that the approach efficiently generates feasible trajectories to minimize energy use when operating multi-robot networks.

AB Autonomous surface and underwater vehicles (ASVs and AUVs) used for ocean monitoring are typically deployed for long periods of time and must operate with limited energy budgets. Coupled with the increased accessibility to ocean flow data, there has been a significant interest in developing energy efficient motion plans for these vehicles that leverage the dynamics of the surrounding flow. In this paper, we present a graph search based method to plan time and energy optimal paths in static and time-varying flow fields. We also use tools from topological path planning to generate optimal paths in different homotopy classes to facilitate simultaneous exploration of the environment by multi-robot teams. The proposed strategy is validated using analytical flow models, actual ocean data, and in experiments using an indoor laboratory testbed capable of creating flows with ocean-like features. We also present an alternative approach using a Riemannian metric based approximation for the cost functions in the static flow case for computing time and energy optimal paths. The Riemannian approximation results in smoother trajectories in contrast to the graph based strategy while requiring less computational time.

AB This paper introduces a novel intelligent underwater sampling apparatus (IUSA) mounted on autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) with an essential practical sense, as the IUSA can be conveniently released from AUV to accomplish the underwater sampling task and then surface up by releasing the ballast itself. Mechanical design of the IUSA is briefly introduced, which has the feature of simple structure to carry the sampling sensor, low power consumption, high reliability of release and recycling utilization. It easily achieves the ability to dive in and surface up only by adjusting its buoyancy. However, it is rather difficult to confirm the surfacing time of the IUSA in order to timely recover it, since the underwater motion forecast of the NSA is largely disturbed by complex fluid hydrodynamics. This paper presents a steady-state superposition algorithm to address the problem of motion forecast of the sampling apparatus, with the assistant of computational fluid dynamics software to take into account the dynamics of the IUSA in sea water, which is instrumental in helping the mission operators recover the apparatus for recycling utilization.

ID MOBILE ROBOT; LOCALIZATION; SYSTEM
AB Using internal and external sensors to provide position estimates in a two-dimensional space is necessary to solve the localization and navigation problems for a robot or an autonomous vehicle (AV). Usually, a unique source of position information is not enough, so researchers try to fuse data from different sensors using several methods, as, for example, Kalman filtering. Those methods need an estimation of the uncertainty in the position estimates obtained from the sensory system. This uncertainty is expressed by a covariance matrix, which is usually obtained from experimental data, assuming, by the nature of this matrix, general and unconstrained motion. We propose in this paper a closed-form expression for the uncertainty in the odometry position estimate of a mobile vehicle, using a covariance matrix whose form is derived from the cinematic model. We then particularize for a nonholonomic Ackerman driving-type AV, Its cinematic model relates the two measures being obtained for internal sensors: the velocity, translated into the instantaneous displacement; and the instantaneous steering angle. The proposed method is validated experimentally, and compared against Kalman filtering.

AB We investigated the mixed traffic flow with human-driving and autonomous cars. A new mathematical model with adjustable sensitivity and smooth factor was proposed to describe the autonomous car's moving behavior in which smooth factor is used to balance the front and back headway in a flow. A lemma and a theorem were proved to support the stability criteria in traffic flow. A series of simulations were carried out to analyze the mixed traffic flow. The fundamental diagrams were obtained from the numerical simulation results. The varying sensitivity and smooth factor of autonomous cars affect traffic flux, which exhibits opposite varying tendency with increasing parameters before and after the critical density. Moreover, the sensitivity of sensors and smooth factors play an important role in stabilizing the mixed traffic flow and suppressing the traffic jam. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB This work presents a comprehensive semi-autonomous control system for agile fixed-wing unmanned aerial vehicles. These versatile platforms are capable of steady flight and thrust-borne hover, but owing to their design are challenging to control for a remote operator with limited visual feedback. The proposed pilot-assist solution uses a unified controller architecture that remains valid for all flight regimes, while accounting for different operating modes required by the pilot. The cascaded control structure consists of an attitude controller, developed directly on the Special Orthonormal Group SO(3), a nonlinear position control system capable of operating in position, velocity, or path following modes, and a reference generation system that enables smooth transitions between modes. The stability of the system dynamics together with the proposed control solution is analyzed through Lyapunov stability theory. In addition, to verify the viability of the developed system when operated by a human pilot, outdoor flight experiments are conducted with an experimental platform. Results show the control system enables the lightweight platform to fly stably outdoors while following pilot inputs, both in conventional steady flight, and in a thrust-borne flight regime.

ID OBSTACLE AVOIDANCE
AB The underwater unmanned vehicle (UUV) is widely used in various marine operations, in which path planning and trajectory tracking are the critical technologies to achieve autonomous motion planning. Unlike previous research methods, this article proposes the asynchronous multithreading proximal policy optimization-based path planning (AMPPO-PP) and trajectory tracking (AMPPO-TT) algorithms and applies these two methods to different task scenarios of UUVs. Taking advantage of the AMPPO, the expensive online computational procedure is converted to an offline training process. The proposed algorithms enable the UUV to learn autonomous planning, tracking, and emergency obstacle avoiding. Besides, the algorithm architecture of the AMPPO-PP and the AMPPO-TT is described in detail. By refining the reward in each timestep and utilizing the reward-shaping trick, the reward sparsity is avoided. The goal-distance heuristic reward function is used to make the UUV explore more directionally. Various simulation environments are developed from simple to complex, along with multiple comparative experiments to verify the effectiveness of the proposed algorithms.

AB Detection of Black Hole attacks is one of the most challenging and critical routing security issues in vehicular ad hoc networks (VANETs) and autonomous and connected vehicles (ACVs). Malicious vehicles or nodes may exist in the cyber-physical path on which the data and control packets have to be routed converting a secure and reliable route into a compromised one. However, instead of passing packets to a neighbouring node, malicious nodes bypass them and drop any data packets that could contain emergency alarms. We introduce an intelligent black hole attack detection scheme (IDBA) tailored to ACV. We consider four key parameters in the design of the scheme, namely, Hop Count, Destination Sequence Number, Packet Delivery Ratio (PDR), and End-to-End delay (E2E). We tested the performance of our IDBA against AODV with Black Hole (BAODV), Intrusion Detection System (IdsAODV), and EAODV algorithms. Extensive simulation results show that our IDBA outperforms existing approaches in terms of PDR, E2E, Routing Overhead, Packet Loss Rate, and Throughput.

ID DATA-COLLECTION; VEHICLE; ALGORITHM; SET
AB Sensory data collection is one of the most important concerns in underwater sensor networks (USNs). Because full connectivity cannot be guaranteed, mobile data gathering with autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) is widely used in sparse three-dimensional (3D) USNs to solve energy-imbalance problems between different sensor nodes. AUVs with relatively abundant energy and storage can collect sensory data from one sensor node to transmit to another node, so as to avoid energy-intensive multi-hop transmission. As a result, movement control strategy and data collecting path planning for AUVs are very crucial for the performance of data acquisition. This paper proposes a smooth 3D Dubins curves based mobile data gathering mechanism to overcome the kinematic nonholonomic constraints of AUVs. The objective of our proposed method is to collect sensory data along smooth 3D Dubins paths, which are interpolated by continuous Bezier curves in the Z-axis from 2D Dubins curves. Extensive simulation results verify that the proposed method has a more efficient performance in terms of path smoothness and energy consumption; thus it is very suitable for mobile data collection in 3D underwater sensor networks.

ID ADAPTIVE CRUISE CONTROL; FLOW; IMPACTS
AB Connected and autonomous vehicles (CAVs) are on the way to the field application. In the beginning stage, there will be a mixed traffic flow, containing the regular human-driven vehicles and CAVs with a low penetration rate. Recently, the discussion about the impact of a small proportion of CAVs in the mixed traffic is controversial. This paper investigated the possibility of applying the limited data from these lowly penetrated CAVs to estimate the average freeway link speeds based on the Kalman filtering (KF) method. First, this paper established a VISSIM-based microsimulation model to mimic the mixed traffic with different CAV penetration rates. The characteristics of this mixed traffic were then discussed based on the simulation data, including the sample size distribution, data-missing rate, speed difference, and fundamental diagram. Accordingly, the traditional KF-based method was introduced and modified to adapt data from CAVs. Finally, the evaluations of the estimation accuracy and the sensitive analysis of the proposed method were conducted. The results revealed the possibility and applicability of link speed estimation using data from a small proportion of CAVs.

AB Since the drifts of Inertial Navigation System (INS) solutions are inevitable and also grow over time, a Doppler Velocity Log (DVL) is used to aid the INS to restrain its error growth. Therefore, INS/DVL integration is a common approach for Autonomous Underwater Vehicle (AUV) navigation. The parameters including the scale factor of DVL and misalignments between INS and DVL are key factors which limit the accuracy of the INS/DVL integration. In this paper, a novel parameter calibration method is proposed. An iterative implementation of the method is designed to reduce the error caused by INS initial alignment. Furthermore, a simplified INS/DVL integration scheme is employed. The proposed method is evaluated with both river trial and sea trial data sets. Using 0.03 degrees/h(1 sigma) ring laser gyroscopes, 5 x 10(-5) g(1 sigma) quartz accelerometers and DVL with accuracy 0.5% V +/- 0.5 cm/s, INS/DVL integrated navigation can reach an accuracy of about 1% of distance travelled (CEP) in a river trial and 2% of distance travelled (CEP) in a sea trial.

AB This article presents a hierarchical fuzzy logic controller that arbitrates recommendations from lower-level modules in order to autonomously guide a robot down forest trails. This robot would be used to move logs or trees from where they are cut to a location where they could be further processed or loaded onto trucks. The lower-level modules contribute recommendations derived from lower-level tasks or behaviors. Each lower-level module provides its own recommendation based on its limited perception of the environment. A fuzzy quality measure is used by the hierarchical controller to determine how best to fuse the individual control recommendations of lower-level modules. The quality measure provides an approximate determination of the value of each lower-level module recommendation. These quality measures, as well as other fuzzy sets used in the controller, were defined with a set of parameters. A computer simulation was used to tune subsets of the fuzzy set parameters to improve the performance of the controller. After these parameters were tuned, they were used in the fuzzy logic controller, which was tested in a vehicle. The results of these vehicle tests are also discussed in the article.

AB Accurate prediction of vehicle acceleration has significant practical applications. Deep learning, as one of the methods for acceleration prediction, has shown promising applications in acceleration prediction. However, due to the influence of multiple factors on acceleration, a single data model may not be suitable for various driving scenarios. Therefore, this paper proposes a hybrid approach for vehicle acceleration prediction by combining clustering and deep learning techniques. Based on historical data of vehicle speed, acceleration, and distance to the preceding vehicle, the proposed method first clusters the acceleration patterns of vehicles. Subsequently, different prediction models and parameters are applied to each cluster, aiming to improve the prediction accuracy. By considering the unique characteristics of each cluster, the proposed method can effectively capture the diverse acceleration patterns. Experimental results demonstrate the superiority of the proposed approach in terms of prediction accuracy compared to benchmarks. This paper contributes to the advancement of sensor data processing and artificial intelligence techniques in the field of vehicle acceleration prediction. The proposed hybrid method has the potential to enhance the accuracy and reliability of acceleration prediction, enabling applications in various domains, such as autonomous driving, traffic management, and vehicle control.

AB In this paper, the Politecnico di Milano solutions proposed for the Leonardo Drone Contest (LDC) are presented. The Leonardo Drone Contest is an annual autonomous drone competition among universities, which has already seen the conclusion of its second edition. In each edition, the participating teams were asked to design and build an autonomous multicopter, capable of accomplishing complex tasks in an indoor urban-like environment. To reach this goal, the designed systems should be capable of navigating in a Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS)-denied environment with autonomous decision making, online planning and collision avoidance capabilities. In this light, the authors describe the first two editions of the competition, i.e., their rules, objectives and overview of the proposed solutions. While the first edition is presented as relevant for the experience and takeaways acquired from it, the second edition solution is analyzed in detail, providing both the simulation and experimental results obtained.

AB This paper presents a scheme that employs feedforward control in conjunction with a predictor-corrector scheme for guidance control of Automated Guided Vehicles (AGVs). The predictor-corrector scheme provides the desired values of steering parameters which depend on the geometry of the track and a driving criterion. The geometry of the track/road ahead of the vehicle is obtained by extrapolating the identified (estimated) geometry of the track/road traversed during the elapsed time interval. This real-time identification is carried out by fitting a curve to the path traversed by the vehicle. The coordinates of the path are provided by a transformation formulation which makes use of the motion parameters and a kinematic model of the vehicle. The driving criterion specifies the positioning of the AGV on the track. Several possible criteria are identified in the paper and mathematical formulations are presented for one such criterion. Results of off-line calculations using simulated track profiles and experimental data obtained using a prototype AGV while following various track profiles are provided for illustration.

AB As an emerging architecture for the future 6G Internet of Vehicles (IoV), the air-ground-integration network has become a paradigm to achieve reliable interconnection everywhere. Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), as low-altitude aerial platforms, can cooperate with ground infrastructures with the advantages of high flexibility and low cost. However, wireless resource allocation for vehicle-to-UAV (V2U) communications has encountered various challenges, such as air-ground spectrum sharing, dynamic topology, fast-changing channels, and time-sensitive services. In this article, we propose a multiagent federated learning and dueling double-deep Q-network (D3QN)-based resource allocation, namely, Fed-D3QN, to jointly optimize channel selection and power control to meet the low latency and reliability requirements of IoV services. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed Fed-D3QN algorithm has good stability in the highly dynamic air-ground integration network. Additionally, it reduces the total delay of vehicle-to-infrastructure links and improves the transmission success rate of V2U links.

AB This article presents research on a hybrid vertical take-off and landing (VTOL) unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) supported by a relative positioning system, enabling the deployment of autonomous missions from ship-based helipads in maritime conditions. A crucial issue to be solved is ensuring precise positioning of the UAV relative to the landing pad in the take-off and landing phases. To achieve this, an extended Kalman filter (EKF) is implemented on the UAV's onboard computer, which integrates the positioning data from the UAV's global navigation satellite system receiver and the positioning data of the landing pad broadcast by the landing pad navigation station (LNS). The EKF estimates both the absolute and relative position of the UAV, which are required for autonomous take-off and landing on the moving landing pad. In unfavorable weather conditions, EKF also uses data from an optional local positioning system to keep the accuracy within the range 1-3 m. The research was concluded by experimental verification during a ferry cruise over the Baltic Sea. During the research, the VTOL UAV performed two fully autonomous flight missions at the range about 1 km from the moving ferry in international waters. Each of them ended with a successful landing back on the helipad with an accuracy matching its required level, which was already achieved in the previous research carried out in inland conditions. Data recorded during real flights confirm that the developed system, consisting of a hybrid VTOL UAV and a LNS, is ready to be utilized in autonomous missions at sea. Factors having a critical impact on the safety of use of the VTOL UAV in marine conditions were also identified, which were not observed during the research in inland conditions, and are related directly to turbulence around the landing pad.

AB Usually, vehicle applications need to use artificial intelligence techniques to implement control strategies able to deal with the noise in the signals provided by sensors, or with the impossibility of having full knowledge of the dynamics of a vehicle (engine state, wheel pressure, or occupants' weight).
   This work presents a cruise control system which is able to manage the pedals of a vehicle at low speeds. In this context, small changes in the vehicle or road conditions can occur unpredictably. To solve this problem, a method is proposed to allow the on-line evolution of a zero-order TSK fuzzy controller to adapt its behaviour to uncertain road or vehicle dynamics.
   Starting from a very simple or even empty configuration, the consequents of the rules are adapted in real time, while the membership functions used to codify the input variables are modified after a certain period of time. Extensive experimentation in both simulated and real vehicles showed the method to be both fast and precise, even when compared with a human driver. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB In recent years, autonomous robots have become ubiquitous in research and daily life. Among many factors, public datasets play an important role in the progress of this field, as they waive the tall order of initial investment in hardware and manpower. However, for research on autonomous aerial systems, there appears to be a relative lack of public datasets on par with those used for autonomous driving and ground robots. Thus, to fill in this gap, we conduct a data collection exercise on an aerial platform equipped with an extensive and unique set of sensors: two 3D lidars, two hardware-synchronized global-shutter cameras, multiple Inertial Measurement Units (IMUs), and especially, multiple Ultra-wideband (UWB) ranging units. The comprehensive sensor suite resembles that of an autonomous driving car, but features distinct and challenging characteristics of aerial operations. We record multiple datasets in several challenging indoor and outdoor conditions. Calibration results and ground truth from a high-accuracy laser tracker are also included in each package. All resources can be accessed via our webpage .

AB How to ensure robust and accurate 3D object detection under various environment is essential for autonomous driving (AD) environment perception. While, until now, most of the existing 3D object detection methods are based on the ordinary driving scenes provided by the mainstream dataset. The researches on actual complex scenes (adverse illumination, inclement weather, distant or small objects, etc.) have been ignored and there is still no comprehensive review of the recent progress in this field. Thence, this paper aims to gain a deep insight on the performance and challenges of 3D object detection methods under complex scenes for AD. Firstly, we discuss the complex driving environments in actual and the perception limitations of mainstream sensors (LIDAR and camera). Then we analyze the performance and challenges of single-modality 3D object detection methods. Therefore, in order to improve the accuracy and robustness of 3D object detection methods in some complex AD scenes, the fusion of L-C (LIDAR-camera) is recommended and systematically analyzed. Finally, some suitable datasets and potential directions are comparatively summarized to support the relative research in complex driving scenes. We hope that this review could facilitate people's research and look forward to more progress in this timely and crucial problem field.

AB Autonomous exploration is a technical challenge in the field of mobile robots. In this paper, the problem of autonomous unmanned ground vehicle (UGV) exploration is formulated as a continuous action planning process and a novel method to achieve real-time action planning in 3D spaces is proposed. First, a traversability map and reduced approximated generalized Voronoi graph (RAGVG) are introduced as grid and topological map models, respectively. Then, an efficient and robust algorithm is presented for constructing RAGVGs, and a three-stage approach for fast path search is proposed. Furthermore, a fuzzy decision-making approach is employed to evaluate candidates and create action plans. The proposed method is tested in synthetic and real-world scenarios. The results of static experiments suggest that the RAGVG can achieve almost full coverage with significantly less redundancy (50 % less vertexes and 23 % less edges); moreover, collision-free action plans can be created in real time (less than 330 ms). Furthermore, the results of dynamic experiments indicate that the proposed method achieves effective, efficient, and stable performance with two exploration tasks in 3D spaces with static and moving obstacles, and it saves at least 10 % of the time required for full coverage exploration. The code related to this project is open-source and available at https://gitee.com/xinkaized/my_exploration.

AB The proliferation of fifth-generation (5G) networks toward vehicle-to-everything (V2X) communication has paved the way for driverless autonomous vehicles (AVs) in vehicular critical energy infrastructures (CEI). Though technological advancements improve AVs, the safety-critical messages (SCMs) still play a vital role in reducing crashes, preventing injuries, and saving lives. AVs' high speed and complex network topology challenge disseminating SCMs with a highly successful delivery ratio and extremely low latency. Furthermore, the typical SCM dissemination schemes cause channel congestion and minimize the delivery ratio, making the systems incompatible with the AVs. Therefore, in this article, a software-defined-networking-assisted continuous clustering approach called migrating consignment region (MiCR) based on the federated K-means algorithm is proposed for disseminating SCMs to the AVs via 5G V2X communication. Unlike other methods that create clusters for every instance of SCM dissemination, MiCR continuously holds moving clusters for disseminating SCMs to AVs with ultrahigh reliability and low latency. The proposed MiCR approach has been simulated under real-time highway road maps and compared with other methods. The simulation results prove the superiority of MiCR in terms of network overload, SCM delivery ratio, latency, dissemination efficiency, and collision rate compared with the existing methods.

AB Range is an important factor to the design of autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs), while drag reduction efforts are pursued, the investigation of body-propeller interaction is another vital consideration. We present a numerical and experimental study of the hull-propeller interaction for deeply submerged underwater vehicles, using a proportional-integral- derivative (PID) controller method to estimate self-propulsion point in CFD environment. The hydrodynamic performance of hull and propeller at the balance state when the AUV sails at a fixed depth is investigated, using steady RANS solver of Star-CCM+. The proposed steady RANS solver takes only hours to reach a reasonable solution. It is more time efficient than unsteady simulations which takes days or weeks, as well as huge consumption of computing resources. Explorer 1000, a long range AUV developed by Shenyang Institute of Automation, Chinese Academy of Sciences, was studied as an object, and self-propulsion point, thrust deduction, wake fraction and hull efficiency were analyzed by using the proposed RANS method. Behind-hull performance of the selected propeller MAU4-40, as well as the hull-propeller interaction, was obtained from the computed hydrodynamic forces. The numerical results are in good qualitative and quantitative agreement with the experimental results obtained in the Qiandao Lake of Zhejiang province, China.

AB This paper focuses on the path-tracking controller design for autonomous ground vehicles (AGVs) using four-wheel steering (4WS) and direct yaw-moment control (DYC) systems. In order to deal with the parametric uncertainties, a linear parameter-varying (LPV) H-infinity controller is designed as the high-level controller to generate the front and rear wheel steering angles and external yaw moment based on linear matrix inequality (LMI) approach. The lower-level controller is designed for torque allocation between the left and right side wheels to yield the desired total longitudinal force and external yaw moment utilizing weighted least square (WLS) allocation algorithm. To test the performance of the proposed path-tracking controller, numerical simulations are carried out based on a high-fidelity and full-vehicle model constructed in CarSim. Simulation results show that the LPV/H-infinity controller has better path-tracking performance than the fixed gain H-infinity controller. To show the superiority of 4WS+DYC control system, the contrast simulation is performed based on LPV/H-infinity controller. Simulation results indicate that 4WS+DYC control system has better path-tracking performance and handling stability than active front steering (AFS), AFS+DYC and 4WS control systems.

AB The present work details the measurement capabilities of Wave Glider autonomous surface vehicles (ASVs) for research-grade meteorology, wave, and current data. Methodologies for motion compensation are described and tested, including a correction technique to account for Doppler shifting of the wave signal. Wave Glider measurements are evaluated against observations obtained from World Meteorological Organization (WMO)-compliant moored buoy assets located off the coast of Southern California. The validation spans a range of field conditions and includes multiple deployments to assess the quality of vehicle-based observations. Results indicate that Wave Gliders can accu-rately measure wave spectral information, bulk wave parameters, water velocities, bulk winds, and other atmospheric variables with the application of appropriate motion compensation techniques. Measurement errors were found to be comparable to those from reference moored buoys and within WMO operational requirements. The findings of this study represent a step toward enabling the use of ASV-based data for the calibration and validation of remote obser-vations and assimilation into forecast models.

DE 3-D vehicle detection; camera; low-resolution light detection and
   ranging (LiDAR)
AB Light detection and ranging (LiDAR) has been widely used in autonomous vehicles for perception and localization. However, the cost of a high-resolution LiDAR is still prohibitively expensive, while its low-resolution counterpart is much more affordable. Therefore, using low-resolution LiDAR for autonomous driving is an economically viable solution, but the point cloud sparsity makes it extremely challenging. In this letter, we propose a two-stage neural network framework that enables 3-D object detection using a low-resolution LiDAR. Taking input from a low-resolution LiDAR point cloud and a monocular camera image, a depth completion network is employed to produce dense point cloud that is subsequently processed by a voxel-based network for 3-D object detection. Evaluated with KITTI dataset for 3-D object detection in bird-eye view (BEV), the experimental result shows that the proposed approach performs significantly better than directly applying the 16-line LiDAR point cloud for object detection. For both easy and moderate cases, our 3-D vehicle detection results are close to those using 64-line high-resolution LiDARs.

   STRATEGY
AB Autonomous Vehicles (AVs) have shown indelible and revolutionary effects on accident reduction and more efficient use of travel time, with outstanding socio-economic impact. Despite these benefits, to make AVs accepted by a wide demographic and produce them on an industrial scale with a reasonable price, there are still a number of technological and social challenges that need to be tackled. Path Tracking Controller (PTC) of AVs is one of the high potential subsystems that can be further improved in order to achieve more accurate, robust and comfortable tracking performance. This study provides a critical review and simulation study of several selected techniques used for the design of PTC of AVs. The AVs are assumed to have limited controllability due to non-holonomic constraints, such as car-like vehicles and differential drive mobile robots. A detailed discussion will be provided on the simulation outcomes as well as the pros and cons of each technique for the sake of implementation and improvement of state-of-the-art PTC.

AB This paper presents a general flight rule-based autonomous trajectory planning scheme for two aerial vehicles to avoid obstacles and collisions in known environments in low-altitude airspace for general aviation. Flight rules in low-altitude airspace are first introduced based on the general flight rules in US, UK and China, and then the suitable flight rules are embedded into the trajectory planning algorithm. It is supposed that the flight parameters, such as positions and velocities, are all available to the aerial vehicles involved in the possible conflict. Then the trajectory of each aerial vehicle is calculated by optimizing an objective function, such as distance and fuel consumption, with the constraints corresponding to the airspace traffic rules. The optimization problem is solved by receding horizon control (RHC) based mixed integer linear programming (MILP). Compared with other collision avoidance algorithms, the proposed algorithm can be adapted to plan the autonomous trajectory to avoid pairwise collision and obstacles as proposed general flight rules. Simulations show the feasibility of the proposed scheme.

AB Coordinated dynamical swarm behavior occurs when certain types of animals forage for food or try to avoid predators. Analogous behaviors can occur in engineering, systems (e.g., in groups of autonomous mobile robots or air vehicles). In this paper, we study a model of an M-dimensional (M greater than or equal to 2) asynchronous swarm with a fixed communication topology, where each member only communicate with fixed neighbors, to provide conditions under which collision-free convergence can be achieved with finite-size swarm members that have proximity sensors, and neighbor position sensors that only provide delayed position information. Moreover, we give conditions under which an M-dimensional asynchronous mobile swarm with a fixed communication topology following an "edge-leader" can maintain cohesion during movements even in the presence of sensing delays and asynchronism. In addition, the swarm movement flexibility is analyzed. Such stability analysis is of fundamental importance if one wants to understand the coordination mechanisms for groups of autonomous vehicles or robots, where intermember communication channels are less than perfect and collisions must be avoided.

AB This article addresses an autonomous manipulation problem for an underwater vehicle-manipulator system (UVMS) operating in a free-floating way while subjecting to unknown continuous disturbance. More specifically, a composite control scheme composed of disturbance observer (DOB), predictor model network (PM-Net), and nonlinear model predictive control (NMPC), is devised to improve the control performance of UVMS (i.e., unicycle-like UVMS actuated only in the surge, heave, and yaw for vehicle body) in the case of disturbance, model mismatch, and input saturation. A RBF-DOB is formulated by combining a DOB and a Radial Basis Function (RBF) neural network to estimate disturbance at the current step. Then, the PM-Network, composed of a disturbance predictor network and state predictor network, is developed based on long short-term memory (LSTM) network that predicts UVMS state sequences considering model mismatch and disturbance. The NMPC is deployed as a feedback control law to endow the input saturation of the UVMS and produce optimal control action. Compared with conventional DOB control methods using feed-forward compensation of disturbance, the primary merit of the proposed approach is that the disturbance estimated by RBF-DOB is utilized in the PM-Net to predict future UVMS state sequences, which are exploited on the NMPC's receding optimization. RGB0,0,0Finally, realistic simulation and relevant experiment are conducted to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method. Note to Practitioners-The motivation behind this article is the autonomous manipulation of an underwater vehicle-manipulator system subjected to unknown disturbance. However, it is not always feasible or straightforward to obtain the external disturbance and unmodeled dynamics for designing robust controllers. On the one hand, how to manipulate the disturbance into the designed controller to generate optimal control action rather than by using feed-forward compensation. On the other hand, the control input saturation often occurs in the UVMS control, especially under the disturbance rejection conditions, where it should be considered in the controller design. Currently, the predominant methods for UVMS control lack a control scheme that provides a complete and credible control strategy that takes the aforementioned issues into consideration. Motivated by the above analysis, this study provides a composite control scheme to deal with the dynamic uncertainties, unknown disturbance, and input saturation. RGB0,0,0The results of realistic simulation and relevant experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method. Hopefully, our control method can provide valuable theoretical and technical guidance to practicing marine engineers for controller design.

AB In recent years, the rapid improvement of sensor and wireless communication technologies powerfully impels the development of advanced cooperative driving systems, generating the demands to form the Internet of Vehicles (IoV). With the assistance of cooperative communication among vehicles, the road safety can be greatly enhanced in the IoV. In this paper, we propose a cooperative driving scheme for vehicles at intersections in the IoV. First, the driver's intention is modeled by the BP neural network trained with driving dataset. Then, the identified intention is used as the control matrix of the Kalman filter model, by which the vehicle trajectory can be predicted. Finally, by collecting the information of vehicles' trajectories at the intersections, we develop a collision probability evaluation model to reflect the conflict level among vehicles at intersections. Through obtained collision probability, the driver or the autonomous control unit can determine the next step to avoid the possible collisions. Numerical results show that our proposed scheme has high accuracy in terms of driver's intention identification, trajectory prediction and collision probability evaluation.

AB Recent advances in unmanned and autonomous vehicle technology are accelerating the push to integrate these vehicles into environments, such as the National Airspace System, the national highway system, and many manufacturing environments. These environments will require close collaboration between humans and vehicles, and their large scalesmean that real-world field trials may be difficult to execute due to concerns of cost, availability, and technological maturity. This paper describes the use of an agent-based model to explore the system-level effects of unmanned vehicle implementation on the performance of these collaborative human-vehicle environments. In particular, this paper explores the introduction of three different unmanned vehicle control architectures into aircraft carrier flight deck operations. The different control architectures are tested under an examplemission scenario using 22 aircraft. Results show that certain control architectures can improve the rate of launches, but these improvements are limited by the structure of flight deck operations and nature of the launch task (which is defined independently of vehicles). Until the launch task is improved, the effects of unmanned vehicle control architectures on flight deck performance will be limited.

AB The Marginal Ice Zone and Arctic Sea State programs examined the processes that govern evolution of the rapidly changing seasonal ice zone in the Beaufort Sea. Autonomous platforms operating from the ice and within the water column collected measurements across the atmosphere-ice-ocean system and provided the persistence to sample continuously through the springtime retreat and autumn advance of sea ice. Autonomous platforms also allowed operational modalities that reduced the field programs' logistical requirements. Observations indicate that thermodynamics, especially the radiative balances of the ice-albedo feedback, govern the seasonal cycle of sea ice, with the role of surface waves confined to specific events. Continuous sampling from winter into autumn also reveals the imprint of winter ice conditions and fracturing on summertime floe size distribution. These programs demonstrate effective use of integrated systems of autonomous platforms for persistent, multiscale Arctic observing. Networks of autonomous systems are well suited to capturing the vast scales of variability inherent in the Arctic system.

ID DESIGN
AB Recent advances in vehicle connectivity have allowed formation of autonomous vehicle platoons for improved mobility and traffic throughput. In order to avoid a pile-up in such platoons, it is important to ensure platoon (string) stability, which is the focus of this work. As per conventional definition of string stability, the power (2-norm) of the spacing error signals should not amplify downstream in a platoon. But in practice, it is the infinity-norm of the spacing error signal that dictates whether a collision occurs. We address this discrepancy in the first part of our work, where we reconsider string stability from a safety perspective and develop an upper limit on the maximum spacing error in a homogeneous platoon as a function of the acceleration maneuver of the lead vehicle. In the second part of this paper, we extend our previous results by providing the minimum achievable time headway for platoons with two-predecessor lookup schemes experiencing burst-noise packet losses. Finally, we utilize throttle and brake maps to develop a longitudinal vehicle model and validate it against a Lincoln MKZ which is then used for numerical corroboration of the proposed time headway selection algorithms.

AB The underwater terrain-aided navigation (TAN) method with a single beam echo sounder (SBES) can achieve long-term underwater navigation. However, due to the limited bathymetric measurements collected using a SBES, the accuracy and robustness of the TAN method are affected by a variety of factors, such as the richness of terrain features and the gradient of underwater terrain. Consequently, the SBES-TAN methods with gridded or contour priori maps cannot yield robust navigational results for long-range autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs). To address this issue, this paper proposed a robust fusion TAN (RFTAN) method with a SBES on the basis of particle filter (PF) theory to locate a vehicle accurately. In the proposed method, both terrain positioning results provided by gridded-TAN and contour-TAN were fused to weigh a particle, with the fuzzy-theory-based fusion weight division (FWD) method. Playback experiments were conducted using 25-h-length field data collected from an at-sea experiment, and experimental results show that the proposed method can provide both robust and accurate long-term navigational results for AUVs.

AB In the context of automated driving, Electric Power Steering (EPS) systems represent an enabling technology. They introduce the ergonomic function of reducing the physical effort required by the driver during the steering maneuver. Furthermore, EPS gives the possibility of high precision control of the steering system, thus paving the way to autonomous driving capability. In this context, the present work presents a performance assessment of an EPS system designed for a full-electric all-wheel-drive electric prototype racing in Formula Student Driverless (FSD) competitions. Specifically, the system is based on the linear actuation of the steering rack by using a ball screw. The screw nut is rotated through a belt transmission driven by a brushless DC motor. Modeling and motion control techniques for this system are presented. Moreover, the numerical model is tuned through a grey-box identification approach. Finally, the performance of the proposed EPS system is tested experimentally on the vehicle through both sine-sweep profiles and co-simulated driverless sessions. The system performance is assessed in terms of reference tracking capability, thus showing favorable results for the proposed actuation solution.

ID LOCALIZATION
AB Underwater acoustic communications consume a significant amount of energy due to the high transmission power (10 - 50 W) and long data packet transmission times (0.1 - 1s). Mobile Autonomous Underwater Vehicles (AUVs) can conserve energy by waiting for the 'best' network topology configuration, e.g., a favorable alignment, before starting to communicate. Due to the frequency-selective underwater acoustic ambient noise and high medium power absorption - which increases exponentially with distance - a shorter distance between AUVs translates into a lower transmission loss and a higher available bandwidth. By leveraging the predictability of AUV trajectories, a novel solution is proposed that optimizes communications by delaying packet transmissions in order to wait for a favorable network topology (thus trading end-to-end delay for energy and/or throughput). In addition, the solution proposed - which is implemented and compared with geographic routing solutions and delay-tolerant networking solutions using an emulator that integrates underwater acoustic WHOI Micro-Modems - exploits the frequency-dependent radiation pattern of underwater acoustic transducers to reduce communication energy consumption by adjusting the transducer directivity on the fly.

TI Radar-Based Perception for Autonomous Outdoor Vehicles
SO JOURNAL OF FIELD ROBOTICS
LA English
DT Article
AB Autonomous vehicle operations in outdoor environments challenge robotic perception. Construction, mining, agriculture, and planetary exploration environments are examples in which the presence of dust, fog, rain, changing illumination due to low sun angles, and lack of contrast can dramatically degrade conventional stereo and laser sensing. Nonetheless, environment perception can still succeed under compromised visibility through the use of a millimeter-wave radar. Radar also allows for multiple object detection within a single beam, whereas other range sensors are limited to one target return per emission. However, radar has shortcomings as well, such as a large footprint, specularity effects, and limited range resolution, all of which may result in poor environment survey or difficulty in interpretation. This paper presents a novelmethod for ground segmentation using a millimeter-wave radar mounted on a ground vehicle. Issues relevant to short-range perception in an outdoor environment are described along with field experiments and a quantitative comparison to laser data. The ability to classify the ground is successfully demonstrated in clear and low-visibility conditions, and significant improvement in range accuracy is shown. Finally, conclusions are drawn on the utility of millimeter-wave radar as a robotic sensor for persistent and accurate perception in natural scenarios. (C) 2011 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

AB This paper proposes a nonlinear robust adaptive control strategy to force a six degrees of freedom underactuated underwater vehicle with only four actuators to follow a predefined path at a desired speed despite of the presence of environmental disturbances and vehicle's unknown physical parameters. The proposed controller is designed using Lyapunov's direct method, the popular backstepping and parameter projection techniques. The closed loop path following errors can be made arbitrarily small. Interestingly, it is shown that our developed control strategy is easily extendible to situations of practical importance such as parking and point-to-point navigation. Numerical simulations are provided to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed methodology. (C) 2004 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB This paper addresses tracking control problems for autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) systems with coupled nonlinear functions. For the first time, the radial basis function (RBF) is applied to the model reference adaptive control system, and the vehicle horizontal plane model is proposed. When the AUV movement is affected by the driving force, ocean resistance, and the force generated by the water current, the expected output of the AUV's system is difficult to meet the expectations, making the AUV trajectory tracking problems challenging. There are two main options for finding suitable controllers for AUVs. The first is making the AUV model achieve better stability using a more complex controller. The second is the simpler controller structure, which can ensure faster system feedback. The RBF and model reference adaptive control (MEAC) system are combined to increase the number of hidden layers, increasing the AUV tracking stability. Because the embedded computing module of an AUV is a bit limited, 31 hidden layers are chosen to simplify the controller structures. A couple of Lyapunov functions are designed for the expected surge and sway velocities, and the vehicle tracking error gradually converges to (0,0). The controller design results are imported into the AUV actuator model by software, and after 0.64 s, the AUV tracking error is less than 1%. At last, the vehicle tracking experiments were carried out, showing that after 0.5 s, the AUV tracking error was less than 1%.

AB This paper investigates the coordination control problem for a special nonlinear heterogeneous multi-agent system consisting of tail-sitter unmanned aerial vehicles and unmanned ground vehicles with uncertainties and disturbances. A robust hierarchical pinning control scheme is proposed for the heterogeneous multi-agent system to restrain the uncertainties and disturbances and achieve coordination scenarios. The heterogeneous multi-agent system can realize coordination tasks by selecting proper pinning nodes and estimating coupling strength. The robustness of the whole system is proven utilizing the Lyapunov stability theorem. The effectiveness of the robust hierarchical pining control method is validated by simulation scenarios.

AB This paper investigates the path planning problem for unmanned surface vehicle (USV), wherein the goal is to find the shortest, smoothest, most economical and safest path in the presence of obstacles and currents, which is subject to the collision avoidance, motion boundaries and velocity constraints. We formulate this problem as a multi-objective nonlinear optimization problem with generous constraints. Then, we propose the dynamic augmented multi-objective particle swarm optimization algorithm to achieve the solution. With our approach, USV can select the ideal path from the Pareto optimal paths set. Numerical simulations verify the effectiveness of our formulated model and proposed algorithm. (C) 2018 ISA.

AB In this paper, Unmanned Aerial Vehicles are used for establishing an airborne communication relay chain to extend the communication range or to obtain a channel between two far points which are outside the single UAV communication range. Positions of the UAVs in the chain are detected by the vehicles autonomously and while establishing the suitable formation, collision avoidance between vehicles and other geographical obstacles are considered by using artificial potential fields. Especially to provide reliable continues communication between vehicles as uninterrupted channels, positions of the UAVs which are providing line of sight, calculated automatically by tuning artificial potential field parameters dynamically. The success of this novel approach is expressed by simulation studies in Matlab environment and the simulation results are validated using NS2 simulator.

AB Trajectory prediction for challenging scenarios has always been a significant problem in the field due to the complexity of dynamic scenarios and interactions. Furthermore, there is often a dynamic gap between evaluating and validating methods on fixed datasets and real driving scenarios. This letter forms part of a series of reports emanating from the IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Vehicles's Decentralized and Hybrid Workshops (DHW) dedicated to the field of Scenarios Engineering. Our research proposes a scenario engineering-based calibration and validation framework for trajectory prediction of autonomous vehicles to more effectively validate the performance of the method in challenging scenarios. First, Scenarios Engineering (SE) uses OpenSCENARIO and real dataset to generate high-definition maps for challenging driving scenarios. Then, the vectorization approach is employed to extract contextual details from the scene and agent trajectory information from the HD map, and the graph neural network is used to model the high-order interaction to realize the interactive trajectory prediction. Compared with the traditional method, the trajectory prediction can be calibrated through SE so that the prediction process can use more traffic information and attribute characteristics, and improve the evaluation index of prediction. The DHW discusses a practical case to verify the potential of the trajectory prediction framework based on scenarios generation in improving the authenticity and accuracy of trajectory prediction.

ID AUTONOMOUS VEHICLES; HEALTH
AB The United States (U.S.) has experienced persistent truck driver shortages for the past several decades, as demand for truckers has increased while individuals willing to fill driving jobs have decreased. Studies in the transportation literature have not examined industry views on driver shortages, which are expected to become more severe, in combination with trucking industry perspectives on the impact of automated vehicles (AVs) on driving jobs. This study addresses these knowledge gaps through focus groups with trucking industry participants (N = 67) working in three organizational levels (25 upper-level management or owners, 20 supervisors or dispatchers, and 22 drivers) and a supplemental online survey. Using an inductive thematic analysis approach, findings indicate that companies struggle to address driver shortages because of difficulties recruiting younger workers related to quality-of-life issues, job requirements, and low rates of pay. AVs were thought to be a potential solution to the driver shortage, although there will be a continued need for drivers to perform certain tasks. The potential changes in industry positions could attract new workers but would require older workers to adapt to using new technology. From a workforce development perspective, training programs targeting technicians and drivers can help prepare the trucking workforce for an autonomous future.

AB In this paper we introduce a new class of Pickup and Delivery problems on circles (or rings). These problems arise in the field of public transportation systems where autonomous (i.e. driverless) vehicles travel on circular networks. We consider a set of stations arranged in a circle and a set of transportation requests. Each request asks for the transportation of a certain quantity from a pickup station to a delivery station. A fleet of capacitated vehicles is available at the depot. In the first part of the paper we propose a classification scheme for these problems. In the second part, we address the variants in which the vehicles are allowed to move in a single direction of the circle (either clockwise or counterclockwise) and the objective is to minimize the number of tours on the ring while serving all the requests. We provide a complexity analysis for this class of problems. We develop polynomial time algorithms for the variants that are polynomially solvable and proofs of NP-hardness for the variants that are NP-hard. In addition, for the latter, we provide mathematical formulations and perform computational tests that show the effectiveness of these formulations. Finally, we compare optimal solutions with those obtained using a straightforward greedy algorithm. (c) 2021 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

ID SELF-PROPULSION
AB The autonomy of any airborne, land borne or waterborne vehicle starts with controlling its speed. To achieve cruise speed control, the conventional approach is to use closed-loop feedback control systems that require high precision sensors. Underwater sensors are expensive due to harsh environment and corrosive properties of seawater. In this study, we propose a speed control system for autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) that closes the control loop via a feedforward mechanism, eliminating the need for these expensive sensors. The feedforward control is based on the recently developed self-propulsion estimation model which can accurately predict propeller rotation rate for conventional AUV forms. The model is first validated by comparing the predicted resistance and propeller rotation rate of DARPA Suboff with the experimental and numerical results published in the literature. After observing a good match, the feedforward control system is used to ensure that the AUV reaches a predetermined surge speed. Two different underwater vehicles are considered in presenting the results of this study: the DARPA Suboff and the Gavia AUV, which has real time measurements available in the literature. The feedforward control system developed in this study achieves the desired speed with negligible errors. Transient response analysis shows that the computer simulation results are in good agreement with experimental results for the Gavia AUV.

AB The management of transport operations is a promising field for agent-based applications. Acting in a collaborative way, the agents can be seen as a multi-agent system that enables vehicles to handle new information perceived during the operation along cargo collecting routes. Traditional research in this field usually focus on the servicing of new transportation demands, in this paper the agents could detect the presence of unexpected traffic congestions and deciding about the transference of tasks to others vehicles. This article evaluates collaborative strategies for applying the agent-based approach to a dynamic vehicle routing formulation, where vehicles are assigned to picking-up components and parts from Original Equipment Manufacturer suppliers. A sequential probabilistic ratio test is used to predict eventual unperformed collecting tasks. Two evaluating criteria are simultaneously used to select a specific collaborative strategy: the service level, represented by the average percentage of performed tasks, plus the average daily operating cost of the vehicle fleet. The evaluation of collaboration strategies between vehicles allowed understand the functioning of distributed decision making, contributing to the adoption of autonomous control methods of transportation operations.

AB The accurate perception of the surroundings of a vehicle has been the subject of study of numerous automotive researchers for many years. Although several projects in this area have been successfully completed, very few prototypes have actually been industrialized and installed in mass produced cars. This indicates that these research efforts must continue in order to improve the present systems. Moreover, the trend to include communication systems in vehicles extends the potential of these perception systems transmitting their information via wireless to other vehicles that may be affected by the surveyed environment. In this paper we present a forward collision warning system based on a laser scanner that is able to detect several potential danger situations. Decision algorithms try to determine the most convenient manoeuvre when evaluating the obstacles' positions and speeds, road geometry, etc. Once detected, the presented system can act on the actuators of the ego-vehicle as well as transmit this information to other vehicles circulating in the same area using vehicle-to-vehicle communications. The system has been tested for overtaking manoeuvres under different scenarios and the correct actions have been performed.

DE Electric vehicles; Automated vehicles; Ridesourcing; Monetary costs
AB Revolutions in shared mobility services, vehicle electrification, and automated vehicle technology will affect urban traffic patterns, energy use and CO2 emissions, the automotive industry, public transportation, and more. This paper examines the monetary costs of these innovations for users in the near-term (approximately 2020) and how they may evolve in the long-term (approximately 2030-2035). We estimate traveler costs for light duty vehicle trips on a per-mile basis, and investigate their sensitivity to vehicle powertrain, vehicle size, travel mode and intensity of vehicle use, and DC charging assumptions. To highlight differences between human and automated driving, we consider only autonomous vehicle scenarios in the long-term. We document three main findings. First, as battery costs continue to drop over the next decade, private battery electric vehicles will become more cost-competitive with internal combustion vehicles; and in high-mileage ridesourcing applications, electric vehicles will be much more cost-competitive. Second, near-term ridesourcing trips will likely remain about 4-5 times the per-mile cost of driving one's own car, while pooled trips cut this factor to around 3. Third, in the long-term automated vehicles may make ridesourcing cheaper than driving one's own vehicle. Even if the manufacturing cost of automated vehicles remains high, this cost will be minor when amortized over a service life of 400,000 miles. These findings are unchanged even with significant variations in assumed future battery and automation costs, electricity (charging) cost, vehicle insurance and maintenance cost, and ridesourcing providers' overhead rates.

DE Autonomous vehicle; vehicle localization; semantic localization;

ID TRACKING
AB Autonomous driving demands robust and precise vehicle localization in complex environments with limited on-board computational resources. Incorporating reliable semantic information with localization algorithms can increase accuracy remarkably, however, the process of extracting semantic information from LiDAR point clouds and matching it to semantic maps is computationally intensive. Moreover, pure semantic localization cannot achieve the robustness requirements for safe self-driving as the necessary quantity of semantic landmarks cannot be guaranteed under extreme conditions. In this paper, we present a lightweight semantic-aided localization method that improves upon traditional techniques in two ways. First, we propose a highly efficient pipeline to extract three semantic classes from a LiDAR scan. Second, instead of semantic 3D point cloud registration, map matching is performed through 2D key point matching. We then integrate these two functions into a dynamic semantic aided localization framework. Our on-road experiments demonstrate that the proposed method achieves both the high accuracy of semantic localization and the robustness of non-semantic localization. With our algorithm consuming under 10% of CPU resources, we observe reduced positioning error, especially peak error, when comparing to non-semantic counterparts.

ID UNMANNED AERIAL VEHICLE
AB Autonomous landing of quadrotor unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) is a critical and challenging issue, especially on a moving target under complex terrain. This paper proposes a practicable solution that consists of a reference trajectory and a robust control strategy. More specifically, a continuous reference trajectory is planned to ensure the safety, where a feasible landing constraint is provided by introducing the sway motion of the target platform. Then, a robust hierarchical control strategy that exploits a saturated force controller and an attitude constraint torque controller is developed, where a dynamics estimator is employed to counteract the uncertain dynamics. Stability analysis indicates that the overall closed-loop system is uniformly ultimately bounded. Since the global positioning system (GPS) fails to provide an acceptable measurement for the precise landing, an ultra-wide band (UWB) positioning system is designed which possesses a 20-centimeter level of accuracy. To simulate a realistic scenario over the rough ground or sea condition, a motion platform with sway motion is utilized in the experiment facility. Flight experiments are performed to validate and assess the proposed strategy.

AB Predicting future events accurately is a task of great importance for autonomous vehicles. In this work we focus on lane change events. For this, we propose a novel attention mechanism on top of recurrent neural networks for the prediction task, which improves performance and yields more interpretable models. As critical corner cases are often not considered and reflected in traditional prediction metrics, we additionally introduce a new scenario-based evaluation scheme, which we posit be considered for further maneuver prediction works. Prediction and planning tasks often are correlated, usually sharing input representations and differing in expected outputs and their subsequent consideration. Here, we detail a supporting layer for planning tasks, which analyzes situations w.r.t. their suitability for lane changes and can serve as decision-making support for any planning algorithm. Exploitation of similarities between this task and the aforementioned prediction problem further improves performance of the prediction task, as well as labelling quality of the assessment task. Additionally, we extend our evaluation to urban scenarios, showcasing the generalizability of our proposed prediction models.

AB There is presently a need for more robust navigation algorithms for autonomous industrial vehicles. These have reasonably guaranteed the adequate reliability of the navigation. In the current work, the stability of a modified algorithm for collision-free guiding of this type of vehicle is ensured. A lateral control and a longitudinal control are implemented. To demonstrate their viability, a stability analysis employing the Lyapunov method is carried out. In addition, this mathematical analysis enables the constants of the designed algorithm to be determined. In conjunction with the navigation algorithm, the present work satisfactorily solves the localization problem, also known as simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM). Simultaneously, a convolutional neural network is managed, which is used to calculate the trajectory to be followed by the AGV, by implementing the artificial vision. The use of neural networks for image processing is considered to constitute the most robust and flexible method for realising a navigation algorithm. In this way, the autonomous vehicle is provided with considerable autonomy. It can be regarded that the designed algorithm is adequate, being able to trace any type of path.

AB For robust vision-based forward collision warning (FCW) and autonomous emergency braking (AEB) systems, not only reliable detection performance including high detection rate and low false positives but also accurate measurement output of a target vehicle is required. Especially, in order to reduce false alarm or activation of FCW/AEB systems, the systems require the precise measurement output of a target object, such as position, velocity, acceleration, and time-to-collision (TTC). In this study, we developed a measurement estimation algorithm of a target vehicle using a monocular camera. This method estimates two cases of vehicle widths for a target vehicle by using the detected lane information and a pin-hole camera model. After that, the position, velocity, acceleration, and TTC of a target vehicle are estimated by using a Kalman filter for the each estimated vehicle width. To improve robustness, the both estimation results using the detected lane information and the pinhole camera model are fused. This estimation algorithm was evaluated and compared with the state-of-the-art technology. As a result, the proposed measurement output estimation method can improve the performance of the FCW/AEB systems.

AB The purpose of this article is to introduce and characterize the bounded acceleration shortest path problem (BASP), a generalization of the shortest path problem (SP). This problem is associated to a graph: nodes represent positions of a mobile vehicle and arcs are associated to preassigned geometric paths that connect these positions. The BASP consists in finding the minimum-time path between two nodes. Differently from the SP, the vehicle has to satisfy bounds on maximum and minimum acceleration and speed, which depend on the vehicle's position on the currently traveled arc. Even if the BASP is NP-hard in the general case, we present a solution algorithm that achieves polynomial time-complexity under some additional hypotheses on problem data.

AB This study presents the study of beamforming capabilities of arrays installed on a non-conductive unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV). The main purposes of this study are the application of a beamforming algorithm by including the airframe in the optimisations and the study of simplifications of the aircraft model, so as to allow performing full-wave simulations, even though the UAV is much larger than the operating wavelength. To validate the simplified electromagnetic model, antenna arrays have been designed and installed onto the UAV. Radiation pattern measurements demonstrate that the proposed simplifications yielded very good radiation pattern predictions and can be used as guidelines for simulation of other kinds of non-conductive aircrafts.

AB To fully automate some in-field agricultural tasks, an autonomous vehicle has to be guided along a crop held. In this work, we describe how a vision system extracts the guidance information for vehicle navigation in a crop row. The method is based on extraction of the scene structure from perspective information that a set of coplanar parallel lines, representing the crop rows, generate in the image. To solve some drawbacks caused by these natural environments, a method to extract the row lines is described, and an approach to calculate the vanishing point proposed. A technique to recover missing information is also introduced. The method has been applied to long sequences of images taken by a moving vehicle in crop row scenes.

ID BEHAVIOR; SYSTEM
AB One of the most challenging problems in autonomous driving is trajectory planning for lane changes. Conventional trajectory planning is generally realized by optimizing a specific cost function. However, the model performance required for different scenarios makes it repetitive and time-consuming to tune the cost function. Furthermore, to ensure driving safety, comfort as well as traffic efficiency, it is essential to interact with other vehicles by predicting their driving intentions. Therefore, this paper proposes a segmented-updated lane-change trajectory planning method for autonomous vehicles on closed highways. The maximum entropy inverse reinforcement learning (IRL) algorithm for human demonstration learning and the long short-term memory and Bayesian network (LSTM-BN)-based model for target vehicles' driving intentions are applied. Three contributions are made in this work: 1) The LSTM-BN is used to judge the intentions of surrounding vehicles based on its historical information to inform lane-change trajectory planning. 2) Different feature-based cost functions of the IRL algorithm are designed according to different lane-change scenarios, which enhances its adaptability to different scenarios. 3) Segmented-updated trajectory planning is used to dynamically optimize trajectories via an online optimization process, which reduces the model's limitations and improves overall lane-change performance. Finally, simulation experiments demonstrate that the proposed method has strong generalization ability, reliable accuracy, and can adjust lane-change trajectories reasonably according to the driving intentions of surrounding vehicles.

AB In semiconductor plants, autonomous vehicle systems (AVSs) are designed to transfer wafer lots using several hundreds of vehicles. To minimize the idleness of production machines, vehicles must be quickly assigned and sent to the required location in advance. Currently, owing to uncertainties that exit in production processing, simple deterministic heuristic approaches are the ones that are predominantly used when making decisions regarding lot discharging and recharging of production machines. However, to obtain better solutions that reflect the near-future states of production machines and AVSs, more sophisticated approaches are required. To address this, we propose a hybrid predictive algorithm using which a delivery vehicle can be sent in advance to minimize the production machine idle time. To predict the remaining processing time, we combine a latent variable regression and an artificial neural network to model and generalize the linear and the nonlinear patterns of wafer takt times. We then use dynamic time warping to identify the best matching pattern for the wafers being processed, thereby accurately estimating the remaining processing time. The experimental results demonstrated the superior performance of the proposed method in comparison to the existing ones in terms of accuracy. Finally, based on the results of field applications, we found that the proposed method can improve the operational efficiency of AVSs by allowing fast wafer transfer and maximize production throughput by reducing machine idle time.

AB Autonomous collision avoidance requires accurate environmental perception; however, flight systems often possess limited sensing capabilities with field-of-view (FOV) restrictions. To navigate this challenge, we present a safety-aware approach for online determination of the optimal sensor-pointing direction psi(d) which utilizes control barrier functions (CBFs). First, we generate a spatial density function phi, which leverages CBF constraints to map the collision risk of all local coordinates. Then, we convolve 4, with an attitude-dependent sensor FOV quality function to produce the objective function Gamma which quantifies the total observed risk for a given pointing direction. Finally, by finding the global optimizer for Gamma, we identify the value of psi(d) which maximizes the perception of risk within the FOV. We incorporate psi(d) into a safety-critical flight architecture and conduct a numerical analysis using multiple simulated mission profiles. Our algorithm achieves a success rate of 88 - 96%, constituting a 16 - 29% improvement compared to the best heuristic methods. We demonstrate the functionality of our approach via a flight demonstration using the Crazyflie 2.1 micro-quadrotor. Without a priori obstacle knowledge, the quadrotor follows a dynamic flight path while simultaneously calculating and tracking psi(d) to perceive and avoid two static obstacles with an average computation time of 371 mu s.

AB The extended downturn experienced by the oil and gas industry has forced operators and service companies to look at new ways to operate more efficiently. Reductions in personnel and assets have led to a rethink of how operations are conducted to support operations offshore. A newer concept of resident vehicle operations is changing the way the industry approaches the inspection, maintenance, and repair market. The resulting technology advances to support the enablement of resident vehicle programs are expected to change the planning, staging, and deployment of personnel and equipment to support offshore operations. How companies interact with these advanced remote systems is migrating field planning back toward a centralized command and control feature set. This allows for shared resources to be used for multiple activities, thereby reducing costs and enabling more efficient operations.

AB This paper proposes an autonomous maneuver decision method using transfer learning pigeon-inspired optimization (TLPIO) for unmanned combat aerial vehicles (UCAVs) in dogfight engagements. Firstly, a nonlinear F-16 aircraft model and automatic control system are constructed by a MATLAB/Simulink platform. Secondly, a 3-degrees-of-freedom (3-DOF) aircraft model is used as a maneuvering command generator, and the expanded elemental maneuver library is designed, so that the aircraft state reachable set can be obtained. Then, the game matrix is composed with the air combat situation evaluation function calculated according to the angle and range threats. Finally, a key point is that the objective function to be optimized is designed using the game mixed strategy, and the optimal mixed strategy is obtained by TLPIO. Significantly, the proposed TLPIO does not initialize the population randomly, but adopts the transfer learning method based on Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence to initialize the population, which improves the search accuracy of the optimization algorithm. Besides, the convergence and time complexity of TLPIO are discussed. Comparison analysis with other classical optimization algorithms highlights the advantage of TLPIO. In the simulation of air combat, three initial scenarios are set, namely, opposite, offensive and defensive conditions. The effectiveness performance of the proposed autonomous maneuver decision method is verified by simulation results.

ID ENTRY; MODEL
AB Decision-making is still a significant challenge to realize fully autonomous driving. Using deep reinforcement learning (DRL) to solve autonomous driving decision-making problems is a recent trend. A common method is to encode surrounding vehicles in a grid to describe the state space to help DRL network extract the scene features. However, in the process of human driving, surrounding vehicles at different positions have different contributions to decision-making. Meanwhile, the network is difficult to fully extract useful features in a sparse state, which can also lead to catastrophic actions. Therefore, this work proposes a spatial attention module to calculate different weights to represent different contributions to decision-making results. And a channel attention module is proposed to fully extract useful features in sparse state features. These two attention modules are integrated into dueling double deep Q network, named D3QN-DA, as a high-level decision-maker of a hierarchical hierarchical control structure based decision-making system. To improve agent performance, an emergency safe checker is introduced in this system. And the agent is trained and test with a designed reward function from safety and efficiency in simulation. The experimental results show that the proposed method increases the safety rate by 54%, and the average explore distance by 30%, which is safer and more intelligent for the decision-making process of automatic driving.

AB The high controllability and connectivity of connected automated vehicles (CAVs) have created opportunities to enhance the road network's performance. Considering the case that all vehicles in the road network are CAVs, we build an intersection model in which all CAVs follow a given route through the intersection. We obtain the basic evolution rules of vehicles based on the cellular automata model and design conflict judgment and speed adjustment rules to ensure the passage of CAVs within intersections without conflicts. Further, with the goal of minimizing traffic delays in the road network, we design a coordinated control strategy for multiple intersections by considering the density of downstream vehicles. Finally, we conduct simulation experiments in different traffic scenarios. The results show that as the vehicle arrival rates rise, CAVs' average delays rise and their average speeds decrease. The growth rate of traffic flow through the intersection slows down when a certain percentage is reached. Meanwhile, the coordinated control strategy for multiple intersections can obtain a minor average delay of vehicles on the road network. (c) 2023 Published by Elsevier B.V.

AB Pedestrians rely on vehicle dynamics, engine sound, and driver cues. The lack of engine sound now constitutes an addressed pedestrian safety issue for (hybrid) electric vehicles ((H)EVs). Analogously, lacking driver cues may constitute a pedestrian safety issue for self-driving vehicles (SDVs). The purpose of this study was to systematically compare the relevance of substituting driver cues with an external human-machine interface among SDVs (no eHMI vs. eHMI) with the relevance of substituting engine sound with artificial sound among (H)EVs (no engine sound vs. engine sound). In a within-subject design, twenty-nine participants acting as pedestrians encountered a simulated SDV in a parking lot. The results revealed that both informational cues have equally large effects on subjective measures such as perceived safety. In semi-structured interviews, participants stated that it is equally crucial to equip SDVs with an eHMI as equipping (H)EVs with an artificial sound generator. We conclude that an eHMI for SDVs seems to be as relevant as an artificial sound for (H)EVs.

ID DRIVER BEHAVIOR; LANE
AB The mixed driving of human-driven vehicles (HVs) and autonomous vehicles (AVs) is an inevi-table stage of future traffic developments. As HV drivers have different trust levels toward AVs, interactions between these two vehicle types will lead to discrepant characteristics in HV driving behaviors, which will impact the traffic flow state of expressways. However, few studies have considered this. Based on questionnaire data, this paper analyzes the changing features of the trust level and its influence on driving behaviors. The quantitative model for the trust level is constructed using the fuzzy logic approach. On this basis, classical cellular automaton models are improved to reflect the features of human-machine mixed traffic flow. Finally, correlations be-tween the trust level and the influencing factors are analyzed, and the impact of the trust level on traffic flow operations is described in terms of both efficiency and safety. The questionnaire re-sults reveal that the influence of the trust level on driving behaviors is universal. The trust level varies with personal and contextual attributes. The simulation results show that traffic density and road congestion greatly influence the trust level. However, the trust level is not sensitive to changes in the penetration rate of AVs. Interactions between these two vehicle types are stronger when the penetration rate approaches 50%. The efficiency and safety of traffic flow operations under each condition decrease by different magnitudes from the influence of the trust level.

AB The detection and recognition of unstructured roads in forest environments are critical for smart forestry technology. Forest roads lack effective reference objects and manual signs and have high degrees of nonlinearity and uncertainty, which pose severe challenges to forest engineering vehicles. This research aims to improve the automation and intelligence of forestry engineering and proposes an unstructured road detection and recognition method based on a combination of image processing and 2D lidar detection. This method uses the "improved SEEDS + Support Vector Machine (SVM)" strategy to quickly classify and recognize the road area in the image. Combined with the remapping of 2D lidar point cloud data on the image, the actual navigation requirements of forest unmanned navigation vehicles were fully considered, and road model construction based on the vehicle coordinate system was achieved. The algorithm was transplanted to a self-built intelligent navigation platform to verify its feasibility and effectiveness. The experimental results show that under low-speed conditions, the system can meet the real-time requirements of processing data at an average of 10 frames/s. For the centerline of the road model, the matching error between the image and lidar is no more than 0.119 m. The algorithm can provide effective support for the identification of unstructured roads in forest areas. This technology has important application value for forestry engineering vehicles in autonomous inspection and spraying, nursery stock harvesting, skidding, and transportation.

TI Scenario Modeling of Autonomous Vehicles with Trip-Based Models
SO TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH RECORD
LA English
DT Article
AB While a range of methods have been employed to quantify certain anticipated impacts of connected and autonomous vehicles (CAVs), a comprehensive framework for integrating CAVs into trip-based models, like those used by many metropolitan areas today, is lacking. Without real-world CAV usage data, integrating CAVs into trip-based models today requires speculative modeling assumptions; however, incorporating fundamental parameters into existing travel modeling frameworks is timely for two reasons. First, understanding the range of possible futures from scenario planning or exploratory modeling analysis can assist metropolitan areas anticipate and manage the potential risks and benefits of CAVs. Second, data on the travel behavior of early CAV adopters will become available during the lifespan of many models currently in use or development. This paper summarizes an enhanced trip-based modeling framework incorporating uncertainties related to CAVs initially developed in support of the Michigan Department of Transportation's statewide model. This framework is now being applied in statewide and metropolitan scale models in Michigan, Illinois, Virginia, Indiana, and South Carolina. An important contribution of this framework is its typology of and methods for representing zero-occupant vehicle (ZOV) trips. Additionally, this paper details an exploratory analysis of CAV scenarios in Vermont using a trip-based model incorporating several elements of the framework. In this application, reasonable assumptions related to induced CAV demand, including ZOV trips, resulted in substantial increases in vehicle miles traveled, vehicle hours traveled, and delay despite capacity increases, demonstrating how relatively basic trip-based scenario modeling of CAVs can be a valuable tool for informing and encouraging public policy discussions.

DT Article
ID AUTONOMOUS VEHICLES; SIMULATION
AB A self-driving, fully automated, or "autonomous" vehicle (AV) revolution is imminent, with the potential to eliminate driver costs and driver error, while ushering in an era of shared mobility. Dynamic ride-sharing (DRS), which refers to sharing rides with strangers en route, is growing, with top transportation network companies providing such services. This work uses an agent-based simulation tool called MATSim to simulate travel patterns in Austin, Texas in the presence of personal AVs, and shared AVs (SAVs), with DRS and advanced road-pricing policies in place. Fleet size, pricing, and fare level impacts are analyzed in depth to provide insight into how SAVs may best be introduced to a city or region. Results indicate that the cost-effectiveness of traveling with strangers overcomes inconvenience and privacy issues at moderate-to-low fare levels, with high fares being more detrimental than the base case. A moderately sized Austin, Texas fleet (one SAV for every 25 people) serves nearly 30% of all trips made during the day. The average vehicle occupancy of this fleet was around 1.48 [after including the 12.7% of SAV vehicle-miles traveled (VMT) empty/without passengers], with a 4.5% increase in VMT. This same fleet performs better when road-pricing is enforced in the peak periods (4h a day), moderating VMT by 2%, increasing SAV demand and in turn fleet-manager revenue. SAVs are able to earn around $100 per SAV per day even after paying tolls, but only at low-fare levels.

   and Uncertain Maneuver Prediction
SO IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON INTELLIGENT VEHICLES
LA English
DT Article
DE Autonomous driving; POMDP; decision making; interaction; motion planning
   under uncertainty
AB Automated driving requires decision making in dynamic and uncertain environments. The uncertainty from the prediction originates from the noisy sensor data and from the fact that the intention of human drivers cannot be directly measured. This problem is formulated as a partially observable Markov decision process (POMDP) with the intended route of the other vehicles as hidden variables. The solution of the POMDP is a policy determining the optimal acceleration of the ego vehicle along a preplanned path. Therefore, the policy is optimized for the most likely future scenarios resulting from an interactive, probabilistic motion model for the other vehicles. Considering possible future measurements of the surrounding cars allows the autonomous car to incorporate the estimated change in future prediction accuracy in the optimal policy. A compact representation results in a low-dimensional state-space. Thus, the problem can be solved online for varying road layouts and number of vehicles. This is done with a point-based solver in an anytime fashion on a continuous state-space. Our evaluation is threefold: At first, the convergence of the algorithm is evaluated and it is shown how the convergence can be improved with an additional search heuristic. Second, we show various planning scenarios to demonstrate how the introduction of different considered uncertainties results in more conservative planning. At the end, we show online simulations for the crossing of complex (unsignalized) intersections. We can demonstrate that our approach performs nearly as good as with full prior information about the intentions of the other vehicles and clearly outperforms reactive approaches.

The observed quantities are: the satellite-sun direction vector measured by a sun sensor, the satellite-earth and satellite-moon direction vectors measured by an ultraviolet sensor, and the geocentric distance measured by a radar altimeter. At the same time the satellite attitude to the earth is also determined. Results of our simulation of the autonomous orbit determination show that the precision of the orbit determinations is better than 200 m. The effects of the sampling period, orbital inclination, orbital eccentricity and orbital altitude on the precision of orbit determination are analyzed and compared, and certain principles helpful for improving the precision of orbit determination are suggested.

Improvements in UAV construction and components, along with developments in embedded computing hardware, communication mechanisms and sensors which may be mounted on-board a UAV, are nearing the point where commercial deployment of fleets of autonomous UAVs will be technically possible. To fulfil this potential, UAVs will need to operate safely and reliably in complex and potentially dynamically changing environments with path-planning, obstacle sensing and collision avoidance paramount. This survey presents an original environment complexity classification and critically analyses the current state of the art in relation to UAV path-planning approaches. Moreover, it highlights the existing challenges in environment complexity modelling and representation, as well as path-planning approaches, and outlines open research questions together with future directions.

AB In this paper, a robust path-following control strategy is proposed to deal with the path-following problem of the underactuated autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) with multiple uncertainties and input saturation, and the effectiveness of the proposed control strategy is verified by semi-physical simulation experiments. Firstly, the control laws are constructed based on the traditional backstepping method; the multiple uncertainties are treated as lumped uncertainties, which can be estimated and eliminated by the employed extended state observers (ESOs). In addition, the influence of input saturation can be compensated by the designed auxiliary dynamic compensators. Secondly, to simplify controller design and address the "complexity explosion", two command filters are used to obtain the estimated value of the unknown sideslip angular velocity and the desired yaw angular acceleration, respectively. Finally, the superiority and robustness of the proposed control strategy are verified through computer simulation. A semi-physical simulation experiment platform is built based on the NI Compact cRIO-9068 and PLC S7-1200 to further demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed control strategy.

AB Path planning is an essential function in an intelligent vehicle, especially when driving in scenarios cluttered by large-scale static obstacles. Traditional path planners often struggle to find a balance among speed, accuracy, and optimality in their solutions. In this article, we introduce an Adaptive Pure Pursuit (APP) planner, which is designed to be fast and near-optimal for autonomous driving in cluttered environments. The APP planner generates feasible paths through a simulated closed-loop tracking control process of a virtual vehicle. If a derived path encounters obstacles, an adaptive refinement step is taken to locally reduce these collisions. Unlike search-based planners that suffer from the "curse of dimensionality" and optimization-based methods that often run slowly, the APP planner operates extremely fast. The high speed stems from the fact that both the virtual controller simulation and the refinement step involve computations with zero degrees of freedom. The proposed APP planner outperforms the prevalent optimization-based and search-based path planners, as shown by comparative simulations.

DT Article
ID MODELING TRAVEL MODE; DECISION TREES
AB This article applies machine learning (ML) to develop a choice model on three choice alternatives related to autonomous vehicles (AV): regular vehicle (REG), private AV (PAV), and shared AV (SAV). The learned model is used to examine users' preferences and behaviors on AV uptake by car commuters. Specifically, this study applies gradient boosting machine (GBM) to stated preference (SP) survey data (i.e., panel data). GBM notably possesses more interpretable features than other ML methods as well as high predictive performance for panel data. The prediction performance of GBM is evaluated by conducting a 5-fold cross-validation and shows around 80% accuracy. To interpret users' behaviors, variable importance (VI) and partial dependence (PD) were measured. The results of VI indicate that trip cost, purchase cost, and subscription cost are the most influential variables in selecting an alternative. Moreover, the attitudinal variables Pro-AV Sentiment and Environmental Concern are also shown to be significant. The article also examines the sensitivity of choice by using the PD of the log-odds on selected important factors. The results inform both the modeling of transportation technology uptake and the configuration and interpretation of GBM that can be applied for policy analysis.

ID DESIGN
AB This paper presents the design and performance evaluation of a set of globally asymptotically stable time-varying kinematic filters with application to the estimation of linear motion quantities of mobile platforms (position, linear velocity, and acceleration) in three dimensions. The proposed techniques are based on the Kalman and H-infinity optimal filters for linear time-varying systems and the explicit optimal filtering solutions are obtained through the use of an appropriate coordinate transformation, whereas the design employs frequency weights to achieve adequate disturbance rejection and attenuation of the measurement noise on the state estimates. Two examples of application in the field of ocean robotics are presented that demonstrate the potential and usefulness of the proposed design methodology. In the first the proposed filtering solutions allow for the design of a complementary navigation filter for the estimation of unknown constant ocean currents, while the second addresses the problem of estimation of the velocity of an underwater vehicle, as well as the acceleration of gravity. Simulation results are included that illustrate the filtering achievable performance in the presence of both extreme environmental disturbances and realistic measurement noise. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

AB Micro air vehicles have become very popular in recent years. Autonomous navigation of such systems plays an important role in many industrial applications as well as in search-and-rescue scenarios. We present a quadrotor that performs autonomous navigation in complex indoor and outdoor environments. An operator selects target positions in the onboard map and the system autonomously plans an obstacle-free path and flies to these locations. An onboard stereo camera and inertial measurement unit are the only sensors. The system is independent of external navigation aids such as GPS. No assumptions are made about the structure of the unknown environment. All navigation tasks are implemented onboard the system. A wireless connection is only used for sending images and a three-dimensional (3D) map to the operator and to receive target locations. We discuss the hardware and software setup of the system in detail. Highlights of the implementation are the field-programmable-gate-array-based dense stereo matching of 0.5 Mpixel images at a rate of 14.6 Hz using semiglobal matching, locally drift-free visual odometry with key frames, and sensor data fusion with compensation of measurement delays of 220 ms. We show the robustness of the approach in simulations and experiments with ground truth. We present the results of a complex, autonomous indoor/outdoor flight and the exploration of a coal mine with obstacle avoidance and 3D mapping. (C) 2014 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

AB With the development and progress of information technology, especially V2X technology, the research focus of intelligent vehicles gradually shifted from single-vehicle control to multi-vehicle control, and the cooperative control system of intelligent connected vehicles became an important topic of development. In order to track the research progress of intelligent connected vehicle cooperative driving systems in recent years, this paper discusses the current research of intelligent connected vehicle cooperative driving systems with vehicles, infrastructure, and test sites, and analyzes the current development status, development trend, and development limitations of each object. Based on the analysis results of relevant references of the cooperative control algorithm, this paper expounds on vehicle collaborative queue control, vehicle collaborative decision making, and vehicle collaborative positioning. In the case of taking the infrastructure as the object, this paper expounds the communication security, communication delay, and communication optimization algorithm of the vehicle terminal and the road terminal of intelligent connected vehicles. In the case of taking the test site as the object, this paper expounds the development process and research status of the real vehicle road test platform, virtual test platform, test method, and evaluation mechanism, and analyzes the problems existing in the intelligent connected vehicle test environment. Finally, the future development trend and limitations of intelligent networked vehicle collaborative control system are discussed. This paper summarizes the intelligent connected car collaborative control system, and puts forward the next problems to be solved and the direction of further exploration. The research results can provide a reference for the cooperative driving of intelligent vehicles.

AB This paper focuses on vehicle detection based on motion features in driving videos. Long-term motion information can assist in driving scenarios since driving is a complicated and dynamic process. The proposed method is a deep learning based model which processes motion frame image. This image merges both spatial (frame) and temporal (motion) information. Hence, the model jointly detects vehicles and their motion from a single image. The trained model on Toyota Motor Europe Motorway Dataset reaches 83% mean average precision (mAP). Our experiments demonstrate that the proposed method has a higher mAP than a tracking-based model. The proposed method runs real-time in driving videos which enables the model to be used in time-critical applications such as autonomous driving and advanced driving assistance systems.

AB Introduction: This research systematically reviewed relevant studies on users' acceptance of conditional (Level 3) to full (Level 5) automated vehicles when such vehicles are to be used privately (herein referred to as 'private automated vehicles or private AVs). Method: The search followed the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis (PRISMA) guidelines, and was undertaken in three databases: APA PsycINFO, Transport Research International Documentation, and Web of Science. Articles were required to focus on individuals' acceptance of private SAE Level 3-5 AVs. Acceptance was defined as individuals' attitudes towards or intentions and/or willingness to use AVs in the future. A total of 2,354 articles were identified in the database search. Thirty-five articles were included in the review, six of which included multiple studies and/or comparison groups. Results: Most studies (n = 31) applied self-reported measures to assess user acceptance together with a range of psychosocial factors predicting such acceptance. The meta-analytic correlations revealed that perceived behavioral control, perceived benefits/usefulness, perceived ease of use, and subjective/social norms had significant positive pooled relationships with attitudes and intentions. Trust and sensation seeking also had significant positive pooled correlations with intentions, while knowledge of AVs had a significant and negative pooled correlation with intentions. Age did not show any significant pooled relationship with attitudes, intentions, or willingness. Conclusions: The findings obtained from the systematic review and meta-analysis provide support for psychosocial models to aid understanding of users' acceptance of private AVs. Practical applications: Examining acceptance of AVs after participants have experienced these vehicles on closed tracks or open roads would advance contemporary knowledge of users' intentions to use these vehicles in the future. Further, experiencing these vehicles firsthand may also help with addressing any perceived barriers reducing acceptance of future use of private AVs.

AB Emerging self-driving vehicles are now capable of sensing the environment and performing autonomous operations, paving the way to a more efficient, safer, and greener transportation system. On the other hand, emerging technologies such as vehicle-to-everything communications, 5G, and edge computing can expand even more the potential of automated driving vehicles, especially when combined with machine learning techniques. In this article, we explore how these emerging technologies can be used to enhance automated driving systems from different perspectives, such as driving safety and transportation efficiency. We conduct a case study using real-world data to show how these technologies can be used together to provide a more reliable path planning service considering predicted future urban dynamics.

AB Autonomous Surface Vessels (ASVs) are reliable and robust vehicles. They perform autonomous missions in lakes, rivers and even open waters. Those are dangerous environments that requires precise and secure navigation. Under these conditions, the knowledge of a robust and accurate mathematical model is a fundamental aspect for adjusting the control system for reaching safety and performance. Moreover, traditional mathematical models disregard assimetries and coupling between the degrees of freedom. While those models work fine for bigger vessels, to ignore these characteristics in small ASVs compromises the model's quality. In this context, this work presents a new methodology for modeling and identifying the dynamics of ASVs along with the uncertainties arising from disturbances and non-modeled dynamics. As for the uncertainties and disturbances, this work considers the coupling parameters into the mathematical modeling, which synthesizes the divergences between the model and the real application, allowing to incorporate asymmetries and model deficiencies. Regarding the parameter identification, the proposal is based on (i) the design of optimal input excitation signals from a double layer optimization methodology and (ii) a parametric estimation concept in two steps, dividing the original set of parameters into two partially coupled sub-problems. Finally, this work also presents a full discussion and analysis about the importance to manage the trade-off between precision and complexity of mathematical models, its respective solution spaces and the impact over the optimization algorithms. To validate the approach, a real 3 Degree of Freedom ASV with aerial holonomic propulsion system is used. The results show that it is possible to successfully capture the complex set of parameters and identify physical characteristics not considered by the model.

AB This study aimed to identify the key factors associated with Australian parents' willingness to use a rideshare vehicle to transport their unaccompanied child(ren). Six hundred and thirty-one participants completed an online survey (M = 39.2 years, SD = 10.5, Range = 18.0-70.0 years; Female: 63.4%). Most participants (62.1%) reported that they would 'never' use a ride share vehicle to transport their unaccompanied child(ren). The results of a logistic regression model showed that participants': previous use of a rideshare vehicle with their child, annual mileage, propensity for technology adoption, aberrant driving behaviours, as well their requirements for vehicle features were significantly associated with their willingness to use a rideshare vehicle to transport their unaccompanied child, chi 2(7) =159.59, p < 0.001. Overall, the findings suggest that Australian parents are mostly 'unwilling' to use a rideshare vehicle to transport their unaccompanied children. Understanding the views of parents towards emerging transportation modes for their children is crucial for urban planning, traffic engineering, economic and social mobility and ultimately, on supporting safe modes of transportation.

AB Automated vehicles are becoming popular across the communities of e-transportation across the globe. Hybrid electric vehicles and autonomous vehicles have been subjected to critical research for decades. The research outcomes pertinent to this topic in the literature have been motivated by the industry and researchers to emphasize automated vehicles. Part 1 of this survey addressed the critical aspects that concern the bidirectional converter topologies and condition monitoring activities. In the present part, 24- and 77-GHz low-profile printed antennas are studied for automotive radar applications. These antennas are mounted on automated vehicles to avoid collision and are used for radio tracking applications. The present paper states the types of antenna structures, feed mechanisms, dielectric material requirements, design techniques, performance parameters, and challenges at 24- and 77-GHz resonating frequency applications. The recent developments in feed methodologies, beam scanning concepts, and the effect of sidelobe levels are addressed. Furthermore, the reasons behind the transition from 24 to 77 GHz are reported in detail. The recent advances in the application of various sensor schemes in an automated vehicle have also been discussed.

AB The interface between land and sea is a key environment for biogeochemical carbon cycling, yet these dynamic environments are traditionally under sampled. Logistical limitations have historically precluded a comprehensive understanding of coastal zone processes, including ocean acidification. Using sensors on autonomous platforms is a promising approach to enhance data collection in these environments. Here, we evaluate the use of an autonomous surface vehicle (ASV), the C-Worker 4 (CW4), equipped with pH and pCO(2) sensors and with the capacity to mount additional sensors for up to 10 other parameters, for the collection of high-resolution data in shallow coastal environments. We deployed the CW4 on two occasions in Belizean coastal waters for 2.5 and 4 days, demonstrating its capability for high-resolution spatial mapping of surface coastal biogeochemistry. This enabled the characterisation of small-scale variability and the identification of sources of low pH/high pCO(2) waters as well as identifying potential controls on coastal pH. We demonstrated the capabilities of the CW4 in both pre-planned "autonomous" mission mode and remote "manually" operated mode. After documenting platform behaviour, we provide recommendations for further usage, such as the ideal mode of operation for better quality pH data, e.g., using constant speed. The CW4 has a high power supply capacity, which permits the deployment of multiple sensors sampling concurrently, a shallow draught, and is highly controllable and manoeuvrable. This makes it a highly suitable tool for observing and characterising the carbonate system alongside identifying potential drivers and controls in shallow coastal regions.

AB For autonomous vehicles (AVs), an intelligent awareness system is a fundamental task that provides crucial information on the driving environment. The main techniques for self-driving systems include solving tasks like self-localization, parsing the driving road, and understanding objects, enabling the system to reason and act. However, compared to other AVs, like cars, such robust awareness systems are not yet developed for inland autonomous vessels. Therefore, this paper proposes a system to accurately delimit safe navigation areas by simultaneously locating and mapping the environment. First, we construct the first open-source dataset; the InlandAutoDetect dataset comprises 3,377 images comprehensively labeled for object detection in a fluvial domain with almost 30,000 objects annotated. Second, we analyze and compare the results of nine deep learning perception models adapted to the inland environment in accuracy and run-time speed. The best one, namely Retinanet, is selected, and its different variants are tested by modifying the feature extractor block. Then, we propose the most suitable configuration for inland navigation. Finally, the selected model results are integrated into the complete system to delimit the safe sailing area. The achieved accuracy rate is above 88%, and the run-time speed rate is 0.8 seconds per image. Hence, the performance evaluations show the proposed system's robustness and effectiveness to give accurate results and fulfill real-time operation requirements.

AB Micro aerial vehicles (MAVs), especially quadrotors, have been widely used in field applications, such as disaster response, field surveillance, and search-and-rescue. For accomplishing such missions in challenging environments, the capability of navigating with full autonomy while avoiding unexpected obstacles is the most crucial requirement. In this paper, we present a framework for online generating safe and dynamically feasible trajectories directly on the point cloud, which is the lowest-level representation of range measurements and is applicable to different sensor types. We develop a quadrotor platform equipped with a three-dimensional (3D) light detection and ranging (LiDAR) and an inertial measurement unit (IMU) for simultaneously estimating states of the vehicle and building point cloud maps of the environment. Based on the incrementally registered point clouds, we online generate and refine a flight corridor, which represents the free space that the trajectory of the quadrotor should lie in. We represent the trajectory as piecewise Bezier curves by using the Bernstein polynomial basis and formulate the trajectory generation problem as a convex program. By using Bezier curves, we can constrain the position and kinodynamics of the trajectory entirely within the flight corridor and given physical limits. The proposed approach is implemented to run onboard in real-time and is integrated into an autonomous quadrotor platform. We demonstrate fully autonomous quadrotor flights in unknown, complex environments to validate the proposed method.

AB Presently, there is increasing interest in autonomous ships to reduce human errors and support intelligent navigation, where automatic collision avoidance and path planning is a key problem, especially in restricted waters. To solve this problem, a path-guided hybrid artificial potential field (PGHAPF) method is first proposed in this paper. It is essentially a reactive path-planning algorithm that provides fast feedback in a changeable environment, including dynamic target ships (TSs) and static obstacles, for steering an autonomous ship safely. The proposed strategy, which is a fusion of the potential field and gradient methods, consists of potential-based path planning for arbitrary static obstacles, gradient-based decision-making for dynamic TSs, and their combination with consideration of the prior path and waypoint selection optimization. A three-degree-of-freedom dynamic model of a Mariner class vessel and a low-level controller have been incorporated together in this method to ensure that the vessel's positions are updated at each time step in order to acquire a more applicable and reliable trajectory. Simulations show that the PGHAPF method has the potential to rapidly generate adaptive, collision-free and International Regulations for Preventing Collisions at Sea (COLREGS)-constrained trajectories in restricted waters by deterministic calculations. Furthermore, this method has the potential to perform path planning on an electronic chart platform and to overcome some drawbacks of traditional artificial potential field (APF) methods.

AB The oceans play a major part in global climate regulation. Developing an understanding of the processes involved, and ultimately a predictive capability, has led to increasing demand for data of all types. Although earth observation satellites can now provide remote means of sampling the ocean surface, many of the measurement techniques applied in the deep oceans are still heavily dependent on ships. An alternative which is being explored in many countries is the use of unmanned autonomous underwater vehicles to gather data. In this context the paper describes the progress made in the Autosub project of the Natural Environment Research Council.

AB In recent years, since the unique advantages in automotive structures, the vehicle active suspension systems have received widespread attentions. A good active suspension system can reduce the vibration and improve the overall performance of the vehicle. Therefore, the design of the controller for the active suspension system to perform autonomous adjustment plays a vital role in vehicle comfort and safety. For the active suspension of the seven-DOF sport utility vehicle (SUV) model, this paper takes the vehicle body acceleration, tire dynamic load and suspension dynamic travel as the indicators to evaluate the performance, and the proportional-integral-derivative (PID) controller is designed to improve the performance of the vehicle active suspension system. Based on the software of MATLAB/Simulink and Carsim, a closed-loop co-simulation model diagram is established, which includes a PID controller module. Meanwhile, the random road input model and the whole vehicle model are constructed in Carsim. Finally, at the speeds of 70, 90, and 120 km/h, the active suspension system under the designed PID controller is simulated and compared with the passive suspension system. The simulation results show that the active suspension system based on PID controller can effectively improve the overall performance of the vehicle, and then the comfort and safety of the vehicle can be further enhanced.

AB Vision-based Automated Vehicle Recognition (VAVR) has attracted considerable attention recently. Particularly given the reliance on emerging deep learning methods, which have powerful feature extraction and pattern learning abilities, vehicle recognition has made significant progress. VAVR is an essential part of Intelligent Transportation Systems. The VAVR system can fast and accurately locate a target vehicle, which significantly helps improve regional security. A comprehensive VAVR system contains three components: Vehicle Detection (VD), Vehicle Make and Model Recognition (VMMR), and Vehicle Re-identification (VRe-ID). These components perform coarse-to-fine recognition tasks in three steps. In this article, we conduct a thorough review and comparison of the state-of-the-art deep learning-based models proposed for VAVR. We present a detailed introduction to different vehicle recognition datasets used for a comprehensive evaluation of the proposed models. We also critically discuss the major challenges and future research trends involved in each task. Finally, we summarize the characteristics of the methods for each task. Our comprehensive model analysis will help researchers that are interested in VD, VMMR, and VRe-ID and provide them with possible directions to solve current challenges and further improve the performance and robustness of models.

AB The mechanism of vehicle dynamics steering bifurcation has almost been confirmed. But the present steering bifurcation mechanism cannot explain the bifurcation phenomena caused by the driving torque. As a result, the vehicle coupled bifurcation analysis of the steering angle and driving torque has not been studied. Based on the five degrees of freedom (5DOF) vehicle system dynamics model with driving torque involved, the vehicle dynamics equilibriums under different driving torque and driving mode were searched by a hybrid method in this paper. The hybrid method combined the real-coded Genetic Algorithm with Quasi-Newton gradient method. According to the definition of static bifurcation of nonlinear systems, the equilibrium bifurcation of 5DOF vehicle system was confirmed. Then, the 5DOF vehicle system model was transformed into autonomous equation with the front wheel steering angle as intermediate variable. From the two aspects of constant steering angle amplitude and constant driving torque, the bifurcation diagrams of different driving mode were calculated. The vehicle coupled bifurcation characteristics of steering angle and driving torque were analyzed. The results show that the values of the driving torque will directly affect the bifurcation characteristics of vehicle dynamics system. The coupled feature of the front wheel steering angle and driving torque effect on vehicle bifurcation is obvious.

AB Accurate and reliable object detection is a fundamental component of perception system for autonomous driving. Specially, in some circumstances like autonomous driving in surface mine, there is a fact that the particularity of scene brings tremendous challenges for object detection with a series of problems caused by the multi-scale and camouflaged objects. In this paper, a multi-scale feature fusion and attention based multi-branches framework was proposed to improve the performance of object detection for above problems called MSFANet. In the proposed MSFANet, a multi-scale feature fusion module, which was used to capture the rich context features for multi-scale high level feature maps, and a multi-scale attention module, which was used to enhance the feature saliency of objects with different scales, were designed. What's more, to improve the performance of multi-scale object detection, we build 4 different prediction branches for large, medium small and smaller scale objects respectively. At last, we built our own dataset for automatic driving in surface mine called SurMine and test the model at our own datasets and KITTI benchmark. It achieved 82.7 mAP(%) and 92.57 mAP(%) in 32 36 ms on a TITAN RTX, compared to 80.2 mAP(%) and 87.83 mAP(%) in 28 similar to 34 ms by YOLOv7 on SurMine and KITTI benchmarks.

AB This paper predicts the future adoption of Connected Autonomous Truck (CAT) among freight transportation organizations by incorporating the distance decay function-based phenomenon of peer effects into an integrated choice and latent variable model (ICLV). We surveyed 400 freight transportation organizations operating within the United States to capture their preferences and perceptions towards adopting level-3 CATs. By analyzing the responses, we are able to generate a prediction for how quickly freight transportation organizations will choose to test and adopt CATs. Through ICLV, the authors captured the impact of organizations' optimistic attitudes towards their inclination to adopt CATs. The results showed that organizations with an optimistic attitude to-wards CATs, having members advocating CATs and nationwide coverage, are more likely to adopt CATs. In contrast, organizations with an average trip length of regular trucks of >500 miles are more likely to reject CATs. The peer effect results imply that the future adoption rate of level-3 CATs will be doubled (29%) or quadrupled (57%) from 13% based on the different peer effect coefficient values varying from 0.70 to 0.90. This study will provide key takeaways and policy inputs to planners, policymakers, and researchers to frame and implement plans to bolster the organizational adoption of innovations like autonomous technology.

AB Nowadays, underwater acoustic communication is an interesting topic of research. This is especially true in the case of Autonomous Underwater Vehicles (AUVs): due to the limitations of the underwater environment, where WiFi and radio communications are limited, it is very important to rely on efficient and reliable tools for acoustic data exchange. Indeed, an underwater network of acoustic nodes can enhance the navigation and localization capabilities of one or more vehicles. However, cooperation and networking is not feasible in underwater networks composed of vehicles with different software architecture and multi-vendor modems due to the lack of communication standards. In this paper, the authors investigate the use of an AUV as a mobile bridging node within a network of fixed heterogeneous acoustic modems. In particular, MARTA AUV, developed and built by the Department of Industrial Engineering of the University of Florence, is employed to enable data transmission between modems of different manufacturers. The networking and the handling of multiple and multi-vendor modems are instead performed through the SUNSET Software Defined Communication Stack (SDCS) framework, developed by University of Rome La Sapienza jointly with WSENSE Srl. Different bridging tests have been performed in field to evaluate the feasibility of such approach, showing that AUVs can efficiently accomplish the role of gateway between the nodes of the network communicating through the SUNSET SDCS framework.

AB Real-time and accurate 3-D object detection is one of the foundational technologies for environmental perception in autonomous vehicles. However, the existing second-stage anchor-based 3-D object detection algorithms have high accuracy, but they are challenging in terms of computation complexity and latency. Due to poor perception of spatial features, the accuracy of the existing single-stage anchor-free detection algorithms with low latency are difficult to be implemented into autonomous vehicles. Therefore, we focus on enhancing the spatial perception ability of the anchor-free detection network based on CenterPoints. In this paper, we propose a single-stage anchor-free 3-D object detector CenterPoint-Space-Enhancement (CenterPoint-SE) algorithm and construct an efficient 3-D backbone network to extract fine-grained spatial geometric features by introducing a spatial attention mechanism and residual structure. At the same time, a powerful spatial semantic feature fusion module, the enhancement of feature fusion (EF-Fusion), is designed. In addition, we add a lightweight IoU prediction branch to improve the algorithm's perception of various object sizes. Finally, we add a foreground point segmentation auxiliary training branch to enable the 3-D backbone to obtain object boundary features. We use the ONCE dataset to train and validate the proposed model, and the results showed that the proposed CenterPoint-SE achieves 70.33 mAP and an inference speed of 17.15 FPS, outperforming other methods.

AB Quantifying habitat selection in marine organisms is challenging because it is difficult to obtain species location information with multiple corresponding habitat measurements. In the ocean, habitat conditions vary on many spatiotemporal scales, which have important consequences for habitat selection. While macroscale biotic and abiotic features influence seasonal movements (spatial scales of 100-1000 km), selectivity of conditions on mesoscales (1-100 km) reflects an animal's response to the local environment. In this study, we examined habitat selectivity by pairing acoustic telemetry with environmental habitat parameters measured by an autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV), and demonstrate that migrating sand tiger sharks Carcharias taurus along the East Coast of the USA did not randomly use the coastal environment. Of the variables examined, we found evidence to suggest that sand tigers were selecting their habitat based on distance to shore, salinity, and colored dissolved organic matter (CDOM). Notably, temperature was not predictive of habitat use in our study. We posit that during their coastal migration, sand tigers select for specific mesoscale coastal habitats that may inform navigation or feeding behaviors. To our knowledge, this is the first empirical measure of mesoscale habitat selection by a coastal marine organism using an AUV. The applications of this method extend beyond the habitat selectivity of sand tigers, and will prove useful for future studies combining in situ observations of marine habitats and animal observations.

AB Formation control for a group of autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) is challenging due to the complex systems dynamics and time delay in the cooperative feedback loops. This paper introduces a decoupled design procedure, so that formation controllers designed for particle dynamics can be generalised to formation controllers for fully actuated AUVs with six-degree-of-freedom dynamic models for motions in three-dimensional space. The orientation control and the translation control are first decoupled following a standard inner-outer loop approach. Then, a geometric approach is followed to separate the translation dynamics into formation shape dynamics and formation centre dynamics. Coupling terms between the two portions of the dynamics are treated as perturbations and are tolerated by a robust formation-keeping controller. The controller is also robust to constant bounded time delays. This decoupling procedure simplified the entire design process comparing with other existing approaches with similar goals. Both rigorous theoretical analysis and simulation results are presented to justify the effectiveness of this method.

DE Autonomous vehicles (AVs); intention prediction; pedestrians
AB The capability to comprehend the intention of pedestrians on the road is one of the most crucial skills that the current autonomous vehicles (AVs) are striving for, to become fully autonomous. In recent years, multi-modal methods have gained traction employing trajectory, appearance, and context for predicting pedestrian crossing intention. However, most existing research works still lag rich feature representational ability in a multimodal scenario, restricting their performance. Moreover, less emphasis is put on pedestrian interactions with the surroundings for predicting short-term pedestrian intention in a challenging ego-centric vision. To address these challenges, an efficient visual-motion-interaction-guided (VMI) intention prediction framework has been proposed. This framework comprises visual encoder (VE), motion encoder (ME), and interaction encoder (IE) to capture rich multimodal features of the pedestrian and its interactions with the surroundings, followed by temporal attention and adaptive fusion (AF) module (AFM) to integrate these multimodal features efficiently. The proposed framework outperforms several SOTA on benchmark datasets: Pedestrian Intention Estimation (PIE)/Joint Attention in Autonomous Driving (JAAD) with accuracy, AUC, F1-score, precision, and recall as 0.92/0.89, 0.91/0.90, 0.87/0.81, 0.86/0.79, and 0.88/0.83, respectively. Furthermore, extensive experiments are carried out to investigate different fusion architectures and design parameters of all encoders. The proposed VMI framework predicts pedestrian crossing intention 2.5 s ahead of the crossing event. Code is available at: https://github.com/neha013/VMI.git.

AB The challenge in autonomous docking and hook locking of multiple unmanned surface navigation platforms is to design an appropriate autonomous docking controller and ensure that the electric control hook can iteratively dock with the passive vessel. The current docking control solution for unmanned surface platforms needs to design an automatic tracking-generated trajectory and visual guidance docking system, capable of detecting the connection status after the hook-lock action to ensure a successful connection. However, most of the docking control designs for unmanned surface platforms pay more attention to the first-time success rate but pay less attention to the failures caused by complex and intelligent docking devices or environmental interference during docking. This article proposes a control strategy for autonomous docking and hook locking of two unmanned surface platforms. It guides the active vessel to the side of the passive vessel under the task requirements and triggers the visual docking control algorithm to complete the mechanical connection of the two joints. This method employs an iterative detection mechanism to improve the automatic hook and lock capability of both the active and passive vessels. The indoor pool and outdoor lake experiments demonstrate that the proposed method can successfully perform automatic iterative docking and hook locking, even in the presence of wave disturbance, showcasing the effectiveness of the proposed method.

AB This paper presents theoretically justified controllers that use relative range and bearing measurements to steer a team of autonomous vehicles, operating without inertial position information, to circular trajectories around a constant-acceleration, constant-velocity, or stationary target. An extended Kalman filter is used to improve the noisy relative measurements and estimate the velocity of the moving target. These estimated values are used in the control laws to encircle constant-velocity moving targets. Lyapunov techniques are utilized to show that the vehicle will converge to the desired circular formations. Additionally, cooperating vehicles are shown to converge to a circular formation with equal temporal spacing using each vehicle's estimate of the target's velocity to define a common reference frame. Numerical simulations validate the efficacy of these control laws.

AB Many safety-critical applications of neural networks, such as robotic control, require safety guarantees. This article introduces a method for ensuring the safety of learned models for control using differentiable control barrier functions (dCBFs). dCBFs are end-to-end trainable and guarantee safety. They improve over classical control barrier functions (CBFs), which are usually overly conservative. Our dCBF solution relaxes the CBF definitions by: 1) using environmental dependencies; 2) embedding them into differentiable quadratic programs. These novel safety layers are called a BarrierNet. They can be used in conjunction with any neural network-based controller. They are trained by gradient descent. With BarrierNet, the safety constraints of a neural controller become adaptable to changing environments. We evaluate BarrierNet on the following several problems: 1) robot traffic merging; 2) robot navigation in 2-D and 3-D spaces; 3) end-to-end vision-based autonomous driving in a sim-to-real environment and in physical experiments; 4) demonstrate their effectiveness compared to state-of-the-art approaches.

AB Periodic inspection is essential for the maintenance and security of port facilities. This paper discusses safe path-following control of an autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) for port area inspection. An AUV usually has a non-holonomic constraint and cannot be stabilized by continuous linear feedback control. In this paper, we derive the error dynamics with respect to a straight line path and show that its linear form is controllable. We then propose a tuning method of linear feedback control gains, which considers the turn point, safety during navigation, and the physical limitations of the vehicle. A critical damped response to a given path is commonly regarded as an ideal one. However, in some cases underdamped and overdamped responses are better for safe navigation. The tuning method can select the suitable damping degree of the control response. Our method is first described for horizontal motion control and then is generalized to vertical motion and 3-D motion controls. Simulations were done to verify the effectiveness of the proposed tuning method and the results are discussed. (c) 2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

ID TIME-DELAY ESTIMATION
AB Autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) are typically used to "actively" probe the ocean, using sensors that are mounted on a vehicle that moves through the water column. A more challenging task is to use an AUV to position a bottom-mounted stationary platform, such as a passive sonar that requires a large aperture. This paper describes the development of a passive sonar, which was mounted as a payload to the Ocean Explorer II, AUV developed at the Florida Atlantic University. The payload was designed so that the AUV could land on the seafloor and deploy the sonar. The passive sonar developed for this system can be used to measure and localize broadband sources that generate ambient noise in the coastal region. The sonar uses a sparse volume array of only six elements and a 2-m maximum dimension. With this array, it is possible to generate three-dimensional images consisting of thousands of independent pixels for any look direction or chosen image plane. This paper describes the ambient noise sonar and the variable buoyancy system used in deploying the array, and then presents some typical results obtained using the sonar.

AB In order to ensure the driving safety, comfort, stability and high mobility of emergency rescue vehicle, and considering the actual characteristics of emergency rescue vehicles like large vehicle width, high center of gravity and large turning radius, a trajectory and velocity planning method for collision avoidance based on segmented three-dimensional quartic Bezier curve is proposed. The velocity information is regarded as the vertical coordinates of corresponding trajectory coordinates, and the three-dimensional Bezier curve is used for vehicle trajectory planning, so as to make the velocity information and vehicle trajectory coordinates correspond one by one in planning results. In addition, in order to realize the effective fit between the multiple optimization objectives and the actual needs in intelligent driving, the segmented Bezier curve is used to design the vehicle trajectory, and the vehicle trajectory is divided into collision-avoidance process and lane-alignment process, so as to realize the dynamic optimization of trajectory design objectives. The results show that the proposed trajectory and velocity planning method based on segmented three-dimensional quartic Bezier curve can effectively improve the mobility of trajectory planning results, improve lane-changing efficiency and reduce lane-changing time while ensuring the design objectives of vehicle safety, comfort and stability.

In this paper, a novel miniature unmanned airship with a sliding ballast is presented to address the limited altitude maneuverability. Simulated and experimental tests demonstrate that the proposed architecture allows for large pitch variations and, when combined with forward facing thrusters, rapid changes in altitude thus facilitating autonomous landings or payload delivery. Operational advantages such as increased hull rigidity and concentrated hardware inherent to the vehicle design are also discussed.

AB Today, with the increasing transition to electric vehicles (EVs), the design of highly energy-efficient vehicle architectures has taken precedence for many car manufacturers. To this end, the energy consumption and recovery rates of different powertrain vehicle architectures need to be investigated comprehensively. In this study, six different powertrain architectures-four independent in-wheel motors with regenerative electronic stability control (RESC) and without an RESC, one-stage gear (1G) transmission, two-stage gear (2G) transmission, continuously variable transmission (CVT) and downsized electric motor with CVT-were mathematically modeled and analyzed under real road conditions using nonlinear models of an autonomous hydrogen fuel-cell electric vehicle (HFCEV). The aims of this paper were twofold: first, to compare the energy consumption performance of powertrain architectures by analyzing the effects of the regenerative electronic stability control (RESC) system, and secondly, to investigate the usability of a downsized electrical motor for an HFCEV. For this purpose, all the numerical simulations were conducted for the well-known FTP75 and NEDC urban drive cycles. The obtained results demonstrate that the minimum energy consumption can be achieved by a 2G-based powertrain using the same motor; however, when an RESC system is used, the energy recovery/consumption rate can be increased. Moreover, the results of the article show that it is possible to use a downsized electric motor due to the CVT, and this powertrain significantly reduces the energy consumption of the HFCEV as compared to all the other systems. The results of this paper present highly significant implications for automotive manufacturers for designing and developing a cleaner electrical vehicle energy consumption and recovery system.

AB Localization methods for autonomous construction vehicles include real-time kinematic positioning through a global navigation satellite system (GNSS) and a scan matching with a light detection and ranging (LiDAR) attached to mobility. However, these conventional methods have low estimation accuracy when the vehicle's surroundings have few features and the vehicle is in the no-GNSS area. For the estimation in such areas, this paper proposes a localization method that can estimate by matching a 3D model of a construction vehicle with a point cloud obtained from 3D LiDARs installed in a work area. To realize the high-accuracy and high-speed processing of the localization, we propose remodeling using the predictive motion model (RM) algorithm to modify the 3D model in the registration process. In the experimental results on rough terrain, we confirmed that our method can estimate a vehicle's position and yaw angle with accuracies of 0.121 m and 0.016 rad, respectively. In addition, compared with the case without the RM algorithm, the construction vehicle's position and yaw angle accuracies improved up to 5 and 12 times, respectively.

AB The main challenge for the adoption of autonomous driving is to ensure an adequate level of safety. Considering the almost infinite variability of possible scenarios that autonomous vehicles would have to face, the use of autonomous driving simulators is becoming of utmost importance. Simulation suites allow the used of automated validation techniques in a wide variety of scenarios, and enable the development of closed-loop validation methods, such as machine learning and reinforcement learning approaches. However, simulation tools suffer from a standing flaw in that there is a noticeable gap between the simulation conditions and real-world scenarios. Although the use of simulators powers most of the research around autonomous driving, and is generally used within all domains it is divided into, there is an inherent source of error given the stochastic nature of activities performed in real world, which are unreplicable in computer environments. This paper proposes a new approach to assess the real-to-sim gap for path tracking systems. The aim is to narrow down the sources of error between simulation results and real-world conditions, and to evaluate the performance of the simulation suite in the design process by employing the information extracted from gap analysis, which adds a new dimension of development against other approaches for autonomous driving. A real-time model predictive controller (MPC) based on adaptive potential fields was developed and validated using the CARLA simulator. Both the path planning and vehicle control systems where tested in real traffic conditions. The error between the simulator and the real data acquisition was evaluated using the Pearson correlation coefficient (PCC) and the max normalized cross-correlation (MNCC). The controller was further evaluated on a process of sim-to-real transfer, and was finally tested both in simulation and real traffic conditions. A comparison was performed against an optimal-control ILQR-based model predictive controller was carried out to further showcase the validity of this approach.

AB A conventional autonomous mobile robot is introduced. The main idea is the integration of many conventional and sophisticated sensor fusion techniques, introduced by several authors in recent years. We show the actual possibility of integrating all these techniques together, rather than analyzing implementation details. The topics of multisensor fusion, observation integration and sensor coordination are widely used throuhout the article. The final god is to demonstrate the validity of both mathematical and artificial intelligence techniques in guaranteeing vehicle survival in a dynamic environment, while the robot carries out a specific task. We review conventional techniques for the management of uncertainty while we describe an implementation of a mobile robot which combines on-line heterogeneous sensors in its navigation and localisation tasks.

AB Unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) swarm enabled edge computing is envisioned to be promising in the sixth generation wireless communication networks due to their wide application sensories and flexible deployment. However, most of the existing works focus on edge computing enabled by a single or a small scale UAVs, which are very different from UAV swarm-enabled edge computing. In order to facilitate the practical applications of UAV swarm-enabled edge computing, the state of the art research is presented in this article. The potential applications, architectures and implementation considerations are illustrated. Moreover, the promising enabling technologies for UAV swarm-enabled edge computing are discussed. Furthermore, we outline challenges and open issues in order to shed light on the future research directions.

SO JOURNAL OF FIELD ROBOTICS

DT Article
AB This paper describes the design and experimental validation of a vision-based vehicle-following system that uses only onboard sensors to enable a convoy of follower vehicles to autonomously track the trajectory of a manually driven lead vehicle. The tracking is done using the concept of a constant time delay, in which a follower tracks the delayed trajectory of its leader. This constant-time-delay approach allows for new techniques to be used to estimate the speed and heading of the leader. Experiments were conducted with full-sized military vehicles on a 1.3-km test track. Successful field trials with one follower for 10 laps and with two followers for 13.5 laps, totaling over 30 km, are presented. (C) 2010 Government of Canada.

ID STABILITY
AB We propose an adaptive nonlinear model predictive control (NMPC) for vehicle tracking control. The controller learns in real time a tyre force model to adapt to a varying road surface that is only indirectly observed from the effects of the tyre forces determining the vehicle dynamics. Learning the entire tyre model from data would require driving in the unstable region of the vehicle dynamics with a prediction model that has not yet converged. Instead, our approach combines NMPC with a noise-adaptive particle filter for vehicle state and tyre stiffness estimation and a pre-determined library of tyre models. The stiffness estimator determines the linear component of the tyre model during normal vehicle driving, and the control strategy exploits a relation between the tyre stiffness and the nonlinear part of the tyre force to select the appropriate full tyre model from the library, which is then used in the NMPC prediction model. We validate the approach in simulation using real vehicle parameters, demonstrate the real-time feasibility in automotive-grade processors using a rapid prototyping unit, and report preliminary results of experimental validation on a snow-covered test track.

AB We propose a technique for trailer angle detection (TAD) for use in advanced trailer backup assistance systems (TBAS) for semi-autonomous or fully autonomous backup maneuvers. TBAS incorporates a combined trailer-tow-vehicle kinematic model, which requires an estimate of the hitch-angle. The proposed radar-based TAD model processes reflections acquired from the mmWave radars situated at the rear side of the vehicle to detect the trailer and track its orientation to the tow-vehicle. This technique is based on the tracking of individual points in the merged radars point-cloud. Each tracked point is considered as a hitch-angle estimator. Using the current and past position information of a point, the model estimates the current hitch-angle. To offer an accurate and reliable estimation for the hitch-angle, the model fuses the estimated hitch-angle by all estimators and the yaw rate of the vehicle. The model employs a Kalman filter to track each radar point, which is robust to the noisy radar measurements. In the presence of strong and persistent reflections from the trailer, the model can track the trailer successfully and return the hitch-angle with a reliability measure equal to 90%. For a less common flat trailer with inconsistent radar reflective points, the measured reliability drops to 72%. The model is implemented in real-time with an expected processing time of 4 ms per epoch.

AB Most current research in the field of autonomous vehicle control assumes that all vehicles will follow the same patterns of automated driving behavior, resulting in systems with "conservative" or "average" driving styles. These systems may not be acceptable to drivers who prefer a more aggressive style of driving, however, while extremely cautious drivers may consider the standard outputs to be too aggressive. To address this problem, in this paper, we introduce Risk Sensitive Control (RSC), an inverse optimal control algorithm that estimates risk-sensitive driving features and incorporates them into a receding-horizon controller. RSC uses a meta-learning algorithm to update the parameters of the cost function, continuously improving the controller online as more and more driving data is gathered from the user and subjective risk feedback. An estimator takes into account individual differences in subjective risk analysis, in terms of driving features and surrounding vehicle locations, by adjusting the cost function and its constraints. We test this approach using five lane change scenarios, some safe and some risky, with thirty real drivers in a CARLA simulation environment. Our quantitative and qualitative evaluations demonstrate that the proposed framework is able to generate a user's preferred driving maneuvers during lane changes, i.e., control commands the user associates with lower subjective risk, outperforming conventional, model-based predictive control methods in terms of replicating the user's own driving behavior.

AB In this study, a Human-Lead-Platoon CACC ((HLP-CACC) controller is proposed for connected and automated vehicles to "include" human drivers in platooning process. The goal is to form a platoon between automated vehicles and human drivers so that turbulence caused by human drivers could be smoothed out by automated vehicles. Unlike the conventional CACC where only longitudinal control is automated, the proposed HLP-CACC regulates both longitudinally and laterally. In other words, the followers in an HLP-CACC platoon are fully autonomous. The controller is formulated utilizing model predictive control (MPC) solved by Chang-Hu's method. The technology has the following advantages: 1) take advantage of human drivers' perception to enable conditional full autonomy; 2) accommodate actuator delay in system dynamics to improve actuator control accuracy; 3) automates both longitudinally and laterally; and 4) ensures string stability in partially connected and automated vehicles environment. Both simulation tests and field tests were conducted to verify the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm. Four scenarios, including straight cruising, lane changing, U-turn and circling were tested. Sensitivity analysis was conducted for speed, turning radius, communication delay and oscillation acceleration. The results confirm that the proposed CACC controller is ready for field implementation. The computation time of the proposed optimal control is approximately 4 similar to 8 milliseconds when running on an NVIDIA Drive PX 2 computer. Under the control of the proposed HLP-CACC, maximum longitudinal error and lateral error are both within 40 cm.

TI Market Penetration Model for Autonomous Vehicles on the Basis of Earlier
   Technology Adoption Experience
SO TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH RECORD
LA English
DT Article
AB This paper presents an effort to develop a market penetration model for autonomous vehicle (AV) technology adoption on the basis of similar technologies and previous trends in the United States. Generalized Bass diffusion models are developed on the basis of data from earlier technologies, including sales and price data on conventional automobiles and hybrid electric vehicles, and the use of Internet and cell phones. On the basis of the adoption patterns of earlier technologies, two values that represented the innovation factor (i.e., risk-taking capacity) and the imitation factor (i.e., culture and lifestyle preferences) were selected for AV market penetration. In addition, external variables (e.g., price of AVs compared with price of conventional vehicles) and economic wealth were incorporated into the model. The market size for AV adoption was determined on the basis of the use of the Internet, and a household was considered as the unit. Given the uncertainties in market size and the price of AVs, sensitivity analyses were conducted to understand the possible impacts of these factors on user adoption. In general, a larger market size led to a higher adoption rate, although the initial cost of AVs compared with that of conventional vehicles did not seem to influence the diffusion process much. This paper contributes to the literature through the addition of a quantitative analysis of AV market penetration on the basis of earlier technology adoption experience. The study results provided valuable insights in terms of possible market diffusion patterns and the impacts of different factors on user adoption.

AB We propose a new information-driven intersection control to enhance the quality of transportation by using communication between vehicles and roadside units. The state-of-the-art solutions for intersection control only have access to the sensor data that is collected by vehicles or roadside units. However, congestion at intersections can have different impact on different drivers, and yet such an impact cannot be measured by sensors. An effective intersection control can consider such driver-exclusive differences based on the information reported by the drivers, which can substantially enhance the quality of transportation. However, such information is driver-exclusive, i.e., not verifiable easily, and therefore prone to be misreported strategically. We propose strategy-proof intersection control addressing such issues via a payment-based incentive-compatible mechanism. Particularly, vehicles at close proximity of the intersection report their driver-exclusive utility functions that they want to maximize (not necessarily truthfully), while the roadside unit seeks to maximize the sum of those utilities, i.e., social welfare, by scheduling intersection usage and charging each vehicle an amount of time-tokens corresponding to their impact on other drivers. This approach, based on the Vickrey-Clarke-Groove mechanism, guarantees truthful utility reporting by the vehicles and, correspondingly, maximizes the social welfare. The proposed scheme is universal such that it can be implemented based on various utility functions or intersection control constraints. We also provide a practical implementation to analyze the performance via numerical simulations.

AB Simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) is crucial and challenging for autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) autonomous navigation in complex and uncertain ocean environments. However, inaccurate time-varying observation noise parameters may lead to filtering divergence and poor mapping accuracy. In addition, particles are easily trapped in local extrema during the resampling, which may lead to inaccurate state estimation. In this paper, we propose an innovative simulated annealing particle swarm optimization-adaptive unscented FastSLAM (SAPSO-AUFastSLAM) algorithm. To cope with the unknown observation noise, the maximum a posteriori probability estimation algorithm is introduced into SLAM to recursively correct the measurement noise. Firstly, the Sage-Husa (SH) based unscented particle filter (UPF) algorithm is proposed to estimate time-varying measurement noise adaptively in AUV path estimation for improving filtering accuracy. Secondly, the SH-based unscented Kalman filter (UKF) algorithm is proposed to enhance mapping accuracy in feature estimation. Thirdly, SAPSO-based resampling is proposed to optimize posterior particles. The random judgment mechanism is used to update feasible solutions iteratively, which makes particles disengage local extreme values and achieve optimal global effects. The effectiveness and accuracy of the proposed algorithm are evaluated through simulation and sea trial data. The average AUV navigation accuracy of the presented SAPSO-AUFastSLAM method is improved by 18.0% compared to FastSLAM, 6.5% compared to UFastSLAM, and 5.9% compared to PSO-UFastSLAM.

AB Traffic light detection is crucial for environment perception and decision-making in autonomous driving. State-of-the-art detectors are built upon deep Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and have exhibited promising performance. However, one looming concern with CNN based detectors is how to thoroughly evaluate the performance of accuracy and robustness before they can be deployed to autonomous vehicles. In this work, we propose a visual analytics system, VATLD, equipped with a disentangled representation learning and semantic adversarial learning, to assess, understand, and improve the accuracy and robustness of traffic light detectors in autonomous driving applications. The disentangled representation learning extracts data semantics to augment human cognition with human-friendly visual summarization, and the semantic adversarial learning efficiently exposes interpretable robustness risks and enables minimal human interaction for actionable insights. We also demonstrate the effectiveness of various performance improvement strategies derived from actionable insights with our visual analytics system, VATLD, and illustrate some practical implications for safety-critical applications in autonomous driving.

AB The primary premise of autonomous railway inspection using unmanned aerial vehicles is achieving autonomous flight along the railway. In our previous work, fitted centerline-based unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) navigation is proven to be an effective method to guide UAV autonomous flying. However, the empirical parameters utilized in the fitting procedure lacked a theoretical basis and the fitted curves were also not coherent nor smooth. To address these problems, this paper proposes a skeleton detection method, called the dynamic-weight parallel instance and skeleton network, to directly extract the centerlines that can be viewed as skeletons. This multi-task branch network for skeleton detection and instance segmentation can be trained end to end. Our method reformulates a fused loss function with dynamic weights to control the dominant branch. During training, the sum of the weights always remains constant and the branch with a higher weight changes from instance to skeleton gradually. Experiments show that our model yields 93.98% mean average precision (mAP) for instance segmentation, a 51.9% F-measure score (F-score) for skeleton detection, and 60.32% weighted mean metrics for the entire network based on our own railway skeleton and instance dataset which comprises 3235 labeled overhead-view images taken in various environments. Our method can achieve more accurate railway skeletons and is useful to guide the autonomous flight of a UAV in railway inspection.

AB Autonomous mobile robots (AMR) are currently being introduced in many intralogistics operations, like manufacturing, warehousing, cross-docks, terminals, and hospitals. Their advanced hardware and control software allow autonomous operations in dynamic environments. Compared to an automated guided vehicle (AGV) system in which a central unit takes control of scheduling, routing, and dispatching decisions for all AGVs, AMRs can communicate and negotiate independently with other resources like machines and systems and thus decentralize the decision-making process. Decentralized decision-making allows the system to react dynamically to changes in the system state and environment. These developments have influenced the traditional methods and decision-making processes for planning and control. This study identifies and classifies research related to the planning and control of AMRs in intralogistics. We provide an extended literature review that highlights how AMR technological advances affect planning and control decisions. We contribute to the literature by introducing an AMR planning and control framework to guide managers in the decision-making process, thereby supporting them to achieve optimal performance. Finally, we propose an agenda for future research within this field.

AB The stable and seamless connection of the mobile communication system is expected to closely link an unprecedented number of things, including smart cars such as autonomous vehicles, in the near future. These vehicles will operate based on the data transmitted over hundreds of sensors. However, an attacker could remotely control a car by intercepting and tampering with these data, and even threaten the life of the driver. In this paper, we propose a code-based authentication scheme that provides both secure booting and lightweight data integrity checking to prevent unauthorized remote control. First, we split some of the core code involved in booting the car, and divide it into several secret pieces known as a share polynomial. One of these is distributed to the driver and is then used to reconstruct the booting code, allowing only the driver with this share polynomial to recover the code and start the car. The remaining share polynomials are distributed to the vehicle control unit and used to generate a lightweight pairwise key. Since the proposed scheme requires only multiplication to generate the pairwise key, it is computationally efficient compared to conventional schemes that require expensive exponential computation. Additional communication is not required to set up the pairwise key, because it needs nothing but the id value of the partner. Thus, our scheme is highly suitable for low-performance devices inside the car. We used the Robot OS system, a widely used autonomous vehicle platform, to implement the proposed scheme and evaluated its feasibility on various test cases.

ID COMMUNICATION; SVM
AB The development of Vehicular Ad-hoc Network (VANET) technology is helping Intelligent Transportation System (ITS) services to become a reality. Vehicles can use VANETs to communicate safety messages on the road (while driving) and can inform their location and share road condition information in real-time. However, intentional and unintentional (e.g., packet/frame collision) wireless signal jamming can occur, which will degrade the quality of communication over the channel, preventing the reception of safety messages, and thereby posing a safety hazard to the vehicle's passengers. In this paper, VANET jamming detection applying Support Vector Machine (SVM) machine learning technology is used to classify jamming and non-jamming situations. The analysis is based on two cases which include normal traffic and heavy traffic conditions, where the results show that the probability of packet dropping will increase when many vehicles are using the wireless channel simultaneously. When using SVM classification, the most appropriate feature set applied in determining a jamming situation shows an accuracy of 98% or higher. Furthermore, more advanced jamming attacks need to be considered for preparation of more reliable and safer autonomous ITS services. Such research can use vehicular communication transmission and reception data based on selected published datasets. In this paper, an additional adversarial defense algorithm using the Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise (DBSCAN) method is proposed, which assumes that evolutionary attacks of the jammer will attempt to confuse the trained classifier. The simulation results show that applying DBSCAN can improve the accuracy by elimination of outliers before conducting classification testing.

ID AUTONOMOUS UNDERWATER VEHICLE; SLIDING MODE CONTROL; TRACKING CONTROL
AB In this paper, a new adaptive neural network control approach is developed for a class of remotely operated vehicles whose velocity state and angular velocity state in the body-fixed frame are unmeasured. Unlike most previous control approaches, it doesn't need thrust model and the thruster control signal is considered as the input of control system directly. Using local recurrent neural network to approximate the unknown nonlinear functions, an adaptive observer is introduced for state estimation. Under the framework of the backstepping design, adaptive neural network control law is constructed based on the output of local recurrent neural network and state estimation. The stability analysis is given by Lyapunov theorem. The effectiveness of the proposed control scheme is illustrated by simulations.

AB The adaptive cruise control systems are capable of adapting the speed to the precedent car in highways as long as the car does not stop. However, in urban areas where the traffic flow can cause stop and go maneuvers continuously, this system is not very useful due to the necessity of re-start it once the car is stopped. In this paper, a speed control based on fuzzy logic for continuous stop and go manoeuvres is presented where the speed car is up to ten kilometers per hour. The system has been tested with two Citroen C3 vehicles, one of them full automated, in the Instituto de Automatica Industrial facilities with great results. Copyright (C) 2009 CEA.

AB The autonomous vehicle is meant to drive by itself, without any driver intervention (for the levels 4 and 5 of automated driving, according to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration(NHTSA)). This car includes a new function, called Autonomous Driving (AD) function, in charge of driving the vehicle when it is authorized. This function may be in different states (basically active or inactive), that shall be managed by a sub-function, named supervision. The main focus of this work is to ensure that the supervision of a function, performed by a safety critical embedded automotive control system (controlled systems are not considered), respects functional and safety requirements. Usually two processes are involved in the system design: the systems engineering process and the safety one. The first process defines the functional requirements on the function while the safety one specifies redundant sub-functions (realizing together the function) allowing to ensure a continuous service under failure. Since two different aspects of the system are specified, it is a major challenge to make all requirements consistent, from the outset of the design process. In this paper, a method is precisely proposed to address this issue. A progressive reinforcement of the treated requirements is achieved by means of formal state models. In fact, the proposed approach permits to build state models from requirements initially expressed in natural language. Potential ambiguities, incompletenesses or undertones in requirements are in this way gradually deleted. The enrichment of conventional formal verification of control properties with safety requirements constitutes the main originality of the deployed method and contributes to solve inconsistencies between functional and safety verification processes. In addition, the application of the method to the design of AD function supervision highlights its efficiency in an industrial context. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

With the rapid increase of the amount of radars used on modern vehicles, where most radars operate in the same frequency band, the risk of radar interference becomes a compelling issue. This article analyzes automotive radar interference and proposes several new approaches that combine industrial and academic expertise toward the goal of achieving interference-free autonomous driving (AD).

AB As a key technology of intelligent transportation system, the intelligent vehicle is the carrier of comprehensive integration of many technologies. Although vision-based autonomous driving has shown excellent prospects, there is still a problem of how to analyze the complicated traffic situation by the collected data. Recently, autonomous driving has been formulated as many tasks separately by using different models, such as object detection task and intention recognition task. In this study, a vision-based system was developed to detect and identity various objects and predict the intention of pedestrians in the traffic scene. The main contributions of this research are (1) an optimized model was presented to detect 10 kinds of objects based on the structure of YOLOv4; (2) a fine-tuned Part Affinity Fields approach was proposed to estimate the pose of pedestrians; (3) Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) technology is added to explain and assist the estimation results in the risk assessment phase; (4) an elaborate self-driving dataset that includes several different subsets for each corresponding task was introduced; and (5) an end-to-end system containing multiple models with high accuracy was developed. Experimental results proved that the total parameters of optimized YOLOv4 are reduced by 74% which satisfies the real-time capability. In addition, the detection precision of the optimized YOLOv4 achieved an improvement of 2.6%; compared to the state-of-the-art.

AB This paper leverages emerging highway vehicle platooning technology to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of fleeting trains at minimum headways under moving blocks. The research aims to better understand how closely following trains respond to different throttle and brake control algorithms, and, using insights gained from automobile and truck platooning technology, develop improved train control algorithms balancing fuel efficiency and train headway. To do so, a detailed multi-train performance simulator is developed to evaluate following train control algorithms and then adapt highway vehicle platooning control methods to the heavy haul freight rail domain. Five following train control algorithms under two different communication topologies are formulated to more intelligently consider information on the status of the train ahead when specifying throttle or brake settings for each following train. With string stability, following trains attenuate the actions of preceding trains and each successive train requires less aggressive acceleration and braking rates to maintain headways. The simulation results suggest that certain families of control laws are better than others at managing train separation and fuel consumption within train fleets. The results of this research will allow industry practitioners to develop improved locomotive driver advisory and semi-autonomous adaptive train cruise control systems for the operation of fleets of trains under moving blocks, and railroad operators to make more informed decisions regarding the potential fuel efficiency and capacity benefits of these systems.

AB This paper presents a robust virtual sensor to estimate the chassis planar motion states and the tire forces during agile maneuvers using a tire-model-less approach. Specifically, virtual sensing is achieved from standard sensor signals available on the CAN bus of modern vehicles using a modular filter architecture composed of stochastic Kalman filters. A high-fidelity virtual testing environment is constructed in IPG CarMaker using a driver-in-the-loop setup to verify the virtual sensor without compromising driver's safety. Moreover, road random profiles are incorporated into the virtual road to assess the state estimator robustness to high vertical excitation levels. The virtual sensor is simulated under drifting maneuvers performed by an experienced test driver and tested experimentally under Fishhook and Slalom maneuvers. Finally, the state estimator is integrated into a drift controller, and autonomous drift control using exclusively readily available measurements is verified for the first time. As the drift equilibrium depends strongly on the tire-road friction, an adaptive neurofuzzy inference system has been integrated into the virtual sensor structure to provide a continuous approximation of the road friction characteristics (axle lateral force versus slip curve) in rigid and loose surfaces. The findings suggest that it may be possible to develop advanced vehicle controllers without using a tire model. This can lead to a substantial acceleration of development time, particularly in off-road applications, and remove the need for online estimation of tire properties due to pressure, wear, and age.

AB The problem of automatic steering control for electric automotive vehicles is considered. Steering a car by hand means that the driver plans a path by preview and controls the lateral deviation of the vehicle from the planned path by the steering wheel. In an automatic car steering system, this path following is automated. The deviation is kept small by feedback control via the steering motors. The reference trajectory may be calculated from the data of a CCD camera and the compensation scheme will be derived by the data of a gyro or a GPS. The desired system behavior in the car steering motion is primarily to obtain good damping and an almost disturbance decoupling property. A certain stability margin should be satisfied and the actuator activity should not be too high. This desired system behavior is to be made precise by formulating performance criteria. In the design process of controller, a design parameter is chosen for the optimization process, which results in good damping, our primary objective is to approximately keep this damping. At the same time the lateral acceleration should be better attenuated in the representative response due to a yaw rate initial value disturbance. In order to study automatic car steering, the steering model must be extended. For the extended steering model with output equation whose elements can be measured by equipped sensors, the H(infinity) optimal controller is introduced so that the vehicle can tracks the reference path.

TI How Do Vehicles Make Decisions during Implementation Period of

AB To investigate and compare the lane changing behavior of passenger cars and heavy vehicles during the implementation period (defined as the interval from the start time to the end time of a lane change maneuver), this study applies the gradient boosting decision tree (GBDT) method to model the lane changing behavior of heavy vehicles and passenger cars, respectively. Results show that the lane change models vary with the vehicle types and lane change directions. Different factors are considered by the drivers of passenger cars and heavy vehicles when implementing lane changes to different directions. Partial dependence plots of GBDT models reveal that the influence of independent variables on lane changing behavior is nonlinear and complicated, which means that the same variable leads to various effects on the lane change decision across different vehicle types and lane change directions. In contrast with other state-of-the-art methods, the proposed method can obtain more accurate results. The findings indicate that it is necessary to build specific lane change models based on vehicle types and lane change directions for microscopic traffic simulators and autonomous vehicles.

AB Conventional intersection managements, such as signalized intersections, may not necessarily be the optimal strategies when it comes to connected and automated vehicles (CAVs) environment. Autonomous intersection management (AIM) is tailored for CAVs aiming at replacing the conventional traffic control strategies. In this work, using the communication and computation technologies of CAVs, the sequential movements of vehicles through intersections are modelled as multi-agent Markov decision processes (MAMDPs) in which vehicle agents cooperate to minimize intersection delay with collision-free constraints. To handle the huge dimension scale incurred by the nature of multi-agent decision making problems, the state space of CAVs are decomposed into independent part and coordinated part by exploiting the structural properties of the AIM problem, and a decentralized coordination multi-agent learning approach (DCL-AIM) is proposed to solve the problem efficiently by exploiting both global and localized agent coordination needs in MM. The main feature of the proposed approach is to explicitly identify and dynamically adapt agent coordination needs during the learning process so that the curse of dimensionality and environment nonstationarity problems in multi-agent learning can be alleviated.
   The effectiveness of the proposed method is demonstrated under a variety of traffic conditions. The comparison analysis is performed between DCL-AIM and the First-Come-First-Serve based AIM (FCFS-AIM), with Longest-Queue-First (LQF-AIM) policy and the signal control based on the Webster's method (Signal) as benchmarks. Experimental results show that the sequential decisions from DCL-AIM outperform the other control policies.

AB As autonomous vehicle (AV) technology advances, it is important to understand its potential demand and user characteristics. Literature from stated preference surveys find that attitudes and current travel behavior are as or more important than demographics in determining intention to purchase or use AVs. Yet to date no study has looked at how attitudes and use of existing modes both simultaneously affect AV adoption. In this study, we conduct a stated preference survey in Singapore to investigate how the subjective evaluation of existing travel modes (attitudes) and inertia based on previous use of existing modes affect the adoption of an autonomous mobility-ondemand service (AMOD). Using a sample size of 2,003 individuals and 11,613 choice observations, we estimate a mixed logit discrete choice model incorporating latent variables capturing subjective evaluations of existing travel modes (determined through confirmatory factor analysis), a two-part formulation of modal inertia, and other trip-specific and socio-demographic variables. Results show that subjective evaluation and use of existing modes both affect the adoption of AMOD. Specifically, people with a positive evaluation of ridehailing and those who are current ridehailing users are more likely to choose AMOD. Additionally, those who are current car drivers are more likely to choose AMOD, while users of public transit were less likely to choose AMOD. Given that ridehailing is the closest existing mode to our hypothetical AMOD service, our results might suggest that how AVs are implemented and their similarity to existing modes may be critical to the formation of attitudes and direction of inertia impacting adoption. Our research provides insights on the potential relationship between AVs and existing modes that could valuable in AV network design and service planning.

AB Environment perception remains one of the key tasks in autonomous driving for which solutions have yet to reach maturity. Multi-modal approaches benefit from the complementary physical properties specific to each sensor technology used, boosting overall performance. The added complexity brought on by data fusion processes is not trivial to solve, with design decisions heavily influencing the balance between quality and latency of the results. In this paper we present our novel real-time, 360 degrees enhanced perception component based on low-level fusion between geometry provided by the LiDAR-based 3D point clouds and semantic scene information obtained from multiple RGB cameras, of multiple types. This multi-modal, multi-sensor scheme enables better range coverage, improved detection and classification quality with increased robustness. Semantic, instance and panoptic segmentations of 2D data are computed using efficient deep-learning-based algorithms, while 3D point clouds are segmented using a fast, traditional voxel-based solution. Finally, the fusion obtained through point-to-image projection yields a semantically enhanced 3D point cloud that allows enhanced perception through 3D detection refinement and 3D object classification. The planning and control systems of the vehicle receives the individual sensors' perception together with the enhanced one, as well as the semantically enhanced 3D points. The developed perception solutions are successfully integrated onto an autonomous vehicle software stack, as part of the UP-Drive project.

ID FUTURE; SLAM
AB Self driving vehicles promise to bring one of the greatest technological and social revolutions of the next decade for their potential to drastically change human mobility and goods transportation, in particular regarding efficiency and safety. Autonomous racing provides very similar technological issues while allowing for more extreme conditions in a safe human environment. While the software stack driving the racing car consists of several modules, in this paper we focus on the localization problem, which provides as output the estimated pose of the vehicle needed by the planning and control modules. When driving near the friction limits, localization accuracy is critical as small errors can induce large errors in control due to the nonlinearities of the vehicle's dynamic model. In this paper, we present a localization architecture for a racing car that does not rely on Global Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSS). It consists of two multi-rate Extended Kalman Filters and an extension of a state-of-the-art laser-based Monte Carlo localization approach that exploits some a priori knowledge of the environment and context. We first compare the proposed method with a solution based on a widely employed state-of-the-art implementation, outlining its strengths and limitations within our experimental scenario. The architecture is then tested both in simulation and experimentally on a full-scale autonomous electric racing car during an event of Roborace Season Alpha. The results show its robustness in avoiding the robot kidnapping problem typical of particle filters localization methods, while providing a smooth and high rate pose estimate. The pose error distribution depends on the car velocity, and spans on average from 0.1 m (at 60 km/h) to 1.48 m (at 200 km/h) laterally and from 1.9 m (at 100 km/h) to 4.92 m (at 200 km/h) longitudinally.

AB In two studies, we evaluated the trust and usefulness of automated compared to manual parking using an experimental paradigm and also by surveying owners of vehicles with automated parking features. In Study 1, we compared participants' ability to manually park a Tesla Model X to their use of the Autopark feature to complete perpendicular and parallel parking maneuvers. We investigated differences in parking success and duration, intervention behavior, self-reported levels of trust in and workload associated with the automation, as well as eye and head movements related to monitoring the automation. We found higher levels of trust in the automated parallel parking maneuvers compared to perpendicular parking. The Tesla's automated perpendicular parking was found to be less efficient than manually executing this maneuver. Study 2 investigated the frequency with which owners of vehicles with automated parking features used those features and probed why they chose not to use them. Vehicle owners reported low use of any automated parking feature. Owners further reported using their vehicle's autonomous parking features in ways consistent with the empirical findings from Study 1: higher usage rates of autonomous parallel parking. The results from both studies revealed that 1) automated parking is error-prone, 2) drivers nonetheless have calibrated trust in the automated parking system, and 3) the benefits of automated parallel parking surpass those of automated perpendicular parking with the current state of the technology.

AB Objective: A driving simulator study was conducted to evaluate the longitudinal effects of an intervention and withdrawal of a lane keeping system on driving performance and cognitive workload. Background: Autonomous vehicle systems are being implemented into the vehicle fleet. However, limited research exists in understanding the carryover effects of long-term exposure. Methods: Forty-eight participants (30 treatment, 18 control) completed eight drives across three separate days in a driving simulator. The treatment group had an intervention and withdrawal of a lane keeping system. Changes in driving performance (standard deviation of lateral position [SDLP] and mean time to collision [TTC]) and cognitive workload (response time and miss rate to a detection response task) were modeled using mixed effects linear and negative binomial regression. Results: Drivers exposed to the lane keeping system had an increase in SDLP after the system was withdrawn relative to their baseline. Drivers with lane keeping had decreased mean TTC during and after system withdrawal compared with manual drivers. There was an increase in cognitive workload when the lane keeping system was withdrawn relative to when the system was engaged. Conclusion: Behavioral adaptations in driving performance and cognitive workload were present during automation and persisted after the automation was withdrawn. Application: The findings of this research emphasize the importance to consider the effects of skill atrophy and misplaced trust due to semi-autonomous vehicle systems.

AB Lane changing is a complex, yet extremely common driving manoeuvre. Studying lane changes can provide insight into how long drivers wait after activating their turn signal before changing lanes -a time that we call time-to-lane-change-initiation (TTLCI). TTLCI can offer valuable insights into driver behaviour prior to changing lanes. However, a better understanding of TTLCI, particularly in real-world settings, is lacking. To address this knowledge gap, we investigated TTLCI using driving data collected on public roads in Gothenburg, Sweden. We used the Kaplan-Meier (K-M) method and the mixed-effect Cox Proportional Hazard (CPH) model (statistical techniques from survival analysis) to comprehensively analyze TTLCI and identify factors that significantly influence it. The results of the K-M method indicate that most lane changes were initiated within two seconds of activating the turn signal. The mixed-effect CPH model showed that the speed of the lane-changing vehicle, the type and direction of the lane change, the presence of lead and lag vehicles, and the lag gap were all significant factors. These findings provide new insights into pre-lane-change behaviour and pave the way for future studies, in part by improving current lane change models. Moreover, the findings have implications for future regulations concerning turn-signal usage by human drivers. Additionally, our results can contribute to the development of algorithms for autonomous vehicles by improving their ability to detect imminent lane changes by surrounding vehicles.

AB Connected and automated vehicles (CAVs) are getting a lot of attention these days as their technology becomes more mature and they benefit from the Internet-of-Vehicles (IoV) ecosystem. CAVs attract malicious activities that jeopardize security and safety dimensions. The cybersecurity systems of CAVs detect such activities, collect and analyze related information during and after the activity, and use cyber threat intelligence (CTI) to organize this information. Considering that CTI collected from various malicious activities may share common characteristics, it is critical to provide the cybersecurity stakeholders with quick and automatic ways of analysis and interrelation. This aims to help them perform more accurate and effective forensic investigations. To this end, we present CAVeCTIR, a novel approach that finds similarities between CTI reports that describe malicious activities detected on CAVs. CAVeCTIR uses advanced machine learning techniques and provides a quick, automated, and effective solution for clustering similar malicious activities. We applied CAVeCTIR in a series of experiments investigating almost 3000 malicious activities in simulation, real-world, and hybrid CAV environments, covering seven critical cyber-attack scenarios. The results showed that the DBSCAN algorithm identified seven no-overlapping core clusters characterized by high density. The results indicated that cybersecurity stakeholders could take advantage of CAVeCTIR by adopting the same or similar methods to analyze newly detected malicious activity, speed up the attack attribution process, and perform a more accurate forensics investigation.

AB With the rapid development of the Internet of Things (IoT) communication system, a huge number of devices are interconnected to sense the unpredictable environment. These systems are needed to manage a lot of varied data in addition to facilitating human lives. With the use of sensors, vehicles exchange multimedia data in smart transportation applications and subsequently give useful information to the road. Many approaches have been proposed to overcome the route optimization problems in improving the transportation system, but a major study is still needed to address intelligence in the context of autonomous processing with lower route reconstruction. Data privacy and the assurance of its integrity are also crucial components of the transportation system since vehicles use next-generation technology to carry roadway information. To cope with vehicle communication through unreliable wireless infrastructure and effectively use the resources of the communication model, this work proposed a smart vehicular algorithm employing an IoT system (SVA-IoT). Firstly, it guarantees the reliability of the intelligent transportation system (ITS) with heuristic computing and decreases the overhead on the devices. Second, route optimization is carried out to balance the load on parallel routes while transmitting highway information, as a result, it increases the intelligence of smart vehicle systems. In the end, authentic devices are identified to establish a secure and trusted communication structure. The proposed technique is tested through a variety of simulated experiments, and the findings show considerable improvement over existing work.

TI Closing the Planning-Learning Loop With Application to Autonomous

SO IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON ROBOTICS

DT Article
DE Autonomous driving; planning under uncertainty; robot learning
AB Real-time planning under uncertainty is critical for robots operating in complex dynamic environments. Consider, for example, an autonomous robot vehicle driving in dense, unregulated urban traffic of cars, motorcycles, buses, etc. The robot vehicle has to plan in both short and long terms, in order to interact with many traffic participants of uncertain intentions and drive effectively. Planning explicitly over a long time horizon, however, incurs prohibitive computational cost and is impractical under real-time constraints. To achieve real-time performance for large-scale planning, this work introduces a new algorithm Learning from Tree Search for Driving (LeTS-Drive), which integrates planning and learning in a closed loop, and applies it to autonomous driving in crowded urban traffic in simulation. Specifically, LeTS-Drive learns a policy and its value function from data provided by an online planner, which searches a sparsely sampled belief tree; the online planner in turn uses the learned policy and value functions as heuristics to scale up its run-time performance for real-time robot control. These two steps are repeated to form a closed loop so that the planner and the learner inform each other and improve in synchrony. The algorithm learns on its own in a self-supervised manner, without human effort on explicit data labeling. Experimental results demonstrate that LeTS-Drive outperforms either planning or learning alone, as well as open-loop integration of planning and learning.

AB Today, and possibly for a long time to come, the full driving task is too complex an activity to be fully formalized as a sensing-acting robotics system that can be explicitly solved through model-based and learning-based approaches in order to achieve full unconstrained vehicle autonomy. Localization, mapping, scene perception, vehicle control, trajectory optimization, and higher-level planning decisions associated with autonomous vehicle development remain full of open challenges. This is especially true for unconstrained, real-world operation where the margin of allowable error is extremely small and the number of edge-cases is extremely large. Until these problems are solved, human beings will remain an integral part of the driving task, monitoring the AI system as it performs anywhere from just over 0% to just under 100% of the driving. The governing objectives of the MIT Advanced Vehicle Technology (MIT-AVT) study are to 1) undertake large-scale real-world driving data collection that includes high-definition video to fuel the development of deep learning-based internal and external perception systems; 2) gain a holistic understanding of how human beings interact with vehicle automation technology by integrating video data with vehicle state data, driver characteristics, mental models, and self-reported experiences with technology; and 3) identify how technology and other factors related to automation adoption and use can be improved in ways that save lives. In pursuing these objectives, we have instrumented 23 Tesla Model S and Model X vehicles, 2 Volvo S90 vehicles, 2 Range Rover Evoque, and 2 Cadillac CT6 vehicles for both long-term (over a year per driver) and medium-term (one month per driver) naturalistic driving data collection. Furthermore, we are continually developing new methods for the analysis of the massive-scale dataset collected from the instrumented vehicle fleet. The recorded data streams include IMU, GPS, and CAN messages, and high-definition video streams of the driver's face, the driver cabin, the forward roadway, and the instrument cluster (on select vehicles). The study is on-going and growing. To date, we have 122 participants, 15 610 days of participation, 511 638 mi, and 7.1 billion video frames. This paper presents the design of the study, the data collection hardware, the processing of the data, and the computer vision algorithms currently being used to extract actionable knowledge from the data.

AB This paper investigates the problem of fault tolerant control (FTC) for autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) with multiple thrusters in the presence of current disturbances, thruster faults, and modelling uncertainty. This paper focuses on the problems of reducing the energy consumption caused by the chattering of control signals and improving the tracking accuracy of an AUV operating in deep-sea environments. In view of the problem of large energy consumption in some other methods, a fault tolerant control method for multiple-thruster AUVs based on a finite-time extended state observer (FTESO) is proposed. More specifically, a FTESO based on an integral sliding mode surface is designed to estimate the generalized uncertainty compounded using current disturbances, thruster faults, and modelling uncertainty. The fast finite-time uniformly ultimately bounded stability of the proposed FTESO is analyzed. Then, based on the estimated value of FTESO, an FTC method based on non-singular fast terminal sliding mode surfaces is developed for AUVs. The finite-time convergence of the closed-loop control system is proved theoretically. In this design, two different sliding mode surfaces are used to design FTESO and FTC, in order to avoid the appearance of singularities. Moreover, a parameter adjustment method is designed to improve tracking accuracy. Finally, comparative numerical simulations show that the proposed control scheme is effective at reducing energy consumption and improving tracking accuracy.

AB Globally, adults aged 65 and older are a rapidly-growing population. Aging is associated with declines in perceptual, cognitive, and physical abilities, which often creates challenges in completing daily activities, such as driving. Autonomous vehicles (AVs) promise to provide older adults one way to maintain their mobility and independence. However, recent surveys of AV acceptance suggest that older adults have a lower AV acceptance compared to younger generations. One challenge is that most of these assessments have not accounted for the various non-chronological age factors that contribute to how older adults perceive their own driving skills and the utility of AVs. To fill this research gap, this study investigated the effects of non-chronological age factors and rated self-perceived driving abilities on AV acceptance across three age groups. An online survey was conducted using Amazon Mechanical Turk (MTurk), for which 438 valid responses were received. Respondents were categorized into a younger (18-40 years), middle-aged (41-64 years), and older (65-79 years) adult age group. Results showed that drivers of a younger age, with higher educational attainment, who rated themselves to have higher social support, and who have lower rated self-perceived driving abilities, report being more willing to accept AVs. Findings from this work can help to inform models of AV technology acceptance and guide in the development of marketing strategies to promote knowledge of AVs.

AB In autonomous vehicles (AVs), LiDAR point cloud data are an important source to identify various obstacles present in the environment. The labeling techniques that are currently available are based on pixel-wise segmentation and bounding boxes to detect each object on the road. However, the Avs' decision on motion control and trajectory path planning depends on the interaction among the objects on the road. The ability of the Avs to understand the moving and non-moving objects is the key to scene understanding. This paper presents a novel labeling method to combine moving and non-moving objects. This labeling technique is named relational labeling. Autoencoders are used to reduce the dimensionality of the data. A K-means model provides pseudo labels by clustering the data in the latent space. Each pseudo label is then converted into unary and binary relational labels. These relational labels are used in the supervised learning methods for labeling and segmenting the LiDAR point cloud data. A backpropagation network (BPN), along with traditional gradient descent-based learning methods, are used for labeling the data. Our study evaluated the labeling accuracy of two as well as three layers of BPN. The accuracy of the two-layer BPN model was found to be better than the three-layer BPN model. According to the experiments, our model showed competitive accuracy of 75% compared to the weakly supervised techniques in a similar area of study, i.e., the accuracy for S3DIS (Area 5) is 48.0%.

AB We present results from sea trials for an autonomous surface vehicle (ASV) equipped with a collision avoidance system based on model predictive control (MPC). The sea trials were performed in the North Sea as part of an ASV Challenge posed by Deltares through a Dutch initiative involving different authorities, including the Ministry of Infrastructure and Water Management, the Netherlands Coastguard, and the Royal Netherlands Navy. To allow an ASV to operate in a maritime environment governed by the International Regulations for Preventing Collisions at Sea (COLREGs), the ASV must be capable of complying with COLREGs. Therefore, the sea trials focused on verifying COLREGs-compliant behavior of the ASV in different challenging scenarios using automatic identification system (AIS) data from other vessels. The scenarios cover situations where some obstacle vessels obey COLREGs and emergency situations where some obstacles make decisions that increase the risk of collision. The MPC-based collision avoidance method evaluates a combined predicted collision and COLREGs-compliance risk associated with each obstacle and chooses the 'best' way out of dangerous situations. The results from the verification exercise in the North Sea show that the MPC approach is capable of finding safe solutions in challenging situations, and in most cases demonstrates behaviors that are close to the expectations of an experienced mariner. According to Deltares' report, the sea trials have shown in practice that the technical maturity of autonomous vessels is already more than expected.

ID SIGNAL CONTROL
AB The problem of traffic congestion caused by the fast-growing travel demands has been getting serious in urban areas. Meanwhile, the future of urban mobility has been foreseen as being electric, shared, and autonomous. Accordingly, the routing and charging strategies for fleets of shared autonomous electric vehicles (SAEVs) need to be carefully addressed to cope with the characteristics of the rideshare service operation of the SAEV fleets. In the literature, much work has been done to develop various traffic control strategies for alleviating the problem in urban traffic congestion. However, little research has proposed effective solutions that integrate the route of charging strategies for SAEV fleets with the urban traffic congestion problem. In this regard, this work presents an integrated framework that tackles the route and charging of SAEV fleets as well as the urban traffic congestion prevention issues. Notably, our contribution in this work not only proposes a joint solution for the problems of the urban traffic congestion control and rideshare dispatch of SAEV fleets, but also fills the gap of the routing and charging strategies for mixed privately owned EVs (PEV) and SAEV fleets in the literature. A general optimization framework is formulated, and effective heuristics are proposed to tackle the above-mentioned problems in this work. The feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed algorithms were evaluated through four different scenarios in the simulation. After applying the proposed algorithms, the traffic volumes of the oversaturated main arterial road were diverted to other less busy road sections, and the traveling times of EV passengers were decreased by 28% during peak periods. The simulation results reveal that the proposed algorithms not only provide a practical solution to prevent the problem in urban traffic congestion during rush hours, but also shorten the travel times of EV passengers effectively.

AB Although connected autonomous vehicles (CAVs) hold great potential to improve driving safety and experience significantly, cybersecurity remains a critical concern. As the de-facto standard for in-vehicle networks, the Controller Area Network (CAN) carries messages and commands vital to the operation of the vehicle. However, due to a lack of security mechanisms, intruders are able to conduct devastating attacks on drivers and passengers over CAN. In order to safeguard CAVs, an Intrusion Detection System (IDS) can be deployed to monitor CAN network activities and detect suspicious behavior resulting from an attack. This paper proposes a prediction-based IDS framework for detecting anomalies and attacks on a CAN bus using temporal correlation of message contents. Two candidates are introduced as the prediction module. The first network is an LSTM that predicts time series data separately for each CAN ID, and the second is a ConvLSTM that predicts messages using correlated data of several CAN IDs. An attack is classified according to prediction errors by a Gaussian Naive Bayes classifier. The proposed IDS is evaluated against other state-of-the-art one-class classifiers, including OCSVM, Isolation Forest, and Autoencoder, and three existing works, including ReducedInception-ResNet, NeuroCAN, and CANLite, using a real-world dataset, the Car Hacking Dataset. A comparison between the two suggested architectures and their use cases is given. Compared to baseline methods and related studies, the proposed method is shown to be more accurate and can achieve F-scores and detection accuracy of almost 100%.

AB For safe and efficient navigation in driving environment, autonomous vehicles are supposed to predict future trajectories of surrounding vehicles dynamically and tackle the uncertainty of environment. Early works view uncertainty as distributions in different modals, and perform this task by enumerating a mass of trajectories, but can hardly cover all the possible modal distributions. Recently, generative model has risen to hold promise for modelling such distributions, something that we will build upon here. Target at predefined modals of vehicle agents, this paper proposes Spatial-Temporal Generative Model (STGM), a new learning algorithm that leverages a stochastic generative model to mitigate modal distributions problem. To be more specific, a Conditional Variational Auto-Encoder (CVAE) is leveraged to construct the framework of STGM, in which the input is augmented into modal distributions to gain modality-wise trajectories. Besides, for the stability of prediction, we also come up with a new modal-wise sampling trick as an alternative of traditional random sampling in CVAE. Considering that multiple layer perception (MLP) based CVAE is incapable of extracting spatial and temporal features effectively, we use two respective encoders before CVAE: Spatial Encoder and Temporal Encoder, and align them with a closed modal set. Additionally, inspired by the Total Probability Formula, we adopt a Modal Prediction Model to refine the confidences of modal-wise trajectories. After empirical evaluation on two public datasets, we find that STGM almost outperforms the baselines, such as Covernet, MTP, and so on.

AB Platooning connected and autonomous vehicles (CAVs) can improve traffic and fuel efficiency. However, scalable platooning operations require junction-level coordination, which has not been well studied. In this paper, we study the coordination of vehicle platooning at highway junctions. We consider a setting where CAVs randomly arrive at a highway junction according to a general renewal process. When a CAV approaches the junction, a system operator determines whether the CAV will merge into the platoon ahead according to the positions and speeds of the CAV and the platoon. We formulate a Markov decision process to minimize the discounted cumulative travel cost, i.e., fuel consumption plus travel delay, over an infinite time horizon. We show that the optimal policy is threshold-based: the CAV will merge with the platoon if and only if the difference between the CAV's and the platoon's predicted times of arrival at the junction is less than a constant threshold. We also propose two ready-to-implement algorithms to derive the optimal policy. Comparison with the classical value iteration algorithm implies that our approach explicitly incorporating the characteristics of the optimal policy is significantly more efficient in terms of computation. Importantly, we show that the optimal policy under Poisson arrivals can be obtained by solving a system of integral equations. We also validate our results in simulation with a Real-time Strategy (RTS) using real traffic data. The simulation results indicate that the proposed method yields better performance compared with the conventional method.

AB The collaboration between a human driver and an automation system will serve as an effective measure before the autonomous driving technology is fully implemented. To discuss the driving authority between a human driver and an automation system, a novel moving horizon shared steering framework is proposed, in which the controller assists the driver when the vehicle is in danger. First, a potential-hazard analysis is presented based on the potential steering operation error and lane departure distance to predict the degree of a hazard and to determine the driving authority between the human driver and the automation system. Then, the minimum collaborative steering operation is determined using a moving horizon optimisation approach with safety constraints. Thus, the automation system shares steering with the driver protect the vehicle from risks in a non-invasive manner. To demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed strategy, simulations with different types of drivers and scenarios are conducted. The results of these simulations demonstrate that the proposed approach can enhance the driving ability of drivers with different skill levels in dangerous situations. The approach can also guarantee the safety of the intelligent vehicle to some extent when drivers lose focus for a period of time.

AB It is important to accurately obtain the motion information of the ego vehicle and surrounding vehicles for autonomous vehicles to plan safe trajectories in complicated traffic environments. In this paper, a LiDAR-based estimation method is developed to simultaneously identify the pose and the velocity information of an ego vehicle and its surrounding moving obstacles. Specifically, a pose estimation network is designed to estimate the poses of both the ego vehicle and the obstacles only with the continuous point clouds obtained by the LiDAR mounted on the ego vehicle. In the network, PointNet++ is utilized as the backbone to extract point-wise features and divide the points into the static part and the moving part. The former is used to estimate the ego vehicle's pose, while the latter is applied for the obstacle pose identification. Then, a reduced-order observer is designed to estimate the velocities, whose convergence is proved with the Lyapunov theory. Finally, both simulation and experiment results are provided to show the effectiveness of the proposed method.

AB NASA's Mars Exploration Rovers (MER) have collected a great diversity of geological science results, thanks in large part to their surface mobility capabilities. The six wheel rocker/bogie mobility system provides driving capabilities in a range of terrain types, while the onboard IMU measures actual rover attitude changes (roll, pitch and yaw, but not position) quickly and accurately. Four stereo camera pairs provide accurate position knowledge and/or terrain assessment. Solar panels generally provide enough energy to drive the vehicle for at most four hours each day, but drive time is often restricted by other planned activities. Driving along slopes in nonhomogeneous terrain injects unpredictable amounts of slip into each drive. These restrictions led to the creation of driving strategies that alternately use more or less onboard autonomy, to maximize drive speed and distance at the cost of increased complexity in the sequences of commands built by human Rover Planners each day.
   Commands to the MER vehicles are typically transmitted at most once per day, so mobility operations are encoded as event-driven sequences of individual motion commands. Motions may be commanded using quickly-executing Directed commands which perform only reactive motion safety checks (e.g., real-time current limits, maximum instantaneous vehicle tilt limit), slowly-executing position measuring Visual Odometry (VisOdom) commands, which use images to accurately update the onboard position estimate, or slow-to-medium speed Autonomous Navigation (AutoNav) commands, which use onboard image processing to perform predictive terrain safety checks and optional autonomous Path Selection.
   In total, the MER rovers have driven more than 10 kilometers over Martian terrain during their first 21 months of operation using these basic modes. In this paper we describe the strategies adopted for selecting between human-planned Directed drives versus rover-adaptive Autonomous Navigation, Visual Odometry and Path Selection drives.

AB In this review paper, the integration of Machine Learning (ML) and Model Predictive Control (MPC) in Automotive Control System (ACS) applications are discussed. ACS can be divided into these three main subsystems: enhancing safety, improving comfort, and reducing fuel consumption and emissions. Due to the development of new technologies such as advancing autonomous and connected vehicles the complexity of these subsystems is increasing. The ACS is meant to encompass the vehicle dynamics, powertrain control, passenger comfort, and accessories. Since vehicle manufacturers must meet stringent performance and emission requirements, optimal control methods for ACS applications are seen as a promising technology. MPC is an optimal control method for closed-loop control applications that allows constraints to be enforced in real-time while an objective function is minimized. The application of MPC in the automotive industry has been shown in the past decade. An important challenge in the design and real-time implementation of MPC is having a accurate predictive model that also does not require excessive real-time computation. Using ML to provide an accurate model at decreased computational cost improves MPC performance of ACS and is the main focus of this paper. How MPC in ML-based ACS applications ensures stability while meeting constraint is also discussed. Method to combine MPC and ML for the ACS subsystems of vehicle dynamics and powertrain control are reviewed and an outlook on future ACS is discussed.

AB The incorporation of high precision vehicle positioning systems has been demanded by the autonomous electric vehicle (AEV) industry. For this reason, research on visual odometry (VO) and Artificial Intelligence (AI) to reduce positioning errors automatically has become essential in this field. In this work, a new method to reduce the error in the absolute location of AEV using fuzzy logic (FL) is presented. The cooperative data fusion of GPS, odometer, and stereo camera signals is then performed to improve the estimation of AEV localization. Although the most important challenge of this work focuses on the reduction in the odometry error in the vehicle, the defiance of synchrony and the information fusion of sources of different nature is solved. This research is integrated by three phases: data acquisition, data fusion, and statistical evaluation. The first one is data acquisition by using an odometer, a GPS, and a ZED camera in AVE's trajectories. The second one is the data analysis and fuzzy fusion design using the MatLab 2019 (R) fuzzy logic toolbox. The last is the statistical evaluation of the positioning error of the different sensors. According to the obtained results, the proposed model with the lowest error is that which uses all sensors as input (stereo camera, odometer, and GPS). It can be highlighted that the best proposed model manages to reduce the positioning mean absolute error (MAE) up to 25% with respect to the state of the art.

AB Autonomous launch vehicles, once lifted off from the launch pad, equipped with an onboard intelligence which aids in achieving the mission objectives with high accuracy. The accuracy of the mission depends basically on navigation and guidance errors caused at burnout condition, after which the vehicle follows an elliptical path upto impact. The paper describes how to handle the final impact and injection error caused by these navigation and guidance errors. In the current work the initial burnout conditions are tuned and corrected such that the terminal impact point is achieved within the desired tolerance bounds. A two point boundary value problem is solved using the gradient method, for determining the impact errors. The algorithm is validated by simulation studies for various burnout conditions.

AB Test the safety of Autonomous Driving Systems (ADS) with realistic traffic conditions is important to the insurance industry, legislators, and third-party technical services. However, the scarcity of risky driving events distributed in real-world driving often makes sampling inefficient. In this paper, we propose a unified and hierarchical testing framework for efficient and unbiased safety tests of ADS. We first extract the risk subspace from the Naturalistic Driving Data (NDD) with defined safety measures. Subsequently, we use the Gaussian Copula method to accurately model the subspace joint probability density function (PDF). We further formulate a Kriging model-based optimization problem for finding the appropriate Importance Sampling (IS) parameters, where the Kriging model is trained iteratively within limited computational resources. Eventually, the risky concrete scenarios library is generated using the obtained Importance Sampling parameters. With the simulation results skewered back to the original risk subspace, the ADS probability of failure (e.g., crash rate) can thus be accurately and unbiasedly estimated. Experiment results show that using 0.94% computational resources, the Kriging surrogate model captures 96.04% of ADS crashes with at least 90.25% precision. On crash rate estimation, our proposed method achieves a consistent result with that of Monte Carlo simulation, provided that the relative error does not exceed 10% while improving the testing efficiency by up to 6,539 times.

AB It is extremely challenging to carry out an advanced adaptive navigation system in the complex environment of a port. Especially in the waters that are about to be berthed, the unmanned surface vehicles (USVs) should autonomously identify and avoid dense buoys according to the rules. Each country has corresponding mandatory documents that strictly regulate the shape, color and orientation of water buoys in coastal and estuary channels. Aiming at the problem of USV collision avoidance navigation under the constraints of the IALA (International Association of Marine Aids and Lighthouse Authorities) Maritime buoyage system, this paper designs a mixed environment model including multiple ocean buoys according to this rule. By using the deep neural network to extract the state features of the target, and setting the reward function reasonably, the USV can not only navigate to the target autonomously, but also identify the corresponding buoy and give the corresponding decision. Using different DQN optimization algorithms to conduct comparative experiments, the stability of the algorithm's learning of the optimal strategy is improved. The results show that the algorithm can accurately avoid obstacles ahead, identify buoys effectively, and realize effective autonomous collision avoidance decision-making in complex environments with static obstacles and buoys with indicating function. This research can provide theoretical basis and method reference for USV's autonomous navigation in port.

First, we establish a kinematic vehicle model by considering the path constraints and boundary constraints during the process of tracking the described path of a vehicle. Subsequently, finding the minimum error of the lateral distance between the prescribed path and the expected trajectory is set as the performance objective function. Finally, the vehicle path tracking problem is transformed into an optimal control problem. The optimization algorithm is combined with the sequential quadratic programming algorithm to optimize problems related to the control and state variables and the boundary and path constraints. The simulated results show that the hp-adaptive GPM can improve the convergence rate of the optimal control problem for vehicle path tracking. The proposed hp-adaptive pseudospectral method has a higher solving efficiency compared with traditional approaches for the vehicle path-tracking problem. Concurrently, the verification results of a real vehicle test indicate the feasibility of the proposed algorithm for solving the vehicle path tracking problem. This research provides valuable insight into the design work of lane changes and is an important step towards the design of feedback control laws for path tracking.

AB The paper poses the problem of minimum-time velocity planning subject to a jerk amplitude constraint and to arbitrary velocity/acceleration boundary conditions. This problem which is relevant in the field of autonomous robotic navigation and also for inertial one-dimensional mechatronics systems is dealt with an algebraic approach based on Pontryagin's Maximum Principle. The exposed complete solution shows how this time-optimal planning can be reduced to the problem of determining the positive real roots of a quartic equation. An algorithm that is suitable for real-time applications is then presented. The paper includes detailed examples also highlighting the special cases of this planning problem.

AB Autonomous underwater gliders (AUGs) are effective platforms for oceanic research and environmental monitoring. However, complex underwater environments with uncertainties could pose the risk of vehicle loss during their missions. It is therefore essential to conduct risk prediction to assist decision making for safer operations. The main limitation of current studies for AUGs is the lack of a tailored method for risk analysis considering both dynamic environments and potential functional failures of the vehicle. Hence, this study proposed a copula-based approach for evaluating the risk of AUG loss in dynamic underwater environments. The developed copula Bayesian network (CBN) integrated copula functions into a traditional Bayesian belief network (BBN), aiming to handle nonlinear dependencies among environmental variables and inherent technical failures. Specifically, potential risk factors with causal effects were captured using the BBN. A Gaussian copula was then employed to measure correlated dependencies among identified risk factors. Furthermore, the dependence analysis and CBN inference were performed to assess the risk level of vehicle loss given various environmental observations. The effectiveness of the proposed method was demonstrated in a case study, which considered deploying a Slocum G1 Glider in a real water region. Risk mitigation measures were provided based on key findings. This study potentially contributes a tailored tool of risk prediction for AUGs in dynamic environments, which can enhance the safety performance of AUGs and assist in risk mitigation for decision makers.

AB Cities around the world are piloting projects to evaluate the feasibility and benefits of shared autonomous vehicles (SAVs), as their large-scale implementation and integration into public transit systems have the potential to improve individuals' accessibility and transportation equity. To understand the full potential of SAVs and their likely adoption, it is important to identify how the services can be utilized most effectively and what determines the composition of the ridership. This research aims to explore the usage and adoption of SAVs, focusing on a project called RAPID (Rideshare, Automation, and Payment Integration Demonstration) that was launched in Arlington, Texas. We used real-time trip-level ridership data from the SAV platform, conducted a survey of SAV riders, and developed a study based on ordered logistic regression to estimate the determinants of ridership frequency. Data analysis of real-time ridership data revealed that spatial distribution of activities and service accessibility have crucial roles in forming the current users' travel patterns. The findings from the logistic regression demonstrated that those with higher household incomes are less likely to be frequent riders of RAPID, while those who usually walk, bike, or utilize on-demand ridesharing services are likely to use SAVs often. Users with higher levels of safety perception are also more likely to be frequent users of the service. The findings of this study will provide planners with a better understanding of SAV ridership patterns and will guide decision-makers nationwide in establishing and adopting policies that will be appropriate for future SAV implementation projects.

AB Object tracking is crucial for planning safe maneuvers of mobile robots in dynamic environments, in particular for autonomous driving with surrounding traffic participants. Multi-stage processing of sensor measurement data is thereby required to obtain abstracted high-level objects, such as vehicles. This also includes sensor fusion, data association, and temporal filtering. Often, an early-stage object abstraction is performed, which, however, is critical, as it results in information loss regarding the subsequent processing steps. We present a new grid-based object tracking approach that, in contrast, is based on already fused measurement data. The input is thereby pre-processed, without abstracting objects, by the spatial grid cell discretization of a dynamic occupancy grid, which enables a generic multi-sensor detection of moving objects. On the basis of already associated occupied cells, presented in our previous work, this paper investigates the subsequent object state estimation. The object pose and shape estimation thereby benefit from the freespace information contained in the input grid, which is evaluated to determine the current visibility of extracted object parts. An integrated object classification concept further enhances the assumed object size. For a precise dynamic motion state estimation, radar Doppler velocity measurements are integrated into the input data and processed directly on the object-level. Our approach is evaluated with real sensor data in the context of autonomous driving in challenging urban scenarios.

AB Featured Application Submersed obstacle avoidance in unknown ocean currents via guidance, navigation, and control for autonomous underwater vehicles.
   Abstract A considerable volume of research has recently blossomed in the literature on autonomous underwater vehicles accepting recent developments in mathematical modeling and system identification; pitch control; information filtering and active sensing, including inductive sensors of ELF emissions and also optical sensor arrays for position, velocity, and orientation detection; grid navigation algorithms; and dynamic obstacle avoidance, amongst others. In light of these modern developments, this article develops and compares integrative guidance, navigation, and control methodologies for the Naval Postgraduate School's Phoenix submerged autonomous vehicle, where these methods are assumed available. The measure of merit reveals how well each of several proposed methodologies cope with known and unknown disturbances, such as currents that can be constant or harmonic, while maintaining a safe passage distance from underwater obstacles, in this case submerged mines. Classical pole-placement designs establish nominal baseline behaviors and are subsequently compared to performance of designs that are optimized to satisfy linear quadratic cost functions in regulators as well as linear-quadratic Gaussian designs. Feed-forward architectures and integral control designs are also evaluated. A noteworthy contribution is a very simple method to mimic optimal results with a rule of thumb criteria based on the design's time constant. Since the rule-of-thumb method uses the assumed system model for computation of the control, it is particularly generic. Cited references each contain methods for online system parameter identification (with a motivation of use in the finding the control signal), permitting the rule of thumb's generic applicability, since it is expressed in terms of the system parameters. This proposed method permits control design at sea where significant computation abilities are not available. Very simple waypoint guidance is also introduced to guide a vehicle along a preplanned path through a field of obstacles placed at random locations. The linear-quadratic Gaussian design proves best when augmented with integral control, and works well with reduced-order equations, while the rule of thumb design is seen to closely mimic the optimal performance. Feed-forward augmentation proves particularly efficient at rejecting constant disturbances, while augmentation with integral control is necessary to counter periodic disturbances, where the augmentations are also optimized in the linear-quadratic Gaussian procedures, yet can be closely mimicked by the proposed rule of thumb technique.

AB Vehicle pose estimation is essential in autonomous vehicle (AV) perception technology. However, due to the different density distributions of the point cloud, it is challenging to achieve sensitive direction extraction based on 3D LiDAR by using the existing pose estimation methods. In this paper, an optimal vehicle pose estimation network based on time series and spatial tightness (TS-OVPE) is proposed. This network uses five pose estimation algorithms proposed as candidate solutions to select each obstacle vehicle's optimal pose estimation result. Among these pose estimation algorithms, we first propose the Basic Line algorithm, which uses the road direction as the prior knowledge. Secondly, we propose improving principal component analysis based on point cloud distribution to conduct rotating principal component analysis (RPCA) and diagonal principal component analysis (DPCA) algorithms. Finally, we propose two global algorithms independent of the prior direction. We provided four evaluation indexes to transform each algorithm into a unified dimension. These evaluation indexes' results were input into the ensemble learning network to obtain the optimal pose estimation results from the five proposed algorithms. The spatial dimension evaluation indexes reflected the tightness of the bounding box and the time dimension evaluation index reflected the coherence of the direction estimation. Since the network was indirectly trained through the evaluation index, it could be directly used on untrained LiDAR and showed a good pose estimation performance. Our approach was verified on the SemanticKITTI dataset and our urban environment dataset. Compared with the two mainstream algorithms, the polygon intersection over union (P-IoU) average increased by about 5.25% and 9.67%, the average heading error decreased by about 29.49% and 44.11%, and the average speed direction error decreased by about 3.85% and 46.70%. The experiment results showed that the ensemble learning network could effectively select the optimal pose estimation from the five abovementioned algorithms, making pose estimation more accurate.</p>

AB The automotive industry is facing disruptive trends and great uncertainty. The path forward for automotive jurisdictions is uncertain in terms of how automakers will allocate the production of new connected and autonomous vehicles (C/AVs). The introduction of C/AV technologies creates high levels of uncertainty both for individual firms and regional innovation systems (RISs). The intersection of established production competencies with emerging digital technologies raises questions about how regional pathways and RISs develop and how local and RISs adapt to changes in global innovation networks. Building on recent contributions to evolutionary economic geography (EEG), the article examines the impact of the current technology transition on Ontario's automotive sector. Drawing on rich empirical data and recent conceptual advances in theorizing about new path development from EEG and the literature on global innovation networks, the article casts light on how the intersection between global innovation networks and regional actors is altering Ontario's developmental path. It examines the potential for Ontario to diversify away from its historic status as a semi-peripheral automotive region with limited investment in research and development to one with a greater role in the emerging paradigm of connected and autonomous vehicles. The article explores the potential for path diversification based on interpath dynamics between the region's auto and information and computer technology sectors as well as the importance of both system-level and firm-level agency for altering the region's developmental trajectory.

AB Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) are widely used platforms to carry data capturing sensors for various applications. The reason for this success can be found in many aspects: the high maneuverability of the UAVs, the capability of performing autonomous data acquisition, flying at different heights, and the possibility to reach almost any vantage point. The selection of appropriate viewpoints and planning the optimum trajectories of UAVs is an emerging topic that aims at increasing the automation, efficiency, and reliability of the data capturing process to achieve a dataset with desired quality. On the other hand, 3-D reconstruction using the data captured by UAVs is also attracting attention in research and industry. This article investigates a wide range of model-free and model-based algorithms for viewpoints and path planning for 3-D reconstruction of large-scale objects. It presents a bibliography of more than 200 references to cover different aspects of the topic. The analyzed approaches are limited to those that employ a single-UAV as a data capturing platform for outdoor 3-D reconstruction purposes. In addition to discussing the evaluation strategies, this article also highlights the innovations and limitations of the investigated approaches. It concludes with a critical analysis of the existing challenges and future research perspectives.

AB Reinforcement learning (RL) can learn from past failures and has the potential to provide selfimprovement ability and higher-level intelligence. However, the current RL algorithms still suffer from challenges in reliability, especially compared to the rule/model-based algorithms that are pre-engineered, human-input intensive, but widely used in autonomous vehicles. To take advantages of both the RL and rule-based algorithms, this work aims to design a decision-making framework that leverages RL and use an existing rule-based policy as its performance lower bound. In this way, the final policy remains the potential of self-learning, while guaranteeing a better system performance compared with the integrated rule-based policy. Such a decision making framework is called trustworthy improvement RL (TiRL). The basic idea is to make the RL policy iteration process synchronously estimate the given rule-based policy's value function. AV will then use the RL policy to drive only in the cases where the RL has learned a better policy, i.e., a higher policy value. This work takes highway safe driving as the case study. The results are obtained through more than 42,000 km driving in stochastic simulated traffic, and calibrated by naturalistic driving data. The TiRL planner is given two typical rule-based highway-driving policies for comparison. The results show that the TiRL can outperform the given arbitrary rule based driving policy. In summary, the proposed TiRL can leverage the learning-based method in stochastic and emergent scenarios, while having a trustworthy safety improvement from the existing rule-based policies.

AB The use of autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) for various scientific, commercial, and military applications has become more common with maturing technology and improved accessibility. One relatively new development lies in the use of AUVs for under-ice marine science research in the Antarctic. The extreme environment, ice cover, and inaccessibility as compared to open-water missions can result in a higher risk of loss. Therefore, having an effective assessment of risks before undertaking any Antarctic under-ice missions is crucial to ensure an AUV's survival. Existing risk assessment approaches predominantly focused on the use of historical fault log data of an AUV and elicitation of experts' opinions for probabilistic quantification. However, an AUV program in its early phases lacks historical data and any assessment of risk may be vague and ambiguous. In this article, a fuzzy-based risk assessment framework is proposed for quantifying the risk of AUV loss under ice. The framework uses the knowledge, prior experience of available subject matter experts, and the widely used semiquantitative risk assessment matrix, albeit in a new form. A well-developed example based on an upcoming mission by an ISE-explorer class AUV is presented to demonstrate the application and effectiveness of the proposed framework. The example demonstrates that the proposed fuzzy-based risk assessment framework is pragmatically useful for future under-ice AUV deployments. Sensitivity analysis demonstrates the validity of the proposed method.

ID UNMANNED AERIAL VEHICLES
AB Model Predictive Control (MPC) is a modern technique that, nowadays, encapsulates different optimal control techniques. For the case of non-linear dynamics, many possible variants can be developed which can lead to new control algorithms. In this manuscript a novel generic control system method is presented. This method can be applied to control, in an optimal way, different systems having non-linear dynamics. Particularly, in this paper, the proposed technique is presented in the context of developing a control system for autonomous flight of UAVs. This technique can be used for different types of aerial vehicles having any type of generic non-linear dynamics. The presented method is based on the use of iteratively defined optimal candidate state-space trajectories in global state-space. The method uses, a generalized linearization process which, opposite to standard methods, does not need to be predefined in a certain equilibrium state but instead it is performed along any arbitrary state. The technique allows the inclusion of constraints with ease. The presented technique is used as a centralized control system unit that is able to control the full aircraft dynamics without the need of decoupling the system in different reduced modes. The technique is tested by making a Cessna 172 airplane model to perform the following autonomous unmanned maneuvers: climbing at constant speed to a desired altitude, heading change to a desired flight direction, and, coordinate turn.

AB Autonomous vehicles (AVs) represent potentially disruptive and innovative changes to public transportation (PT) systems. However, the exact interplay between AV and PT is understudied in existing research. This paper proposes a systematic approach to the design, simulation, and evaluation of integrated autonomous vehicle and public transportation (AV + PT) systems. Two features distinguish this research from the state of the art in the literature: the first is the transit oriented AV operation with the purpose of supporting existing PT modes; the second is the explicit modeling of the interaction between demand and supply.
   We highlight the transit-orientation by identifying the synergistic opportunities between AV and PT, which makes AVs more acceptable to all the stakeholders and respects the social-purpose considerations such as maintaining service availability and ensuring equity. Specifically, AV is designed to serve first-mile connections to rail stations and provide efficient shared mobility in low-density suburban areas. The interaction between demand and supply is modeled using a set of system dynamics equations and solved as a fixed-point problem through an iterative simulation procedure. We develop an agent-based simulation platform of service and a discrete choice model of demand as two subproblems. Using a feedback loop between supply and demand, we capture the interaction between the decisions of the service operator and those of the travelers and model the choices of both parties. Considering uncertainties in demand prediction and stochasticity in simulation, we also evaluate the robustness of our fixed-point solution and demonstrate the convergence of the proposed method empirically.
   We test our approach in a major European city, simulating scenarios with various fleet sizes, vehicle capacities, fare schemes, and hailing strategies such as in-advance requests. Scenarios are evaluated from the perspectives of passengers, AV operators, PT operators, and urban mobility system. Results show the trade off between the level of service and the operational cost, providing insight for fleet sizing to reach the optimal balance. Our simulated experiments show that encouraging ride-sharing, allowing in-advance requests, and combining fare with transit help enable service integration and encourage sustainable travel. Both the transit-oriented AV operation and the demand-supply interaction are essential components for defining and assessing the roles of the AV technology in our future transportation systems, especially those with ample and robust transit networks.

AB As autonomous driving technologies advance, occupants are expected to be free from driving, diversifying interaction scenarios with vehicles. Despite the growing importance of in-vehicle occupant monitoring systems, most existing systems focus on the face or head tracking of occupants, and only a few studies have attempted to detect their poses. In this paper, we present the first in-vehicle environment-specialized framework for the joint estimation of 3D human pose and shape from a single image. To this end, we introduce a new dataset called Human In VEhicles (HIVE), which contains a large collection of synthesized humans with different shapes and poses in vehicle images. HIVE provides RGB and NIR in-vehicle image pairs with ground-truth 2D and 3D pose and shape annotations, respectively. In addition, to exploit the different characteristics of humans in vehicles and unconstrained environments, we present a new pose prior penalizing poses that deviate from in-vehicle poses. The pose prior is derived using a variational autoencoder trained with in-vehicle human pose data. By using the proposed HIVE dataset and pose prior along with an elaborately designed two-stage training procedure, our method exhibits significantly improved pose and shape estimation performance compared with state-of-the-art methods for real-world test images captured in vehicles under different conditions.

AB The cooperative path planning problem for air-sea heterogeneous unmanned vehicles using search-and-tracking mission is studied in this paper. Due to the limitations of single unmanned vehicle, the air-sea heterogeneous system, composed of an unmanned aerial-aquatic vehicle (UAAV), an unmanned surface vehicle (USV) and an autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV), is introduced to compensate for the singleness of unmanned vehicle and complete more complicated marine missions. One search-and-tracking mission containing the search phase and tracking phase is presented to accomplish the underwater target tracking mission with goals of minimizing the search time and finding the shortest tracking path. In the search phase, according to different initial positions of three unmanned vehicles, the corresponding task allocation algorithms are proposed to determine the location of the target efficiently and minimize the search time by allocating different task for three unmanned vehicles. Meanwhile, the unmanned vehicles only know the approximate area containing the target before the task execution and move in the direction of the area for searching target. In the tracking phase, an improved particle swarm optimization algorithm is addressed to solve the path planning problem with obstacles. Simulation results show that the underwater target can be detected using search-and-tracking mission in an air-sea heterogeneous system efficiently and accurately.

ID SOCIOLOGY
AB This paper examines recent street tests of autonomous vehicles (AVs) in the UK and makes the case for an experimental approach in the sociology of intelligent technology. In recent years intelligent vehicle testing has moved from the laboratory to the street, raising the question of whether technology trials equally constitute tests of society. To adequately address this question, I argue, we need to move beyond analytic frameworks developed in 1990s Science and Technology Studies, which stipulated "a social deficit" of both intelligent technology and technology testing. This diagnosis no longer provides an effective starting point for sociological analysis, as real-world tests of intelligent technology explicitly seek to bring social phenomena within the remit of technology testing. I propose that we examine instead whether and how the introduction of intelligent vehicles into the street involves the qualification and re-qualification of relations and dynamics between social actors. I develop this proposal through a discussion of a field study of AV street trials in three cities in the UK-London, Milton Keynes, and Coventry. These urban trials were accompanied by the claim that automotive testing on the open road will enable cars to operate in tune with the social environment, and I show how iterations of street testing undo this proposition and compel its reformulation. Current test designs are limited by their narrow conception of sociality in terms of interaction between cars and other road users. They exclude from consideration the relational capacities of vehicles and human road users alike-their ability to co-exist on the open road. I conclude by making the case for methodological innovation in social studies of intelligent technology: by combining social research and design methods, we can re-purpose real-world test environments in order to elucidate social issues and dynamics raised by intelligent vehicles in society by experimental means, and, possibly, test society.

AB Mobility services are evolving globally. Driverless public transport can be a game-changer for urban mobility. However, empirical evidence from the point of user experiences is lacking. A customer's sense of safety and security has a significant influence on public transport acceptance. This case study focuses on driverless shuttle bus passengers' subjective experiences of (a) traffic safety, (b) in-vehicle security, and (c) emergency management compared to the conventional bus. Data were collected through interviews from informants that travelled by driverless shuttle busses in the City of Vantaa, Finland in summer 2015. A total of 19,021 passengers travelled by 3,962 km autonomous buses on a specific route. The sample of 197 informants was analysed by quantitative methods. Informants assessed perception of traffic safety to be better in the driverless shuttle bus than in a conventional bus with a driver. However, they were lacking personal in-vehicle security. 64 per cent of passengers answered that sense of in-vehicle security in the driverless shuttle bus was worse or much worse than in the conventional bus. There was a significant difference between women and men when they evaluated their subjective sense of security on board F(1, 195) = 8.196,p < 0.001. Men assessed their experiences of traffic safety, in vehicle security and emergency management to be overall better than those of women. In order to mainstream the use of driverless shuttle buses, for example as a part of a transport chain, traffic safety is not a problem. Instead, a passenger's sense of security on board should be increased. This is the case especially with female passengers.

AB Motion prediction for the leading vehicle is a critical task for connected autonomous vehicles. It provides a method to model the leading-following vehicle behavior and analysis their interactions. In this study, a joint time-series modeling approach for leading vehicle trajectory prediction considering different driving styles is proposed. The proposed method enables a precise and personalized trajectory prediction for the leading vehicle based on limited inter-vehicle communication signals, such as the vehicle speed and acceleration of the front vehicles. Three different driving styles are first recognized based on an unsupervised clustering algorithm, namely, Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM). The GMM generates a specific driving style for each vehicle based on the speed, acceleration, jerk, time, and space headway features of the leading vehicle. The feature importance of driving style recognition is also evaluated based on the Maximal Information Coefficient (MIC) algorithm. Then, a personalized joint time series modeling (JTSM) method based on the Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) Recurrent Neural Network model (RNN) is proposed to predict the front vehicle trajectories. The JTSM contains a common LSTM layer and different fully connected regression layers for different driving styles. The proposed method is tested with the Next Generation Simulation (NGSIM) data on the US101, and I-80 highway dataset. The JTSM is tested for making predictions one to five seconds ahead. Results indicate that the proposed personalized JTSM approach shows a significant advantage over the baseline algorithms.

AB In this study, we will show how ocean surface wave displacement can be estimated from sensors onboard a subsurface moving autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV). The approach is to use a high-resolution vertical accelerometer along with a high-resolution pressure sensor mounted coincidently on an AUV. We apply this approach to data collected in summer 2005, in northeast Monterey Bay, CA, during an engineering experiment as a part of the Layered Organization in the Coastal Ocean (LOCO) program. The AUV used was the School for Marine Science and Technology, University of Massachusetts Dartmouth T-REMUS vehicle. Data were collected while the vehicle traveled at a constant speed 1.2 m/s and a constant depth of 10 m in water of depth 19.5 m. The local wind-generated surface wave field was relatively weak and dominated by surface wave swell of frequencies of 1/12 and 1/6 Hz, respectively. Surface waves of these frequencies in this depth of water have wavelengths of 150 and 55 m, respectively, both values being much larger than the length of the T-REMUS, which is 2 m. This condition, along with the fact that the AUV is moving over an order of magnitude slower than the phase speed associated with these surface waves, allows estimation of the frequency spectrum of surface waves by sensors onboard the AUV as well as interpretation of how the AUV responds to the surface wave field. From our estimation technique, we have confirmed that the two frequencies of 1/12 and 1/6 Hz were the dominant surface wave frequencies present and that the AUV-based estimated spectral values agreed very closely with in situ observations made by a fixed slow rise profiler located 200 m away. Pitch spectra indicated that the AUV responded to the higher frequency swell component of 1/6 Hz by adjusting its depth to try to follow the surface-wave-induced pressure. At the lower frequency, the AUV tended to follow the surface wave coherently.

AB Bridges are designed to withstand different types of loads, including dead, live, environmental, and occasional loads during their service period. Moving vehicles are the main source of the applied live load on bridges. The applied load to highway bridges depends on several traffic parameters such as weight of vehicles, axle load, configuration of axles, position of vehicles on the bridge, number of vehicles, direction, and vehicle's speed. The estimation of traffic loadings on bridges are generally notional and, consequently, can be excessively conservative. Hence, accurate prediction of the in-service performance of a bridge structure is very desirable and great savings can be achieved through the accurate assessment of the applied traffic load in existing bridges. In this paper, a review is conducted on conventional vehicle-based health monitoring methods used for bridges. Vision-based, weigh in motion (WIM), bridge weigh in motion (BWIM), drive-by and vehicle bridge interaction (VBI)-based models are the methods that are generally used in the structural health monitoring (SHM) of bridges. The performance of vehicle-assisted methods is studied and suggestions for future work in this area are addressed, including alleviating the downsides of each approach to disentangle the complexities, and adopting intelligent and autonomous vehicle-assisted methods for health monitoring of bridges.

AB With the advent of modern technologies, including the IoT and blockchain, smart-parking (SP) systems are becoming smarter and smarter. Similar to other automated systems, and particularly those that require automation or minimal interaction with humans, the SP system is heuristic in delivering performances, such as throughput in terms of latency, efficiency, privacy, and security, and it is considered a long-term cost-effective solution. This study looks ahead to future trends and developments in SP systems and presents an inclusive, long-term, effective, and well-performing smart autonomous vehicle parking (SAVP) system that explores and employs the emerging fog-computing and blockchain technologies as robust solutions to strengthen the existing collaborative IoT-cloud platform to build and manage SP systems for autonomous vehicles (AVs). In other words, the proposed SAVP system offers a smart-parking solution, both indoors and outdoors, and mainly for AVs looking for vacant parking, wherein the fog nodes act as a middleware layer that provides various parking operations closer to IoT-enabled edge devices. To address the challenges of privacy and security, a lightweight integrated blockchain and cryptography (LIBC) module is deployed, which is functional at each fog node, to authorize and grant access to the AVs in every phase of parking (e.g., from the parking entrance to the parking slot to the parking exit). A proof-of-concept implementation was conducted, wherein the overall computed results, such as the average response time, efficiency, privacy, and security, were examined as highly efficient to enable a proven SAVP system. This study also examined an innovative pace, with careful considerations to combatting the existing SP-system challenges and, therefore, to building and managing future scalable SP systems.

AB Object detection has been one of the most active topics in computer vision for the past years. Recent works have mainly focused on pushing the state-of-the-art in the general-purpose COCO benchmark. However, the use of such detection frameworks in specific applications such as autonomous driving is yet an area to be addressed. This study presents an enhanced 2D object detector based on Faster R CNN that is better suited for the context of autonomous vehicles. Two main aspects are improved: the anchor generation procedure and the performance drop in minority classes. The default uniform anchor configuration is not suitable in this scenario due to the perspective projection of the vehicle cameras. Therefore, we propose a perspective-aware methodology that divides the image into key regions via clustering and uses evolutionary algorithms to optimize the base anchors for each of them. Furthermore, we add a module that enhances the precision of the second-stage header network by including the spatial information of the candidate regions proposed in the first stage. We also explore different re weighting strategies to address the foreground-foreground class imbalance, showing that the use of a reduced version of focal loss can significantly improve the detection of difficult and underrepresented objects in two-stage detectors. Finally, we design an ensemble model to combine the strengths of the different learning strategies. Our proposal is evaluated with the Waymo Open Dataset, which is the most extensive and diverse up to date. The results demonstrate an average accuracy improvement of 6.13% mAP when using the best single model, and of 9.69% mAP with the ensemble. The proposed modifications over the Faster R-CNN do not increase computational cost and can easily be extended to optimize other anchor-based detection frameworks.

AB Recent developments in IoT have facilitated advancements in the Internet of Vehicles (IoV) with autonomous vehicles and roadside infrastructure as its key components. IoV aims to provide new innovative services for different modes of transport with adaptive traffic management and enables vehicles to broadcast messages to improve traffic safety and efficiency. However, due to nontrusted environments, it is difficult for vehicles to evaluate the credibility of the messages that they receive. Therefore, trust establishment in IoV is a key security concern that is constantly limited by scalability challenges. This article proposes a blockchain-based protocol for IoV using smart contracts, physical unclonable functions (PUFs), certificates, and a dynamic Proof-of-Work (dPoW) consensus algorithm. The blockchain, in conjunction with contracts, provides a secure framework for registering trusted vehicles and blocking malicious ones. PUFs are used to assign a unique identity to each vehicle via which trust is established. Certificates are issued by roadside units that preserve the privacy of vehicles, whereas the dPoW consensus allows the protocol to scale according to the incoming traffic generated by the vehicles. To demonstrate the feasibility and scalability of the proposed protocol, security and performance analyses are presented. A case study is also discussed along with a comparative analysis, which confirms that our protocol can provide superior decentralized trust management for IoV.

AB A stereo vision based three-dimensional (3D) ego-motion estimation system was proposed and tested to enable real-time navigation for a full-scale agricultural vehicle. A stereo camera was used to track features in image sequences which were then matched to obtain 3D point clouds that can be used for motion estimation. To overcome the challenges of uneven terrains, relative rotation and translation motions were taken into consideration by registering the point clouds using the iterative closest point algorithm. A smooth-motion constraint was employed to reduce estimation outliers, and a multi-frame estimation strategy was developed to limit estimation failures and error propagations. A series of field tests were conducted on different field surfaces. In a soybean field where the vehicle was driven for 2.5 km following a typical back-and-forth route, the maximum position estimation error was 5.12 m or 0.20%; while on a grass road, where available features were limited, the maximum error was 6.21 m, or 1.61%, for a driving distance of 386 m. To evaluate the estimation of heading angles using multiple frames, the vehicle was driven following a sine-wave route for 100 m; the root-mean-square error (RMSE) of heading angle was 1.43 degrees, which was much lower compared to a RMSE of 6.69 degrees obtained using consecutive frames for estimation. Finally, the vehicle was driven across a 0.24 m and a 0.1 m high bumps and an estimate of pitch angle and roll angle were obtained. An RMSE of 0.30 degrees was obtained for both angles, indicating its feasibility of navigating vehicles on uneven terrains. (C) 2014 IAgrE. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

SO PRESENCE-TELEOPERATORS AND VIRTUAL ENVIRONMENTS
LA English
DT Article
ID CONTROL STRATEGIES; SYSTEMS
AB Remotely operated vehicles (ROVs) are vehicular robotic systems that are teleoperated by a geographically separated user. Advances in computing technology have enabled ROV operators to manage multiple ROVs by means of supervisory control techniques. The challenge of incorporating telepresence in any one vehicle is replaced by the need to keep the human "in the loop" of the activities of all vehicles. An evaluation was conducted to compare the effects of automation level and decision-aid fidelity on the number of simulated remotely operated vehicles that could be successfully controlled by a single operator during a target acquisition task. The specific ROVs instantiated for the study were unmanned air vehicles (UAVS). Levels of automation (LOAs) included manual control, management-by-consent, and management-by-exception. Levels of decision-aid fidelity (100% correct and 95% correct) were achieved by intentionally injecting error into the decision-aiding capabilities of the simulation. Additionally, the number of UAVs to be controlled varied (one, two, and four vehicles). Twelve participants acted as UAV operators. A mixed-subject design was utilized (with decision-aid fidelity as the between-subjects factor), and participants were not informed of decision-aid fidelity prior to data collection. Dependent variables included mission efficiency, percentage correct detection of incorrect decision aids, workload and situation awareness ratings, and trust in automation ratings. Results indicate that an automation level incorporating management-by-consent had some clear performance advantages over the more autonomous (management-by-exception) and less autonomous (manual control) levels of automation. However, automation level interacted with the other factors for subjective measures of workload, situation awareness, and trust. Additionally, although a 3D perspective view of the mission scene was always available, it was used only during low-workload periods and did not appear to improve the operator's sense of presence. The implications for ROV interface design are discussed, and future research directions are proposed.

AB When a vehicle faces an imminent collision, it becomes imperative for intelligent vehicles to make emergency collision avoidance decisions in order to mitigate traffic accidents and reduce injuries. To address collision avoidance in emergency scenarios, this study proposes a model predictive decision-making (MPDM) approach that incorporates the consideration of lane-changing time. First, a simplified integrated longitudinal and lateral decision-making model is established, and its accuracy is validated through comparison with real vehicle data. Second, a mixed integer nonlinear MPDM is designed to optimize emergency collision avoidance decisions. Within this framework, the minimum lane-changing time for intelligent vehicles is analytically derived based on vehicle dynamics, taking into account varying speeds and adhesion coefficients. Third, by reducing the dimensionality of the lane-changing time optimization variables, an equivalent suboptimization problem is introduced, which consequently diminishes the computational complexity of solving the optimization problem. Finally, a comparative analysis was performed between the MPDM method and several alternative approaches, employing Simulink-SCANeR cosimulation. Furthermore, the MPDM method was validated on a real vehicle. The results obtained highlight a significant enhancement in the safety and stability of collision avoidance due to the MPDM.

AB PurposeDocking technology plays a crucial role in enabling long-duration operations of autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs). Visual positioning solutions alone are susceptible to abnormal drift values due to the challenging underwater optical imaging environment. When an AUV approaches the docking station, the absolute positioning method fails if the AUV captures an insufficient number of tracers. This study aims to to provide a more stable absolute position visual positioning method for underwater terminal visual docking.Design/methodology/approachThis paper presents a six-degree-of-freedom positioning method for AUV terminal visual docking, which uses lights and triangle codes. The authors use an extended Kalman filter to fuse the visual calculation results with inertial measurement unit data. Moreover, this paper proposes a triangle code recognition and positioning algorithm.FindingsThe authors conducted a simulation experiment to compare the underwater positioning performance of triangle codes, AprilTag and Aruco. The results demonstrate that the implemented triangular code reduces the running time by over 70% compared to the other two codes, and also exhibits a longer recognition distance in turbid environments. Subsequent experiments were carried out in Qingjiang Lake, Hubei Province, China, which further confirmed the effectiveness of the proposed positioning algorithm.Originality/valueThis fusion approach effectively mitigates abnormal drift errors stemming from visual positioning and cumulative errors resulting from inertial navigation. The authors also propose a triangle code recognition and positioning algorithm as a supplementary approach to overcome the limitations of tracer light positioning beacons.

AB With the development of autonomous vehicles, activities in the indoor spaces of autonomous vehicles are diversifying. Therefore, as the operating range of the interior parts increases, the occupant becomes sensitive to the operating noise of autonomous vehicles. Therefore, to reduce operating noise, it is necessary to analyze the causal relationship between the mechanical/electrical noise characteristics of the motor and sound quality. In this paper, we propose a methodology to analyze the relationship between the noise frequency components and the sound quality of small motors used in automobile interior parts. Two types of motors were selected for this study, and noise measurements and analyses were performed by applying the design proposed in this study. Subjective sound quality evaluations were conducted using the 12 pairs of adjectives extracted from the survey. The results suggest that subjective sound quality evaluation scores should be converted to Z-scores to ensure the reliability of the statistical analysis. In addition, we present a critical sound quality value that can be used as a criterion for determining whether the sound quality is positive (good quality) or negative (bad quality). Sound quality regression models explain the causal relationship between rotational frequency components of the motor and subjective sound quality characteristics. Thus, a method for analyzing the effect of the rotational frequency component of the motor on the sound quality is presented, which suggests that it can be used as basic research data to improve the noise performance of the motor.

AB Background This paper provides insight into the opportunity offered by shared autonomous vehicles (SAVs) to improve urban populations' spatial equity in accessibility. It provides a concrete implementation model for SAVs set to improve equity in accessibility and highlights the need of regulation in order for SAVs to help overcome identified spatial mismatches. Methodology Through the formulation of linear regression models, the relationship between land-use and transportation accessibility (by car and public transport) and socio-economic well-being indicators is tested on district-level in four European cities: Paris, Berlin, London and Vienna. Accessibility data is used to analyse access to points of interest within given timespans by both car and public transport. To measure equity in socio-economic well-being, three district-level proxies are introduced: yearly income, unemployment rate and educational attainment. Results In the cities of Paris, London and Vienna, as well as partially in Berlin, positive effects of educational attainment on accessibility are evidenced. Further, positive effects on accessibility by yearly income are found in Paris and London. Additionally, negative effects of an increased unemployment rate on accessibility are observed in Paris and Vienna. Through the comparison between accessibility by car and public transportation in the districts of the four cities, the potential for SAVs is evidenced. Lastly, on the basis of the findings a 'SAV identification matrix' is created, visualizing the underserved districts in each of the four cities and the need of equity enhancing policy for the introduction of SAVs is emphasized.

AB The ethical dilemma (ED) of whether autonomous vehicles (AVs) should protect the passengers or pedestrians when harm is unavoidable has been widely researched and debated. Several behavioral scientists have sought public opinion on this issue, based on the premise that EDs are critical to resolve for AV adoption. However, many scholars and industry participants have downplayed the importance of these edge cases. Policy makers also advocate a focus on higher level ethical principles rather than on a specific solution to EDs. But conspicuously absent from this debate is the view of the consumers or potential adopters, who will be instrumental to the success of AVs. The current research investigated this issue both from a theoretical standpoint and through empirical research. The literature on innovation adoption and risk perception suggests that EDs will be heavily weighted by potential adopters of AVs. Two studies conducted with a broad sample of consumers verified this assertion. The results from these studies showed that people associated EDs with the highest risk and considered EDs as the most important issue to address as compared to the other technical, legal and ethical issues facing AVs. As such, EDs need to be addressed to ensure robustness in the design of AVs and to assure consumers of the safety of this promising technology. Some preliminary evidence is provided about interventions to resolve the social dilemma in EDs and about the ethical preferences of prospective early adopters of AVs.

AB Traffic light recognition (TLR) detects the traffic light from an image and then estimates the state of the light signal. TLR is important for autonomous vehicles because running against a red light could cause a deadly car accident. For a practical TLR system, computation time, varying illumination conditions, and false positives are three key challenges. In this paper, a novel real-time method is proposed to recognize a traffic light with high dynamic imaging and deep learning. In our approach, traffic light candidates are robustly detected from low exposure/dark frames and accurately classified using a deep neural network in consecutive high exposure/bright frames. This dual-channel mechanism can make full use of undistorted color and shape information in dark frames as well as the rich context in bright frames. In the dark channel, a non-parametric multi-color saliency model is proposed to simultaneously extract lights with different colors. A multiclass classifier with convolutional neural network (CNN) model is then adopted to reduce the number of false positives in the bright channel. The performance is further boosted by incorporating temporal trajectory tracking. In order to speed up the algorithm, a prior detection mask is generated to limit the potential search regions. Intensive experiments on a large dual-channel dataset show that the proposed approach outperforms the state-of-the-art real-time deep learning object detector, which could cause more false positives because it uses bright images only. The algorithm has been integrated into our autonomous vehicle and can work robustly on real roads.

ID SERVICE
AB The extension of planning tools to consider the impact of new technologies and mobility trends, such as ride-hailing (RH) and connected autonomous vehicles (CAVs), is a pressing need among transportation planners and decision-makers. This paper discusses the incorporation of empty (zero-occupancy) trips attributable to RH and CAVs into a four-step planning model. We estimate RH empty trips using an exogenous constant-multiplier. For CAVs, we consider the vehicle miles traveled (VMT) generated by empty "return home" and "park elsewhere" trips. The "return home" and "park elsewhere" trip fractions are determined using a binary choice model based on distance to home and average parking cost at the destination zone. Parking location choice is modeled using a logit approach that considers parking costs and distance to parking location. The methods developed in this work are incorporated into a model of the Dallas-Fort Worth region, U.S., that was previously extended to account for RH and CAVs. Results suggest that, for a 40% penetration of CAVs and a 4% mode share by RH, empty trips add 22 million VMT and have significant impacts on vehicle hours traveled and traffic congestion. While results depend on modeling assumptions, our experiment illustrates the value of extended models in understanding the implications of policies such as parking costs and limiting the movement of empty vehicles. The four-step process is still the primary tool used for long-term planning, making our proposed modeling approach a feasible option for planning organizations to consider.

AB Every urban environment contains a rich set of dominant surfaces which can provide a solid foundation for visual odometry estimation. In this work visual odometry is robustly estimated by computing the motion of camera mounted on a vehicle. The proposed method first identifies a planar region and dynamically estimates the plane parameters. The candidate region and estimated plane parameters are then tracked in the subsequent images and an incremental update of the visual odometry is obtained. The proposed method is evaluated on a navigation dataset of stereo images taken by a car mounted camera that is driven in a large urban environment. The consistency and resilience of the method has also been evaluated on an indoor robot dataset. The results suggest that the proposed visual odometry estimation can robustly recover the motion by tracking a dominant planar surface in the Manhattan environment. In addition to motion estimation solution a set of strategies are discussed for mitigating the problematic factors arising from the unpredictable nature of the environment. The analyses of the results as well as dynamic environmental strategies indicate a strong potential of the method for being part of an autonomous or semi-autonomous system.

AB The vehicle dynamics simulation and preview control require a dedicated vehicle model, such as multibody dynamics model. However, the multibody model has higher computational complexity which affects the response time of the vehicle controller. This issue can be alleviated by using a data-driven vehicle dynamics model due to its effective generalization and computational speed. In this work, we propose a data driven modeling approach based on deep neural networks (DNNs) for computing and predicting the vehicle characteristics. The high-fidelity simulations of a validated vehicle multibody model are performed for data acquisition. This data is then used for training and testing the proposed model. The DNN inputs comprise the initial speed of the vehicle and the torque applied on front wheels to imitate vehicle acceleration and deceleration. The DNN outputs comprise the driving distance and the longitudinal velocity of the vehicle. The dynamics characteristics resulting from both the data-driven model and the multibody model are investigated and compared. Furthermore, the accuracy of the data-driven model is analyzed in terms of various error functions. The data-driven model is verified by using the results obtained from a commercial software package. The simulation results show that the data-driven vehicle model predicts the accurate velocity and driving distance in real-time. The data-driven model can be used for real-time simulation and preview control in autonomous vehicles.

AB In recent years, autonomous vehicles (AVs), which observe the driving environment and lead a few or all of the driving tasks, have garnered tremendous success. The field of AVs has been rapidly developing and has found many applications. As a safety requirement established by policymakers, these vehicles must be evaluated before their deployment. The evaluation process for AVs is challenging because crashes are rare events, and AVs can escape passing predefined test scenarios. Therefore, capturing crashes and creating real test scenarios should be considered in order to develop an evaluation approach that represents real-world scenarios. One evaluation approach is based on the naturalistic field operational test (N-FOT), in which prototype AVs are driven on roads by volunteers or test engineers. Unfortunately, this approach is time-consuming and costly because thousands of miles need to be driven to experience a police-reported collision and nearly millions of miles for a fatal crash. Another approach is the accelerated evaluation method. The core idea of the accelerated evaluation approach is to modify the statistics of naturalistic driving so that safety-critical events are emphasized. This paper presents a brief survey of the advances that have occurred in the area of the evaluation of partially or fully autonomous vehicles, starting with naturalistic field operational tests (N-FOTs). The review covers the test matrix evaluation, worst-case scenario evaluation (WCSE), Monte Carlo simulations, and accelerated evaluation (AE). We also present all the simulation-based and agent-based modeling approaches that do not follow any evaluation protocol listed above. This study provides a scientific analysis of each evaluation techniques, focusing on their advantages/disadvantages, inherent restrictions, practicability, and optimality. The results reveal that the accelerated evaluation approach outperforms naturalistic field operational tests (N-FOTs), test matrix evaluation, worst-case scenario evaluation (WCSE), and Monte Carlo simulation methods in some of the car-following and lane-change studies when using specific models. Moreover, the agent-based model and augmented and virtual reality approaches show promising results in AV evaluation. Furthermore, integrating machine and deep learning into the available AV evaluation methods can improve their performance and generate encouraging outcomes.

AB In the last couple of years, academia-industry collaboration has demonstrated rapid advancements in the development of self-driving vehicles. Since it is evident that self-driving vehicles are going to reshape the traditional transportation systems in near future through enhancement in safe and smart mobility, motion control in self-driving vehicles while performing driving tasks in a dynamic road environment is still a challenging task. In this regard, we present a comprehensive study considering the evolution of steering control methods for self-driving vehicles. Initially, we discussed an insight into the traditional steering systems of the vehicles. To the best of our knowledge, currently, there is no taxonomy available, which elaborates steering control methods for self-driving vehicles. In this paper, we present a novel taxonomy including different steering control methods which are categorized into deterministic and heuristic steering control methods. Concurrently, the abovementioned techniques are critically reviewed elaborating their strengths and limitations. Based on the analysis, key challenges/research gaps in existing steering control methods along with the possible solutions have been briefly discussed to improve the effectiveness of the steering system of self-driving vehicles.

AB Compared to existing human-driven vehicles (HDVs), connected and autonomous vehicles (CAVs) offer users the potential for reduced value of time, enhanced quality of travel experience, and seamless situational awareness and connectivity. Hence, CAV users can differ in their route choice behavior compared to HDV users, leading to mixed traffic flows that can significantly deviate from the single-class HDV traffic pattern. However, due to the lack of quantitative models, there is limited knowledge on the evolution of mixed traffic flows in a traffic network. To partly bridge this gap, this study proposes a multiclass traffic assignment model, where HDV users and CAV users follow different route choice principles, characterized by the cross-nested logit (CNL) model and user equilibrium (UE) model, respectively. The CNL model captures HDV users' uncertainty associated with limited knowledge of traffic conditions while overcoming the route overlap issue of logit-based stochastic user equilibrium. The UE model characterizes the CAV's capability for acquiring accurate information on traffic conditions. In addition, the multiclass model can capture the characteristics of mixed traffic flow such as the difference in value of time between HDVs and CAVs and the asymmetry in their driving interactions, thereby enhancing behavioral realism in the modeling. The study develops a new solution algorithm labeled RSRS-MSRA, in which a route-swapping based strategy is embedded with a self-regulated step size choice technique, to solve the proposed model efficiently. Sensitivity analysis of the proposed model is performed to gain insights into the effects of perturbations on the mixed traffic equilibrium, which facilitates the estimation of equilibrium traffic flow and identification of critical elements under expected or unexpected events. The study results can assist transportation decision-makers to design effective planning and operational strategies to leverage the advantages of CAVs and manage traffic congestion under mixed traffic flows.

AB Managing all the mobility and transportation services with autonomous vehicles for users of a smart city requires determining the assignment of the vehicles to the users and their routing in conjunction with their speed. Such decisions must ensure low emission, efficiency, and high service quality by also considering the impact on traffic congestion caused by other vehicles in the transportation network. In this paper, we first propose an abstract trilevel multi-objective formulation architecture to model all vehicle routing problems with assignment, routing, and speed decision variables and conflicting objective functions. Such an architecture guides the development of subproblems, relaxations, and solution methods. We also propose a way of integrating the various urban transportation services by introducing a constraint on the speed variables that takes into account the traffic volume caused across the different services. Based on the formulation architecture, we introduce a (bilevel) problem where assignment and routing are at the upper level and speed is at the lower level. To address the challenge of dealing with routing problems on urban road networks, we develop an algorithm that alternates between the assignment-routing problem on an auxiliary complete graph and the speed optimization problem on the original non-complete graph. The computational experiments show the effectiveness of the proposed approach in determining approximate Pareto fronts among the conflicting objectives.

TI Addressing the "minimum parking" problem for on-demand mobility
SO SCIENTIFIC REPORTS

   IMPACT; POLICY
AB Parking infrastructure is pervasive and occupies large swaths of land in cities. However, on-demand (OD) mobility has started reducing parking needs in urban areas around the world. This trend is expected to grow significantly with the advent of autonomous driving, which might render on-demand mobility predominant. Recent studies have started looking at expected parking reductions with on-demand mobility, but a systematic framework is still lacking. In this paper, we apply a data-driven methodology based on shareability networks to address what we call the "minimum parking" problem: what is the minimum parking infrastructure needed in a city for given on-demand mobility needs? While solving the problem, we also identify a critical tradeoff between two public policy goals: less parking means increased vehicle travel from deadheading between trips. By applying our methodology to the city of Singapore we discover that parking infrastructure reduction of up to 86% is possible, but at the expense of a 24% increase in traffic measured as vehicle kilometers travelled (VKT). However, a more modest 57% reduction in parking is achievable with only a 1.3% increase in VKT. We find that the tradeoff between parking and traffic obeys an inverse exponential law which is invariant with the size of the vehicle fleet. Finally, we analyze parking requirements due to passenger pick-ups and show that increasing convenience produces a substantial increase in parking for passenger pickup/dropoff. The above findings can inform policy-makers, mobility operators, and society at large on the tradeoffs required in the transition towards pervasive on-demand mobility.

TI An autonomous tracked vehicle with omnidirectional sensing
SO JOURNAL OF ROBOTIC SYSTEMS
LA English
DT Article
AB Operation of an autonomous vehicle along a marked path, in an obstacle-laden environment, requires path detection, relative position detection and control, and obstacle detection and avoidance. The design solution of the team from the U.S. Military Academy is a tracked vehicle operating open-loop in response to position information from an omnidirectional mirror, and to obstacle-detection input from the mirror and from a scanning laser. The use of a tracked rather than a wheeled vehicle is the team's open-loop solution to the problem of wheeled-vehicle slippage on wet and sandy surfaces. The vehicleresponds to sensor information from (1) a digital camera-mounted parabolic omnidirectional mirror for visual inputs and (2) a scanning laser for detecting obstacles in relief. Raw sensor data is converted synchronously into a global virtual context, which places the vehicle's center at the origin of a 2-D Cartesian coordinate system. A four-phase process is used to convert the camera's inputs into the data structures needed to reason about the vehicle's position relative to the course. Development of the path plan proceeds incrementally, using a space-sweeping algorithm to identify safe paths along waypoints within the course boundaries. An attempt is made to minimize translation errors by favoring paths which exhibit fewer sharp turns. Integration of Intel's OpenCV computer vision library and the Independent JPEG Group's JPEG library allow for very good encapsulation of the low-level functions needed to do most of the image processing. Ada95 is the language of choice for the majority of the team-developed software, except where needed to interface to motors and sensors. Use of an object-oriented high-level language has been invaluable in leveraging the efforts of previous years' development activities, and for maximizing the ability to log or otherwise respond to anomalous behavior.

The knowledge base uses a memory-efficient hybrid structure combining octree and standard three-dimensional maps. Essential elements including terrain, obstacles, and atmospheric conditions are mapped in 3D through layers grafted onto the octree structure. The knowledge base also integrates the capability of adding user-defined layers to represent mission-dependent features such as radar exposure or communication link intensity.

AB The literature on autonomous vehicle (AV) acceptance highlights the significance of hedonic motivation in AV adoption. Numerous studies empirically confirm hedonic motivation as either the most or one of the most influential factors in the acceptance of AV. This fact calls for a need to achieve a wider understanding of the potential AV users' perceived enjoyment (i.e., hedonic motivation). To this end, this study investigates the antecedents of hedonic motivation in the AV technology acceptance domain. The partial least square structural equations modeling approach was applied to analyze the data collected from 1823 respondents from 11 countries via an online survey. The developed hypotheses are examined for the entire sample, as well as separately for the Global North (GN) countries' sample, Global South (GS) countries' sample, and each individual country through a cross-country analysis. The results for the entire sample indicate that social influence is the strongest predictor of hedonic motivation, consistent with the findings of the GN sample. However, in the GS sample, self-efficacy emerges as the strongest predictor of hedonic motivation. Perceived safety is the second strongest predictor of hedonic motivation for both the GN and GS samples, highlighting its importance in relation to the perceived enjoyment of PAV. Trust does not significantly contribute to hedonic motivation, while the enjoyment of driving conventional cars has a small negative impact on hedonic motivation in the GS sample. The cross-country analysis reveals general patterns in the findings of the GN and GS samples, while highlighting a few exceptions. The results of the multi-group moderation analysis highlight the significant impact of the respondents' geographical distribution (GN vs GS) on their perceived enjoyment of PAV. Additionally, the analysis indicates that female respondents who enjoy driving conventional cars are less likely to perceive PAV as enjoyable compared to male participants who enjoy driving conventional cars.

AB This article addresses the distributed formation control of multiple under-actuated autonomous surface vehicles (ASVs) in a receding-horizon setting. The ASVs are subject to physical constraints, in addition to stationary and moving obstacles. A barrier-certified distributed model predictive control method is proposed with the capability of avoiding collision with stationary and moving obstacles and neighboring ASVs. Specifically, a data-driven neural predictor is used to learn unknown functions in ASV kinetics. A nominal distributed receding-horizon position control law is developed based on the learned unknown function to achieve the desired formation within physical constraints. To ensure the safety requirement, a barrier-certified control law is designed based on control barrier functions to generate the signals of optimal surge force and heading angle within the safety constraints. A receding-horizon heading control law is designed based on the data-driven neural predictor to track the desired heading signals. Constrained quadratic programming problems are formulated based on barrier functions for barrier-certified distributed formation control and solved via neurodynamic optimization using one-layer recurrent neural networks. Thus, the proposed control method is able to ensure obstacle avoidance in the formation control of multiple ASVs in the presence of stationary and moving obstacles. Simulation results are elaborated to validate the efficacy of the proposed barrier-certified distributed model predictive control method for ASV formation.

AB In this article, a novel adaptive generalized super-twisting algorithm (GSTA) is proposed for a class of systems whose perturbations and uncertain control coefficients may depend on both time and state. The proposed approach uses dynamically adapted control gains, and it is proven that this ensures global finite-time convergence. A nonsmooth strict Lyapunov function is used to obtain the conditions for global finite-time stability. A simulation and experimental case study is performed using an articulated intervention autonomous underwater vehicle (AIAUV). It is also shown that the adaptive GSTA causes the tracking errors of the AIAUV to converge to zero in finite time. In the case study, we use the singularity-robust multiple task-priority method to create a continuous trajectory for the AIAUV to follow. The simulation and experimental results validate and verify that the proposed approach is well suited for controlling an AIAUV. We also perform a comparison with the super-twisting algorithm with adaptive gains and the original GSTA to evaluate whether adding adaptive gains to the GSTA actually improves the tracking capabilities by combining the theoretical advantages afforded by the GSTA with the practical advantages afforded by adaptive gains. Based on this comparison, the adaptive GSTA yields the best tracking results overall without increasing the energy consumption, and the simulations and experiments thus indicate that adding adaptive gains to the GSTA does indeed improve the consequent tracking results and capabilities.

AB Real-time Internet of Things (IoT) applications have stringent delay requirements when implemented over distributed sensing and communication networks in smart traffic control. They require the system to reach a permissible neighbourhood of an optimum solution with a tolerable delay. The performance of such applications mostly depends on the delay introduced by the underlying optimization algorithms, with the localized computational capability. In this paper, we study a smart traffic control scenario-a real-time IoT application, where a group of autonomous vehicles independently decide on their lane velocities, in collaboration with road-side units to efficiently utilize intersections with minimal environmental impact. We decompose this problem as an unconstrained network utility maximization problem. A consensus-based, constant step-size gradient descent algorithm is proposed to obtain a near-optimal solution. We analyze the delay-accuracy tradeoff in reaching a near-optimal velocity. Delay is measured in terms of the number of iterations required before the scheduling operation can be done for a particular tolerance. The operation of the algorithm under quantized message passing is also studied. On contrary to the existing methods to intersection management problems, our approach studies the limit at which an optimization algorithm fails to cater for the requirements of a real-time application and must fall back for a pareto-optimal solution, due to the communication constraints. We used simulation of urban mobility to incorporate the microscopic behavior of traffic flows to our simulations and compared our solution with traditional and state-of-the-art intersection management techniques.

AB In this work, we propose a compositional data-driven approach for the formal estimation of collision risks for autonomous vehicles (AVs) with black-box dynamics while acting in a stochastic multi-agent framework. The proposed approach is based on the construction of sub-barrier certificates for each stochastic agent via a set of data collected from its trajectories while providing an a priori guaranteed confidence on the data-driven estimation. In our proposed setting, we first cast the original collision risk problem for each agent as a robust optimization program (ROP). Solving the acquired ROP is not tractable due to an unknown model that appears in one of its constraints. To tackle this difficulty, we collect finite numbers of data from trajectories of each agent and provide a scenario optimization program (SOP) corresponding to the original ROP. We then establish a probabilistic bridge between the optimal value of SOP and that of ROP, and accordingly, we formally construct a sub-barrier certificate for each unknown agent based on the number of data and a required level of confidence. We then propose a compositional technique based on small-gain reasoning to quantify the collision risk for multi-agent AVs with some desirable confidence based on sub-barrier certificates of individual agents constructed from data. For the case that the proposed compositionality conditions are not satisfied, we provide a relaxed version of compositional results without requiring any compositionality conditions but at the cost of providing a potentially conservative collision risk. Eventually, we also present our approaches for non-stochastic multi-agent AVs. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed results by applying them to a vehicle platooning consisting of 100 vehicles with 1 leader and 99 followers. We formally estimate the collision risk for the whole network by collecting sampled data from trajectories of each agent.

AB Introduction: The operation of autonomous vehicles (AVs) on public roadways affects the safety of vulnerable roadway users, such as pedestrians and bicyclists. This research contributes to the literature by investigating vulnerable roadway users' safety perceptions on road sharing with AVs.Method: This study analyzed the survey responses of pedestrians and bicyclists in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, collected by Bike Pittsburgh (Bike PGH) in 2017 and 2019. First, this study investigates how pedestrians and bicyclists perceive safety regarding road sharing with AVs. Second, the study examines how the safety perceptions of pedestrians and bicyclists regarding AVs might be changing over time. Non-parametric tests were applied to compare the safety perceptions of pedestrians and bicyclists across different characteristics, experiences, and attitudes, considering the ordinal nature of the AV safety perception data. An ordered probit model was estimated to better understand the factors influencing safety perceptions regarding road sharing with AVs.Results: The study findings suggest that higher exposures to AVs are associated with improved safety perceptions. In addition, respondents with a stricter attitude toward AV regulations perceive road sharing with AVs as less safe. Respondents whose opinion regarding AVs did not worsen due to the pedestrian/bicyclist involved AV accident in Arizona have higher safety perceptions. Practical Applications: Policymakers can use the findings of this study in developing guidelines to ensure safe road sharing and develop strategies to sustain active transportation usage in the future AV era.& COPY; 2023 National Safety Council and Elsevier Ltd.

AB As one of the main elements of reinforcement learning, the design of the reward function is often not given enough attention when reinforcement learning is used in concrete applications, which leads to unsatisfactory performances. In this study, a reward function matrix is proposed for training various decision-making modes with emphasis on decision-making styles and further emphasis on incentives and punishments. Additionally, we model a traffic scene via graph model to better represent the interaction between vehicles, and adopt the graph convolutional network (GCN) to extract the features of the graph structure to help the connected autonomous vehicles perform decision-making directly. Furthermore, we combine GCN with deep Q-learning and multi-step double deep Q-learning to train four decision-making modes, which are named the graph convolutional deep Q-network (GQN) and the multi-step double graph convolutional deep Q-network (MDGQN). In the simulation, the superiority of the reward function matrix is proved by comparing it with the baseline, and evaluation metrics are proposed to verify the performance differences among decision-making modes. Results show that the trained decision-making modes can satisfy various driving requirements, including task completion rate, safety requirements, comfort level, and completion efficiency, by adjusting the weight values in the reward function matrix. Finally, the decision-making modes trained by MDGQN had better performance in an uncertain highway exit scene than those trained by GQN.

AB This article studies the joint localization and tracking issue for the autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV), with the constraints of asynchronous time clock in cyberchannels and model uncertainty in physical channels. More specifically, we develop a reinforcement learning (RL)-based asynchronous localization algorithm to localize the position of AUV, where the time clock of AUV is not required to be well synchronized with the real time. Based on the estimated position, a scalable sampling strategy called multivariate probabilistic collocation method with orthogonal fractional factorial design (M-PCM-OFFD) is employed to evaluate the time-varying uncertain model parameters of AUV. After that, an RL-based tracking controller is designed to drive AUV to the desired target point. Besides that, the performance analyses for the integration solution are also presented. Of note, the advantages of our solution are highlighted as: 1) the RL-based localization algorithm can avoid local optimal in traditional least-square methods; 2) the M-PCM-OFFD-based sampling strategy can address the model uncertainty and reduce the computational cost; and 3) the integration design of localization and tracking can reduce the communication energy consumption. Finally, simulation and experiment demonstrate that the proposed localization algorithm can effectively eliminate the impact of asynchronous clock, and more importantly, the integration of M-PCM-OFFD in the RL-based tracking controller can find accurate optimization solutions with limited computational costs.

AB 3D Object detection is a critical mission of the perception system of a self-driving vehicle. Existing bounding box-based methods are hard to train due to the need to remove duplicated detections in the post-processing stage. In this paper, we propose a center point-based deep neural network (DNN) architecture named RCBi-CenterNet that predicts the absolute pose for each detected object in the 3D world space. RCBi-CenterNet is composed of a recursive composite network with a dual-backbone feature extractor and a bi-directional feature pyramid network (BiFPN) for cross-scale feature fusion. In the detection head, we predict a confidence heatmap that is used to determine the position of detected objects. The other pose information, including depth and orientation, is regressed. We conducted extensive experiments on the Peking University/Baidu-Autonomous Driving dataset, which contains more than 60,000 labeled 3D vehicle instances from 5277 real-world images, and each vehicle object is annotated with the absolute pose described by the six degrees of freedom (6DOF). We validated the design choices of various data augmentation methods and the backbone options. Through an ablation study and an overall comparison with the state-of-the-art (SOTA), namely CenterNet, we showed that the proposed RCBi-CenterNet presents performance gains of 2.16%, 2.76%, and 5.24% in Top 1, Top 3, and Top 10 mean average precision (mAP). The model and the result could serve as a credible benchmark for future research in center point-based object detection.

AB There exist some problems when the fractal feature method is applied to identify thruster faults for autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs). Sometimes it could not identify the thruster fault, or the identification error is large, even the identification results are not consistent for the repeated experiments. The paper analyzes the reasons resulting in these above problems according to the experiments on AUV prototype with thruster faults. On the basis of these analyses, in order to overcome the above deficiency, an improved fractal feature integrated with wavelet decomposition identification method is proposed for AUV with thruster fault. Different from the fractal feature method where the signal extraction and fault identification are completed in the time domain, the paper makes use of the time-domain and frequent-domain information to identify thruster faults. In the paper, the thruster fault could be mapped multisource and described redundantly by the fault feature matrix constructed based on the time-domain and frequent-domain information. In the process of identification, different from the fractal feature method where the fault is identified based on fault identification model, the fault sample bank is built at first in the paper, and then pattern recognition is achieved by calculating the relative coefficients between the constructed fault feature matrix and the elements in the fault sample bank. Finally, the online pool experiments are performed on an AUV prototype, and the effectiveness of the proposed method is demonstrated in comparison with the fractal feature method.

TI Worst-case traffic assignment model for mixed traffic flow of
   human-driven vehicles and connected and autonomous vehicles by factoring
   in the uncertain link capacity

AB Connected and autonomous vehicles (CAVs) can form platoons to reduce the time headway and improve the link capacity. However, in a mixed traffic flow environment where both human driven vehicles (HDVs) and CAVs exist, the platoon intensity is significantly impacted by the stochastic order of the HDVs and CAVs (i.e., the fleet sequence). Therefore, the link capacity involves a large uncertainty even under the same HDV and CAV flow. This uncertain link capacity can cause a large variation in network flow. In the literature, traffic assignment models for mixed traffic flows of HDVs and CAVs are developed based on expected link capacity models, in which the computed link capacity is deterministic for given HDV and CAV flows. These models ignore the impacts of uncertain link capacity on the network performance and network flow distribution, which can dramatically reduce the effectiveness of the corresponding planning strategies. To address this problem, this study proposes a worst-case mixed traffic assignment model. It aims to compute the worst network performance and corresponding equilibrium flow that may occur due to uncertain link capacity. The worst-case mixed traffic assignment is formulated as a bilevel programming problem, where the low-level problem is a variational inequality problem presented to compute the equilibrium results based on a fixed link capacity while the upper-level problem is to find the optimal input for all link capacities within their ranges to minimize the network performance. The partition-based norm relaxed method of the feasible direction solution algorithm is proposed to solve the bilevel worst-case mixed traffic assignment problem. A numerical application shows that the uncertain link capacity has drastic effects on the network flows and network performance, and the proposed algorithm can effectively and efficiently solve the bilevel worst-case mixed traffic assignment problem to compute the worst-case network equilibrium flows and network performance. These results can help traffic managers design robust planning strategies to ensure a minimum level of network performance under the impacts of uncertain link capacity.

TI Spatial Attention Frustum: A 3D Object Detection Method Focusing on
   Occluded Objects

ID DEPTH
AB Achieving the accurate perception of occluded objects for autonomous vehicles is a challenging problem. Human vision can always quickly locate important object regions in complex external scenes, while other regions are only roughly analysed or ignored, defined as the visual attention mechanism. However, the perception system of autonomous vehicles cannot know which part of the point cloud is in the region of interest. Therefore, it is meaningful to explore how to use the visual attention mechanism in the perception system of autonomous driving. In this paper, we propose the model of the spatial attention frustum to solve object occlusion in 3D object detection. The spatial attention frustum can suppress unimportant features and allocate limited neural computing resources to critical parts of the scene, thereby providing greater relevance and easier processing for higher-level perceptual reasoning tasks. To ensure that our method maintains good reasoning ability when faced with occluded objects with only a partial structure, we propose a local feature aggregation module to capture more complex local features of the point cloud. Finally, we discuss the projection constraint relationship between the 3D bounding box and the 2D bounding box and propose a joint anchor box projection loss function, which will help to improve the overall performance of our method. The results of the KITTI dataset show that our proposed method can effectively improve the detection accuracy of occluded objects. Our method achieves 89.46%, 79.91% and 75.53% detection accuracy in the easy, moderate, and hard difficulty levels of the car category, and achieves a 6.97% performance improvement especially in the hard category with a high degree of occlusion. Our one-stage method does not need to rely on another refining stage, comparable to the accuracy of the two-stage method.

AB The future implementation of Autonomous Vehicles (AVs) in cities can have significant impacts, both positive and negative, on their sustainability. The objective of this research is to investigate those impacts and evaluate which policies could be most effective in achieving the desired city scenario through a backcasting planning methodology. To this end, a survey among experts was carried out in which they expressed their opinions on the potential consequences of AVs in cities and on the effectiveness of various policy packages focused on achieving a more sustainable mobility and land use planning. The results obtained show that the experts consulted were sceptical about the positive impacts of AVs, arguing that they could induce an increase in car trips and urban sprawl. The policies that could be most effective in mitigating these effects, leading to a city more aligned with the planned objectives would be: to strengthen active (foot, bicycle) and public transport modes, to restrict access of motorised modes to central urban areas and to use freed spaces for alternative modes of transport, green areas and public facilities. A cluster analysis also showed that most of the experts consulted considered that the policy packages presented could be effective or very effective in reaching the most desirable scenario. Therefore, it is important that the implementation of AVs does not subordinate to, but enhances, the sustainable mobility and land use policies already being developed in many urban areas.

AB Providing quality transit service to travelers in low-density areas, particularly travelers without personal vehicles, is a constant challenge for transit agencies. The advent of fully-autonomous vehicles (AVs) and their inclusion in mobility service fleets may allow transit agencies to offer better service and/or reduce their own capital and operational costs. This study focuses on the problem of allocating resources between transit patterns and operating (or subsidizing) shared-use AV mobility services (SAMSs) in a large metropolitan area. To address this question, a joint transit network redesign and SAMS fleet size determination problem (JTNR-SFSDP) is introduced, and a bi-level mathematical programming formulation and solution approach are presented. The upper-level problem modifies a transit network frequency setting problem (TNFSP) formulation via incorporating SAMS fleet size as a decision variable and allowing the removal of bus routes. The lower-level problem consists of a dynamic combined mode choice-traveler assignment problem (DCMC-TAP) formulation. The heuristic solution procedure involves solving the upper-level problem using a nonlinear programming solver and solving the lower-level problem using an iterative agent-based assignment-simulation approach. To illustrate the effectiveness of the modeling framework, this study uses traveler demand from Chicago along with the regions existing multimodal transit network. The computational results indicate significant traveler benefits, in terms of improved average traveler wait times, associated with optimizing the joint design of multimodal transit networks and SAMS fleets compared with the initial transit network design.

AB A robust leader-slave cooperative navigation (CN) algorithm for autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) based on the Student's t extended Kalman filter (SEKF) is proposed. Compared with the conventional EKF based on a Gaussian distributed noise assumption, which has been widely used in the field of CN, the Student's t-based filtering algorithms show an improved robustness against outliers existing in the process and measurement noises. The utilization of the Student's t distribution can minimize the negative effect induced by the outliers existing in the underwater acoustic communication system and the cheap but unreliable dead reckoning sensors equipped on the slave AUVs. After a detailed derivation of the robust CN algorithm based on the SEKF, two approximation methods that are required in the Student's t-based filter are discussed and compared. Simulation results show the efficiency and superiority of the robust SEKF-based leader-slave CN algorithm as compared with the conventional EKF-based CN algorithm. The validity of the proposed CN algorithm is also evaluated on field trial data, and the performance of different degrees of freedom (DOF) values, which determine the tail behavior of the Student's t distribution is compared and analyzed, and then the link between the DOF value and the robust effect of the Student's t distribution is revealed, which will act as a guide when applying the Student's t-based filter in the field of CN.

AB Road traffic accidents have been on the rise worldwide, leading to significant economic and societal costs. According to the World Health Organization, over 1.3 million people die annually due to road traffic accidents, and 50 million people are injured. The economic cost of road collisions is estimated to be between 2% and 7% of the global Gross Domestic Product. One of the potential remedies to revolutionize road safety and transform the transportation landscape is the integration of autonomous features in passenger cars. Self-driving cars can process vast amounts of data in real-time using sensors, cameras, and algorithms to detect and avoid potential hazards on the road.
   The selection of a passenger car to purchase is a complex decision-making problem that is influenced by various factors. The introduction of electric and autonomous vehicles extends the considered decision criteria even further. A sustainable assessment of autonomous cars requires a range of scientific research tools and methodologies. Multi-Criteria Decision Analysis (MCDA) is a powerful research tool in this domain as it allows evaluation considering multiple factors and criteria, including environmental impacts, economic costs, and social benefits. However, many MCDA methods are susceptible to the linear compensation effect. While linear compensation can be useful for decision-making, it may not be consistent with the strong sustainability paradigm that seeks to balance economic, social, and environmental considerations equally.
   The paper presents several important contributions to the field of MCDA and sustainability assessment of passenger cars with autonomous features. Firstly, the paper introduces the TOSS method (TOPSIS with Strong Sustainability), an extension of the Technique for Order Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution method, which supports the strong sustainability paradigm. Secondly, the paper constructs a multi-criteria decision model for sustainable assessment and selection of a passenger car with autonomous features, which avoids the limitations of linear compensation. Thirdly, the paper verifies the robustness of the produced rankings to ensure that the method is reliable and consistent. Finally, the paper benchmarks the TOSS method.

AB In this study, we propose a lane-changing conflict management model based on game theory for automated vehicles. When a vehicle plans to change to the adjacent lane, and if there is a closely following vehicle on that lane, the following vehicle must sacrifice its speed to make space for the lane-changing vehicle, which means there are conflicts of interest between two vehicles. So far, there is no clear answer if the following vehicle should make space for the lane-changing vehicle. These individualistic lane-changing models may lead to suboptimal traffic flow or even traffic safety issues. To solve this problem, this study designed a model based on game theory to solve lane-changing conflicts between the lane-changing vehicle and the following vehicle in the target lane. When the two vehicles enter a lane-changing conflict, the payoffs of the two vehicles under various combinations of strategies were evaluated, and the final strategy and the acceleration for each vehicle were obtained based on the principle of benefit equilibrium. The simulation is conducted to analyze the game strategy of the lane-changing vehicle (LV) and the close rear vehicle (RV) in the process of lane-changing from different initial positions. The results show that, under the hypothesis scenario in the simulation, the strategy {changing a lane, avoiding } will be chosen when the RV is initially located in the range of [0, 40 m], while {not changing a lane, not avoiding} is more appropriate when the initial position of the RV is in the range of [41 m, 90 m].

AB Despite the advancement of advanced driver assistance systems (ADAS) and autonomous driving systems, surpassing the threshold of level 3 of driving automation remains a challenging task. Level 3 of driving automation requires assuming full responsibility for the vehicle's actions, necessitating the acquisition of safer and more interpretable cues. To approach level 3, we propose a novel method for detecting driving vehicles and their brake light status, which is a crucial visual cue relied upon by human drivers. Our proposal consists of two main components. First, we introduce a fast and accurate one-stage brake light status detection network based on YOLOv8. Through transfer learning using a custom dataset, we enable YOLOv8 not only to detect the driving vehicle, but also to determine its brake light status. Furthermore, we present the publicly available custom dataset, which includes over 11,000 forward images along with manual annotations. We evaluate the performance of our proposed method in terms of detection accuracy and inference time on an edge device. The experimental results demonstrate high detection performance with an mAP50 (mean average precision at IoU threshold of 0.50) ranging from 0.766 to 0.793 on the test dataset, along with a short inference time of 133.30 ms on the Jetson Nano device. In conclusion, our proposed method achieves high accuracy and fast inference time in detecting brake light status. This contribution effectively improves safety, interpretability, and comfortability by providing valuable input information for ADAS and autonomous driving technologies.

AB The intensity and frequency of bushfires have increased significantly, destroying property and living species in recent years. Presently, unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) technology advancements are becoming increasingly popular in bushfire management systems because of their fundamental characteristics, such as manoeuvrability, autonomy, ease of deployment, and low cost. UAVs with remote-sensing capabilities are used with artificial intelligence, machine learning, and deep-learning algorithms to detect fire regions, make predictions, make decisions, and optimize fire-monitoring tasks. Moreover, UAVs equipped with various advanced sensors, including LIDAR, visual, infrared (IR), and monocular cameras, have been used to monitor bushfires due to their potential to provide new approaches and research opportunities. This review focuses on the use of UAVs in bushfire management for fire detection, fire prediction, autonomous navigation, obstacle avoidance, and search and rescue to improve the accuracy of fire prediction and minimize their impacts on people and nature. The objective of this paper is to provide valuable information on various UAV-based bushfire management systems and machine-learning approaches to predict and effectively respond to bushfires in inaccessible areas using intelligent autonomous UAVs. This paper aims to assemble information about the use of UAVs in bushfire management and to examine the benefits and limitations of existing techniques of UAVs related to bushfire handling. However, we conclude that, despite the potential benefits of UAVs for bushfire management, there are shortcomings in accuracy, and solutions need to be optimized for effective bushfire management.

AB Purpose This study first presents a method to identify the parameters increasing road vulnerability on a macroscopic road network model. The second part exploresthe effect size difference of the analyzed attributes on network vulnerability through the implementation of different autonomous vehicles (AVs) penetrations and automation levels. Methods The road traffic network of Budapest, Hungary on PTV VISUM is studied by adopting a passenger car unit factor procedure to simulate the effect of AVs on road saturation. Five link parameters were used: length, distance from the centre, speed, number of lanes, and number of connectors. Network vulnerability was studied by simulating a combination of road elimination process with different passenger car unit values for AVs. Results The analysis found the number of road lanes is the most significant parameter, affecting the link criticality; followed by road length and distance from the centre. The analysis of four AV scenarios with different AV penetration and level of automation showed huge effect differences ranging from 3.50% for a simple AV automation level with low AV percentage to as large to 28.53% for a fully automated fleet. Conclusions AV implementation has proved efficient in reducing the amount of travel delays in the case of road failure. Finally, it was found that the number of lanes remained the most significant influencing parameter on travel delay. The main question is to discover the effect size difference of the analyzed attributes on network vulnerability through the implementation of different AVs penetrations and automation levels.

AB With the popularity of autonomous vehicles and the rapid development of intelligent transportation, the application scenarios for detecting pedestrians in everyday life are becoming more and more widespread, with high and high application value. Pedestrian detection is the basis of many human-based tasks, including speed tracking, pedestrian motion detection, automatic pedestrian recognition, and appropriate response measures, or rejecting true false pedestrian detection. Various researchers have done a lot of research in this area, but there are still many errors in the correct identification of rejecting true false pedestrians. This article focuses on the design and implementation of real pedestrian discovery using deep learning technology to identify pedestrian rejections. In this work, our goal is to estimate the achievement of the current 2D detection system with a 3D Convolutional Neural Network on the issues of rejecting true false pedestrians using images obtained from the car's on-board cameras and light detection and ranging (LiDAR) sensors. We evaluate the single-phase (YOLOv3 models) and two-phase (Faster R-CNN) deep learning meta-structure under distinct image resolutions and attribute extractors (MobileNet). To resolve this issue, it is urge to apply a data augmentation approach to improve the execution of the framework. To observe the performance, the implemented methods are applied to recent datasets. The experimental assessment shows that the proposed method/algorithm enhances the accuracy of detection of true and false pedestrians, and still undergoes the real-time demands.

AB Autonomous vehicles (AVs)-and accidents they are involved in-attest to the urgent need to consider the ethics of artificial intelligence (AI). The question dominating the discussion so far has been whether we want AVs to behave in a 'selfish' or utilitarian manner. Rather than considering modeling self-driving cars on a single moral system like utilitarianism, one possible way to approach programming for AI would be to reflect recent work in neuroethics. The agent-deed-consequence (ADC) model (Dubljevic and Racine in AJOB Neurosci 5(4):3-20, 2014a, Behav Brain Sci 37(5):487-488, 2014b) provides a promising descriptive and normative account while also lending itself well to implementation in AI. The ADC model explains moral judgments by breaking them down into positive or negative intuitive evaluations of the agent, deed, and consequence in any given situation. These intuitive evaluations combine to produce a positive or negative judgment of moral acceptability. For example, the overall judgment of moral acceptability in a situation in which someone committed a deed that is judged as negative (e.g., breaking a law) would be mitigated if the agent had good intentions and the action had a good consequence. This explains the considerable flexibility and stability of human moral judgment that has yet to be replicated in AI. This paper examines the advantages and disadvantages of implementing the ADC model and how the model could inform future work on ethics of AI in general.

AB The majority of currently used automatic parking systems exploit the planning-and-tracking approach that involves planning the reference trajectory first and then tracking the desired reference trajectory. However, the response delay of longitudinal velocity prevents the parking controller from tracing the desired trajectory because the vehicle's velocity and other state parameters are not synchronized, while the controller maneuvers the vehicle according to the planned desired velocity and steering profiles. We propose an inverse vehicle model to provide a neural-network-based integrated lateral and longitudinal automatic parking controller. We approximated the relationship of the planned velocity to the vehicle's velocity using a second-order difference equation that involves the response characteristic of the vehicle's longitudinal delay. The adjusted desired velocity to track the origin-planned velocity is calculated using the inverse vehicle model. Furthermore, we proposed an integrated longitudinal and lateral parking controller using an artificial neural network (ANN) model trained on a dataset applying the inverse vehicle model. By learning the control laws between the vehicle's states and the corresponding actions, the proposed ANN-based controller could yield a steering angle and the adjusted desired velocity to complete automatic parking in a confined space.

AB For the next coming years, metaverse, digital twin and autonomous vehicle applications are the leading technologies for many complex applications hitherto inaccessible such as health and life sciences, smart home, smart agriculture, smart city, smart car and logistics, Industry 4.0, entertainment (video game) and social media applications, due to recent tremendous developments in process modeling, supercomputing, cloud data analytics (deep learning, etc.), communication network and AIoT/IIoT/IoT technologies. AIoT/IIoT/IoT is a crucial research field because it provides the essential data to fuel metaverse, digital twin, real-time Industry 4.0 and autonomous vehicle applications. However, the science of AIoT is inherently multidisciplinary, and therefore, it is difficult for readers to understand its evolution and impacts. Our main contribution in this article is to analyze and highlight the trends and challenges of the AIoT technology ecosystem including core hardware (MCU, MEMS/NEMS sensors and wireless access medium), core software (operating system and protocol communication stack) and middleware (deep learning on a microcontroller: TinyML). Two low-powered AI technologies emerge: TinyML and neuromorphic computing, but only one AIoT/IIoT/IoT device implementation using TinyML dedicated to strawberry disease detection as a case study. So far, despite the very rapid progress of AIoT/IIoT/IoT technologies, several challenges remain to be overcome such as safety, security, latency, interoperability and reliability of sensor data, which are essential characteristics to meet the requirements of metaverse, digital twin, autonomous vehicle and Industry 4.0. applications.

AB Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), commonly known as drones, are being increasingly deployed throughout the globe as a means to streamline monitoring, inspection, mapping, and logistic routines. When dispatched on autonomous missions, drones require an intelligent decision-making system for trajectory planning and tour optimization. Given the limited capacity of their onboard batteries, a key design challenge is to ensure the underlying algorithms can efficiently optimize the mission objectives along with recharging operations during long-haul flights. With this in view, the present work undertakes a comprehensive study on automated tour management systems for an energy-constrained drone: (1) We construct a machine learning model that estimates the energy expenditure of typical multi-rotor drones while accounting for real-world aspects and extrinsic meteorological factors. (2) Leveraging this model, the joint program of flight mission planning and recharging optimization is formulated as a multi-criteria Asymmetric Traveling Salesman Problem (ATSP), wherein a drone seeks for the time-optimal energy-feasible tour that visits all the target sites and refuels whenever necessary. (3) We devise an efficient approximation algorithm with provable worst-case performance guarantees and implement it in a drone management system, which supports real-time flight path tracking and re-computation in dynamic environments. (4) The effectiveness and practicality of the proposed approach are validated through extensive numerical simulations as well as real-world experiments.

AB In this study, a simplified model of an autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) with input saturation based on kinematic and dynamic equations was built. Subsequently, a simplified model of the AUV was used to represent its main dynamic features. In terms of trajectory tracking, only the system's structure (i.e., the regression matrix, which is flexible and non-unique) from the nominal model of the transformed system was required to design the proposed adaptive regression matrix-based fixed-time controller (ARM-FTC). A nonlinear auxiliary sliding surface was contained in the control design to shape the system's frequency response. When the operating point was in the neighborhood of the zero auxiliary sliding surface, nonlinear filtering gains were increased to accelerate its tracking ability. Furthermore, the skew-symmetric property condition of the time-derivative of the inertia matrix and the Coriolis and centrifugal force matrices was not necessitated for the controller design. Under an appropriate condition for lumped uncertainties, the fixed-time convergence of the auxiliary sliding surface and the corresponding tracking error is guaranteed to go to zero by the Lyapunov stability theory. Finally, a comparative study was conducted through simulations for the AUV with external disturbance and input saturation among the known parameters, learning parameters reflecting a regression matrix, and another asymptotical robust tracking control scheme. The results validate the fast tracking ability of a desired time-varying trajectory of the proposed control scheme.

AB Internet of Things (IoT) integrates a variety of software (e.g., autonomous vehicles and military systems) in order to enable the advanced and intelligent services. These software increase the potential of cyber-attacks because an adversary can launch an attack using system vulnerabilities. Existing software vulnerability analysis methods used to be relying on human experts crafted features, which usually miss many vulnerabilities. It is important to develop an automatic vulnerability analysis system to improve the countermeasures. However, source code is not always available (e.g., most IoT related industry software are closed source). Therefore, vulnerability detection on binary code is a demanding task. This article addresses the automatic binary-level software vulnerability detection problem by proposing a deep learning-based approach. The proposed approach consists of two phases: binary function extraction, and model building. First, we extract binary functions from the cleaned binary instructions obtained by using IDA Pro. Then, we employ the attention mechanism on top of a bidirectional long short-term memory for building the predictive model. To show the effectiveness of the proposed approach, we have collected datasets from several different sources. We have compared our proposed approach with a series of baselines including source code-based techniques and binary code-based techniques. We have also applied the proposed approach to real-world IoT related software such as VLC media player and LibTIFF project that used on Autonomous Vehicles. Experimental results show that our proposed approach betters the baselines and is able to detect more vulnerabilities.

AB The real-time position of an autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) is always of great interest. With advances of technologies, underwater wireless sensor networks (UWSNs) become promising tools for AUV tracking. Due to the energy constraint of underwater nodes, energy saving is a key issue that affects all aspects of the design of a tracking scheme. In this paper, we propose a novel energy-efficient tracking scheme for an AUV to locate itself in time by UWSNs. We first design a tracking protocol considering the energy consumptions in both the AUV and sensor nodes (SNs). Particularly, the protocol is designed in two aspects: 1) the passive listening mechanism and duty-cycle strategy for the AUV and 2) the detection based ranging packet transmission for SNs. Since the tracking protocol will inevitably affect the packet delivery between the AUV and SNs, we analyze the packet delivery success rate (PDSR) to shed light on the impact of system parameters on the tracking performance. To cope with non-linearity of the model and the intermittent observations mainly arisen from the effect of the tracking protocol, we adopt two extended versions of the original intermittent Kalman filter for tracking. They are intermittent extended Kalman filter and intermittent unscented Kalman filter. Simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed tracking scheme, and reveal that the PDSR analysis provides a design guidance for parameter selection in system configuration.
