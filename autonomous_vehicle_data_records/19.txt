AB Because of their high maneuverability and fast deployment times, aerial robots have recently gained popularity for automating inspection tasks. In this paper, we address the visual inspection of vessel cargo holds, aiming at safer, cost-efficient and more intensive visual inspections of ships by means of a multirotor-type platform. To this end, the vehicle is equipped with a sensor suite able to supply the surveyor with imagery from relevant areas, while the control software is supporting the operator during flight with enhanced functionalities and reliable autonomy. All this has been accomplished in the context of the supervised autonomy (SA) paradigm, by means of extensive use of behaviour-based high-level control (including obstacle detection and collision prevention), all specifically devised for visual inspection. The full system has been evaluated both in laboratory and in real environments, on-board two different vessels. Results show the vehicle effective for the referred application, in particular due to the inspection-oriented capabilities it has been fitted with.

AB Morphologic features, 600-1100 m across and elevated up to 30 m above the surrounding seafloor, interpreted to be mud volcanoes were investigated on the continental slope in the Beaufort Sea in the Canadian Arctic. Sediment cores, detailed mapping with an autonomous underwater vehicle, and exploration with a remotely operated vehicle show that these are young and actively forming features experiencing ongoing eruptions. Biogenic methane and low-chloride, sodium-bicarbonate-rich waters are extruded with warm sediment that accumulates to form cones and low-relief circular plateaus. The chemical and isotopic compositions of the ascending water indicate that a mixture of meteoric water, seawater, and water from clay dehydration has played a significant role in the evolution of these fluids. The venting methane supports extensive siboglinid tubeworms communities and forms some gas hydrates within the near seafloor. We believe that these are the first documented living chemosynthetic biological communities in the continental slope of the western Arctic Ocean.

AB Artificial intelligence techniques applied to control processes are particularly useful when the elements to be controlled are complex and can not be described by a linear model. A trade-off between performance and complexity is the main factor in the design of this kind of system. The use of fuzzy logic is specially indicated when trying to emulate such human control actions as driving a car. This paper presents a fuzzy system that cooperatively controls the throttle and brake pedals for automatic speed control up to 50 km/h. It is thus appropriate for populated areas where driving involves constant speed changes, but within a range of low speeds because of traffic jams, road signs, traffic lights, etc. The system gets the current and desired speeds for the car and generates outputs to control the two pedals. It has been implemented in a real car, and tested in real road conditions, showing good speed control with smooth actions resulting in accelerations that are comfortable for the car's occupants.

AB In this paper, we discuss the co-optimized performance of multi-reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS)-assisted integrated satellite-unmanned aerial vehicle-terrestrial network (IS-UAV-TN), where the multiple vehicle users are applied to the network under consideration. The performance optimization of IS-UAV-TNs faces two major challenges: one is the obstacles in the transmission path and the other is the highly dynamic communication environment caused by the UAV movement for the multiple ground vehicle users. To tackle these above issues efficiently, we will install RIS on the UAV for the purpose of reshaping the wireless transmission path. In addition, non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) protocols are considered as a new paradigm to address spectrum shortage and enhance connection quality. Considering the UAV energy consumption, the satellite transmission beamforming matrix and RIS phase shift configuration, a multi-objective optimization problem is proposed to maximize the system achievable rate and minimize the UAV energy consumption during a specific mission. On this foundation, to facilitate the online decision problem, the deep reinforcement learning (DRL) algorithm is utilized to achieve real-time interaction with the communication environment. A multi-objective deep deterministic policy gradient (MO-DDPG) algorithm is proposed to search for sub-optimal solutions about the learning problem of multi-objective control policies in IS-UAV-TNs. Experimental results show that the method can simultaneously consider three optimization objectives and effectively adjust the optimal update policy according to the settings of different weight parameters.

TI The Stixel World: A medium-level representation of traffic scenes
SO IMAGE AND VISION COMPUTING
LA English
DT Article
DE Stereo-vision; Automotive vision; Intelligent vehicles; Scene
   understanding
AB Recent progress in advanced driver assistance systems and the race towards autonomous vehicles is mainly driven by two factors: (1) increasingly sophisticated algorithms that interpret the environment around the vehicle and react accordingly, and (2) the continuous improvements of sensor technology itself. In terms of cameras, these improvements typically include higher spatial resolution, which as a consequence requires more data to be processed. The trend to add multiple cameras to cover the entire surrounding of the vehicle is not conducive in that matter. At the same time, an increasing number of special purpose algorithms need access to the sensor input data to correctly interpret the various complex situations that can occur, particularly in urban traffic.
   By observing those trends, it becomes clear that a key challenge for vision architectures in intelligent vehicles is to share computational resources. We believe this challenge should be faced by introducing a representation of the sensory data that provides compressed and structured access to all relevant visual content of the scene. The Stixel World discussed in this paper is such a representation. It is a medium-level model of the environment that is specifically designed to compress information about obstacles by leveraging the typical layout of outdoor traffic scenes. It has proven useful for a multitude of automotive vision applications, including object detection, tracking, segmentation, and mapping.
   In this paper, we summarize the ideas behind the model and generalize it to take into account multiple dense input streams: the image itself, stereo depth maps, and semantic class probability maps that can be generated, e.g., by deep convolutional neural networks. Our generalization is embedded into a novel mathematical formulation for the Stixel model. We further sketch how the free parameters of the model can be learned using structured SVMs. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Due to the advantage of flexible and rapid deployment, unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)-based synthetic aperture radar (SAR) tomography (TomoSAR) is a promising technology in 3-D urban mapping. The long baseline is indispensable for P-band SAR systems to achieve high elevation resolution. It will introduce two problems. On the one hand, the unavoidable spatial decorrelation brings serious phase noise and sidelobes in 3-D imaging. On the other hand, the noticeable image distortion fails the image registration and the TomoSAR data stack (TDS) construction. Aiming at the above problems, this article proposes a multimaster (MM) TomoSAR approach via three main contributions. First, the traditional TomoSAR signal model is extended to the MM case to improve the number of baselines and the average image coherence of the TDS and suppress the sidelobes. Second, a short-baseline-recursion image registration method is proposed to achieve high-precision image registration. Third, a TDS optimization processing consisting of interferometric SAR (InSAR) phase screening and baseline sign reassignment is introduced. Moreover, a clustering-based outliers' elimination method is also adopted to ensure the 3-D imaging quality. Computer simulation and long-baseline P-band UAV-SAR experiment validate the proposed approach.

AB As autonomous vehicles are rapidly developing, the required electrical energy for operating various in-tire sensors as well as in-vehicle sensors is also increasing. In addition, noise from tires is becoming a critical issue given that the growth of electric vehicles eliminates the noise from engines. Thus, we develop a triboelectric nanogenerator implemented inside a tire with an acoustic foam for a self-driven silent tire, abbreviated as Tire-TENG. The manufactured Tire-TENG maintains the sound absorption ability of pristine acoustic foam while generating electrical energy using the radial acceleration change of a tire. In a laboratory test, the Tire-TENG with a volume of 50 mm x 50 mm x 30 mm shows power of 3.38 mW. As an actual application, six Tire-TENGs with each volume of 120 mm x 110 mm x 30 mm are mounted at the inner surface of a tire. At a speed of 100 km/h and with a weight load of 3500 N, 40 light-emitting diodes were lit bright enough to be seen in a daylight environment without any extra power source. By virtue of its high output characteristics, the Tire-TENG showed feasibility as a self-driven and sound-attenuated in-tire solution thus far not yet reported.

AB Large cities' expanding populations are causing traffic congestion. The maintenance of the city's road network necessitates ongoing monitoring, growth, and modernization. An intelligent vehicle detection solution is necessary to address road traffic concerns with the advancement of automatic cars. The identification and tracking vehicles on roads and highways are part of intelligent traffic monitoring while driving. In this paper, we have presented how You Only Look Once (YOLO) v5 model may be used to identify cars, traffic lights, and pedestrians in various weather situations, allowing for real-time identification in a typical vehicular environment. In an ordinary or autonomous environment, object detection may be affected by bad weather conditions. Bad weather may make driving dangerous in various ways, whether due to freezing roadways or the illusion of low fog. In this study, we used YOLOv5 model to recognize objects from street-level recordings for rainy and regular weather scenarios on 11 distinct classes of vehicles (car, truck, bike), pedestrians, and traffic signals (red, green, yellow). We utilized freely available Roboflow datasets to train the proposed system. Furthermore, we used real video sequences of road traffic to evaluate the proposed system's performance. The study results revealed that the suggested approach could recognize cars, trucks, and other roadside items in various circumstances with acceptable results.

DE Post-impact trajectory tracking; feedforward-feedback compensation;

AB This paper investigates the trajectory tracking control of independently actuated autonomous vehicles after the first impact, aiming to mitigate the secondary collision probability. An integrated predictive control strategy is proposed to mitigate the deteriorated state propagation and facilitate safety objective achievement in critical conditions after a collision. Three highlights can be concluded in this work: (1) A compensatory model predictive control (MPC) strategy is proposed to incorporate a feedforward-feedback compensation control (FCC) method. Based on the definite physical analysis, it is verified that adequate reverse steering and differential torque vectoring render more potentials and flexibility for vehicle post-impact control; (2) With compensatory portions, the deteriorated states after a collision are far beyond the traditional stability envelope. Hence it can be further manipulated in MPC by constraint transformation, rather than introducing soft constraints and decreasing the control efforts on tracking error; (3) Considering time-varying saturation on input, input rate, and slip ratio, the proposed FCC-MPC controller is developed to improve faster deviation attenuation both in lateral and yaw motions. Finally two high-fidelity simulation cases implemented on CarSim-Simulink conjoint platform have demonstrated that the proposed controller has the advanced capabilities of vehicle safety improvement and better control performance achievement after severe impacts.

ID ENVIRONMENTS; NAVIGATION; ALGORITHM
AB Unmanned surface vehicles (USVs) have become a focus of research because of their extensive applications. To ensure safety and reliability and to perform complex tasks autonomously, USVs are required to possess accurate perception of the environment and effective collision avoidance capabilities. To achieve these, investigation into realtime marine radar target detection and autonomous collision avoidance technologies is required, aiming at solving the problems of noise jamming, uneven brightness, target loss, and blind areas in marine radar images. These technologies should also satisfy the requirements of real-time and reliability related to high navigation speeds of USVs. Therefore, this study developed an embedded collision avoidance system based on the marine radar, investigated a highly real-time target detection method which contains adaptive smoothing algorithm and robust segmentation algorithm, developed a stable and reliable dynamic local environment model to ensure the safety of USV navigation, and constructed a collision avoidance algorithm based on velocity obstacle (V-obstacle) which adjusts the USV's heading and speed in real-time. Sea trials results in multi-obstacle avoidance firstly demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed avoidance system, and then verify its great adaptability and relative stability when a USV sailing in a real and complex marine environment. The obtained results will improve the intelligent level of USV and guarantee the safety of USV independent sailing.

ID NONLINEAR-SYSTEMS
AB A model predictive control (MPC) approach for controlling an active front steering (AFS) system in an autonomous vehicle is presented. At each time step a trajectory is assumed to be known over a finite horizon, and an MPC controller computes the front steering angle in order to best follow the desired trajectory on slippery roads at the highest possible entry speed. We start from the results presented in (Int. J. Veh. Auton. Syst. 2005; 3(2-4):265-291; IEEE Trans. Contr. Syst. Technol. 2007; 15(3)) and formulate the MPC problem based on successive online linearization of the nonlinear vehicle model (linear time-varying (LTV) MPC). We present a sufficient stability condition for such LTV MPC scheme. The condition is derived for a general class of nonlinear discrete time systems and results into an additional convex constraint to be included in the LTV MPC design.
   For the AFS control problem, we compare the proposed LTV MPC scheme with the LTV MPC scheme in (IEEE Trans. Contr. Syst. Technol. 2007; 15(3)) where stability has been enforced with an ad hoc constraint. Simulation and experimental tests up to 17 m/s on icy roads show the effectiveness of the LTV MPC formulation.

ID WALKABILITY
AB Two scenarios have shaped the discussion on the deployment of automated vehicles (AVs). The first is the revolutionary or disruptive scenario, in which a competitor would reach fully automated vehicles (level 5) in one giant leap. The second scenario renders the deployment of AVs as a lengthy process of evolutionary vehicle automation, progressing from specialized, controlled and restricted conditions, i.e. operational design domains (ODDs), to ever more complex ones. But as it becomes more and more clear that there are large uncertainties about how far in the future level 5 AVs become available, in the near future situations in which the driver is replaced completely, i.e. not requiring driver interventions, only seem feasible in specific ODDs and cities will likely be faced by highly automated vehicles (level 4) equipped with automated driving systems (ADSs) for specific ODDs over a longer period. However, cities comprise different street spaces with various conditions which lead to different requirements for the ADSs and could affect the deployment of level 4 AVs and thus the impacts of AVs in cities in the near future. This paper presents a framework and related indicators for assessing the automated drivability, i.e. the suitability of street spaces for the functioning operation of ADSs from a technical-infrastructural point of view, based on the relationship between the current technological development state of ADSs and different (urban) street spaces. Using the case study of the city of Vienna in Austria to apply the framework, a set of indicators for the different components of the framework is calculated and integrated to build an automated drivability index (ADX), illustrating the automated drivability within the street network. The results are a first step to indicate which areas are more suitable for level 4 AVs from a technological point of view, as well as areas where a deployment of AVs would only be possible after larger adjustments of the infrastructure or at considerably lower than intended speeds; thus, detailing the complexity of driving urban street spaces in a yet unprecedented level. Besides other aspects this can give hints for policy makers and other stakeholders where to facilitate the deployment of AVs.

AB The Green Light Optimal Speed Advisory (GLOSA) system is a Cooperative Intelligent Trans-portation System (C-ITS) that is supposed to reduce the energy consumption and travel time associated with a vehicle trip by providing an optimal speed profile to avoid unnecessary stops at an intersection, based on Traffic Light Signals (TLSs) information. It is expected that GLOSA solutions will be widely deployed on transportation networks, thanks to the rapid spread of increasingly effective and pervasive communication technologies. Thus, appropriate methodologies and tools should be adopted to test sustainability objectives and evaluate the effects of such systems on the performance of traffic networks. In this perspective, this paper proposes an enhanced testing approach of GLOSA services based on an Integrated Simulation Environment that combines custom models developed in Matlab/Simulink with the SUMO traffic simulation environment, allowing both the traffic environment and vehicle dynamics to be represented with a suitable level of detail. The proposed approach can be used to cover several aspects which, in the existing technical literature, are: (i) not considered (traffic signal phase condition); (ii) rarely considered (electric engine); (iii) considered in a non-integrated way (traffic condition, TLS cycle duration, communication distance and minimum speed). Indeed, the considered factors pertain to different subsystems of the mobility environment (network and vehicles), and the proposed testing framework allows an equally detailed simulation of all, thus enhancing the accuracy of the results. To show the validity of the proposed approach, this study considers one controlled vehicle, equipped with a GLOSA system, travelling along a single route through a city centre including many TLSs. The simulation analysis deals with different levels of considered factors, assessed through Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) related to mobility and environmental indicators. Numerical results confirm that the proposed Integrated Simulation Environment can give valuable insights and suggestions to design a GLOSA system aiming to enhance both mobility and environmental performance. They also show that the factors in question affect system performance differently.

AB Unmanned Aerial Vehicles are employed for vision-based modal analysis of civil infrastructure, as they overcome range limitations of fixed cameras and measure the oscillations of a structure up close. Nevertheless, their potential is not fully exploited: they are often piloted manually and one at a time, though one drone is unable to capture high resolution displacement of a whole structure. An approach is explored here, employing multiple drones simultaneously to estimate natural frequencies and modal shapes of a structure, by synchronizing their measurement. The ability of the method to detect modal parameter variations is assessed, such that it can identify anomalies in the structure. Procedures are applied to a test structure, yielding maximum natural frequency estimation errors of 0.2% with respect to accelerometers. The results suggest the accuracy of the approach is high enough to warrant further development and support autonomous, multi-drone applications to the inspection of the built environment.

AB Covert communication has emerged as a revolutionary wireless technique to hide confidential information -- either naturally or via artificial noise -- from being detected. Random transmit power, time-variant channel state information, and location mobility can be leveraged to confuse the detection at the warden. However, it becomes challenging when the distance is long or the direct link is blocked. In this article, we explore an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) as the relay to assist covert wireless networks to achieve better quality of service. First, several typical application scenarios are demonstrated and briefly discussed. Then, two scenarios of UAVs serving as a relay in covert wireless networks are narrated. The first case investigates a multi-antenna transmitter aided by a drone relay in the long-range covert wireless network against the detection of a UAV warden. The second case studies the covert wireless network assisted by a UAV relay to overcome the channel blockage problem. Simulation results are provided to evaluate the effectiveness and superiority of the proposed schemes. Finally, some future challenges are discussed.

AB Pedestrian crossing intention prediction is crucial for the safety of pedestrians in the context of both autonomous and conventional vehicles and has attracted widespread interest recently. Various methods have been proposed to perform pedestrian crossing intention prediction, among which the skeleton-based methods have been very popular in recent years. However, most existing studies utilize manually designed features to handle skeleton data, limiting the performance of these methods. To solve this issue, we propose to predict pedestrian crossing intention based on spatial-temporal graph convolutional networks using skeleton data (ST CrossingPose). The proposed method can learn both spatial and temporal patterns from skeleton data, thus having a good feature representation ability. Extensive experiments on a public dataset demonstrate that the proposed method achieves very competitive performance in predicting crossing intention while maintaining a fast inference speed. We also analyze the effect of several factors, e.g., size of pedestrians, time to event, and occlusion, on the proposed method.

AB We design an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) based wireless network with wireless access and backhaul links leveraging an intelligent reflecting surface (IRS). This design aims to maximize the sum rate achieved by ground users (GUs) through optimizing the UAV placement, IRS phase shifts, and sub-channel assignments considering the wireless backhaul capacity constraint. To tackle the underlying mixed integer non-linear optimization problem (MINLP), we first derive the closed-form IRS phase shift solution; we then optimize the sub-channel assignment and UAV placement by using the alternating optimization method. Specifically, we propose an iterative sub-channel assignment method to efficiently utilize the bandwidth and balance bandwidth allocation for wireless access and backhaul links while maintaining the backhaul capacity constraint. Moreover, we employ the successive convex approximation (SCA) method to solve the UAV placement optimization sub-problem. We show the effectiveness of our proposed design via extensive numerical studies.

AB This paper introduces an autonomous payment administration solution, integrating blockchain-enabled smart contracts and robotic reality capture technologies. The construction progress is captured, analyzed, and documented respectively using sensing, machine intelligence, and as-built building information models (BIM). The progress data is stored in a distributed manner using content addressable file sharing; it is then broadcasted to a smart contract which administers payments and transfers lien rights respectively using crypto currencies/tokens and non-fungible tokens (NFT). The method was successfully implemented for payments to 7 subcontractors in two real-world commercial construction projects in Canada and United States where progress was captured using a camera-equipped unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) and an unmanned ground vehicle (UGV) equipped with a laser scanner. The method eliminates reliance on today's heavily intermediated payment applications and showed promise for achieving accurate, efficient, and timely payment administration. Future work should further explore the connections between off- and on-chain realities.

AB While the convolutional layer deepens during the feature extraction process in deep learning networks, the performance of the object detection decreases associated with the gradual loss of feature integrity. In this paper, the convolutional feature frequency adaptive fusion object detection network is proposed to effectively compensate for the missing frequency information in the convolutional feature propagation. Two branches are used for high- and low-frequency-domain channel information to maintain the stability of feature delivery. The adaptive feature fusion network complements the advantages of missing high-frequency features, enhances the feature extraction integrity of convolutional neural networks, and improves network detection performance. The simulation tests showed that this algorithm's detection results are significantly enhanced on blurred objects, overlapping objects, and objects with low contrast between the object and background. The detection results on the Common Objects in Context dataset was more than 1% higher than the CornerNet algorithm. Thus, the proposed algorithm performs well for detecting pedestrians, vehicles, and other objects. Consequently, this algorithm is suitable for application in autonomous vehicle systems and smart robots.

AB Efficient sampling of coastal ocean processes, especially mechanisms such as upwelling and internal waves and their influence on primary production, is critical for understanding our changing oceans. Coupling robotic sampling with ocean models provides an effective approach to adaptively sample such features. We present methods that capitalize on information from ocean models and in situ measurements, using Gaussian process modeling and objective functions, allowing sampling efforts to be concentrated to regions with high scientific interest. We demonstrate how to combine and correlate marine data from autonomous underwater vehicles, model forecasts, remote sensing satellite, buoy, and ship-based measurements, as a means to cross-validate and improve ocean model accuracy, in addition to resolving upper water-column interactions. Our work is focused on the west coast of Mid-Norway where significant influx of Atlantic Water produces a rich and complex physical-biological coupling, which is hard to measure and characterize due to the harsh environmental conditions. Results from both simulation and full-scale sea trials are presented.

AB The very nature of a complex system does not allow that a single person be able to master all required competences for its development or operation. Therefore, specialization, team work and coordination are required to achieve the desired goals. In order to assure positive synergy between every participant, system engineering concepts must be taken into account, like development methods, product decomposition, functional classification, design patterns, interface and compatibility assessment, configuration management, technological plans, technical standards, integration policies, system commissioning and validation. These systems engineering concepts are shown in the presented work through the development of a fully functional AUV system and control architecture. The control system and its components are properly described and compared against other state of the art architectures. It is also shown that it was possible to sustain the project development tasks among many successive group or generation of students, demonstrating the benefits of the proposed engineering methods. The proposed system was tested in field tests of the AUV during an oceanographic mission.

ID PEDESTRIAN DETECTION
AB Intelligent systems designed to reduce highway fatalities have been widely applied in the automotive sector in the last decade. Of all users of transport systems, pedestrians are the most vulnerable in crashes as they are unprotected. This paper deals with an autonomous intelligent emergency system designed to avoid collisions with pedestrians. The system consists of a fuzzy controller based on the time-to-collision estimate - obtained via a vision-based system - and the wheel-locking probability - obtained via the vehicle's CAN bus - that generates a safe braking action. The system has been tested in a real car - a convertible Citroen C3 Pluriel - equipped with an automated electro-hydraulic braking system capable of working in parallel with the vehicle's original braking circuit. The system is used as a last resort in the case that an unexpected pedestrian is in the lane and all the warnings have failed to produce a response from the driver. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

AB Future user acceptance will be a requirement for the AVs to accomplish their estimated safety benefits, highlighting the importance of acceptable driving behaviour. This study aims to investigate the parameters that affect the acceptability of highly automated overtaking. 237 respondents participated in a video based online survey, rating different motorway flying overtaking scenarios based on their preferences. The scores were analysed using a variety of methods (statistical tests, Principal Component Analysis, Linear Mixed Models). Long pull-out distances and manoeuvre duration values, as well as lower speeds were preferred by the participants, with some limited impact of the driving situation. Overall, behaviour simulating an average, cautious human driver is likely to positively influence acceptability and suggests the value of further research on context-adaptive automated driving to account for subjective risk perception. These findings can contribute towards user-centred systems that assist or autonomously perform overtaking manoeuvres, supporting their uptake and thus the realisation of their safety benefits.

AB During the past two decades, there has been major growth of small-unmanned aerial vehicles (sUAV) for hobbyists and rapidly expanding commercial and military applications. The impetus for this dramatic expansion has been due to the ex-plosion of mobile technology in terms of microelectronics, data processing and transmission capability, high-energy-density batteries, miniaturized integrated programmable chips, and innovations in computer vision and videography/photography. However, there are many challenges to overcome before these small unmanned aerial systems (sUAS) can be used for routine commercial and military applications, which include reliability, sizable payload and range, stringent navigation/guidance requirements, and precision takeoff/landing and robust autonomous flight in constrained and low-altitude gusty environ-ment. The objective of this paper is to cover state-of-the-art of sUAS and delivery drones, identify technology gaps and key scientific barriers, and present future research needs for high payoff applications.

AB In intelligent transportation systems (ITS), the vehicular ad-hoc network (VANET) is an enabling technology that can provide information exchange services among connected and autonomous vehicles (CAVs). Video streaming over VANETs is a potential application to ensure the safety of drivers and passengers and improve infotainment services. However, owing to the dynamic network topology, video transmission in VANETs is very challenging in terms of latency, reliability, and security. Therefore, a comprehensive summary of the state-of-art video streaming over VANETs is surveyed in this work. Firstly, related works and background knowledge are introduced. Then, a systematic survey on resource allocation (RA) scheme for video streaming in VANETs is provided, and some prevailing and feasible optimization tools are elaborated. Furthermore, enabling technologies of video streaming over VANETs are summarized with a special focus on the integration of video communication, caching, and computing. Finally, we give some challenges and future research directions.

AB UAVs often perform tasks that require flying close to walls or structures and in environments where a satellite-based location is not possible. Flying close to solid bodies implies a higher risk of collisions, thus requiring an increase in the precision of the measurement and control of the UAV's position. The aerodynamic distortions generated by nearby walls or other objects are also relevant, making the control more complex and further placing demands on the positioning system. Performing wall-related tasks implies flying very close to the wall and, in some cases, even touching it. This work presents a Near-Wall Positioning System (NWPS) based on the combination of an Ultra-wideband (UWB) solution and LIDAR-based range finders. This NWPS has been developed and tested to allow precise positioning and orientation of a multirotor UAV relative to a wall when performing tasks near it. Specific position and orientation control hardware based on horizontal thrusters has also been designed, allowing the UAV to move smoothly and safely near walls.

AB In the vision of intelligent transportation, vehicles are expected to feature with advanced applications, such as automatic road enforcement, dynamic traffic light sequence, and autonomous driving. Therefore, real-time and fast dynamic information exchanges are required, and vehicle-to-everything (V2X) communications are highly demanded. In this work, the channel characteristics of vehicular communication are analyzed in the millimeter-wave (mmWave) band at 22.1-23.1 GHz. Specifically, two types of links (the satellite link and the terrestrial link) are considered in urban and highway scenarios with different weather conditions. The ray-tracing simulator together with calibrated electromagnetic parameters is employed to practically generate wideband channels. The key channel parameters of each link including the received power, Rician K-factor, root-mean-square delay spread, and angular spreads are explored. The co-channel interferences between the two links are analyzed as well. The observations and conclusions of this work can be useful for the design of V2X communication technologies.

AB Road condition and quality are critical road maintenance and risk reduction factors. Most existing road monitoring systems include regular on-site surveys and maintenance. However, major roads in urban areas are generally complicated and have heavy traffic during the daytime, so such field investigation can be significantly limited. Moreover, any road work at nighttime can be risky and dangerous and incur excessive expenses. Based on a review of existing systems for monitoring road conditions, this study focuses on overcoming two unsolved challenges: the capacity of the monitoring range and the avoidance techniques to ensure traffic is not hindered. To solve these challenges, these paper proposes an integrated road monitoring system called Car-free Street Mapping (CfSM) using unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV), aerial mapping cameras, and deep learning (DL) algorithms. The use of the aerial mapping camera mounted on the UAV is to widen the monitoring viewing range, and general-purpose drones are used in this study rather than expensive special equipment. Since the drone-taken images include many passing vehicles that conceal the road surface from the camera vision, the DL model was applied to detect the vehicles and their shadows and then remove them from the images. To train the DL model, two image datasets were used: publicly available cars overhead with context (COWC) images and orthoimages additionally taken for the project to further improve the accuracy. The two datasets consist of 298,623 labeled objects on 9,331 images in total. The tests resulted in a mean average precision (mAP) of 89.57% for trucks, 95.77% for passenger vehicles, and 76.51% for buses. Finally, the object-removed images were composited into one whole car-free image. The CfSM was applied to two areas in Yeouido and Sangam-dong, Seoul, Korea. The car-free images in both regions show a spatial resolution of 10 mm and can be used for various purposes such as road maintenance and management and autonomous vehicle roadmaps.

AB In this paper, we modify the slotted ALOHA protocol to quickly identify a swarm of drones in unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) communication environments. Considering the unreliable UAV channel and the fundamental tradeoff between collision and idle slots in slotted ALOHA, we propose an idle-less slotted ALOHA (ILS-ALOHA) protocol that detects and utilizes idle slots to transmit control messages to drones. In ILS-ALOHA, the ground control station recognizes the idle slot promptly at the beginning of each slot and then transmits acknowledgment (ACK) and beacon messages during the remaining period of the idle slot. Therefore, it can control the access of the drone swarm more adaptively and feed back the ACK to the drones more frequently in an error-prone UAV environment without allocating additional slots. The analysis and simulation results show that the proposed ILS-ALOHA protocol outperforms the conventional slotted ALOHA-based protocols in terms of identification time, channel throughput, and probability of successful identification.

DT Article
ID HURRICANE
AB This paper presents experimental observations to improve typhoon prediction accuracy and to understand interactions between atmosphere and ocean directly under typhoons. Two unmanned surface vehicles (Wave Gliders (WGs)) equipped with interchangeable sensors were sailed toward the path of an approaching Category 5 typhoon (Hinnamnor), which began on 29 August 2022 and subsided on 6 September, reaching a minimum pressure of 920 hPa and a maximum wind speed of 55 m/s (105 knots). Sensors on WGs measured atmospheric pressure, wind speed, atmospheric and seawater temperature, wave height, currents, salinity, and chlorophyll-a concentrations in different parts of the typhoon. These observations made it possible to clarify changes in various phenomena as the typhoon approached and to compare differences in storm characteristics measured by the two WGs. Sea surface pressure in the core of a typhoon is useful as an initial predictor of its intensity. Data assimilation into numerical models and other observations are expected to improve prediction accuracy of typhoon phenomena. Furthermore, simultaneous observations of atmosphere and ocean will also be useful for modeling interactions.

AB This article considers topology construction or design using unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) in order to maximize the traffic flow from a given source to a destination node. To this end, it outlines a mixed-integer linear program (MILP) to optimize the placement of UAVs and the routing of flow from the said source to the destination. The problem is very challenging because the MILP requires an exhaustive collection of topologies, which increases exponentially with the number of UAVs and potential UAVs placement locations. To this end, this article outlines two novel methods. The first is a heuristic centralized method called distance-based location selection (DBLS) that generates a subset of topologies to reduce the search space of the said MILP. The second method is a distributed Gibbs-sampling-based protocol (DGSP) that allows each UAV to determine its location iteratively and independently. Our results show that DBLS and DGSP achieve, respectively, 85% and 72% of the optimal maximum flow.

AB Visual Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (VSLAM) and Visual Odometry (VO) are fundamental problems to be properly tackled for enabling autonomous and effective movements of vehicles/robots supported by vision -based positioning systems. This study presents a publicly shared dataset for SLAM investigations: a dataset collected at the Yildiz Technical University (YTU) in an outdoor area by an acquisition system mounted on a terrestrial vehicle. The acquisition system includes two cameras, an inertial measurement unit, and two GPS receivers. All sensors have been calibrated and synchronized. To prove the effectiveness of the introduced dataset, this study also applies Visual Inertial Odometry (VIO) on the KITTI dataset. Also, this study proposes a new recurrent neural network-based VIO rather than just introducing a new dataset. In addition, the effectiveness of this proposed method is proven by comparing it with the state-of-the-arts ORB-SLAM2 and OKVIS methods. The experimental results show that the YTU dataset is robust enough to be used for benchmarking studies and the proposed deep learning-based VIO is more successful than the other two traditional methods.

TI Material remodeling and unconventional gaits facilitate locomotion of a
   robophysical rover over granular terrain
SO SCIENCE ROBOTICS

DT Article
ID DESIGN; ROBOT; MODEL; SOFT
AB Autonomous robots and vehicles must occasionally recover from locomotion failure in loosely consolidated granular terrain. Recent mobility challenges led NASA Johnson Space Center to develop a prototype robotic lunar rover Resource Prospector 15 (RP15) capable of wheeled, legged, and crawling behavior. To systematically understand the terradynamic performance of such a device, we developed a scaled-down rover robot and studied its locomotion on slopes of dry and wet granular media. Addition of a cyclic-legged gait to the robot's wheel spinning action changes the robot dynamics from that of a wheeled vehicle to a locomotor paddling through frictional fluid. Granular drag force measurements and modified resistive force theory facilitate modeling of such dynamics. A peculiar gait strategy that agitates and cyclically reflows grains under the robot allows it to "swim" up loosely consolidated hills. Whereas substrate disturbance typically hinders locomotion in granular media, the multimode design of RP15 and a diversity of possible gaits facilitate formation of self-organized localized frictional fluids that enable effective robust transport.

AB We propose a system for performing structural change detection in street-view videos captured by a vehicle-mounted monocular camera over time. Our approach is motivated by the need for more frequent and efficient updates in the large-scale maps used in autonomous vehicle navigation. Our method chains a multi-sensor fusion SLAM and fast dense 3D reconstruction pipeline, which provide coarsely registered image pairs to a deep Deconvolutional Network (DN) for pixel-wise change detection. We investigate two DN architectures for change detection, the first one is based on the idea of stacking contraction and expansion blocks while the second one is based on the idea of Fully Convolutional Networks. To train and evaluate our networks we introduce a new urban change detection dataset which is an order of magnitude larger than existing datasets and contains challenging changes due to seasonal and lighting variations. Our method outperforms existing literature on this dataset, which we make available to the community, and an existing panoramic change detection dataset, demonstrating its wide applicability.

DE Automotive radar; radar antenna; simulation; radar cross section
AB Radar is one of the primary active safety sensors for advanced driver assistance systems. Autonomous vehicles will heavily rely on the ability of automotive radar systems to accurately identify crucial targets while filtering out false targets. Road guardrails present a unique corner case challenge to automotive radar sensors due to their large radar cross section (RCS) that can lead to false targets alerts. This paper presents a full physics, full-scale electromagnetic simulation-based study on the radar returns of road guardrails. Results from this paper demonstrate how guardrails can obfuscate crucial targets, such as pedestrians and nearby stationary vehicles. A novel guardrail system for high-pedestrian density areas is proposed. Further RCS reduction of this design is achieved through a proposed diffraction mitigation technique. Simulations using this proposed guardrail system predict over 25-dB reduction in guardrail RCS. Results from this paper show that guardrails with low RCS improve the visibility of adjacent stationary targets, and thus have the potential to reduce accidents and possibly save lives.

AB The step-change in gravimetric energy density needed for electrochemical energy storage devices to power unmanned autonomous vehicles, electric vehicles, and enable low-cost clean grid storage is unlikely to be provided by conventional lithium ion batteries. Lithium-sulfur batteries comprising lightweight elements provide a promising alternative, but the associated polysulfide shuttle in typical ether-based electrolytes generates loss in capacity and low coulombic efficiency. The first new electrolyte based on a unique combination of a relatively hydrophobic sulfonamide solvent and a low ion-pairing salt, which inhibits the polysulfide shuttle, is presented. This system behaves as a sparingly solvating electrolyte at slightly elevated temperatures, where it sustains reversible capacities as high as 1200-1500 mAh g(-1) over a wide range of current density (2C-C/5, respectively) when paired with a lithium metal anode, with a coulombic efficiency of >99.7% in the absence of LiNO3 additive.

AB Methods for real-time in situ analysis are needed for the monitoring and detection of pollutants and nutrients in water bodies. In situ instruments reduce the analysis time and decrease the chance of contamination or altering of the sample if taken to the laboratory. For this purpose, a mobile total analysis system is being developed for real-time environmental monitoring. The sensing platform, based on either an autonomous underwater vehicle or remotely operated vehicle, consists of an integrated flow-through channel with a chemically sensitive strip on one side of the channel and an optoelectronic detector opposite the strip. The strip contains an analyte-specific reagent that changes colour upon reaction with the analyte of interest introduced through the flow channel. In determining the feasibility of the design, the detection of copper ions was used as the case study. The interpretation strategy, referencing and calibration from the lab experiments including the effects of flow are shown.

AB This article presents an adaptive control strategy for lane-keeping task of automatic steering systems via sliding-mode technique. First, considering the road-vehicle lateral dynamics, a standard single track steering model has been developed for the lane-keeping task. To cope with the time-variant nature of the longitudinal velocity and uncertainty of measurement, a class of interval type-2 fuzzy sets considered in this article are employed to reconstruct the steering system dynamics mathematical model. Based on the fuzzy system, an integral sliding surface is proposed and the asymptotic convergence criterion for the overall system is derived with extended dissipation. Furthermore, an adaptive control law is provided to achieve the reachability of the assigned sliding surface and improve the attenuation ability to unknown curvature and exogenous disturbance. Finally, several scenarios with different path-following tasks are given in the simulations. Results demonstrate that the proposed sliding-mode control method has the capability to track the road centerline and is robust to external unknown disturbances.

AB This paper investigates the fundamental rate performances in the highly promising cellular-enabled unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) swarm networks, which can provide ubiquitous wireless connectivity for supporting various Internet of things (IoT) applications. We first provide the formulations for the sum rate maximization and max-min rate, which are two nonlinear optimization problems subject to the constraints of UAV transmit power and antenna parameters at base station (BS). For the sum rate maximization problem, we propose an iterative algorithm to solve it utilizing the Karush-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT) condition. For the max-min rate problem, we transform it to an equivalent conditional eigenvalue problem based on the nonlinear Perron-Frobenius theory, and thus design an iterative algorithm to obtain the solution of such problem. Finally, numerical results are presented to indicate the effect of some key parameters on the rate performances in such networks.

AB The term unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) was post-applied in the 1980s to describe remotely piloted multi-purpose, unmanned, autonomous aircraft. The terms unmanned aircraft systems with data terminal connectivity (UAS) and remotely piloted aircraft systems (RPV, RPAS-military systems) are also used. This review aims to analyze the feasibility of using UAVs to support emergency medical systems in the supply and urgent care ranges. The implementation of drones in the medical security system requires proper planning of service cooperation, division of the area into sectors, assessment of potential risks and opportunities, and legal framework for the application. A systematic literature search was conducted to assess the applicability based on published scientific papers on possible medical drone applications in the field of urgent mode. The widespread applications of UAVs in healthcare are concerned with logistics, scope, and transportability, with framework legal constraints to effectively exploit opportunities for improving population health, particularly for costly critical situations.

AB Path planning is one of the most important aspects for ambulance driving. A local dynamic path planning method based on the potential field theory is presented in this paper. The potential field model includes two components-repulsive potential and attractive potential. Repulsive potential includes road potential, lane potential and obstacle potential. Considering the driving distinction between an ambulance and a regular vehicle, especially in congested traffic, an adaptive potential function for a lane line is constructed in association with traffic conditions. The attractive potential is constructed with target potential, lane-velocity potential and tailgating potential. The design of lane-velocity potential is to characterize the influence of velocity on other lanes so as to prevent unnecessary lane-changing behavior for the sake of time-efficiency. The results obtained from simulation demonstrate that the proposed method yields a good performance for ambulance driving in an urban area, which can provide support for designing an ambulance support system for the ambulance personnel and dispatcher.

AB Mapping, as the back-end of perception and the front-end of path planning in the modern UAV navigation system, draws our interest. Considering the requirements of UAV navigation and the features of the current embedded computation platforms, we designed and implemented a novel multilayer mapping framework. In this framework, we divided the map into three layers: awareness, local, and global. The awareness map is constructed in cylindrical coordinate, enabling fast raycasting. The local map is a probability-based volumetric map. The global map adopts dynamic memory management, allocating memory for the active mapping area, and recycling the memory from the inactive mapping area. We implemented this mapping framework in three parallel threads: awareness thread, local-global thread, and visualization thread. Finally, we evaluated the mapping kit in both the simulation environment and the real-world scenario with the vision-based sensors. The framework supports different kinds of map outputs for the global or local path planners. The implementation is open-source for the research community.

AB In recent years, the ability to respond to real-time changes in operations, agility in turbulent market environment, and reconfigurability in equipment are likely to become essential characteristics for next generation intralogistics systems to deal with the dynamic environment. The cellular transport system (CTS) that aims at coping with these new requirements provides an efficient way to increase flexibility and changeability of intralogistics systems. The main objective of this paper is to determine the performance of the CTS under various pre-defined scenarios in order to support the design process. Since analytical models have several simplifications and constraints, simulation is used to evaluate the real performance of the CTS. Furthermore, the paper discusses how we apply situated agent-based simulation as a tool for modeling and implementing a decentralized control of the vehicle. Simulation scenarios consist of different physical and environmental factors, such as varying the number of order lines, stochastic demand, number of aisles, number of racks, layout configuration, and number of multishuttle move in the system.

ID EXPLORATION
AB Algorithms to detect diffuse hydrothermal vent fluids using the structured light laser sensor have proven to be successful. However, potential limitations due to survey parameters, including altitude and vehicle heading, have not been explored and are the focus of this study. Data from 12 surveys conducted over a single hydrothermal vent at three different altitudes (2.7 m, 4.2 m, and 6.2 m) and four different headings are analyzed. Increasing survey altitude decreases the resolution and intensity of the imaged laser line; therefore, range-dependent processing considerations to maintain detection sensitivity are presented. Analysis of these surveys suggests minimal degradation of vent detection capabilities from survey altitudes up to 6 m. Additionally, as the shape and location of the detected distortion patterns vary with survey heading and altitude they are presented as potential indications of plume shape and rise height. The effects of range and survey heading are important for future applications of this sensor which may include surveying from higher, faster flying autonomous underwater vehicles.

AB This paper addresses the problem of steering autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) along a desired horizontal path throughout the full-range low-speed and high-speed profiles, experiencing both fullyactuated and under-actuated configurations. First, a nonlinear controller adopting Lyapunov's direct method and backstepping technique is proposed for under-actuated AUV, based on the Line-of-Sight guidance built in a moving Frenet-Serret frame. And then, the controller is adapted to fully-actuated AUV except that the control computation for the evolution of the side-slip angle is different from the case of under-actuated one. Hence, both the fully-actuated and under-actuated configurations are under the same control framework, which enables a smooth continuous transition between two configurations in a synthesized controller. Finally, simulation results illustrate the performance of the proposed control design, where the varied control efforts in the sway direction clearly show the transitions from fullyactuated to under-actuated configuration.

AB Quadrotor type helicopters continue to grow in popularity for academic research and unmanned aerial vehicle applications. However, the model uncertainties caused by battery voltage drop, payload variation and flight condition change, have rarely been considered in control design. This work proposes a quantitative feedback theory based robust design approach to deal with these uncertainties. By analyzing the rigid body dynamics and aerodynamic forces/moments under different voltages, payloads and flight conditions, we model quadrotor dynamics as a set of linear models with parameter uncertainties, which represent a larger flight envelop than models linearized from hover condition. These model uncertainties, as well as the robust stability requirements and performance specifications of flight control system are then used for designing and tuning the controllers, to perform tradeoff between controller complexity, robust requirements, and performance specifications. We also implemented a prototype system, and conducted a serial of experiments in realtime outdoor flights to evaluate its performance. The results show good, robust, and reliable performances of the designed system in autonomous hovering, takeoff, waypoint navigation and landing flights.

AB The world is moving towards applying intelligent technologies in automobiles, with focus on the development of autonomous vehicles. These vehicles are equipped with devices to predict and avoid dangerous situations such as vehicle crashes, pedestrian hits, etc. Such devices are mostly used in pre-crash management but not during crash. Hence, there is a requirement of smart crash energy absorption system that works during crashes and modulates its energy absorption capability as per the severity of crash. Thus, the proposed methodology involves development of mathematical modelling and dynamic simulation of a four-stage collision energy absorption system. The Dodge Neon vehicle is considered as a base model with 4 DoF lumped parameter modelling (LPM). The proposed model is equipped with four impact absorption elements such as a bumper, magneto rheological absorber (MRA), spring, and a piston-cylinder with shear plate assembly, that are in series. The MRA is an intelligent device which plays a vital role to make a system to be smart or semi-active by adjusting the crash absorbing capability while altering the power distribution to MRA as per the severity of crash. The modified Bouc-Wen model is utilized for MRA, which is non-linear in nature, and the spring-dashpot model has been considered for other elements of the proposed system. Dynamic expressions have been derived and simulated to validate the capability of the proposed model against the existing base model. The proposed model exhibits great capability in terms of displacement, deceleration, and time of crash of the occupant's cabin. The proposed design can also be utilized for the electrical vehicles (EVs) as an add-on system because of the absence of crushable mechanical elements.

AB This paper tackles the distributed leader-follower cooperative control problem for networked heterogeneous unmanned aerial vehicle-unmanned ground vehicle (UAV-UGV) systems in unknown environments requiring formation keeping, obstacle avoidance, inter-robot collision avoidance, and reliable robot communications. To adopt various formations, we design a novel negative imaginary (NI) switching formation protocol with a directed dynamic topology. To prevent an inter-mobile robot collision, a new method to formulate the virtual propulsive force between robots is employed. To avoid unexpected obstacles, a new obstacle avoidance technique that allows the UGVs' formation to change its shape and the UGVs' roles is developed. To determine each UGV robot's order in obstacle avoidance formation, a quadrotor UAV, controlled by a strictly negative imaginary controller involving good wind resistance characteristics, tracks the center of formation shape to guarantee the maintaining visibility for multi-robot systems on the ground. The proposed control system's efficacy is investigated through a rigorously comparative study with other control techniques, namely, the performance of artificial potential field and an NI obstacle avoidance strategy using the switching formation control method without switching topology. Finally, we also conduct a stability analysis of the closed-loop control system using the NI-systems theory.

AB Developing conditionally automated driving systems is on the rise. Vehicles with full longitudinal and latitudinal control will allow drivers to engage in secondary tasks without monitoring the roadway, but users may be required to resume vehicle control to handle critical hazards. The loss of driver's situational awareness increases the potential for accidents. Thus, the automated systems need to estimate the driver's ability to resume control of the driving task.
   The aim of this study was to assess the physiological behaviour (heart rate and pupil diameter) of drivers. The assessment was performed during two naturalistic secondary tasks. The tasks were the email and the twenty questions task in addition to a control group that did not perform any tasks. The study aimed at finding possible correlations between the driver's physiological data and their responses to a takeover request. A driving simulator study was used to collect data from a total of 33 participants in a repeated measures design to examine the physiological changes during driving and to measure their takeover quality and response time.
   Secondary tasks induced changes on physiological measures and a small influence on response time. However, there was a strong observed correlation between the physiological measures and response time. Takeover quality in this study was assessed using two new performance measures called PerSpeed and PerAngle. They are identified as the mean percentage change of vehicle's speed and heading angle starting from a take-over request time. Using linear mixed models, there was a strong interaction between task, heart rate and pupil diameter and PerSpeed, PerAngle and response time. This, in turn, provided a measurable understanding of a driver's future responses to the automated system based on the driver's physiological changes to allow better decision making. The present findings of this study emphasised the possibility of building a driver mental state model and prediction system to determine the quality of the driver's responses in a highly automated vehicle. Such results will reduce accidents and enhance the driver's experience in highly automated vehicles.

AB Vehicle dynamics model-aided inertial navigation system (VDM-AINS) is an effective approach for autonomous navigation when the global navigation satellite system (GNSS) fails. However, the accuracy of the vehicle dynamics model (VDM) will decrease, or even diverge, in low-speed and high-dynamic situations, which leads to the performance degradation of the whole system. The traditional VDM-AINS uses the velocity information from VDM to estimate and correct inertial navigation system (INS) errors, but most previous research ignored that the acceleration and angular velocity from INS are more accurate than VDM. To reach the full potential of INS and VDM, this article proposed a three-layer structure for the VDM-AINS. In the proposed method, the navigation information is divided into the sensor layer, system layer I, and system layer II. In the sensor layer, VDM is corrected by INS through the strong tracking cubature Kalman filter (STCKF), and the chi-square test is adopted to avoid redundant computation. In the system layer I, INS is aided by the corrected velocity information from VDM. In the system layer II, the position is updated with the velocity and attitude that are corrected in the system layer I. As the result, VDM and INS can be corrected in different layers simultaneously, and the accuracy and robustness of the whole system can be improved. The simulation experiment proved that, with the sensor layer filter, the velocity errors of VDM can be reduced by 35% in low-speed and high-dynamic situations and reduced by 20% in the normal situation. Then, a 31-min field test shows that the maximum horizontal position error of the proposed method is 241.8 m, while those of two traditional VDM-AINS methods are more than 500 m.

AB The work tackles energy-aware data-gathering problems in clustered robotic networks. A cluster head (CH) robot assigns tasks to other robots which gathers monitoring data from sensors. After executing their assigned tasks, they send the resultant data to it in each cluster. Then, an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) with limited battery capacity collects data from CH robots by visiting a portion of them. Under the limit of battery capacity of UAV, we aim to collect data from CH robots with a minimum cost by visiting a subgroup of CH robots among them. UAV makes a decision on the CH robots to visit by also caring a set of CH robot in addition to its battery capacity and locations of all CH robots. If exists, a nonvisited CH robot sends data to other CH robots for forwarding data. The data forwarding strategy of each nonvisited CH robot is also considered for this cost optimization. Differently from traditional approaches, we consider fixed battery capacity for the UAV. The proposed algorithm is compared for various numbers of CH robots and priority sets by considering the energy consumption of CH robots, which has an influence on the lifetime of the network.

AB The object detection of unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) images has widespread applications in numerous fields; however, the complex background, diverse scales, and uneven distribution of objects in UAV images make object detection a challenging task. This study proposes a convolution neural network transformer hybrid model to achieve efficient object detection in UAV images, which has three advantages that contribute to improving object detection performance. First, the efficient and effective cross-shaped window (CSWin) transformer can be used as a backbone to obtain image features at different levels, and the obtained features can be input into the feature pyramid network to achieve multiscale representation, which will contribute to multiscale object detection. Second, a hybrid patch embedding module is constructed to extract and utilize low-level information such as the edges and corners of the image. Finally, a slicing-based inference method is constructed to fuse the inference results of the original image and sliced images, which will improve the small object detection accuracy without modifying the original network. Experimental results on public datasets illustrate that the proposed method can improve performance more effectively than several popular and state-of-the-art object detection methods.

AB Disguised tailing and visual monitoring of suspicious mobile targets is a promising application of security unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs). But trajectory planning is non-trivial, especially for fixed-wing UAVs with more constrained maneuverability and dynamic models. This paper proposes a new framework to optimize collectively the propulsion power and the three-dimensional (3D) trajectory of a solar-powered, fixed-wing UAV on a disguised tailing and video surveillance mission. The multi-objective optimization strikes a balance between distance keeping, elevation variance, and power efficiency. A key aspect is that we develop a new propulsion power model of the fixed-wing UAV by analyzing the forces undergone while the UAV is ascending or descending. Another important aspect is a series of non-trivial reformulations, which convexify the multi-objective problem progressively with increasingly tightening linear approximation and solve the problem with a polynomial time-complexity. Our algorithm can control the trajectory of the UAV on-the-fly. Simulations confirm that the algorithm outperforms existing schemes in terms of visual disguise and power efficiency. The fixed-wing UAV also demonstrates its advantage of energy efficiency and sustainability to elongate the surveillance mission, over its rotary-wing counterpart.

TI Incorporating Driver Relaxation into Factory Adaptive Cruise Control to

SO TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH RECORD

AB Current adaptive cruise control (ACC) systems adopt a fixed desired time headway, which often leads to abrupt speed changes in response to a close new leader after a cut-in or a lane change. These are disruptive maneuvers. In contrast, human drivers are willing to accept spacings much smaller than equilibrium values at the onset of these maneuvers and then gradually increase the spacing until they again reach equilibrium. This process, which typically lasts around 20 s or 30 s, is known as driver relaxation, which improves comfort and capacity. Therefore, this paper aims to incorporate relaxation into ACC systems. Based on the open-source factory-level ACC platform Openpilot by Comma.ai, the paper proposes a feasible relaxation model compatible with recent market ACC systems. The model is tested using simulation and road tests using a 2019 Honda Civic with its stock ACC hardware. The study further investigates the potential benefits of relaxation ACC on traffic operations. Comparative simulations suggest that incorporating relaxation into ACC can help: (i) reduce the magnitude of speed perturbations in both cut-in vehicles and followers; (ii) stabilize the lane-changing (LC) traffic by reducing the speed variance and preventing the lateral propagation of congestion; and (iii) increase the average flow speed and capacity after a bottleneck occurs.

AB Enhanced vehicle-to-everything (eV2X) communication is one of the key challenges to be addressed by the fifth generation (5G) of cellular mobile communications. In particular, eV2X includes some 5G vehicular applications targeting fully autonomous driving which require ultra-high reliability. Although vehicular communications are by default assumed between single antennas located on the roof of the transmitter and receiver vehicles, prior art has shown that there are other antenna positions more suitable for V2X communication, depending on the specific communication context. Antenna selection can be used in this case to select one specific antenna or a subset of them better suited for a certain communication link. In this work, we propose a context-aware antenna selection procedure able to enhance the communication with multi-antenna vehicles. To enable such scheme in 5G systems, we discuss the necessary signaling to extend current 5G radio resource control and radio resource management mechanisms, which are mainly focused on single-antenna communication. The signaling overhead caused by context exchange for antenna selection is analyzed and compared to the overhead when reference signals are exchanged for that purpose instead. Finally, simulation results for a 5G platooning use case are presented to show the advantages of antenna selection.

AB Benefiting from high mobility and maneuverability, unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) can be flexibly deployed in various wireless networks to improve coverage and connectivity. In this article, the system with a UAV, which relays confidential messages between a couple of unconnected ground nodes with the presence of an eavesdropper is considered. In order to maximize the overall end-to-end secure throughput in a given time period, the joint power allocation and trajectory planning are investigated. The formulated optimization problem is nonconvex, which is difficult to obtain the optimal solution with acceptable complexity. Therefore, we propose an iterative algorithm to achieve a suboptimal solution approximately. In the proposed approach, the joint optimization problem is firstly divided into two subproblems, i.e., the power allocation subproblem and the trajectory planning subproblem. The power is optimized by using the method of successive convex approximation with fixed trajectory, and the trajectory was optimized by successive convex approximation with fixed transmit power. Finally, the power and trajectory are optimized alternately. Since the two subproblems are approximated as convex problems, they can be solved efficiently with acceptable complexity. The simulation results show that remarkable gain in terms of secure throughput can be achieved by the proposed joint optimization algorithm.

AB Automated vehicles (AVs) are ready to share public roads with humans in mixed traffic. How human drivers will interact with AVs is unclear. We assumed that AVs' aberrant behaviors (e.g., driving slowly) provoke higher driving anger than identical ones by human drivers do and examined this assumption from the perspective of mind perception (i.e., perception of whether AVs have human-like minds or lack thereof). Mind perception has two dimensions: agency (capable of doing and planning) and experience (capable of feeling and sensing). Our survey (N = 622) supported this assumption. Agency attribution to AVs is negatively correlated with driving anger, suggesting that perceiving AVs as lacking agency might be associated with greater anger toward AVs' aberrant behaviors. Attributing high agency to AVs eliminated the human-AV difference. The relationship between driving anger and experience attribution was U-shaped: Participants attributing "middle" experience to AVs reported lower anger than those attributing no or "high" experience to AVs. We speculate that perceiving AV as having high capability to feel and sense might induce the "uncanny valley" effect documented in the literature on human-robot interaction, enhancing more negative reactions. Our findings suggest AVs' aberrant behaviors and their induced anger as emerging risks to future mixed-traffic flow.

AB Since outdoor events are gradually allowed within the current pandemic situation, a close monitoring of the crowd activity is needed to avoid undesired contact and disease transmission. In this context, unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) can be occasionally used to watch these activities, to ensure that health measures are applied, and to trigger alerts when an anomaly is detected. Consequently, we propose in this paper a complete UAV framework for intelligent monitoring of post COVID-19 outdoor activities. Specifically, we propose a three-step approach. In the first, captured images are analyzed using machine learning to detect and locate individuals. The second step consists of a novel coordinates mapping approach to evaluate distances among individuals and cluster them, while the third step provides an energy-efficient and reliable UAV trajectory to further inspect clusters for restrictions violation. Obtained results provide important insights towards the efficient design of the framework: 1) Efficient detection of individuals depends on the angle from which the images were captured, 2) coordinates mapping is very sensitive to estimate errors in individuals' bounding boxes, and 3) UAV trajectory design algorithm 2-Opt is recommended for practical real-time deployments due to its low-complexity and near-optimal performance.

AB Outdoor mobile robots must perform operations with ever-increasing speed and distance. Therefore we are interested in designing controllers of fast rovers which improve mobile robot capacity in natural environment. When designing autonomous path tracking systems for fast rovers, a major problem is the dynamic effect and the non-linearity of the model. Several control laws have been designed to resolve the problem by separating the dynamic of the robot at the problem of trajectory tracking.
   This paper presents a path tracking controller for a fast rover with independent front and rear steering. In the first step, a dynamic model of a vehicle that moves on a horizontal plane was developed. Next, the projection of the position of the vehicle in the absolute reference frame was used to define the kinematics non-linear model. We present a new approach to solving a tracking path problem by applying Non-linear Continuous-time Generalized Predictive Control (NCGPC). The controller is based on the dynamic model of a bicycle like vehicle which considers the lateral slippage of the wheels. The prediction model allows anticipation of future changes in setpoints in accordance with the dynamic constraints of the system. Experimental results, show a good control accuracy and appears to be robust with respect to environmental and robot state changes.

AB This article provides a general ergonomic framework of cooperative guidance and control for vehicles with an emphasis on the cooperation between a human and a highly automated vehicle. In the twenty-first century, mobility and automation technologies are increasingly fused. In the sky, highly automated aircraft are flying with a high safety record. On the ground, a variety of driver assistance systems are being developed, and highly automated vehicles with increasingly autonomous capabilities are becoming possible. Human-centred automation has paved the way for a better cooperation between automation and humans. How can these highly automated systems be structured so that they can be easily understood, how will they cooperate with the human? The presented research was conducted using the methods of iterative build-up and refinement of framework by triangulation, i.e. by instantiating and testing the framework with at least two derived concepts and prototypes. This article sketches a general, conceptual ergonomic framework of cooperative guidance and control of highly automated vehicles, two concepts derived from the framework, prototypes and pilot data. Cooperation is exemplified in a list of aspects and related to levels of the driving task. With the concept Conduct-by-Wire', cooperation happens mainly on the guidance level, where the driver can delegate manoeuvres to the automation with a specialised manoeuvre interface. With H-Mode, a haptic-multimodal interaction with highly automated vehicles based on the H(orse)-Metaphor, cooperation is mainly done on guidance and control with a haptically active interface. Cooperativeness should be a key aspect for future human-automation systems. Especially for highly automated vehicles, cooperative guidance and control is a research direction with already promising concepts and prototypes that should be further explored. The application of the presented approach is every human-machine system that moves and includes high levels of assistance/automation. Practitioner Summary: The aim of this article is to sketch a general ergonomic framework of cooperative guidance and control. After a general description, the framework is illustrated through descriptions of two examples for which prototype embodiments have been developed and preliminary evaluations conducted. Major findings of pilot studies show good system performance and acceptance.

AB Traditionally, active traffic management systems (ATM) have included lane management systems (LMS) mounted on overhead gantries to provide merge advisories to human drivers when lanes are closed due to incidents or work zones. Advancements in connected and automated vehicles (CAVs) provide opportunities for developing applications to send advisory messages directly to CAVs, which provides an efficient way of managing traffic. This research develops an enhanced CAV based lane management and control application to overcome the limitations of infrastructure-based systems and improve operations, fuel efficiency, and safety in a mixed autonomy operation of CAVs and human-driven vehicles. Impacts of this approach on operations, fuel efficiency, and safety are compared to traditional LMS using a calibrated simulation model of a site where traditional LMS is present. High fidelity simulation runs of drive cycles were conducted using the Autonomie (R) model to estimate fuel efficiency effects. The simulation results showed that starting at a lower penetration of 20% CAVs, an average throughput improvement of 3.5% was observed, increasing to a maximum of 14.2% for full penetration of CAVs. The drive cycle simulations revealed a reduction of 47% to 60% in fuel consumption with the CAV based application. Both lane change and rear-end conflicts were also observed to reduce. Likewise, volatility represented by acceleration-deceleration variation, was reduced by an average of 18.2% and 17.6% under varying penetrations of CAVs. Volatility represents variation in driving regimes over an instantaneous period of driving, so this reduction in volatility serves as a positive surrogate indicator of safety and fuel efficiency for this new application as well.

AB Rao-Blackwellized particle filter (RBPF) SLAM solutions with Gaussian Process (GP) maps can both maintain multiple hypotheses of a vehicle pose estimate and perform implicit data association for loop closure detection in continuous terrain representations. Both qualities are of particular interest for SLAM with autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) in the open sea, where distinguishable features are scarce. However, the applicability of GP regression to parallel, real-time mapping in an RBPF framework remains limited by the size of the area to survey and the computational cost of the GP training. To overcome these constraints, in this letter we propose the adaption of Stochastic Variational GP (SVGP) regression to online mapping in combination with a novel, efficient particle trajectory storing in the RBPF. We show how the resulting RBPF-SVGP framework can achieve real-time performance in an embedded platform on two AUV surveys containing millions of points. We further test the framework on a live mission on an AUV and we make the implementation publicly available.

AB This paper is concerned with the consensus of a system involving multiple underactuatedautonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs). Combined with a dynamic event-triggered mechanismand a fixed-time stability theorem, the backstepping average consensus controllers are designed.Firstly, the new consensus control objective on the system for multiple underactuated AUVs in abody frame (BF) spherical coordinate system is proposed, and the tracking error kinematic equationsare established based on the kinematic characteristics of the underactuated AUV. The fixed-timeconsensus controller is designed by the backstepping method, and the average consensus theorem isproposed to improve the Lyapunov function. Furthermore, the dynamic event-triggered mechanismis adopted to reduce the communication requirements and energy consumption. This is the firstsolution to the problem of a consensus controller design for a system of multiple underactuatedAUVs. Finally, numerical simulation results demonstrate that the proposed method has superioreffectiveness over alternatives.

AB In this letter, we propose a novel time switching (TS) transmission scheme for intelligent reflecting surface (IRS)-assisted unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)-enabled wireless powered communication network (WPCN). In the energy harvesting (EH) phase, the operation of IRS is switched between energy harvesting and reflecting to improve the energy transfer. In the information transmitting (IT) phase, the operation of IRS is switched between assisted and unassisted IT to avoid the deficient duration of IT phase when the IRS is energy starved. We formulate an achievable sum-rate maximization problem by jointly optimizing the resource allocation, IRS phase shift and location of the UAV. To address the non-convexity resulting from coupling of variables, we divide original problem into three sub-problems and solve them with the block coordinate descent (BCD) method. The numerical results testify that the proposed scheme can obtain the significant sum-rate gain compared to the traditional TS scheme.

AB In this paper, we introduce a distributed autonomous flocking behavior of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) in demanding outdoor conditions, motivated by search and rescue applications. We propose a novel approach for decentralized swarm navigation in the direction of a candidate object of interest (OOI) based on real-time detections from onboard RGB cameras. A novel self-adaptive communication strategy secures an efficient change of swarm azimuth to a higher priority direction based on the real-time detections. We introduce a local visual communication channel that establishes a network connection between neighboring robots without explicit communication to achieve high reliability and scalability of the system. As a case study, this novel method is applied for the deployment of a UAV swarm towards detected OOI for closer inspection and verification. The results of simulations and real-world experiments have verified the intended behavior of the swarm system for the detection of true positive and false positive OOI, as well as for cooperative environment exploration.

AB Electric vertical take-off and landing (eVTOL) constitutes a promising type of personal air vehicle (PAV). This research addresses the urgent need for eVTOL technology development strategies aimed at vitalising eVTOL aircraft commercialisation in South Korea. It does so by evaluating the relative importance and readiness level of technology using the analytic hierarchy process (AHP) and technology readiness level (TRL) analysis, respectively. Expert surveys are conducted based on a previously identified eVTOL technology tree. The ratings are then presented on a four-quadrant importance-performance analysis (IPA) matrix where each eVTOL technology is plotted according to its perceived relative importance and readiness level. The main categories of control autonomous flight and propulsion fall into Quadrant II (high importance and low readiness level), indicating that they constitute the highest priority among categories, and that a fast-follower strategy via the establishment of strategic partnerships should be pursued.

AB This letter presents a learning-based approach to consider the effect of unobservable world states in kinodynamic motion planning in order to enable accurate high-speed off-road navigation on unstructured terrain. Existing kinodynamic motion planners either operate in structured and homogeneous environments and thus do not need to explicitly account for terrain-vehicle interaction, or assume a set of discrete terrain classes. However, when operating on unstructured terrain, especially at high speeds, even small variations in the environment will be magnified and cause inaccurate plan execution. In this letter, to capture the complex kinodynamic model and mathematically unknown world state, we learn a kinodynamic planner in a data-driven manner with onboard inertial observations. Our approach is tested on a physical robot in different indoor and outdoor environments, enables fast and accurate off-road navigation, and outperforms environment-independent alternatives, demonstrating 52.4% to 86.9% improvement in terms of plan execution success rate while traveling at high speeds.

AB The ultra-low resolution underwater terrain maps of the Arctic region reduce the localization and navigation accuracy of the underwater vehicle relying on terrain-aided navigation. In this paper, we study the navigation ability of Autonomous Underwater Vehicles (AUVs) under the ultralow-resolution terrain map. Firstly, the low-resolution map is transformed into a continuous map by bilinear interpolation. Then, a Terrain-Aided Navigation (TAN) system based on the Particle Filter (PF) is constructed to estimate the state of AUV position by particles. Particles of a random distribution of fixed variance can effectively track targets. However, a fixed variance distribution is not well adapted to many different situations. To improve navigation accuracy and robustness, fuzzy logic is used to estimate the distribution variance of particles under the current terrain gradient dynamically. The simulation results show that our proposed Fuzzy-PF TAN system is robust under various current disturbance situations. The position error of our system is within a map resolution unit of 500 m.

The proposed system will be capable to combine the advantages of legged and wheeled locomotion systems, having 3DOF connected through a combination of both rigid and non-rigid joints. This configuration provides the vehicle the ability to absorb impacts and selected external disturbances. A state space approach was adopted to control the joints, increasing the system's stability and adaptability. Throughout this article, the entire design process of this robotic system will be presented, as well as its modeling and control. The proposed system's design is biologically inspired, having as reference the human leg, resulting in the development of a prototype.

AB Multirotors, among all aerial vehicles, are fundamental instruments in many situations, i.e. video recording of sport events, leisure, environmental monitoring before or after a disaster. In particular, in the context of environmental monitoring, the possibility of following a predetermined path while avoiding obstacles is extremely relevant. In this work, we propose a novel method for path definition in presence of obstacles, which describes a curve as the intersection of two surfaces. The planner, based on that path definition along with a Cascaded control architecture and utilizing a nonlinear control technique for both control loops (position and attitude), creates a framework to manipulate the multicopters' behaviors. The method is demonstrated to be able to generate a safe path taking into account obstacles perceived in real-time and avoids collisions. These algorithms are embedded in a software package to control the flight of a fully autonomous AscTec Firefly hexacopter with two cameras and onboard processing capabilities.

AB This paper proposes an approach to robust model predictive control (RMPC) for distributed systems with chain structure. Motivated by the application of a platoon of autonomous vehicles in linear motion, we consider a system structure in which the dynamics of each subsystem is specified in relative error coordinates and in affine form, considering the input of the preceding subsystem as disturbance (since locally not known a-priori). Employing principles of RMPC as suggested before by Kerrigan et al. for the case of non-distributed systems, we first show how robust strong feasibility can be guaranteed for the distributed case. The drawback of this approach is that the zone of robustness is obtained in a relatively conservative form, and that the control error, in general, cannot be forced to zero. Thus, in the second part, we include a scheme for communicating predicted control trajectories between the subsystems in order to improve the control performance and to render the solution less conservative.

ID ALERTING-SYSTEM; COLLISION; PROBABILITY
AB Recent developments have shown that conflict avoidance may be cast as a probabilistic state-space problem. The probabilistic accumulation of risk because of exposure to a hazard over a period of time is an essential and often neglected and misunderstood aspect of the process of conflict risk calculation. How such risk accumulation may be accurately approximated in real time is demonstrated. The research reverts to theoretical basics and illustrates how risk accumulation for a one- and two-vehicle scenario is a first passage time problem. It is illustrated how exact quadratic state-order reduction may be combined with simple and accurate first passage time approximations. In this way, a tractable and accurate receding horizon solution is provided with the recognition of the time dependence of risk accumulation. The solution algorithm is implemented as a relatively straight-forward four-step discrete-time propagation and accumulation of risk. Small calculation errors are characterized to first order-second moment and always lead to a slight upper-bound solution, thereby improving safety. Simulation results indicate a high degree of risk calculation accuracy, calculable in real time.

AB This letter considers the reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS)-aided unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) communication systems in urban areas under the general Rician fading channel. A hybrid offline-online design is proposed to improve the system performance by leveraging both the statistical channel state information (S-CSI) and instantaneous channel state information (I-CSI). For the offline phase, we aim to maximize the expected average achievable rate based on the S-CSI by jointly optimizing the RIS's phase-shift and UAV trajectory. The formulated stochastic optimization problem is difficult to solve due to its non-convexity. To tackle this problem, we propose an efficient algorithm by leveraging the stochastic successive convex approximation (SSCA) techniques. For the online phase, the UAV adaptively adjusts the transmit beamforming and user scheduling according to the effective I-CSI. Numerical results verify that the proposed hybrid design performs better than various benchmark schemes, and also demonstrate a favorable trade-off between system performance and CSI overhead.

AB The development of autonomous detection technology is imperative in the field of construction. The bucket fill factor is one of the main indicators for evaluating the productivity of construction vehicles. Bucket detection is a prerequisite for bucket trajectory planning. However, previous studies have been conducted under ideal environments, a specific single environment, and several normal environments without considering the actual harsh environments at construction sites. Therefore, seven extreme environments are set in this paper to fill this gap, and an effective method is proposed. First, a novel framework for image restoration under extreme environments is proposed. It applies to all tasks conducted by vision on construction sites. Second, a combination of segmentation and classification networks is used for the first time in this area. Multitask learning is used to discover a positive correlation between fill factor estimation and bucket detection. Furthermore, probabilistic methods and transfer learning were introduced, and excellent results were achieved (97.40% accuracy in fill factor estimation and 99.76% accuracy in bucket detection for seven extreme environments).

AB The tractor and trailer units of the semi-trailer truck are connected through the hitch point. The articulation angle is generated when lateral force is applied to the vehicle and it causes the tractor and trailer units to move in different trajectories. When driving on narrow road or large curvature road, considerable level of driving skill is required to drive within the road boundary. If the driver passes through a narrow road without considering the articulation angle, a collision accident may occur to surrounding obstacles or vehicles. In this study, an autonomous driving system was proposed by considering the articulation angle of a semi-trailer truck in a narrow road. Based on the model predictive control, the future trajectory of the semi-trailer truck is predicted and controlled. Collision detection is conducted by using the Separate Axis Theorem and the result is reflected in model predictive control (MPC) constraints. The proposed algorithm is verified using MATLAB Simulink and TruckSim.

In this article, an overview of key barriers and design considerations of widespread commercial use of flying UAVs are presented along with their potential solutions. In addition, we discuss how cellular networks can support UAVs by relying on their advanced features, network intelligence, key enabling technologies for beyond 5G and 6G, and exploiting new tools from machine learning. Finally, we shed light on offering wireless services to high altitudes and the integration of non-terrestrial networks with terrestrial networks toward limitless connectivity in 6G.

TI Infrared object classification with a hybrid optical convolution neural

SO APPLIED OPTICS

DT Article
AB Recent advancements in machine vision have enabled a great range of applications from image classification to autonomous driving. However, there is still a dilemma between the pursuit of higher-resolution training images that require a detector array with more pixels on the front end, and the demands on acquisition for embedded systems restrained by power, transmission bandwidth, and storage. In this paper, a multi-pixel hybrid optical convolutional neural network machine vision system was designed and validated to perform high-speed infrared object detection. The proposed system replicates the front convolution layer in a convolutional neural network utilizing a high-speed digital micro-mirror device to display the first layer of kernels at a resolution greater than the subsequent detector. After this, further convolutions are carried out in software to perform the object recognition. An infrared vehicle dataset was used to validate the performance of the hybrid system through simulation. We also tested this in hardware by performing infrared classification on toy vehicles to showcase the feasibility of such a design. (C) 2021 Optical Society of America

AB Autonomous vehicles (AVs) have been reported to improve road safety, reduce traffic congestion, and increase urban mobility. However, the high price of AVs is currently a challenge for most consumers. Robo-taxi services, with ride-sharing services and AVs, are regarded as a good approach to solving this problem. As some companies have started testing Robo-taxis on the actual road, it has become important to investigate public adoption of Robo-taxi services before they are more widely introduced to the market. This study aims to explain and predict users' acceptance of Robo-taxis by extending the Technology Acceptance Model by including the construct of social influence. Data were collected from an online survey in China and analyzed using linear regression models. The results indicate that perceived usefulness, perceived ease of use, and social influence have significant positive correlations with people's behavior intentions to use Robo-taxis. Perceived ease of use further has an indirect effect on intention to use via perceived usefulness. The results of this study can serve as good references for policymakers, operators, and future transport researchers.

AB The literature on self-driving cars and ethics continues to grow. Yet much of it focuses on ethical complexities emerging from an individual vehicle. That is an important but insufficient step towards determining how the technology will impact human lives and society more generally. What must complement ongoing discussions is a broader, system level of analysis that engages with the interactions and effects that these cars will have on one another and on the socio-technical systems in which they are embedded. To bring the conversation of self-driving cars to the system level, we make use of two traffic scenarios which highlight some of the complexities that designers, policymakers, and others should consider related to the technology. We then describe three approaches that could be used to address such complexities and their associated shortcomings. We conclude by bringing attention to the "Moral Responsibility for Computing Artifacts: The Rules", a framework that can provide insight into how to approach ethical issues related to self-driving cars.

AB For the ongoing revolution in developing intelligent and connected vehicles (ICVs), there is a lack of research for powertrain control systems using the latest artificial intelligence and vehicle-to-everything technology that have already been widely adopted in the autonomous driving systems. In this context, recent development of deep reinforcement learning (DRL) and one of the latest computing frameworks are coupled to facilitate an onboard-based intelligent powertrain control. Taking the boost control of a diesel engine equipped with variable geometry turbocharger as an example, the results show that the final control behavior indicated by the cumulated rewards is improved by 50.43% and the learning efficiency is improved by 74.29% for the proposed curiosity-driven DRL algorithm, compared with the same structure DRL algorithm with classic random exploration policy. In addition, unlike most of the DRL-based powertrain optimization algorithms, which have only been applied to single-machine architecture, this work manages the proposed DRL algorithm in parallel and, more importantly, from an edge computing perspective. This, in addition to greatly speeding up the algorithm training, can also realize a good balance of control accuracy and generality depending upon the selected training scenario. Moreover, unlike most of the cloud computing frameworks, which require low network latency, the proposed architecture can achieve a similar final control performance even if good network communication is not allowed. Compared with other existing powertrain control methods, the proposed algorithm is able to approximate a global powertrain control optimization autonomously in a connected manner, making it attractive to current ICVs with advanced automated driving and traditional powertrain control.

AB With the emerging application of low-level driving automation technology, heterogeneous traffic flow mixed with human-driven vehicles and low-level autonomous vehicles is dawning. In this context, it is imperative to investigate its effect on mixed traffic flow. As a key component for adaptive cruise control (ACC) which is a practical low-level application of driving automation, the time gap policy determines the dynamic of ACC-equipped vehicles and plays a crucial role in traffic flow stability and efficiency. There are two main time gap policies used for ACC at present, namely, constant time gap (CTG) policy and variable time gap (VTG) policy. In this study, we carried out a detailed comparison between these time gap policies to investigate their potential effect on mixed traffic flow, where the analytical- and simulation-based approaches are both considered. Analytical results show that VTG policy is superior to CTG policy in stabilizing the mixed traffic flow. In addition, numerical simulations are also conducted and simulation results further support the analytical results. As for throughput, there is no difference between CTG policy and VTG policy in analytical progress when the same time gap is set at the equilibrium. However, simulation results based on an on-ramp scenario show that the throughput of mixed traffic flow with VTG policy is slightly higher than that of CTG policy. Meanwhile, the scatter of mixed traffic flow with VTG policy in the flow-density diagram gradually clusters in the middle range of density (i.e., 20-40 veh/km) with the increase of the penetration rates of ACC vehicles, where the traffic flow operates more efficiently. These results indicate that VTG policy is better than CTG policy when designing controllers for ACC in the context of traffic flow operation and control.

AB Pulse and glide (PnG) is a longitudinal control strategy that operates vehicles in a more fuel-efficient way than driving at a constant speed. The pulse phase is an acceleration phase, followed by a deceleration, or glide, phase. Former research on PnG had in common that the acceleration profile during the pulse phase is chosen to operate the engine along the course of optimal engine efficiency. However, this optimal strategy will not be accepted by human drivers due to high acceleration values and sudden changes in acceleration. The purpose of this paper is to assess the driveability of the PnG based on the subjective evaluations from test drives and, as a result, to define a PnG operation that is noticeable only to the skeptical customers. The fuel savings of this PnG operation are simulated afterward. The results of this paper reveal that a PnG operation that is noticeable only to skeptical customers is reached if the acceleration value and the absolute values of the jerk are kept below the specific thresholds. Also, the duration of deceleration needs to be limited. Furthermore, the selection of the target gear after exiting sailing needs to be calibrated specifically for PnG to cope with the engine vibrations. Within the identified thresholds, the fuel savings of PnG are larger than 18% below 48 km/h and decrease gradually with increasing speed. Consequently, PnG can be implemented to the drivers' satisfaction, leading to significant fuel savings. Moreover, as we provide a general link between the acceleration and jerk levels and the corresponding ride comfort, the results can directly be implemented in the trajectory planning of further automated longitudinal vehicle control schemes to attain the desired ride comfort.

AB With the rapid development of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), many related applications using UAVs are to monitor air quality in urban, rural, or industrial areas. They often focus on how to monitor the propagation of air pollution when the pollution source is known. However, the pollution source is often unknown and hard to identify because many chimneys will emit smoke in an industrial area. Therefore, we focus on studying the problems of using single and multiple UAVs to detect the pollution source in an industrial area such that the search time is minimized when the locations of UAVs are predetermined, which is termed the air pollution source detection with single UAV (APSD-SUAV) problem and the APSD with multiple UAV (APSD-MUAV) problem, respectively. We also study the same problem if the locations of UAVs are not predetermined, which is termed the UAV deployment and APSD (UAVD-APSD) problem. Then, we propose three heuristics, including the interference-graph-based algorithm (IGBA), the extended IGBA (EIGBA), and the Hungarian-based algorithm (HBA), respectively, for the APSD-SUAV, the APSD-MUAV, and the UAVD-APSD problems. Simulations are conducted to show the performances of the proposed algorithms.

AB Aquatic robotics is making a critical transition to adapt and inspire more efficient systems from nature. The result is the abandonment of inefficient propeller-based locomotion for a biological locomotion type suitable for the specific mission. Bioinspired aquatic unmanned vehicles (AUVs) could be exploited in a diverse range of missions depending on the design and its capabilities. Removing the human pilot and creating an animal-based AUV means that more hazardous aquatic environments can be studied with reduced repercussions. There is a diverse range of biological locomotion's to choose from when developing a bioinspired AUV. The respective animals that exhibit a specific swimming mode give a range of criteria to follow make the system more capable of swimming. In this review, how previous AUV developers determined the kinematic, physical, and hydrodynamic modeling of these systems are consolidated and discussed. All types of developed actuators are reviewed, organized, and explained based on their materials and motion capabilities. The electronic components of these systems are outlined to give an idea of how these bioinspired AUVs are constructed. Then, it is discussed what makes these systems bioinspired and biomimetic, and the trends of these designs. Limitations and future recommendations on possible improvements for these systems are offered and deeply discussed.

AB On-line anomaly detection is critical for the safety of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs). However, the flight status assessment still depends on ground control stations, which cannot meet the time requirement for autonomous and safe flight. The lack of on-board intelligent anomaly detection systems makes it rather difficult for on-line flight status estimation and assessment. In order to achieve real-time monitoring of UAV flight status and enhance the reliability and safety of UAVs, an embedded intelligent system is designed to address the challenging issues of UAV on-line anomaly detection in this paper. During the flight, the status of sensors and key components are continuously detected via flight data which can reflect the current status of the UAV. The proposed embedded anomaly detection system includes two main parts: (1) a general heterogeneous computing architecture which is based on Xilinx Zynq-7000 SoC with dual-core Cortex A9 processors and Field Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGA), (2) an on-line anomaly detection intelligent algorithm which is based on least squares support vector machine (LS-SVM) prediction model and utilized as a demonstration that needs high computing performance. The simulation flight data are used to verify the proposed system, and the experimental results show that the proposed intelligent system is capable of effective UAV on-line anomaly detection.

AB Cybersecurity is increasingly important for the safety and reliability of autonomous vehicles. The controller area network (CAN) is the most widely used in-vehicle network for automotive safety-critical applications. Enhancing the cybersecurity ability of CAN while considering the real-time, schedulability, and cost constraints becomes an urgent issue. To address this problem, a real-time, and schedulability analysis-guaranteed security mechanism [identification hopping CAN (IDH-CAN)] is proposed in this paper, which aims to improve the security performance of CAN under the constraints of automotive real-time applications. In order to support the operation of the IDH-CAN mechanism, an IDH-CAN controller is also designed and implemented on a field-programmable gate array, which can work as a hardware firewall in the data link layer of CAN to isolate cyberattacks from the physical layer. Meanwhile, to maximize the information entropy of the CAN message ID on the physical layer, the ID hopping table generation and optimization algorithms for IDH-CAN are also proposed. Then, information security evaluation experiments based on information entropy comparison are deployed. The simulation and practical evaluations demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed mechanism in defending reverse engineering, targeted denial of service, and replay attacks without violating real-time and schedulability constraints.

AB Conventional pressure-sinkage models of characterizing bearing properties of terrains for vehicles are semi-empirical with poor adaptability and extrapolation ability; definitions of parameters are nonintuitive. The purpose of this paper is to provide more general and high-fidelity models for terrain characterization to satisfy the high requirements of autonomous wheeled vehicles, which should "understand" terramechanics in an accurate way on off-road terrains. Based on the analysis of conventional models and experimental results, new perspective and related equations on characterizing bearing performance are proposed. The stiffness modulus which is an intrinsic terrain parameter with determined unit of Pa/m has dominant role in governing the bearing performance. The sinkage exponent is variable as the function of various influential factors. Numerical analysis verifies that the new model with two meaningful parameters has high goodness of fit with Bekker's model. Experimental results verifies that the new model using constant stiffness modulus and variable sinkage exponent reflects key factors such as dynamic sinkage, dimension effect, payload effect, and lug effect with high fidelity, which are not considered by the conventional models. This concept could be applied to various terrains and conventional vehicles. (C) 2014 ISTVS. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The use of resources in autonomous vehicles when manoeuvring along changing terrain is an issue yet to be faced in the industrial field, such as mining and agriculture, where automated machinery performs repetitive tasks. If the machinery is not capable to overcome such terrain disturbances during its motion, the vehicle spends more energy than the necessary as the motion controller is adapted to the new terramechanical scenario. The latter usually includes a re-tuning of the controller and the corresponding loss of man-hours until obtaining the desired responses. In this context, we propose a self-tuning methodology based on probabilistic approaches and machine learning techniques to improve the performance of the controllers through reducing trajectory tracking errors and control input efforts, as the vehicle repeats its trajectory and learns from the wheel-terrain interaction. Three degree-of-freedom motion controllers are used to test our techniques, although our proposal is not restricted to the nature of such controllers. For the validation of our hypothesis, we considered three tests: one is performed via simulation using a modified kinematic model of the vehicle and slippage constraints, whereas other two extensive trials were carried out in field using an electric vehicle-Twizy, made by Renault - under different types of shaped trajectories and irregular terrain. In particular, two terrains: grass and muddy, and their transitions. The metrics used herein and previously published in the literature have shown that the self-tuning methodologies proposed in this work decreases the trajectory tracking errors up to 18%, saves energy in the effort input of the actuators up 15%, and in general, increases the performance of the controllers up to 22% when compared to efficient manual tuning. The experimental results as well as the statistical analysis of our proposal are presented in detail herein. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB In the field of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) mission planning, autonomous route planning in complex 3D environments represents a crucial aspect. To enhance the utilization of valuable information and increase search efficiency when solving path planning problems in 3D environments, a novel UAV route planning algorithm named WG-GWO is proposed with a waypoint guidance and an adaptive evolution strategy. Initially, we introduce a novel waypoint extraction method based on cubic B-spline to harness crucial information from individuals eliminated during the evolutionary process. Subsequently, an adaptive evolutionary direction selection strategy is introduced, which utilizes historical information and a differential operator to improve the search ability. The WG-GWO also incorporates L e & PRIME;vy flight to prevent premature convergence to local minimums. Simulation results validate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm, demonstrating that WG-GWO outperforms several existing algorithms in generating feasible routes and achieving faster convergence speeds across various scenarios. These results suggest that WG-GWO holds potential for practical engineering applications.& COPY; 2023 The Franklin Institute. Published by Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Route planning considering terrain information is useful for the navigation of autonomous ground vehicles (AGV) on complicated terrain surfaces, such as mountains with rivers. For instance, an AGV in mountains cannot cross a river or a valley that is too steep. This article addresses a novel route-planning algorithm that is time-efficient in building a sub-optimal route considering terrain information. In order to construct a route from the start to the end point in a time-efficient manner, we simulate two virtual vehicles that deploy virtual nodes iteratively, such that the connected node network can be formed. The generated node network serves as a topological map for a real AGV, and we construct the shortest route from the start to the end point utilizing the network. The route is weighted considering the route length, the steepness of the route, and the traversibility of the route. Through MATLAB simulations, we demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed route-planning algorithm by comparing it with RRT-star planners.

AB The unmanned air vehicle (UAV) industry is prophesized to play a profoundly vital role in global technological advancement. The emerging global market for drone-powered solutions is valued at 127 billion dollars, and a projected increase in the number of UAVs between 2017 and 2022 is from 1.1 to 2.4 million. This increased UAV usage will cause an ecstatic burden on the airspace resulting in collisions and interference, possibly damaging property and endangering human lives. Hence, the need for a regulatory system which can route UAV operations is inevitable. This paper discusses the need for an autonomous UAV Traffic Management System (UTMS) in the Indian context and presents a requirement analysis of the proposed system. Subsequently, this paper presents a broad preliminary analysis, followed by a broad generic architecture of the overall system. This proposed architecture is expected to play a crucial in defining the physical architecture and developing the much needed UTMS for the public domain in India and the world.

AB Moving object classification is essential for autonomous vehicle to complete high-level tasks like scene understanding and motion planning. In this paper, we propose a novel approach for classifying moving objects into four classes of interest using 3D point cloud in urban traffic environment. Unlike most existing work on object recognition which involves dense point cloud, our approach combines extensive feature extraction with the multiframe classification optimization to solve the classification task when partial occlusion occurs. First, the point cloud of moving object is segmented by a data preprocessing procedure. Then, the efficient features are selected via Gini index criterion applied to the extended feature set. Next, Bayes Decision Theory (BDT) is employed to incorporate the preliminary results from posterior probability Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier at consecutive frames. The point cloud data acquired from our own LIDAR as well as public KITTI dataset is used to validate the proposed moving object classification method in the experiments. The results show that the proposed SVM-BDT classifier based on 18 selected features can effectively recognize the moving objects.

TI Ricochet Characteristics of AUVs during Small-Angle Water Entry Process
SO MATHEMATICAL PROBLEMS IN ENGINEERING
LA English
DT Article
ID IMPACT; HYDROELASTICITY; VEHICLE
AB When the autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) enters the water at a small angle, the head of the AUV will be subjected to a torque that causes it to rise, which may cause the AUV to ricochet. The occurrence of ricochet will have an important impact on the trajectory stability of the AUV. In this paper, the finite element method-smoothed particle hydrodynamics (FEM-SPH) coupling algorithm, which absorbs the high efficiency of FEM and the advantages of SPH in dealing with large deformation and meshes distortion, is used to study the small-angle water entry problem of the AUV numerically. In the coupled FEM-SPH algorithm, discrete particles were used to model the zone of water, while the part of the AUV was modeled with finite elements. A contact algorithm couples the finite elements and the particles. Particular attention was paid to the influence of different head hemisphere angles and different initial conditions on the ricochet trajectory of the AUV. The critical conditions and influencing factors of the AUV ricochet phenomenon were given.

DE Occupancy probability; road surface marker; auto parking; around view
   monitoring (AVM); Bayesian filter
AB Many car makers have examined parking assistance systems and auto parking systems that automatically find free parking spaces and can park a car. The around view monitoring (AVM) can compensate for the disadvantages of distance-sensor-based detect' because it can recognize parking spaces based on parking slot markers instead of empty spaces. However. in the ease of AVM-based parking marker recognition, false-positive (FP) features can be detected from 3-D objects and shadows, and the parking slot marker is occluded by the vehicle on which the AVM camera is attached. In this paper, we propose a probabilistic occupancy filter to detect parking slot markers. This filter uses a series of AVM images and onboard sensors to improve the occlusion problem and reduce the FPs from other objects. Each pixel of an AVM image has an occupancy probability of parking slot marker features. The occupancy probability compensates for using vehicle motion and updates using the error model of the AVM system and the performance indicator of the feature extractor.

AB In this article, a collaborative relay tracking method based on information fusion is proposed for unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs). Target matching is performed by combining the target's spatiotemporal information with its appearance and other auxiliary cues. Only the motion information and a compressed image of the target are used for target handover. Specifically, to determine the spatiotemporal transfer probability of the target after entering the blind area of visual field, this article proposes a spatiotemporal correlation model construction method to predict the spatiotemporal similarity. Besides, Siam-LGNet is proposed in this article for target appearance matching to overcome the effects of various view angles, rotations, scale changes, and other factors on the images. This effectively ensures the accuracy of target matching and lowers the model complexity. In addition, similarities obtained from multiple cues are fused by D-S evidence theory to compensate for the uncertainty of single cue. Finally, the effectiveness of the proposed method is verified in simulation experiments and physical experiments. This article fills a gap in the field of UAVs relay tracking. The proposed scheme is scalable and lays the foundation for subsequent research on UAVs relay tracking problems.

AB Vehicular edge computing (VEC) is a new computing paradigm that enhances vehicular performance by introducing both computation offloading and service caching, to resource-constrained vehicles and ubiquitous edge servers. Recent developments of autonomous vehicles enable a variety of applications that demand high computing resources and low latency, such as automatic driving, auto navigation, etc. However, the highly dynamic topology of vehicular networks and limited caching space at resource-constrained edge servers calls for intelligent design of caching placement and computation offloading. Meanwhile, service caching decisions are highly correlated to the computation offloading decisions, which pose a great challenge to effectively design service caching and computation offloading strategies. In this paper, we investigate a joint optimization problem by integrating service caching and computation offloading in a general VEC scenario with time-varying task requests. To minimize the average task processing delay, we formulate the problem using long-term mixed integer non-linear programming (MINLP) and propose an algorithm based on deep reinforcement learning to obtain a suboptimal solution with low computation complexity. The simulation results demonstrate that our proposed scheme exhibits an effective performance improvement in task processing delay compared with other representative benchmark methods.

AB A system level methodology is presented for soft failure detection and analysis in small unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) system, induced by radio frequency interference (RFI). This method includes a radio frequency test system based on the equivalent dynamic test method, and soft failure detection and identification method based on ground control station observation records and system log analysis. By designing signal forwarding system for global positioning system, the equivalent dynamic flight state of the UAV is realized. Through the application of standard radiated susceptibility test methods, the effects of RFI with multiple interference levels covering the frequency range from 2 MHz to 3 GHz on small UAV systems have been investigated. RFI is coupled into the UAV system through the antenna coupling and cable coupling. Soft failure modes are classified and failure analysis is mainly carried out through system log analysis, combined with full-wave simulation analysis, the root cause of the soft failure is determined. The understanding of the soft failure mode and susceptibility is beneficial to the design of UAV system, improving the robustness of software and hardware.

AB The recent years have seen a rise in the incorporation and integration of new smart connected devices and platforms such as Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) to the ubiquitous network of Internet of Things (IoT). UAVs not only offer new means of delivering value-added IoT services through a wide range of applications ranging from monitoring and surveillance to on-demand last-mile delivery and people transport, but they also promise a pragmatic solution to the limitations of fixed terrestrial IoT infrastructure. Owning to their potential, UAVs are expected to soon be an integral part of our cities, dominating the shared low-altitude airspace. This introduces new research challenges in privacy, security and most notably in the safe management of UAVs' operation under high traffic demands. To this end, this work presents a holistic study on the current state-of-the-art of UAVs and low-altitude airspace traffic management. This work additionally explores the technical standardisation landscape and highlights synergies between scientific research and standardisation efforts towards enabling safe UAV operations, while taking into consideration additional IoT inherent challenges such as security, data protection and privacy.

AB Advanced and accurate modelling of a Flapping Wing Micro Air Vehicle (FW MAV) and its control is one of the recent research topics related to the field of autonomous MAVs. Some desiring features of the FWMAV are quick flight, vertical take-off and landing, hovering, and fast turn, and enhanced manoeuvrability contrasted with similar-sized fixed and rotary wing MAVs. Inspired by the FW MAV's advanced features, a four-wing Nature-inspired (NI) FW MAV is modelled and controlled in this work. The Fuzzy C-Means (FCM) clustering algorithm is utilized to construct the data-driven NIFW MAV model. Being model free, it does not depend on the system dynamics and can incorporate various uncertainties like sensor error, wind gust etc. Furthermore, a Takagi-Sugeno (T-S) fuzzy structure based adaptive fuzzy controller is proposed. The proposed adaptive controller can tune its antecedent and consequent parameters using FCM clustering technique. This controller is employed to control the altitude of the NIFW MAV, and compared with a standalone Proportional Integral Derivative (PID) controller, and a Sliding Mode Control (SMC) theory based advanced controller. Parameter adaptation of the proposed controller helps to outperform it static PID counterpart. Performance of our controller is also comparable with its advanced and complex counterpart namely SMC-Fuzzy controller.

AB The Global Positioning System (GPS) is the most widely used navigation system in land vehicle applications. In urban areas, the GPS suffers from insufficient signal strength, multipath propagation and non-line-of-sight (NLOS) errors, so it thus becomes difficult to obtain accurate and reliable position information. In this paper, an integration algorithm for multiple receivers is proposed to enhance the positioning performance of GPS for land vehicles in urban areas. The pseudoranges of multiple receivers are integrated based on a tightly coupled approach, and erroneous measurements are detected by testing the closeness of the pseudoranges. In order to fairly compare the pseudoranges, GPS errors and terms arising due to the differences between the positions of the receivers need to be compensated. The double-difference technique is used to eliminate GPS errors in the pseudoranges, and the geometrical distance is corrected by projecting the baseline vector between pairs of receivers. In order to test and analyze the proposed algorithm, an experiment involving live data was performed. The positioning performance of the algorithm was compared with that of the receiver autonomous integrity monitoring (RAIM)-based integration algorithm for multiple receivers. The test results showed that the proposed algorithm yields more accurate position information in urban areas.

AB An important concept proposed in the early stage of robot path planning field is the shrinking of the robot to a point and meanwhile expanding of the obstacles in the workspace as a set of new obstacles. The resulting grown obstacles are called the Configuration Space (Cspace) obstacles. The find-path problem is then transformed into that of finding a collision free path for a point robot among the Cspace obstacles. However. the research experiences obtained so far have shown that the calculation of the Cspace obstacles is very hard work when the following Situations occur: 1. both the robot and obstacles are not polygons and 2. the robot is allowed to rotate. This situation is even worse when the robot and obstacles are three dimensional (3D) objects with various shapes. Obviously a direct path planning approach without the calculation of the Cspace obstacles is strongly needed. This paper presents Such a new real-time robot path planning approach which. to the best Of our knowledge, is the first one in the robotic community. The fundamental ideas are the utilization of inequality and optimization technique. Simulation results have been presented to show its merits.

AB In vehicles for autonomous driving, light detection and ranging (LiDAR) is one of the most used sensors, along with cameras. LiDAR sensors that produce a large amount of data in one scan make it difficult to transmit and calculate data in real-time in the vehicle's embedded system. In this paper, we propose a platform based on semantic depth data-based data reduction and reconstruction algorithms that reduce the amount of data transmission and minimize the errors between original and restored data in a vehicle system using four LiDAR sensors. The proposed platform consists of four LiDAR sensors, an integrated processing unit (IPU) that reduces the data of the LiDAR sensors, and the main processor that reconstructs the reduced data and processes the image. In the proposed platform, the 58,000 bytes of data constituting one frame detected by the VL-AS16 LiDAR sensor were reduced by an average of 87.4% to 7295 bytes by the data reduction algorithm. In the IPU placed near the LiDAR sensor, the memory usage increased by the data reduction algorithm, but the data transmission time decreased by an average of 40.3%. The transmission time where the vehicle's processor received one frame of data decreased from an average of 1.79 ms to 0.28 ms. Compared with the original LiDAR sensor data, the reconstructed data showed an average error of 4.39% in the region of interest (ROI). The proposed platform increased the time required for image processing in the vehicle's main processor by an average of 6.73% but reduced the amount of data by 87.4% with a decrease in data accuracy of 4.39%.

TI YOLO-SSFS: A Method Combining SPD-Conv/STDL/IM-FPN/SIoU for Outdoor
   Small Target Vehicle Detection
SO ELECTRONICS
LA English
DT Article
DE vehicle detection; small target detection; YOLOv5s; deep learning
AB As a vital part of autonomous driving, vehicle detection, especially for outdoor small target vehicles, has attracted great attention from researchers during recent years. To ameliorate the difficulty in accurately identifying outdoor small vehicle targets in dense environments, this paper proposes a new structure named YOLO-SSFS, in which SPD-Conv, a small target detection layer (STDL), the Improved Feature Pyramid Network structure (IM-FPN), and the SCYLLA-IoU (SIoU) loss function are introduced. Firstly, the multi-scale fusion module of the original algorithm is improved by adding a detection layer for smaller targets. This detection layer preserves shallow semantic information, which helps to refine the algorithm's detection accuracy for small targets. Then, a new Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) building block named SPD-Conv is constructed to replace the pooling layers and convolutional layers in the YOLOv5 algorithm, which reduces information loss, ensures the original fine-grained details of the image and improves the learning ability. Afterwards, a new FPN structure is created to retain more information conducive to small target detection during the feature fusion process so as to enhance the robustness of the method. Finally, to speed up the convergence of the loss function, the SIoU loss function is introduced to replace Complete-IoU (CIoU) in the original algorithm. In order to verify the authenticity of the improved algorithm, we conduct a series of experiments on the VisDrone dataset and perform comparative analyses of the results. The results obtained demonstrate that compared with the original YOLOv5, the proposed model performs better in small target detection. The mean average precision (mAP) is 83.07%, which is 7.63% higher than that for YOLOv5, while the detection speed reaches 52 frames per second (FPS), meeting the requirements for real-time detection.

AB This paper addresses the problem of studying the impacts of the strategic formation of platoons in automated mobility-on-demand (AMoD) systems in future cities. Forming platoons has the potential to improve traffic efficiency, resulting in reduced travel times and energy consumption. However, in the platoon formation phase, coordinating the vehicles at formation locations for forming a platoon may delay travelers. In order to assess these effects, an agent-based model has been developed to simulate an urban AMoD system in which vehicles travel between service points transporting passengers either forming or not forming platoons. A simulation study was performed on the road network of the city of The Hague, Netherlands, to assess the impact on traveling and energy usage by the strategic formation of platoons. Results show that forming platoons could save up to 9.6% of the system-wide energy consumption for the most efficient car model. However, this effect can vary significantly with the vehicle types and strategies used to form platoons. Findings suggest that, on average, forming platoons reduces the travel times for travelers even if they experience delays while waiting for a platoon to be formed. However, delays lead to longer travel times for the travelers with the platoon leaders, similar to what people experience while traveling in highly congested networks when platoon formation does not happen. Moreover, the platoon delay increases as the volume of AMoD requests decreases; in the case of an AMoD system serving only 20% of the commuter trips (by private cars in the case-study city), the average platoon delays experienced by these trips increase by 25%. We conclude that it is beneficial to form platoons to achieve energy and travel efficiency goals when the volume of AMoD requests is high.

AB Intelligent Transportation System (ITS) has become the need of the day to manage heavy traffic problems due to the exponential growth of road transportation. This is also very much essential for building the smart cities and to improve the comfort of the vehicle drivers. The electric and autonomous vehicles are going to be the future transport systems for which we need an intelligent traffic management system. This requires a lot of growth in infrastructure. The integration of technologies such as Sensors, Internet of Things (IoT), Cloud Computing, etc. has to be done for this. The traffic prediction is one of thekey requirement for establishing the ITS. In this paper we present our study on ARIMA model with optimized hyper-parameter using grid search technique for traffic flow predictions. The model validation is done on the whole day traffic flow, morning and evening peak time traffic flow datasets. The prediction results show good performance metrics with RMSE of 8.953, 11.007 and 11.837 for those three datasets.

AB The hydrodynamic characteristics of autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) play a significant role in the design and analysis of their maneuverability. This paper evaluates the effects of the Reynolds (Re) number on the hydrodynamic characteristics of AUV for various angles of attack (AOA). To estimate the hydrodynamic parameters, a numerical modelling based on computational fluid dynamics (CFD) is employed. Reynolds numbers between 2 x 10(6) and 150 x 10(6) were examined at -10 degrees to 10 degrees AOAs. Experimental tests for the same AUV in Re = 2 x 10(6) in the water tunnel were carried out for CFD validation. A comparison of the results showed an acceptable agreement between the numerical method and the experimental results. The results show that hydrodynamic parameters can be a function of Re and converge on a constant in a limited value when the Re number increases. Results of independent parameters, can be used for full-scale without the establishment of dynamic similarity.

AB Searching and containing dynamic target like oil spillage in the ocean is a challenging task due to the natural time variance of the spread of the oil. The use of cooperative multi-marine vehicle systems in a cluttered environment for this purpose poses difficulties in sustaining formation pattern to pursue and contain the leakage. In this article, in order to provide realistic setup for the industrial applications of multi-marine vehicles systems, we present a novel approach for collision-free distributed formation control for a network of underactuated surface vessels (USVs). The proposed approach comprises two layers: A distributed coordination layer and a local fixed-time neural network control layer. In the first layer, formation leaders accomplish a specified formation configuration while tracking a desired trajectory from a tracking leader. The second control layer is to robustly drive the real USVs with parametric and nonparametric uncertainties to track their corresponding formation leaders. Because only parts of the formation leaders can acquire the states of the tracking leader, a distributed fixed-time estimator is proposed to obtain accurate estimations of the desired information for each USV in the network. Next, in order to effectively maneuver in cluttered environment, local path replanning-based repulsive potential function technique is proposed for each USV in the group formation to act on the formation leaders trajectories. Further, redesigned adaptive neural networks are integrated to compensate the model uncertainties. The stability of the proposed controller is verified by the Lyapunov direct method. Simulation studies of a hexagon formation are presented to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach.

AB A dashboard camera (Dashcam) is attached to the front or rear of a vehicle to record images and video. As it is effective in crime prevention and accident management and it can also be used as learning data for Traffic Accident Detection technology for Autonomous Vehicles the use of Dashcam is increasing. However, the video data is stored on a memory card or a cloud server, so there is a high possibility of data loss and forgery. Although it is possible to prevent forgery and falsification using distributed storage based on blockchain technology, the authenticity and privacy of the image data stored in the blockchain cannot be guaranteed. In this study, to solve this problem, we propose a multi-signature-based access control method by grouping and storing video data of multiple vehicles based on GPS (Global Positioning System) data. To ensure the privacy of the video data stored in the blockchain, only users uploading video belonging to the relevant GPS can access nearby Dashcam videos. Through these experimental results, it show that Experimental results proposed method can maintain low latency in large-scale request environment to the privacy and reach data management efficiently in a distributed file system. According to our experiments, the dashcam video data distributed storage latency was fast enough, with an average of 25 ms for uploads and less than 15 ms for downloads. The signature generation time is 10ms, and the verification time required for access control is also less than 100 ms, which is the same even if the number of nodes increases, so scalability is not affected. The blockchain transaction processing took about 2 seconds, but it does not affect the V2V network. Also, client registration time does not affect performance.

AB Smart vehicles with embedded Autonomous Vehicle (AV) technologies are currently equipped with different types of mounted sensors, aiming to ensure safe movement for both passengers and other road users. The sensors' ability to capture and gather data to be synchronically interpreted by neural networks for a clear understanding of the surroundings is influenced by lighting conditions, such as natural lighting levels, artificial lighting effects, time of day, and various weather conditions, such as rain, fog, haze, and extreme temperatures. Such changing environmental conditions are also known as complex environments. In addition, the appearance of other road users is varied and relative to the vehicle's perspective; thus, the identification of features in a complex background is still a challenge. This paper presents a pre-processing method using multi-sensorial RGB and thermal camera data. The aim is to handle issues arising from the combined inputs of multiple sensors, such as data registration and value unification. Foreground refinement, followed by a novel statistical anomaly-based feature extraction prior to image fusion, is presented. The results met the AV challenges in CNN's classification. The reduction of the collected data and its variation level was achieved. The unified physical value contributed to the robustness of input data, providing a better perception of the surroundings under varied environmental conditions in mixed datasets for day and night images. The method presented uses fused images, robustly enriched with texture and feature depth and reduced dependency on lighting or environmental conditions, as an input for a CNN. The CNN was capable of extracting and classifying dynamic objects as vehicles and pedestrians from the complex background in both daylight and nightlight images.

AB Energy costs account for a significant proportion of total costs in production systems. Since energy is becoming an increasingly expensive resource, therefore, it is critical to consume it as efficiently as possible. Focusing on energy efficiency is also important in terms of reducing greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and the effects of other pollutants on the environment. One of the possible ways for businesses to reduce energy consumption is to use available transportation means as efficiently as possible. In the operational phase, this can be achieved by reducing unnecessary transport, selecting the most efficient delivery routes, and by optimized assignment of available vehicles to transportation orders. We present in this article a novel dynamic assignment of transportation orders to fleet with energy minimization criterion in internal transport system of a printing company. The novelty of the proposed model is that, in contrast to most existing models, it can handle a heterogeneous fleet of human-operated and autonomous mobile robots (AMRs). The minimization of the energy consumption by transportation vehicles was modeled with reference to VDI 2198 standard. The need for such a model is justified by the fact that it better reflects a real production environment in many companies. The proposed optimization model was tested in simulation experiments imitating real production conditions in a large web printing house. The obtained results show that the proposed model allows for a significant reduction of energy consumption in internal transportation. The proposed model is general enough to be used in various companies with a heterogeneous fleet of internal transportation vehicles. In addition, the energy consumption factor VDI for AMRs has been determined, which can be useful in solving various problems related to energy optimization of internal transportation.

DE Urban air mobility; eVTOL; Risk domain; Fairness-awareness; Risk-bounded

AB Collision avoidance is an important issue in the field of the autonomous operations of aerial vehicles in dynamic and uncertain urban environments. This paper introduces a risk-bounded and fairness-aware path planning algorithm for multiple electrical vertical take-off and landing (eVTOL) aircraft operating in such environments. This algorithm advances the sampling-based path planning with the risk domain formulation to generate stochastically safety assured collision-free paths that are robust to both vehicle and environmental obstacle uncertainties for multiple eVTOL aircraft. To address the concern of flight fairness between different eVTOLs in the free flight airspace, the strategy of permit assignment is introduced. By incorporating the risk domain formulation into the sampling-based path planning with the strategy of permit assignment, the algorithm proposed in this paper not only inherits the computational advantage of the sampling-based methods, but also guarantees a stochastically feasible flying zone at every time step. Simulation studies demonstrate the promising performance of the proposed algorithm. (c) 2022 Elsevier Masson SAS. All rights reserved.

AB Route planning for multiple Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) is a series of translation and rotational steps from a given start location to the destination goal location. The goal of the route planning problem is to determine the most optimal route avoiding any collisions with the obstacles present in the environment. Route planning is an NP-hard optimisation problem. In this paper, a newly proposed Salp Swarm Algorithm (SSA) is used, and its performance is compared with deterministic and other Nature-Inspired Algorithms (NIAs). The results illustrate that SSA outperforms all the other meta-heuristic algorithms in route planning for multiple UAVs in a 3D environment. The proposed approach improves the average cost and overall time by 1.25% and 6.035%, respectively, when compared to recently reported data. Route planning is involved in many real-life applications like robot navigation, self-driving car, autonomous UAV for search and rescue operations in dangerous ground-zero situations, civilian surveillance, military combat and even in commercial services like package delivery by drones.

AB Dynamic obstacle avoidance is essential for unmanned surface vehicles (USVs) to achieve autonomous sailing. This paper presents a dynamic navigation ship domain (DNSD)-based dynamic obstacle avoidance approach for USVs in compliance with COLREGs. Based on the detected obstacle information, the approach can not only infer the collision risk, but also plan the local avoidance path trajectory to make appropriate avoidance maneuvers. Firstly, the analytical DNSD model is established taking into account the ship parameters, maneuverability, sailing speed, and encounter situations regarding COLREGs. Thus, the DNSDs of the own and target ships are utilized to trigger the obstacle avoidance mode and determine whether and when the USV should make avoidance maneuvers. Then, the local avoidance path planner generates the new avoidance waypoints and plans the avoidance trajectory. Simulations were implemented for a single obstacle under different encounter situations and multiple dynamic obstacles. The results demonstrated the effectiveness and superiority of the proposed DNSD-based obstacle avoidance algorithm.

AB We investigated whether motion sickness analogous to carsickness can be studied in a moving base simulator, despite the limited motion envelope. Importantly, to avoid simulator sickness, vision outside the simulator cabin was restricted. Participants (N = 16) were exposed blindfolded to 15-min lateral sinusoidal motion at 0.2 Hz and 0.35 Hz on separate days. These conditions were selected to realize optimal provocativeness of the stimulus given the simulator's maximum displacement and knowledge on frequency-acceleration interactions for motion sickness. Average motion sickness on an 11-point scale was 2.21 +/- 1.97 for 0.2 Hz and 1.93 +/- 1.94 for 0.35 Hz. The motion sickness increase over time was comparable to that found in studies using actual vehicles. We argue that motion base simulators can be used to incite motion sickness analogous to carsickness, provided considerable restrictions on vision. Future research on carsickness, potentially more prevalent in autonomous vehicles, could benefit from employing simulators.

AB Collective motion is a promising field that studies how local interactions lead groups of individuals to global behaviors. Biologists try to understand how those subjects interplay in nature, and engineers are concerned with the application of interaction strategies to mobile vehicles, satellites, robots, etc. There are several models in literature that employ strategies observed in groups of beings in nature. The aim is not to literally mimic them but to extract suitable strategies for the chosen application. These models, constituted of multiple mobile agents, can be used in tasks such as data collection, surveillance and monitoring. One approach is to use phasecoupled oscillators to design the mobile agents, in which each member is an oscillator and they are coupled according to an interconnection network. This design usually does not keep track and handle the possible collisions within the group, and real applications obviously must manage these situations to prevent the equipment from crashing. This paper introduces a collision avoidance mechanism to a model of particles with phase-coupled oscillators dynamics for symmetric circular formations.

ID MOBILE ROBOT
AB A global localization system combining odometry data with radio frequency identification (RFID) readings is proposed. RFID tags are placed at the ceiling of the environment and can be detected by a mobile robot unit traveling below them. The detection of the tags is the only information used in the proposed approach (no distance or bearing to the tag is considered available), but differently from similar localization setups reported in the literature, only a small number (about one each square meter or less) of tags are used. This is possible using a suitable tag's antenna in ultrahigh frequency band, expressly designed to obtain regular and stable RFID detection regions, which allows us to consider an efficient Kalman filtering approach to fuse RFID readings with the vehicle odometry data. A satisfactory performance is achieved, with an average position error of about 0.1 m. The hardware/software localization setup described in this paper is cheap and easy to use and may provide a satisfactory approach in several industrial and domestic scenarios.

TI Automated Intersection Control Performance of Future Innovation Versus
   Current Traffic Signal Control
SO TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH RECORD
LA English
DT Article
AB Congestion is one of the biggest challenges faced by the transportation community; congestion accounted for an estimated $87.2 billion in losses in 2007 alone. Transportation professionals need to go beyond capacity expansion projects and explore novel strategies to mitigate traffic congestion. Automated intersection management is a novel strategy that has the potential to greatly reduce intersection delay and improve safety. Although the implementation of such a system is contingent on the development of automated vehicles, competitions such as the Grand Challenge and Urban Challenge of the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency have shown that this technology is feasible and will be available. Therefore, the development of the infrastructure and associated control methods required to exploit fully the benefits of such technology at the system level is critical. This research explores one such innovative strategy, an automated intersection control protocol based on a first-come, first-served (FCFS) reservation system. The FCFS reservation system was shown to reduce intersection delay significantly by exploiting the features of autonomous vehicles. Microscopic simulation experimental results showed that the FCFS reservation system significantly outperformed a traditional traffic signal in reducing delay.

AB Emergency vehicles (EVs) are permitted to travel at high speed to quickly reach the destination with the aid of audible and visual warning signals, and other road users are required to clear the path for EVs. However, car drivers may sometimes be unaware of nearby EVs, leading to delay in response or even traffic collisions. This work proposes audio-based and vision-based EV detection systems (EVD) that can detect EVs and alert car drivers to respond appropriately. First, we propose a modified YOLO model tailored to the EVD problem, namely YOLO-EVD, and develop a novel image dataset for vision-based EVD (V-EVD). We utilize cross-stage partial connections at the YOLO-EVD's neck to enhance the detection performance, in which YOLO-EVD achieves 95.5% mean average precision that is better than those of the other single-stage object detectors. Second, we propose WaveResNet, an end-to-end convolutional neural network, for audio-based EVD (A-EVD) based on the classification of siren sound and traffic noise. With raw waveform input of at least one second, the WaveResNet attains high accuracies, at above 98% in normal traffic, and is robust to noise. Both YOLO-EVD and WaveResNet meet the real-time operation requirement. Also, we integrate YOLO-EVD and WaveResNet to develop a prototype of the audio-vision EVD system (AV-EVD) that is a novel approach in the literature of the EVD problem. Our experiments show the promising results of the AV-EVD system as it produces a low misdetection rate of 1.54%. The proposed A-EVD, V-EVD, and AV-EVD systems can be applied to provide safety functions for private cars, self-driving cars, or smart road infrastructure.

AB Connected and/or automated vehicles (CAVs or AVs) have been shown to dampen stop-and-go waves in mixed autonomy traffic, thus improving string stability. However, their effects on network traffic instability due to turning and merging maneuvers are less known. In this paper, we characterize such effects using the macroscopic or network fundamental diagram (MFD or NFD). We first revisit and extend the theoretical two-ring network, and then develop an integrated modeling and simulation framework that explicitly accounts for different microscopic traffic models of human-driven vehicles (HVs), AVs, and CAVs. Results suggest that network traffic instability resulting from turning and merging maneuvers persists even if vehicles become automated and cooperative. When the turning probability is low, the presence of CAVs does not induce a significant change in the bifurcation point of the NFD. Scatter in both link fundamental diagrams (FDs) and NFDs, however, reduces resulting in higher and more stable network flows. When the turning probability is high, AVs without cooperation turn out to worsen network traffic stability, giving rise to an NFD that undergoes bifurcation long before the theoretical critical network density is reached. This is in contrast to the case with CAVs that perform cooperative merging. Results also suggest that, whenever the penetration rate of CAVs is too low or too high, making HVs connected is not as effective in delaying the bifurcation of the NFD as when the penetration rate is moderate. We further compare cooperative merging with adaptive signal control and adaptive driver routing to demonstrate its benefits in improving network flows. Simulation experiments on a real motorway segment in Sydney, Australia are also performed to confirm our findings.

AB The condition of the bridge may deteriorate due to the traffic that passes over it, as well as weather and environmental conditions. To ensure the safety and structural stability of the bridges, regular inspections of the bridge elements should be carried out. Recent advances in unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) can provide tools for accurate and even autonomous inspection of bridge structures without interrupting normal bridge operations. In this paper, we focus on the determination of the dynamic structural parameters of a suspension bridge. The proposed method is based on the estimation of the natural vibration frequency of the bridge cables using the videos captured by the UAV. We provide a detailed theoretical description of the algorithm and an analysis of the simulation results and the data collected during the experiments in the laboratory and in the real case study. In addition to the vision based method for estimating vibration frequency, we tested the ability of the UAV's on-board sensors to record structural oscillations when the UAV landed on the surface of the bridge.

AB Autonomous vehicles (AVs) play an important role in the next-generation intelligent transportation system (ITS), which requires AVs to have the ability of rapid decision-making and control. As a part of ITS, simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) technology is the basis for AVs to operate in a complex and unknown environment. In this article, a stereo vision odometry method in a dynamic environment is proposed, which can not only effectively overcome the influence of dynamic objects but also detect the position of dynamic objects. An optical flow filtering algorithm based on the quantitative histogram (QH) and the optical flow angle histogram (OFAH) of the feature points is proposed to obtain dynamic points. Furthermore, a multifeature fusion mechanism is used to perform binary segmentation and get the bounding box of dynamic object. Experiments show that the proposed method can improve the accuracy of pose estimation and detect moving objects in a dynamic environment.

AB Cooperative hunting is a typical task that reflects the intelligence level of a swarm. For the complex underwater weak information environment with obstacles, a problem description of the multi-autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) cooperative hunting task is given, considering the influencing factors, including underwater obstacles, AUV sensing interaction range, and target escape strategy. A hybrid adaptive preference method based on improved artificial potential fields (HAP-IAPF) is proposed. Then the strategies of obstacle avoidance and hunting are designed separately according to the task requirements. The adaptive weight control unit is used to adjust the preference strategy. The multi-AUV cooperative hunting in dynamic obstacle underwater environments under weakly connected conditions are achieved. In order to prove the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm, simulation results compared with the traditional artificial potential field method and the optimized artificial potential field method are given in this paper. The results show that the proposed method is robust and effective in different environments.

TI Robotic Visual Tracking of Relevant Cues in Underwater Environments with
   Poor Visibility Conditions
SO JOURNAL OF SENSORS
LA English
DT Article
ID ATTENTION
AB Using visual sensors for detecting regions of interest in underwater environments is fundamental for many robotic applications. Particularly, for an autonomous exploration task, an underwater vehicle must be guided towards features that are of interest. If the relevant features can be seen from the distance, then smooth control movements of the vehicle are feasible in order to position itself close enough with the final goal of gathering visual quality images. However, it is a challenging task for a robotic system to achieve stable tracking of the same regions since marine environments are unstructured and highly dynamic and usually have poor visibility. In this paper, a framework that robustly detects and tracks regions of interest in real time is presented. We use the chromatic channels of a perceptual uniform color space to detect relevant regions and adapt a visual attention scheme to underwater scenes. For the tracking, we associate with each relevant point superpixel descriptors which are invariant to changes in illumination and shape. The field experiment results have demonstrated that our approach is robust when tested on different visibility conditions and depths in underwater explorations.

AB Error is always present in the GPS guidance of a tractor along a desired trajectory. One way to reduce GPS guidance error is by improving the tractor positioning. The most commonly used ways to do this are either by employing more precise GPS receivers and differential corrections or by employing GPS together with some other local positioning systems such as electronic compasses or Inertial Navigation Systems (INS). However, both are complex and expensive solutions. In contrast, this article presents a simple and low cost method to improve tractor positioning when only a GPS receiver is used as the positioning sensor. The method is based on placing the GPS receiver ahead of the tractor, and on applying kinematic laws of tractor movement, or a geometric approximation, to obtain the midpoint position and orientation of the tractor rear axle more precisely. This precision improvement is produced by the fusion of the GPS data with tractor kinematic control laws. Our results reveal that the proposed method effectively reduces the guidance GPS error along a straight trajectory.

AB ObjectiveForward collision warning (FCW) and automatic emergency braking (AEB) have found to be effective on cars, SUVs, and large trucks. The objective of this study was to extend prior work and estimate the effects of FCW and AEB on pickups.MethodsRear-end crashes where a pickup with optional FCW or AEB was the striking vehicle were identified in 25 U.S. states during 2017-2020. Quasi-induced exposure was performed with logistic regression to compare rear-end-striking crashes between vehicles with and without the systems relative to being struck in the rear. Rear-end-striking crash rates per registered vehicle year were also compared between equipped and non-equipped pickups with Poisson regression. The association of the systems with severity in the rear-end-striking crashes that occurred was examined with logistic regression.ResultsIn the quasi-induced exposure analysis, AEB was associated with statistically significant 34% reductions in the risk of a rear-end-striking crash of any severity and with any injuries, and a 76% reduction in the risk of a rear-end-striking crash with serious or fatal injuries (p = 0.09). FCW was associated with statistically significant declines of 22% in the risk of a rear-end-striking crash with any injuries and 71% in the risk of a rear-end-striking crash with serious or fatal injuries, but FCW was not associated with a change in all rear-end-striking crashes. Results were similar in Poisson regression models for all but FCW's effect on all rear-end-striking crashes. The odds that rear-end-striking crashes involving pickups with FCW resulted in any injuries were 26% lower, and serious/fatal injuries were 75% lower, than those involving pickups without the system. AEB was associated with a nonsignificant reduction in the odds of serious/fatal injuries when a rear-end strike occurred and no change in the odds of any injuries.DiscussionConsistent benefits for front crash prevention systems have been demonstrated for a wide range of vehicle types, now including a sample of pickups. Gaps in proposed U.S. regulations should be filled so that AEB is required equipment on all new vehicles.

AB Vehicle view object detection technology is the key to the environment perception modules of autonomous vehicles, which is crucial for driving safety. In view of the characteristics of complex scenes, such as dim light, occlusion, and long distance, an improved YOLOv4-based vehicle view object detection model, VV-YOLO, is proposed in this paper. The VV-YOLO model adopts the implementation mode based on anchor frames. In the anchor frame clustering, the improved K-means++ algorithm is used to reduce the possibility of instability in anchor frame clustering results caused by the random selection of a cluster center, so that the model can obtain a reasonable original anchor frame. Firstly, the CA-PAN network was designed by adding a coordinate attention mechanism, which was used in the neck network of the VV-YOLO model; the multidimensional modeling of image feature channel relationships was realized; and the extraction effect of complex image features was improved. Secondly, in order to ensure the sufficiency of model training, the loss function of the VV-YOLO model was reconstructed based on the focus function, which alleviated the problem of training imbalance caused by the unbalanced distribution of training data. Finally, the KITTI dataset was selected as the test set to conduct the index quantification experiment. The results showed that the precision and average precision of the VV-YOLO model were 90.68% and 80.01%, respectively, which were 6.88% and 3.44% higher than those of the YOLOv4 model, and the model's calculation time on the same hardware platform did not increase significantly. In addition to testing on the KITTI dataset, we also selected the BDD100K dataset and typical complex traffic scene data collected in the field to conduct a visual comparison test of the results, and then the validity and robustness of the VV-YOLO model were verified.

ID NAVIGATION; SYSTEM
AB With the rapid development of autonomous vehicles, the demand for reliable positioning results is urgent. Currently, the ground vehicles heavily depend on the Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) and the Inertial Navigation System (INS) providing reliable and continuous navigation solutions. In dense urban areas, especially narrow streets with tall buildings, the GNSS signals are possibly blocked by the surrounding tall buildings, and under this condition, the geometry distribution of the in-view satellites is very poor, and the None-Line-Of-Sight (NLOS) and Multipath (MP) heavily affects the positioning accuracy. Further, the INS positioning errors will quickly diverge over time without the GNSS correction. Aiming at improving the position accuracy under signal challenging environment, in this paper, we developed an MIMU(Micro Inertial Measurement Unit)/Odometer integration system with vehicle state constraints (MO-C) for improving the vehicle positioning accuracy without GNSS. MIMU/Odometer integration model and the constrained measurements are given in detail. Several field tests were carried out for evaluating and assessing the MO-C system. The experiments were divided into two parts, firstly, field testing with data post-processing and real-time processing was carried out for fully assessing the performance of the MO-C system. Secondly, the MO-C was implemented in the BeiDou Satellite Navigation System (BDS)/integrated navigation system (INS) for evaluating the MO-C performance during the BDS signal outage. The MIMU standalone positioning accuracy was compared with that from the MIMU/Odometer integration (MO), MO-C and MIMU with constraints (M-C) for assessing the Odometer, and the influence of the constraint on the positioning errors reduction. The results showed that the latitude and longitude errors could be suppressed with Odometer assisting, and the height errors were suppressed while the state constraints were included.

AB In order to realize maneuver combat in the modern warfare, some special military vehicles require the ability of determining their position and orientation rapidly and accurately, and the position and orientation system should be highly autonomous and have strong anti-jamming capability. So a high-accuracy independent position and orientation method for vehicles that utilizes strapdown inertial navigation system/Doppler radar is presented in this article. Laser gyroscopes in strapdown inertial navigation system and Doppler radar are adopted to develop a dead-reckoning system for vehicles. Subsequently, the attitude, velocity,and position-updating algorithms of dead-reckoning system are designed. The error sources of dead-reckoning system are analyzed to establish the system error model, including the attitude error equations of the mathematical platform, velocity error equations, and position error equations. The errors of strapdown inertial navigation system and deadreckoning system are selected as system states of the integrated position and orientation method. The difference between the attitude output of strapdown inertial navigation system and that of dead-reckoning system, and the difference between the position output of strapdown inertial navigation system and that of dead-reckoning system are chosen as the measurements of integrated position and orientation. Then, Kalman filter is adopted to design the filtering algorithm of integrated position and orientation. In the end, the integrated position and orientation method is validated by simulation experiment and vehicular experiment. The experimental results show that strapdown inertial navigation system/Doppler radar integration can realize accurate positioning and orientation for a long time, and the accuracy of attitude/position integration mode is significantly higher than that of velocity/position integration mode. Therefore, the former integration mode is more suitable for accurate position and orientation for vehicles.

ID VEHICLE
AB Inertial navigation systems for underwater vehicles are often aided by acoustic time-of-flight positioning schemes. One widely implemented long baseline (LBL) approach uses a ping-response protocol resulting in asynchronous measurements that depend on the state of the vehicle at two time instants. Such aiding measurements that depend on the state at multiple time instants do not fit the model format of the standard extended Kalman filter (EKF) framework. This paper proposes a near-real-time (NRT) Bayesian smoothing framework for the LBL-aided inertial navigation system application. Within this NRT framework, the time interval between LBL cycles is divided into two intervals defined by the ping-response cycles of LBL. The time instant when all the LBL responses are received will be referred to as the NRT point. Between the LBL ping and the NRT point, a traditional real-time EKF is implemented using the inertial measurement unit and all aiding measurements. After the NRT point, when all the LBL responses have been received, an optimal Bayesian trajectory estimator executes. This maximum a posteriori (MAP) estimation includes all the measurement information already collected up to the NRT point of the current LBL cycle. The MAP output is a smoothed trajectory estimate for the period of time between the LBL ping and the NRT point. At the conclusion of this smoothing process, the current EKF estimate is corrected to the optimal MAP solution and propagated to the current time, and then the EKF estimation process continues to the NRT point of the next LBL cycle. At all times, the approach maintains a real-time state estimate suitable for use by the control system. This paper presents the theoretical solution, discusses the implementation, and presents implementation results to illustrate the accuracy and reliability of this NRT approach.

AB In our project on the autonomous guidance of Micro-Air Vehicles (MAVs) in confined indoor and outdoor environments, we have developed a vision based autopilot, with which a miniature hovercraft travels along a corridor by automatically controlling both its speed and its clearance from the walls. A hovercraft is an air vehicle endowed with natural roll and pitch stabilization characteristics, in which planar flight control systems can be developed conveniently. Our hovercraft is fully actuated by two rear and two lateral thrusters. It travels at a constant altitude (similar to 2 mm) and senses the environment by means of two lateral eyes that measure the right and left optic flows (OFs). The visuo-motor control system, which is called LORA III (Lateral Optic flow Regulation Autopilot, Mark III), is a dual OF regulator consisting of two intertwined feedback loops, each of which has its own OF set-point and controls the vehicle's translation in one degree of freedom (surge or sway). Our computer-simulated experiments show that the hovercraft can navigate along a straight or tapered corridor at a relatively high speed (up to 1 m/s). It also reacts to any major step perturbations in the lateral OF (provided by a moving wall) and to any disturbances caused by a tapered corridor. The minimalistic visual system (comprised of only 4 pixels) suffices for the hovercraft to be able to control both its clearance from the walls and its forward speed jointly, without ever measuring speed and distance. The non-emissive visual sensors and the simple control system developed here are suitable for use on MAVs with a permissible avionic payload of only a few grams. This study also accounts quantitatively for previous ethological findings on honeybees flying freely in a straight or tapered corridor.

First, the system is extended to a Markov jump system (MJS) by considering the stochastic delay due to the influence of uncertain network environment on the system. Then, the sufficient conditions that can make the augmented system stochastically stable with H-infinity performance index are given in the form of matrix inequalities. After that, the optimal parameters and matrices of the system are calculated by convex optimization after decoupling the matrix inequalities to obtain the solution of the controller gain matrix. Finally, the effectiveness of the method proposed in this paper is verified by simulation comparison experiments.

AB Unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) swarm communication has received increasing attention thanks to its intriguing advantages, such as low costs, high mobility, and deployment convenience. However, this technology is also facing certain new challenges, for example, RF spectrum scarcity, interference, and network connectivity. To this end, ultraviolet (UV) communication is introduced in this article to tackle these problems due to its distinctive benefits, such as license-free operation, immunity to electromagnetic interference, and the ability of non-line-of-sight transmission. First, a comparison between UV communication and other alternatives is presented. Then the structural designs of the high-capability UAV and the low-capability UAV, the system communication protocol and mutual interference, and the network topology of the UV-based UAV swarm are investigated. Further, the bit error rate performance, data rate, and communication range are analyzed. In the end, an artificial-intelligence-aided UV-based UAV swarm system is put forward to tackle users' complicated requirements. Simultaneously, the challenges are discussed to direct future research work.

AB Place recognition is an important capability for autonomously navigating vehicles operating in complex environments and under changing conditions. It is a key component for tasks such as loop closing in SLAM or global localization. In this letter, we address the problem of place recognition based on 3D LiDAR scans recorded by an autonomous vehicle. We propose a novel lightweight neural network exploiting the range image representation of LiDAR sensors to achieve fast execution with less than 2 ms per frame. We design a yaw-angle-invariant architecture exploiting a transformer network, which boosts the place recognition performance of our method. We evaluate our approach on the KITTI and Ford Campus datasets. The experimental results show that our method can effectively detect loop closures compared to the state-of-the-art methods and generalizes well across different environments. To evaluate long-term place recognition performance, we provide a novel dataset containing LiDAR sequences recorded by a mobile robot in repetitive places at different times.

AB Change detection (CD) is an important vision task for autonomous landing of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV) on water. High-density photoreceptors and lateral inhibition mechanisms have inspired a novel bi-ologic computational method based on structure and properties in eagle eyes as proposed for change de-tection. We call this method "STabCD," which ensures spatiotemporal distribution consistency to achieve foreground acquisition, noise reduction, and background adaptability. Therefore, our proposed model re-sponds strongly to object information and suppresses noise and wave textures. Then, we present a cloning method to simulate water scenes and collect a new synthetic dataset (called "Synthetic Boat Sequence") for UAV vision research. Besides, we utilize synthetic datasets and corresponding real datasets to conduct change detection experiments. The experimental results indicate that: 1) the STabCD model achieves the best results in real or synthetic water landing scenes; and 2) change detection models for UAV can be quantitatively analyzed and tested under challenging synthetic scenarios.

AB We propose an active perception controller to drive an aerial robot to localize 3-D features in an environment using an onboard monocular camera. The robot estimates feature positions with either an extended Kalman filter (EKF) or an unscented Kalman filter (UKF). For each filter, we derive a controller that seeks the most valuable robot motions for estimating the 3-D positions of features in the local robot body frame. The control algorithm uses an explicit expression for the gradient of the error covariance matrices for both the EKF and UKF at the next time step. This gradient approach is demonstrated in both simulations and real-world experiments on a quadrotor with a downward facing camera where it is shown to outperform a wide variety of the state-of-the-art active sensing strategies. Our proposed control algorithms are computationally efficient, making them well-suited for fast, online reconstructions onboard microaerial vehicles.

AB In this study, an active disturbance rejection and predictive control strategy is presented to solve the trajectory tracking problem for an unmanned quadrotor helicopter with disturbances. The proposed control scheme is based on the quadrotor's dynamic model, where effects of wind gust are considered as additive disturbances on six degrees of freedom. The predictive controller solves the path following problem with extended state observers to estimate and compensate disturbances. The active disturbance rejection control scheme is used for the stabilisation of rotational movements. The suggested control structure is verified in simulation studies with the presence of external disturbances and parametric uncertainties. The proposed method improves the robustness for the modelling error and disturbances while performing a smooth tracking of the reference trajectory.

AB A key requirement for the complete autonomy of an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) is the replenishment of its energy source and other consumables. Such processes are typically overseen and conducted by a human operator, may be time consuming and effectively reduce the operating range of the system. To satisfy the requirements of UAV customers such as military surveillance networks, that seek faster, broader and more fully autonomous systems, and hobbyists, who seek to avoid the hassle associated with changing the fuel source, we develop automated energy recharging systems. Focusing on battery operated remote control helicopters, we employ the Axiomatic Design methodology to develop design concepts of platforms to act as automatic service stations. We propose three station designs for refilling platforms and one concept for battery exchange platforms. In addition, we analyze the economic feasibility of automatic consumable replenishment stations, consider two types of station (container refilling and container exchange) and discuss the application of these systems. Refilling platforms better suit low coverage unmanned aerial systems (UAS) while exchange stations allow high coverage with fewer UAVs.

AB Wide area search, classification and attack operations using Un-manned Combat Air Vehicles (UCAVs) are considered. This work could apply equally well to systems of varying degree of discrimination in detection and classification. The specific wide area search and attack scenario at hand is modelled, capturing the important problem parameters of target density in the battle space, the presence and the density of false targets, the seeker and Autonomous Target Recognition (ATR) modules' performance parameters, air vehicles' parameters, e.g., speed and seeker swath width, as well as munition parameters such as warhead lethality. The weapon system's effectiveness analysis is presented. Specifically, applied probability theory is used to analytically solve for the probability of success in search and engagement. A Markov chain model is applied to a UCAV armed with multiple munitions and operating in a single target/multiple false target scenario; a multiple target/multiple false target scenario is also considered. Most importantly, this paper shows how the analytically derived results can be applied to all facets of a UCAV wide area search weapon system design and operation.

AB Merging activities at freeway merging areas can cause significant recurrent and non-recurrent bottleneck congestion due to vehicles' mandatory lateral conflicts. The Connected and Automated Vehicles (CAVs), with their capabilities of real-time communication and precise trajectory control, hold great potential to prevent or mitigate such critical conflicts at merging areas. However, the performance of CAVs may be impaired by the imbalance of lane flow distribution, and non-cooperative movements of Human-driven Vehicles (HDVs) in the mixed traffic environment (i.e. traffic mixed with CAVs and HDVs). In this paper, a novel two-level hierarchical traffic control framework for multilane merging areas under the mixed traffic environment is developed. Note that this paper assumes that the merging sequence is determined by the high control level and focuses on the low level of the control framework. The low control level not only establishes a trajectory optimization strategy for CAVs with lane-changing optimization and cooperative merging control, but includes a human-like merging strategy for HDVs. First, to balance downstream lane flow distribution and provide sufficient merging space for on-ramp vehicles, a lane-changing optimization method is proposed to choose a certain number of designated mainline CAVs to perform early lane changes at the upstream mainline. Second, a cooperative merging control method is presented to optimize the longitudinal trajectories of both mainline and on-ramp CAVs while accounting for the movement of HDVs. Third, Gipps car-following model and heuristic control are combined to represent the HDVs' merging maneuvers. The proposed algorithm simulates and performs merging maneuvers at a typical two-lane freeway merging area and verifies it in various scenarios considering demand level, demand splits and CAV Penetration Rate (PR). The simulation results show that the proposed algorithm can effectively facilitate merging operations, reduce the Total Travel Time (TTT), and increase the Average Travel Speeds (ATS) compared to other merging algorithms. Specifically, compared to the case of using only cooperative merging control method, the proposed algorithm can further reduce TTT by 25.5% and increase ATS by 33.38%. When PR gradually increased, the control performance of the proposed algorithm can be further improved.

AB Vehicle-borne Mobile Laser Scanning (MLS) point cloud is one of the key components of 3D spatial information, which provides important geographic data support for the development of smart cities and autonomous driving. However, urban high-rise buildings will obscure the Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) positioning signal of the vehicle-borne MLS system, causing the problem of the inconsistent location of revisited point clouds collected in the same area, and the existing methods are still limited by low accuracy and efficiency when registering large-scale point clouds. Aiming at the complexity and timeliness of vehicle-borne point cloud registration, this paper proposes an improved Iterative Closest Point (ICP) point cloud accurate registration method based on road markings. Firstly, the road feature image is generated based on the laser reflection intensity of the ground point cloud, and the Pix2Pix_L1 (P2P_L1) transformation model is introduced to realize the identification and classification of markings. Secondly, we take road classification markings as the registration primitives, a Random Sample Consensus (RANSAC) point cloud coarse registration method based on a Fast Point Feature Histogram (FPFH) descriptor is designed, and the Chi-square distance function is used to improve the stability of corresponding points. Then, according to the normal vector characteristics of marking point clouds, the angle between the normal vectors is constrained to extract edge points of markings and select effective corresponding closest point pairs, and the translation vector is preferentially calculated according to the offset characteristics of point cloud to optimize spatial transformation matrix. Finally, a linear interpolation method is developed to correct the pose of global point clouds. Experimental results show that our method achieves high registration accuracy and computational speed on multiple datasets, and has stronger performance than the most widely used geometric feature registration methods.

AB This paper presents a quantitative analysis of the operations of shared-ride automated mobility-on-demand services (SRAMODS). The study identifies (i) operational benefits of SRAMODS including improved service quality and/or lower operational costs relative to automated mobility-on-demand services (AMODS) without shared rides; and (ii) challenges associated with operating SRAMODS. The study employs an agent-based stochastic dynamic simulation framework to model the operational problems of AMODS. The agents include automated vehicles (AVs), on-demand user requests, and a central AV fleet controller that can dynamically change the plans (i.e. routes and AV-user assignments) of AVs in real-time using optimization-based control policies. The agent-based simulation tool and AV fleet control policies are used to test the operational performance of AMODS under a variety of scenarios. The first set of scenarios vary user demand and a parameter constraining the maximum user detour distance. Results indicate that even with a small maximum user detour distance parameter value, allowing shared rides significantly improves the operational efficiency of the AV fleet, where the efficiency gains stem from economies of demand density and network effects. The second set of scenarios vary the mean and coefficient of variation of the curbside pickup time parameter; i.e. how long an AV must wait curbside at a user's pickup location before the user gets inside the AV. Results indicate that increases in mean curbside pickup time significantly degrade operational performance in terms of user in-vehicle travel time and user wait time. The study quantifies the total system (user plus fleet controller) cost as a function of mean curbside pickup time. Finally, the paper provides an extensive discussion of the implications of the quantitative analysis for public-sector transportation planners and policy-makers as well as for mobility service providers.

AB Introduction: Automated vehicle (AV) technologies are one of the most highly disruptive transportation technologies that have the potential to transform the existing transportation systems and the associated impacts on public health and health equity. There have been numerous attempts to recognize and frame the consequences of AVs on public health; however, the uncertainties in impacts and extent of the impacts is not explored, while studies quantifying these impacts are non-existent. Methods: In this paper, we introduce a 5-step mechanism through which AV can impact public health and health equity. We conduct a holistic and narrative review of the existing review studies about AVs' impacts and transportation-related health risk factors that are quantified via two pathways: traffic crash risk and air quality. We have then reviewed the existing quantification methodologies in the literature on each topic. Results: In light of the literature review, we proposed a conceptual framework for full-chain impact assessment of automated vehicles on health and health equity through changes in transportation. The literature review effort showed the changes in transportation after AV implementation vary based on the assumptions of the travel demand models. Six quantification approaches were identified for AV safety evaluations, but their application is limited for full-chain health impact assessment of AVs. The literature about AV impacts on transportation related air pollution (TRAP) related health impacts is limited and requires further steps, including air quality modelling and health impact assessment. Finally, most of the studies on AVs' health equity impact assessment are speculative in nature and do not rely on data-driven analysis. Conclusions: The proposed framework aims to provide researchers with a full-chain impact assessment framework for quantifying the health and equity impacts of AVs at the system level and identify the methodological gaps for future research.

AB Connected and automated vehicles (CAVs) are expected to yield significant improvements in safety, energy efficiency, and time utilization. However, their net effect on energy and environmental outcomes is unclear. Higher fuel economy reduces the energy required per mile of travel, but it also reduces the fuel cost of travel, incentivizing more travel and causing an energy "rebound effect." Moreover, CAVs are predicted to vastly reduce the time cost of travel, inducing further increases in travel and energy use. In this paper, we forecast the induced travel and rebound from CAVs using data on existing travel behavior. We develop a microeconomic model of vehicle miles traveled (VMT) choice under income and time constraints; then we use it to estimate elasticities of VMT demand with respect to fuel and time costs, with fuel cost data from the 2017 United States National Household Travel Survey (NHTS) and wage-derived predictions of travel time cost. Our central estimate of the combined price elasticity of VMT demand is -0.4, which differs substantially from previous estimates. We also find evidence that wealthier households have more elastic demand, and that households at all income levels are more sensitive to time costs than to fuel costs. We use our estimated elasticities to simulate VMT and energy use impacts of full, private CAV adoption under a range of possible changes to the fuel and time costs of travel. We forecast a 2-47% increase in travel demand for an average household. Our results indicate that backfire - i.e., a net rise in energy use - is a possibility, especially in higher income groups. This presents a stiff challenge to policy goals for reductions in not only energy use but also traffic congestion and local and global air pollution, as CAV use increases.

AB Adaptive Navigation (AN) control strategies allow an agent to autonomously alter its trajectory based on realtime measurements of the environment. Compared to conventional navigation methods, these techniques can reduce required time and energy to explore scalar characteristics of unknown and dynamic regions of interest (e.g., temperature, concentration level). Multiple Uncrewed Aerial Vehicle (UAV) approaches to AN can improve performance by exploiting synchronized spatially-dispersed measurements to generate realtime information regarding the structure of the local scalar field, which is then used to inform navigation decisions. This article presents initial results of a comprehensive program to develop, verify, and experimentally implement mission-level AN capabilities in three-dimensional (3D) space using our unique multilayer control architecture for groups of vehicles. Using our flexible formation control system, we build upon our prior 2D AN work and provide new contributions to 3D scalar field AN by a) demonstrating a wide range of 3D AN capabilities using a unified, multilayer control architecture, b) extending multivehicle 2D AN control primitives to navigation in 3D scalar fields, and c) introducing state-based sequencing of these primitive AN functions to execute 3D mission-level capabilities such as isosurface mapping and plume following. We verify functionality using high-fidelity simulations of multicopter drone clusters, accounting for vehicle dynamics, outdoor wind gust disturbances, position sensor inaccuracy, and scalar field sensor noise. This paper presents the multilayer architecture for multivehicle formation control, the 3D AN control primitives, the sequencing approaches for specific mission-level capabilities, and simulation results that demonstrate these functions.

AB Multi-constraint trajectory planning for unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) has been widely used in military and civil fields. The existing path planning methods, such as swarm intelligence algorithm and graph-based algorithm, cannot incorporate the flying time and UAV kinematic model into evolution. To overcome such disadvantage, a method of solving trajectory planning under obstacles and multi-constraint is investigated in this paper. Firstly, the flying time is discretized as a certain number of Chebyshev points which are the optimized moments of control variable, and they can reduce the computational burden. The process of solution is divided into multi-phase, i.e., two points as a phase to generate the trajectory. Then, angular velocity is taken as control variable, and function of angular velocity is solved by cubic spline interpolation. Besides, functions of angle and position are obtained by integration. The results are substituted into the model consisted by particle swarm optimization (PSO) and the UAV kinematic model to optimize. On this basis, the angular velocity, angle and position are calculated according to the allocated moments. Finally, Monte-Carlo simulation and comparison with existed method are carried out in obstacle environment. All the results illustrate that the multi-phase method can calculate the kinematic parameters of UAV accurately and plan smooth trajectories. Meanwhile, the proposed method is easier to meet the complicated constraints than the single-phase method. In addition, the dimensionality of solution is also enriched effectively.

AB The transformation of the existing urban environment in digital smart cities has become a reality, which aimed to transform daily life activities into automated processes for the ease in human efforts and reduction in effort time. Vision based sensors are commonly used for monitoring cities, which acquire a huge amount of diverse data and store them for further computer vision processing. In this article, we aim to explore whether and how to navigate a vehicle using cost effective means (vision based sensors) in smart cities without using the calibrated sensors and Global Positioning System (GPS). Vehicle localization and navigation require on-board calibrated sensors and reliable GPS link. In an urban environment, these sensors fail to perform well in: indoor environment (tunnels), crowded and congested areas, and severe weather conditions. The most effective technique used for vision based navigation depends on image registration. The challenges of a successful and effective registration are: sufficient illumination in the environment, dominance of static scene over moving objects, high textured ratio to allow apparent motion and necessary scene overlap between consecutive frames. We proposed a novel approach for vehicle navigation based on vision sensors using modified normalized phase correlation. In the proposed approach, the distinction between textured and texture less surface is based on the identification of corresponding features. In this regard, the Gram polynomial basis function is used to remove the Gibbs error problem generated due to peak in the registration process. Similarly, entropy based tensor approximation is used to remove outliers for robust image registration. Experiments performed in real time during test drives show excellent results with respect to estimated position accuracy in comparison with GPS calculated data.

AB In recent years, laser rangefinder sensors have been introduced to the practice and research of agricultural engineering. In research, laser rangefinders have been investigated in horticulture and agriculture. For vehicle-based determination of crop biomass, commercially available laser rangefinders have been analysed and tested to measure aboveground biomass in oilseed rape, winter rye, winter wheat, oats and grassland. Resulting from limited measuring range and fixed beam types, the laser rangefinder models that were investigated only partially met the specific demands for agricultural field and crop conditions. Therefore, a new laser rangefinder scanner (ibeo-ALASCA XT) was chosen. This sensor was specifically developed for driver assistance and autonomous guiding of road vehicles. The scanner was tested in 2008 focusing on the measurement of crop stand parameters in winter wheat under field conditions. The sensor achieved good results with reproducible measurements. Measuring from a stationary vehicle, the standard deviation for the measurements of crop height to characterise the crop stand was less than 3 mm in low, medium, and high biomass areas. The ground speed of the vehicle, ranging from 6 to 24 km h(-1), did not significantly influence the readings. For measurements in front of tractors and self-propelled machines (field sprayers, combines and forage harvesters), the sensor has to scan the crop stands at different inclination angles. It was shown that the inclination angle of the laser beam, which varied from 10A degrees to 80A degrees, significantly influenced the readings. Higher inclination angles resulted in apparent increased heights of the crop stand. For the functional relationship between reflection height levels (95th, 75th, 50th and 25th percentiles, and mean values) and crop biomass density, the coefficient of determination (R(2)) was greater than 0.9.

AB A flexible high-level control language is an important element in the ongoing task of introducing automated guided vehicles (AGV) to new application domains. A new application domain is row crops, where small AGV's will perform weed control around individual crop plants. This paper defines the requirements and scope of a process- and behaviour-based scripting language needed to control the weeding AGV in an agricultural row crop. The goal is to traverse and cover the whole field with no human auxiliary input during the field operation.
   The basis is the transparent and tactical real-time control language (CL) for small mobile robots (SMR). This SMR-CL has been modified to include some necessary motion commands and a supplemental supervisory function to monitor and record the progressive coverage of the field. The control language was then tested by applying it to a scenario representing typical field conditions for row crops.
   The construction of a suitable SMR-CL script for use in a field clearly demonstrates the feasibility of adapting behaviour-based control systems to field structures. The conducted case study indicated the importance of including goal-directing modules. Such a module is described here as the 'supervisory field coverage monitor' (SFCM), which acts to coordinate the behaviours. The applicability of this modified SMR-CL has been successfully demonstrated using a vehicle test in a specially designed artificial row crop field. The analysis of the operational performance verified that it is possible to cover all rows in a field without conducting time-consuming planning procedures. (c) 2008 Elsevier B.V.

ID AIR-COMBAT
AB With the development of unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) and artificial intelligence (AI) technology, Intelligent UAV will be widely used in future autonomous aerial combat. Previous researches on autonomous aerial combat within visual range (WVR) have limitations due to simplifying assumptions, limited robustness, and ignoring sensor errors. In this paper, in order to consider the error of the aircraft sensors, we model the aerial combat WVR as a state-adversarial Markov decision process (SA-MDP), which introduce the small adversarial perturbations on state observations and these perturbations do not alter the environment directly, but can mislead the agent into making suboptimal decisions. Meanwhile, we propose a novel autonomous aerial combat maneuver strategy generation algorithm with high-performance and high-robustness based on state-adversarial deep deterministic policy gradient algorithm (SA-DDPG), which add a robustness regularizers related to an upper bound on performance loss at the actor-network. At the same time, a reward shaping method based on maximum entropy (MaxEnt) inverse reinforcement learning algorithm (IRL) is proposed to improve the aerial combat strategy generation algorithm's efficiency. Finally, the efficiency of the aerial combat strategy generation algorithm and the performance and robustness of the resulting aerial combat strategy is verified by simulation experiments. Our main contributions are three-fold. First, to introduce the observation errors of UAV, we are modeling air combat as SA-MDP. Second, to make the strategy network of air combat maneuver more robust in the presence of observation errors, we introduce regularizers into the policy gradient. Third, to solve the problem that air combat's reward function is too sparse, we use MaxEnt IRL to design a shaping reward to accelerate the convergence of SA-DDPG.

AB This paper describes the concept of an autonomous robot for harvesting cucumbers in greenhouses. A description is given of the working environment of the robot and the logistics of harvesting. It is stated that for a 2 ha Dutch nursery, 4 harvesting robots and one docking station are needed during the peak season. Based on these preliminaries, the design specifications of the harvest robot are defined. The main requirement is that a single harvest operation may take at most 10 s. Then, the paper focuses on the individual hardware and software components of the robot. These include, the autonomous vehicle, the manipulator, the end-effector, the two computer vision systems for detection and 3D imaging of the fruit and the environment and, finally, a control scheme that generates collision-free motions for the manipulator during harvesting. The manipulator has seven degrees-of-freedom (DOF). This is sufficient for the harvesting task. The end-effector is designed such that it handles the soft fruit without loss of quality. The thermal cutting device included in the end-effector prevents the spreading of viruses through the greenhouse. The computer vision system is able to detect more than 95% of the cucumbers in a greenhouse. Using geometric models the ripeness of the cucumbers is determined. A motion planner based on the A*-search algorithm assures collision-free eye-hand co-ordination. In autumn 2001 system integration took place and the harvesting robot was tested in a greenhouse. With a success rate of 80%, field tests confirmed the ability of the robot to pick cucumbers without human interference. On average the robot needed 45 s to pick one cucumber. Future research focuses on hardware and software solutions to improve the picking speed and accuracy of the eye-hand co-ordination of the robot.

AB A review of the literature on autonomous vehicles has shown that they offer several benefits, such as reducing traffic congestion and emissions, and improving transport accessibility. Until the highest level of automation is achieved, humans will remain an important integral of the driving cycle, which necessitates to fully understand their role in automated driving. A difficult research topic involves an understanding of whether a period of automated driving is likely to reduce driver fatigue rather than increase the risk of distraction, particularly when drivers are involved in a secondary task while driving. The main aim of this research comprises assessing the effects of an automation period on drivers, in terms of driving performance and safety implications. A specific focus is set on the car-following maneuver. A driving simulator experiment has been designed for this purpose. In particular, each participant was requested to submit to a virtual scenario twice, with level-three driving automation: one drive consisting of Full Manual Control Mode (FM); the other comprising an Automated Control Mode (AM) activated in the midst of the scenario. During the automation mode, the drivers were asked to watch a movie on a tablet inside the vehicle. When the drivers had to take control of the vehicle, two car-following maneuvers were planned, by simulating a slow-moving vehicle in the right lane in the meanwhile a platoon of vehicles in the overtaking lane discouraged the passing maneuver. Various driving performances (speeds, accelerations, etc.) and surrogate safety measures (PET and TTC) were collected and analysed, focusing on car-following maneuvers. The overall results indicated a more dangerous behavior of drivers who were previously subjected to driving automation; the percentage of drivers who did not apply the brakes and headed into the overtaking lane despite the presence of a platoon of fast-moving vehicles with unsafe gaps between them was higher in AM drive than in FM drive. Conversely, for drivers who preferred to brake, it was noted that those who had already experienced automated driving, adopted a more careful behavior during the braking maneuver to avoid a collision. Finally, with regard to drivers who had decided to overtake the braking vehicle, it should be noted that drivers who had already experienced automated driving did not change their behavior whilst overtaking the stopped lead vehicle.

AB Connected and automated vehicles (CAVs) require proper infrastructure for safer and more reliable operations. Many state and local planning agencies have developed multiyear capital programs to provide such infrastructure in a timely manner within their limited budgets. Meanwhile, the traffic environment will evolve over time as CAV technologies become available (i.e., toward the mixed environment of CAVs and human-driven vehicles), which requires infrastructure plans specific to different planning terms (i.e., short-, medium-, and long-term) to accommodate changing infrastructure needs. To develop an effective multiyear infrastructure plan, planning agencies need to understand changing infrastructure needs with time, identify alternative infrastructure options for different planning terms, and select the most appropriate ones based on their long-term vision. This study performed a systematic literature review to develop a knowledge base for multiyear infrastructure planning for CAVs. To be more specific, the literature review aims to develop the following knowledge areas: (1) identification of existing and future infrastructure options for the operation of CAVs, (2) understanding the role of infrastructure to support different functions of CAVs to realize safety, mobility, and environmental benefits, and (3) integration of the aforementioned findings into planning agencies' multiyear infrastructure plans for CAVs. Based on the review, this study categorizes different CAV infrastructure into existing infrastructure and future infrastructure options while considering five system functions of CAVs (i.e., cooperative merging, platooning, intersection movement, dynamic routing, and cooperation and connected functions) to illustrate the role of these infrastructure options under different traffic scenarios. The implementation of the developed knowledge base is demonstrated through a case study of two selected state agencies' long-term infrastructure planning for CAVs.

AB With the popularity of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), more and more valuable data can be collected by UAVs. In order to balance the data usage and communication cost, the data can be preprocessed in UAVs rather than directly transmitting to the data centre in the edge computing paradigm. Users can obtain information of interest by accessing the data centre remotely by authenticating themselves to the data centre using the most pervasive password authentication method. Unfortunately, the data centre becomes the main attack target because it not only stores the data but also maintains the passwords of all the users. Aiming at protecting the data as well as the password in the UAV-enabled mobile edge computing environment, the authors combine the advantages of gateway-oriented password authenticated key exchange (PAKE) protocols and two-server PAKE protocols and put forward an efficient gateway-oriented two-server PAKE protocol. The security of the proposed protocol is given in the random oracle model. The performance comparison shows their proposal has comparable efficiency in computation and communication costs. Their protocol provides better protection to the password without sacrificing efficiency. Consequently, their protocol is more suitable for real applications in UAV-enabled mobile edge computing environment.

AB In this study, a novel state estimation method is proposed for small unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) tracking in passive sensors (PSs) wireless sensor network (WSN), where the measurement equations are highly non-linear. Different from many non-linear function approximation methods, the non-linear measurement functions are recast into a linear form with respect to UAV states. The centralised 3D pseudomeasurement information filter (PMIF) is derived by embedding the linear form measurements into conventional information filtering schemes. For distributed state estimation in a not fully connected WSN, a hybrid consensus-based distributed PMF (DHCPMIF) is developed in which each PS independently calculates local contribution by using its own pseudomeasurement. To guarantee bounded estimation error as close as possible to that obtained by the optimal centralised estimator, the hybrid consensus method is developed by combining consensus on measurement and consensus on information method, which retains the advantages of both approaches, thus providing estimation accuracy improvement when the number of consensus iterations is moderate. The effectiveness of the proposed distributed filter is verified via two simulation examples involving tracking a UAV using four and eight PSs, respectively.

AB This paper addresses the landing problem of a quadrotor on an unpredictable moving vehicle, using a robust image-based visual servoing (IBVS) method. The circle-based image moments are defined to construct image dynamics, and the passivity-like property of the circle features is preserved by reprojecting to the virtual image plane. The landing control system is decoupled into translation and rotation modules due to the rotation invariance of the proposed circle features. First, by exploiting the error transformation in the image space, a robust IBVS controller can overcome the lack of both the desired depth information of target features and the velocity feedback of the target. Next, an adaptive geometric attitude controller is developed directly using rotation matrices to avoid the singularities of Euler-angles and the ambiguity of quaternions. One benefit of the proposed scheme is that it can potentially improve the camera visibility, guarantee the transient and steady-state behaviors in image space, and be efficiently implemented on the low-cost quadrotor. Finally, The stability analysis is presented using Lyapunov stability theory on cascaded systems, and the effectiveness of the proposed control strategy is demonstrated through simulations and experiments. Note to Practitioners-The motivation of this paper is to investigate a practical control strategy for the image-based landing control of underactuated quadrotors on an unpredictable moving vehicle. In most of the existing image-based landing control schemes for underactuated quadrotors, having the prior predictive model of the moving landing vehicle to provide a feed-forward compensation during the landing maneuver. However, due to the fact that the landing environment and vehicle are primarily stochastic, resulting in no predictive models are valid in practice. Therefore, this paper suggests a robust image-based landing control strategy without the model or state of the moving landing vehicle. In particular, a novel virtual circle feature, possessing the characteristic of rotation invariance, is designed for the landing of underactuated quadrotors, which decouples the landing system and simplifies the control design. Moreover, the image feature errors are directly retained within prescribed performance funnels in the image space. As a result, the transient and steady-state landing behaviors can be implicitly guaranteed in Cartesian space. The stability and convergence of the system are analyzed mathematically and the experiment using quadrotors provides promising results. In ongoing research, we are addressing the issues of collision avoidances and unknown disturbances to provide a more realistic setup for the autonomous deployment and recovery of underactuated quadrotors in GPS-denied environments.

AB Autonomous trajectory planning is a hot topic in the UAV mission planning area of research. Autonomous UAVs have major use case applications which involve navigation in complex environments such as aerial photography, package delivery and relief operations. Many existing trajectory planning solutions rely on the GPS system. However, such GPS-based solutions do not provide a reliable real-time navigation solution, particularly in dense urban environments. Opportunely, cellular networks can be utilized as an attractive alternative for UAV navigation applications. We therefore propose to utilize existing 5G infrastructure to enable the UAV to navigate complex environments, independent of the GPS and other detectable signals transmitted by the UAV. Our objective is to propose an efficient solution to enable the UAVs to autonomously execute such tasks while meeting the real-time operational requirements, without the need to actually interact with the cellular network. For this purpose, we formulate the UAV trajectory planning problem as a joint objective optimization problem to minimize a composite cost metric that we introduce. The computational complexity involved in exact optimization techniques hinders obtaining the real-time calculation requirement that is needed due to the dynamic nature of the environment. To overcome this complexity, we utilize machine learning based techniques to solve the formulated trajectory planning problem. Specifically, we propose two machine learning-based techniques, namely, the reinforcement learning and the deep supervised learning-based approaches. We then analyze the performance of each of the proposed techniques as compared to the optimization-based approaches and other solutions from the literature. Our simulation results show that the proposed reinforcement and deep supervised learning-based solutions provide near optimal solutions to the formulated trajectory planning problem, with comparable accuracy of 99% and 98%, respectively, as compared to the optimal bound while meeting the real-time calculation requirement.

AB In recent years, unmanned autonomous driving technology has attracted increasing attention from people, and become a research hotspot. Currently, the integration of strapdown inertial navigation system (SINS) and global navigation satellite systems (GNSSs) is the most common and effective navigation and positioning scheme for unmanned ground vehicles (UGVs) and unmanned aerial vehicles. However, this integrated system is unable to maintain a reliable positioning solution in challenging environments due to the inherent weakness of GNSS signals and the accumulation of SINS positioning errors over time. To address this issue, this paper proposes an integrated scheme based on an asynchronous Kalman filter for SINS, GNSS and two-dimensional (2D) laser Doppler velocimeter (LDV). In the proposed scheme, the SINS and 2D-LDV are tightly coupled to improve the robustness of the integrated system, and the error parameters between the 2D-LDV and the SINS are calibrated in real time during the validity of the GNSS signal. In addition, the designed asynchronous Kalman filter method evaluates the validity of the GNSS and 2D-LDV measurements in real time based on Mahalanobis distance of innovation vector and statistical property principle. Two groups of long-distance, high-mobility vehicle experiments conducted in challenging environments verify the validity of the proposed scheme. The experimental results show that the proposed SINS/GNSS/2D-LDV integrated navigation scheme has good environmental adaptability and reliability, and can maintain high horizontal and vertical positioning accuracy despite frequent GNSS signal failures, which can meet the needs of UGVs.

AB In road traffic, mental overload often leads to a failure to notice new and distinctive stimuli. Such phenomenon is known as 'inattentional blindness'. Safe and efficient interaction between automated vehicles (AVs) and pedestrians is expected to rely heavily on external human-machine interfaces (eHMIs), a tool AVs are equipped with to communicate their intentions to pedestrians. This study seeks to explore the phenomenon of 'inattentional blindness' in the context of pedestrian-AV interactions. Specifically, the aim is to understand the effects of a warning eHMI on pedestrians' crossing decisions when they are engaged in a secondary task. In an experiment study with videos of pedestrian crossing scenarios filmed from the perspective of the crossing pedestrian, participants had to decide the latest point at which they would be willing to cross the road in front of an AV with an eHMI vs. an AV without an eHMI. Participants were also asked to predict the future behavior of the AV. 125 female and 9 male participants aged between 18 and 25 completed the experiment and a follow-up questionnaire. It was found that the presence of a warning eHMI on AVs contributes to a clearer understanding of pedestrians' inferences about the intention of AVs and helps deter late and dangerous crossing decisions made by pedestrians. However, the eHMI fail to help pedestrians avoid such decisions when they face a high mental workload induced by secondary task engagement.

In this paper, we innovatively develop a cooperative CD&R method in the UAV IoT environment considering UAV relative motion relationships and UAV priorities. Using this method in 6G environment, the real-time and reactive conflict-free paths for UAVs can be generated. The developed method has the advantage of smaller calculation and needs fewer UAVs to take maneuvers than the CD&R methods based on traditional Artificial Potential Field (APF). To verify the effectiveness of CD&R methods, a safety assessment method (evaluate from both conflict feature and network structure perspectives) is also proposed. A Monte Carlo Simulation with ``clone mechanism'' is designed to incorporate the effect of CD&R systems. Three cases of distributed CD&R protocols are simulated and compared. The simulations with different parameter settings are also discussed. Quantitative simulation experiments show that the safety effect of CD&R proposed in this paper is improved a lot due to the improved APF and the UAV priority determination. Meanwhile, the safety assessment method is demonstrated to be feasible for evaluating the safety of CD&R systems.

AB Recent developments in the field of rail vehicles increased the demand for accurate and up-to-date 3D maps of rail track networks. Collision avoidance systems, semi-automated, or fully autonomous rail vehicles strongly benefit from such high quality maps. In this work, we present a fully automatic, photogrammetric method for the 3D reconstruction of rail track segments. More specifically, the center line of the rail track is reconstructed as a georeferenced and continuous 3D cubic spline. The main data inputs are collected while driving the rail vehicle along the segment: (a) images from a front-looking camera and (b) observations from a low-cost GNSS receiver. Optional data inputs can be used to increase the reconstruction accuracy, namely (c) an a priori rail track (e.g. from OpenStreetMap), (d) a digital height model (DHM), and (e) ground control points (GCPs). The rail track is estimated in post processing (offline) by a weighted least squares adjustment (LSA). The core of the LSA is the bundle adjustment of images. It is extended by additional geometric constraints which exploit the geometric relations between the rail track, the rail vehicle, and the camera trajectory. As a consequence, in contrast to many related methods, the rails need not to be visible in the images to map the rail track. We applied the method to reconstruct a 13 km long tram line in Vienna (Austria). We found that the local geometry of the track can be well reconstructed from the image sequence. However, if the low-cost GNSS receiver is used as single georeferencing source, the track shows a strong drift behavior. This drift can significantly be minimized over the entire track if the above mentioned optional data inputs are used.

AB Endowed with automation and connectivity, connected and automated vehicles (CAVs) will be a revolutionary promoter for cooperative driving automation (CDA). Nevertheless, CAVs need high-fidelity perception information on their surroundings, which is available but costly to collect from various onboard sensors, as well as vehicle-to-everything communications. Therefore, authentic perception (AP) information based on high-fidelity sensors via a cost-effective platform is crucial for enabling CDA-related research, e.g., cooperative decision making or control. Most state-of-the-art traffic simulation studies for CAVs rely on the situation-awareness information by directly calling on intrinsic attributes of the objects, which impedes the reliability and fidelity of the assessment of CDA algorithms. In this study, a cyber mobility mirror (CMM) co-simulation platform is designed for enabling CDA by providing AP information. The CMM co-simulation platform can emulate the real world with a high-fidelity sensor perception system and the cyberworld with a real-time rebuilding system acting as a "mirror" of the real-world environment. Concretely, the real-world simulator is mainly in charge of simulating the traffic environment, the sensors, and the AP process. The mirror-world simulator is responsible for representing objects and providing their information as intrinsic attributes of the simulator to support the development and evaluation of CDA algorithms. To illustrate the functionality of the proposed co-simulation platform, a roadside lidar-based vehicle perception system for enabling CDA is prototyped as a study case. Specific traffic environments and CDA tasks are designed for experiments whose results are demonstrated and analyzed to show the performance of the platform.

TI Impact of Cooperative Adaptive Cruise Control on a Multilane Highway
   under a Differentiated Per-Lane Speed Limit Policy

   FLOW; OSCILLATIONS
AB Cooperative adaptive cruise control (CACC) has drawn wide attention in recent years for its potential throughput benefit, as it is a promising intermediate technology to the highly connected and automated vehicles. The impact of CACC on multilane highways has been the subject of several studies, but they assumed traffic under a uniform speed limit. Recent research has revealed that traffic performs differently under a differentiated per-lane speed limit (DPLSL) policy with heavy vehicle (HV) restricted lanes. Whether the benefits of CACC still remain under a DPLSL policy has not been explored. This study developed cellular automaton models to incorporate CACC-equipped and non-equipped vehicles (i.e., passenger cars, HVs) on a two-way eight-lane highway with a DPLSL. Results shown throughputs by lane increase up to 78.5% as the CACC car market penetration rate (MPR) rises. Such increases became sharper (i.e., >= 10%) for inner lanes (i.e., HV restricted lanes) and outer lanes after reaching a 40% and a 60% CACC car MPR, separately. Moreover, HVs induced a 1.5% to 15.7% throughput reduction across lanes even under higher CACC car MPRs (i.e., 60%, 80%). This DPLSL policy may cause the lanes to experience a throughput penalty when they are adjacent to lanes with a different speed limit as the MPR of CACC cars rises. Lastly, in traffic with a 60% CACC car MPR, increases are brought further by considering 10% of HV with CACC, especially on those HV non-restricted lanes. The study is helpful for policy makers to further prepare for the prevalence of CACC in the forthcoming years.

AB Autonomous systems are being increasingly used in many areas. A significant example is unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), regularly being called upon to perform tasks in the military theatre. Autonomous systems can work alone or be called upon to work collaboratively towards common mission objectives. In this case it will be necessary to ensure that the decisions enable the progression of the platform objectives and also the overall mission objectives.
   The motivation behind the work presented in this paper is the need to be able to predict the failure probability of missions performed by a number of autonomous systems working together. Such mission prognoses can assist the mission planning process in autonomous systems when conditions change, with reconfiguration taking place if the probability of mission failure becomes unacceptably high.
   In a multiplatform phased mission a number of platforms perform their own phased mission that contributes to an overall mission objective. Presented in this paper is a methodology for calculating the phase failure probabilities of a multiplatform phased mission. These probabilities are then used to find the total mission failure probability. Prior to the mission the failure probabilities are used to decide if the original mission structure is acceptable. Once underway, failure probabilities, updated as circumstances change, are used to decide whether a mission should continue. Circumstances can change owing to failures on a platform, changing environmental conditions (weather), or the occurrence of unforeseen external events (emerging threats). This diagnostics information should be used to ensure that the updated failure probabilities calculated take into account the most up-to-date system information possible. Since the speed of decision making and the accuracy of the information used are essential, binary decision diagrams (BDDs) are utilized to form the basis of a fast, accurate quantification process.

AB Object detection supported by unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) has generated significant interest in recent years including applications, such as surveillance, search for missing persons, traffic, and disaster management. Location awareness is a challenging task, particularly, the deployment of UAVs in a global positioning system (GPS) restricted environment or GPS sensor failure. To mitigate this problem, we propose LocateUAV, a novel location awareness framework, to detect UAV's location by processing the data from the visual sensor in real time using a lightweight convolutional neural network (CNN). Assuming that the drone is in an IoT environment, first, the object detection technique is applied to detect the object of interest (OOI), namely, signboard. Subsequently, optical character recognition (OCR) is applied to extract useful contextual information. In the final step, the extracted information is forwarded to the map application programming interface (API) to locate the UAV. We also present a newly created data set for LocateUAV, which comprises challenging scenarios for context analysis. Moreover, we also compress an existing lightweight model up to 45 MB for efficient processing over UAV, which is 19.5% when compared with the size of the original model. Finally, an in-depth comparison of various trained and efficient object detection and OCR techniques is presented to facilitate future research on the development of flex drone that can extract information from the surroundings of a location in a GPS-restricted environment.

AB Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) are the next technology to be incorporated into a telecommunications network to improve command and control on a large scale in both line-of-sight (LOS) and non-line-of-sight (NLOS) conditions. However, there is still room for improvement in terms of reliability. This paper investigates Constant Packet Combining (CPC) and Adaptive Packet Combining (APC) techniques applied to Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) communication in the presence of large-scale fading, where the channels are subject to sudden degradation for long periods due to obstructions. We use Single Carrier (SC) Frequency Domain Equalization (FDE) combined with the Iterative Block Decision-Feedback Equalizer (IB-DFE) to handle command and control messages mapped for UAV use cases. We present closed-form equations for the equalization design as well as the performance parameters such as Bit Error Rate (BER), the Packet Error Rate (PER), the throughput, the retransmissions amount, the goodput (the transmission rate without the retransmissions quantity), and the outage probability. Then, we analyze the system performance using correlated, independent, and equal channels. There is a trade-off between the overall available power, throughput, and reliability. For instance, more retransmissions result in higher reliability, power consumption and lower goodputs (effective data rates). CPC validates the transmission system and confirms the improvement of BER and PER parameters without energy efficiency optimization. APC is appealing because it can reduce the number of retransmissions for all channels used with the advantage of meeting energy efficiency requirements by adapting the overall power to the scenario experienced by the UAV.

ID VIBRATION CONTROL; SUPPRESSION; VEHICLE
AB Transportation is a critical part of logistics in any economy. In the context of industrialization and moderniza-tion, a solution to enable utilization of autonomous vehicles that work with uncertain factors, high speed, and continuous motion is urgent. The anti-vibration control of this system plays a vital role in avoiding accidents, especially when sharing space with humans. Therefore, in this paper, non-vibration control strategies, such as the linear motion profile (LMP), symmetric motion curve (SMC), and asymmetric motion curve (ASMC), based on the phases of motion profiles, are investigated for a lifting type of carrier. Firstly, the system modelling of both the vehicle and cargo is conducted. Secondly, by analysing the dynamic characteristics, the motion performance in both the acceleration phase and deceleration phase is achieved. Several constraints are validated in order to maintain the stable motion. In the experiments, four cases including a test without the algorithm and with the algorithm with LMP, SMC, and ASMC are examined. From these results, the peak acceleration of these schemes, LMP, SMC, and ASMC, respectively, decrease by 28.5%, 20.3%, and 10.1% compared with the case without the algorithm. The contributions of this research are (i) to analyse the poles and zeros for a load-vehicle system with respect to its dynamic characteristics, (ii) to propose a vibration attenuation control scheme based on the classification of the motion phases, and (iii) to employ various smoothing profiles to demonstrate the compar-ative performance. These results can be widely applied to the sustainability of not only the logistics field but also digital trade.

AB Decision and control are core functionalities of high-level automated vehicles. Current mainstream methods, such as functional decomposition and end-to-end reinforcement learning (RL), suffer high time complexity or poor interpretability and adaptability on real-world autonomous driving tasks. In this article, we present an interpretable and computationally efficient framework called integrated decision and control (IDC) for automated vehicles, which decomposes the driving task into static path planning and dynamic optimal tracking that are structured hierarchically. First, the static path planning generates several candidate paths only considering static traffic elements. Then, the dynamic optimal tracking is designed to track the optimal path while considering the dynamic obstacles. To that end, we formulate a constrained optimal control problem (OCP) for each candidate path, optimize them separately, and follow the one with the best tracking performance. To unload the heavy online computation, we propose a model-based RL algorithm that can be served as an approximate-constrained OCP solver. Specifically, the OCPs for all paths are considered together to construct a single complete RL problem and then solved offline in the form of value and policy networks for real-time online path selecting and tracking, respectively. We verify our framework in both simulations and the real world. Results show that compared with baseline methods, IDC has an order of magnitude higher online computing efficiency, as well as better driving performance, including traffic efficiency and safety. In addition, it yields great interpretability and adaptability among different driving scenarios and tasks.

AB Recently a new type of autonomous underwater vehicle uses artificial fins to imitate the movements of marine animals, e.g. fish. These vehicles are biomimetic and their driving system is an undulating propulsion. There are two main methods of reproducing undulating motion. The first method uses a flexible tail fin, which is connected to a rigid hull by a movable axis. The second method is based on the synchronised operation of several mechanical joints to imitate the tail movement that can be observed among real marine animals such as fish. This paper will examine the first method of reproducing tail fin movement. The goal of the research presented in the paper is to identify the parameters of the one-piece flexible fin kinematics model. The model needs further analysis, e.g. using it with Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) in order to select the most suitable prototype for a Biomimetic Underwater Vehicle (BUV). The background of the work is explained in the first section of the paper and the kinematic model for the flexible fin is described in the next section. The following section is entitled Materials and Methods, and includes a description of a laboratory test of a water tunnel, a description of a Vision Algorithm (VA)which was used to determine the positions of the fin, and a Genetic Algorithm (GA) which was used to find the parameters of the kinematic fin. In the next section, the results of the research are presented and discussed. At the end of the paper, the summary including main conclusions and a schedule of the future research is inserted.

AB Vehicle automation technology is expected to bring significant benefits to transit systems. For public transportation to continue being a viable mobility alternative to private modes, automated technologies are anticipated to be actively utilized in the future. Investigating public perceptions and their determinants at an early stage is important to inform policies that will support the acceptance and future adoption of automated buses. The objective of this study was to investigate the factors that affect intention to use automated buses, using an extended version of the Technology Acceptance Model. To that end, survey data were collected from bus users in Scotland. An exploratory factor analysis was conducted to identify the latent attitudinal constructs potentially influencing intentions to use automated buses. Considering the ordinal nature of the dependent variable, ordered models were estimated using the SPSS software. Age, gender, and experience with automated vehicle technologies were found to be crucial factors in the absence of attitudinal constructs. Young males with experience of using or seeing automated vehicle technologies were more likely to use automated buses at the early stage. The fear in relation to their navigation on roads, the perceived usefulness, enjoyment of using the system, trust, perceived safety, and security influenced how early one might adopt automated buses. Unlike the expectations, perceived ease of use did not emerge as significant. The sociodemographic variables lost their predictive power when used along with attitudinal latent variables. The findings of this study highlight the importance for policy interventions to increase public awareness about automated buses.

AB Objective This study used a virtual environment to examine how older and younger pedestrians responded to simulated augmented reality (AR) overlays that indicated the crossability of gaps in a continuous stream of traffic. Background Older adults represent a vulnerable group of pedestrians. AR has the potential to make the task of street-crossing safer and easier for older adults. Method We used an immersive virtual environment to conduct a study with age group and condition as between-subjects factors. In the control condition, older and younger participants crossed a continuous stream of traffic without simulated AR overlays. In the AR condition, older and younger participants crossed with simulated AR overlays signaling whether gaps between vehicles were safe or unsafe to cross. Participants were subsequently interviewed about their experience. Results We found that participants were more selective in their crossing decisions and took safer gaps in the AR condition as compared to the control condition. Older adult participants also reported reduced mental and physical demand in the AR condition compared to the control condition. Conclusion AR overlays that display the crossability of gaps between vehicles have the potential to make street-crossing safer and easier for older adults. Additional research is needed in more complex real-world scenarios to further examine how AR overlays impact pedestrian behavior. Application With rapid advances in autonomous vehicle and vehicle-to-pedestrian communication technologies, it is critical to study how pedestrians can be better supported. Our research provides key insights for ways to improve pedestrian safety applications using emerging technologies like AR.

AB Simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) is one of the key technologies for coal mine underground operation vehicles to build complex environment maps and positioning and to realize unmanned and autonomous operation. Many domestic and foreign scholars have studied many SLAM algorithms, but the mapping accuracy and real-time performance still need to be further improved. This paper presents a SLAM algorithm integrating scan context and Light weight and Ground-Optimized LiDAR Odometry and Mapping (LeGO-LOAM), LeGO-LOAM-SC. The algorithm uses the global descriptor extracted by scan context for loop detection, adds pose constraints to Georgia Tech Smoothing and Mapping (GTSAM) by Iterative Closest Points (ICP) for graph optimization, and constructs point cloud map and an output estimated pose of the mobile vehicle. The test with KITTI dataset 00 sequence data and the actual test in 2-storey underground parking lots are carried out. The results show that the proposed improved algorithm makes up for the drift of the point cloud map, has a higher mapping accuracy, a better real-time performance, a lower resource occupancy, a higher coincidence between trajectory estimation and real trajectory, smoother loop, and 6% reduction in CPU occupancy, the mean square errors of absolute trajectory error (ATE) and relative pose error (RPE) are reduced by 55.7% and 50.3% respectively; the translation and rotation accuracy are improved by about 5%, and the time consumption is reduced by 2~4%. Accurate map construction and low drift pose estimation can be performed.

AB The tremendous increase in vehicular navigation often witnessed daily has elicited constant and continuous traffic congestion at signalized road intersections. This study focuses on applying an artificial neural network trained by particle swarm optimization (ANN-PSO) to unravel the problem of traffic congestion. Traffic flow variables, such as the speed of vehicles on the road, number of different categories of vehicles, traffic density, time, and traffic volumes, were considered input and output variables for modelling traffic flow of non-autonomous vehicles at a signalized road intersection. Four hundred and thirty-four (434) traffic datasets, divided into thirteen (13) inputs and one (1) output, were obtained from seven roadsites connecting to the N1 Allandale interchange identified as the busiest road in Southern Africa. The results obtained from this research have shown a training and testing performance of 0.98356 and 0.98220. These results are indications of a significant positive correlation between the inputs and output variables. Optimal performance of the ANN-PSO model was achieved by tuning the number of neurons, accelerating factors, and swarm population sizes concurrently. The evidence from this research study suggests that the ANN-PSO model is an appropriate predictive model for the swift optimization of vehicular traffic flow at signalized road intersections. This research extends our knowledge of traffic flow modelling at a signalized road intersection using metaheuristics algorithms. The ANN-PSO model developed in this research will assist traffic engineers in designing traffic lights and creation of traffic rules at signalized road intersections.

However, affected by the nature of deep learning, end-to-end autonomous driving is currently facing some problems. First, due to the imbalance between the "junctions" and "non-junctions" samples of the road scene, the model is overfitted to a large class of samples during training, resulting in insufficient learning of the ability to turn at intersections; second, it is difficult to evaluate the confidence of the deep learning model, so it is impossible to determine whether the model output is reliable, and then make further decisions, which is an important reason why the end-to-end autonomous driving solution is not recognized; and third, the deep learning model is highly sensitive to disturbances, and the predicted results of the previous and subsequent frames are prone to jumping. To this end, a more robust and reliable end-to-end visual navigation scheme (RREV navigation) is proposed in this paper, which was used to predict a vehicle's future waypoints from front-view RGB images. First, the scheme adopted a dual-model learning strategy, using two models to independently learn "junctions" and "non-junctions" to eliminate the influence of sample imbalance. Secondly, according to the smoothness and continuity of waypoints, a model confidence quantification method of "Independent Prediction-Fitting Error" (IPFE) was proposed. Finally, IPFE was applied to weight the multi-frame output to eliminate the influence of the prediction jump of the deep learning model and ensure the coherence and smoothness of the output. The experimental results show that the RREV navigation scheme in this paper was more reliable and robust, especially, the steering performance of the model intersection could be greatly improved.

AB This paper attempts to address two particular questions about the adoption of connected autonomous trucks (CATs) by trucking companies: (i) what are the factors affecting the decisions to adopt different levels of autonomous trucks? and (ii) how many with what sizes are the groups of CAT adopters? We employ choice modeling and latent-class cluster analysis (LCCA) to address the two questions. US companies working in the freight industry are contacted and 400 full re-sponses are collected. The data is analyzed descriptively and detailed results of modeling efforts are presented and discussed. Focusing on the first question, companies view automation Level 2 not significantly different than Regular trucks. We observe that small-sized companies are more likely to adopt the higher levels of automation, and large companies may be willing to adopt only when the technology become more affordable. Cargo type is found to have some impact on the adoption: for example, companies carrying foodstuff are more likely to adopt higher levels of automation. Having promoters of new technologies in the company increases the likelihood of adoption and the impact is more visible for the higher levels of automation. Turning to the second question, our results indicate that there could be five categories of CAT adopters which is consistent with what the Theory of diffusion of Innovations (DOI) suggests. However, the sizes of the Innovators and Early Majority classes would respectively be four and two times of DOI's general suggestion. Overall, it is speculated that the CAT adopter distribution may not be a bell-shaped curve but more of a right-skewed figure. This can be contributed to explicit financial benefits of CATs which could incentivize companies to adopt earlier.

AB The marine environment surrounding islands and reefs exhibit significant time-varying characteristics, which require the path planning algorithm of an unmanned surface vehicle (USV) to have good environmental adaptability. To this end, a dynamic path planning algorithm for USV under an island-reef environment is proposed. The algorithm fully considers these environmental features, such as ocean currents, tides, and winds, to construct an environment model. The environment model is combined with the USV motion model to construct a path planning model under the constraint of environmental disturbance time windows. This approach ensures that the path planning model can adapt to the time-varying marine environment. At the same time, to improve the safety of USV navigation by effectively predicting and timely avoiding passing ships, the velocity obstacle method is introduced for establishing a collision risk assessment model that detects the threat level of passing ships in the vicinity of the USV. Based on the decision-making basis generated by the model, a path replanning model is constructed under the constraint of collision detection time windows. This improves the dynamic collision avoidance capability of the path replanning model. Furthermore, to speed up the solution speed and accuracy of the path planning model and the path replanning model, the multiobjective particle swarm optimization algorithm is improved in three aspects: particle coding method, particle update strategy, and external archive maintenance mechanism. Simulation results show that the algorithm can enable USV to safely avoid multiple close-range dynamic obstacles under maritime rules, while also demonstrating a high level of adaptability to the time-varying marine environment.

ID TERRAIN CLASSIFICATION
AB The demand for several sources of situational data from the traffic environment has intensified in recent years, through the development of applications in intelligent transport systems (ITS), such as autonomous vehicles and advanced driver assistance systems. Among these situational data, the road surface type classification is one of the most important and can be used throughout the ITS domain. However, in order to have a wide application, the development of a safe and reliable model is necessary. Therefore, in addition to the application of safe technology, the model developed must operate correctly in different vehicles, with different driving styles and in different environments in which vehicles can travel to. For this purpose, in this work we collect nine datasets with contextual variations using inertial sensors, represented by accelerometers and gyroscopes. These data were produced in three different vehicles, with three different drivers, in three different environments in which there are three different surface types, in addition to variations in conservation state and presence of obstacles and anomalies, such as speed bumps and potholes. After a pre-processing step, these data were used in 34 different computational models for road surface type classification, employing both Classical Machine Learning and Deep Learning techniques. Through several experiments, we analyze the learning and generalization capacity of each technique. The best model developed was a CNN-based deep neural network, which obtained validation accuracy of 93.17%, classifying surfaces between segments of dirt, cobblestone or asphalt roads.

AB The emerging applications of the Internet of Things (IoT), such as driverless cars, have an increasing need for precise vehicle positioning. Inertial navigation systems (INSs) became a possible component of autonomous driving systems due to low computational load, fast response, and high autonomy. However, error accumulation presents a significant challenge. Although nonholonomic constraints (NHCs) and odometry (ODO) have been demonstrated to improve INS, NHC is not always reliable, and ODO is often inaccessible in many applications. To address these issues, we propose a novel untethered pseudo-odometry, SdoNet, a convolutional neural network that estimates vehicle velocity from raw inertial measurement unit (IMU) observations to extend NHC as a 3-D velocity constraint without needing a hardware-wheeled ODO. To eliminate the influence of interference features on the accuracy of SdoNet, we improve the SdoNet by incorporating a residual module, attention mechanism, and soft threshold to guide the network to eliminate interference features. Moreover, a lightweight noise adapter network is proposed to adjust the constraint measurement noise covariance dynamically to apply the velocity constraint properly. The proposed approach is validated on the KITTI data set, demonstrating that SdoNet enhances the network's learning ability and achieves robust and accurate velocity regression, especially in noisy IMU observations. The mean absolute speed regression error of SdoNet is lower than the two types of long short-term memory networks by 52.52% and 71.86%, respectively. Compared to the process using only NHC, the absolute translation error is reduced by approximately 44.00% after employing the pseudo-ODO velocity constraint and further reduced by around 11.31% after employing the noise adapter.

AB In this paper, multi-UAV trajectory planning and resource allocation are jointly investigated to improve the information freshness for vehicular networks, where the vehicles collect time-critical traffic information by on-board sensors and upload to the UAVs through their allocated spectrum resource. We adopt the expected sum age of information (ESAoI) to measure the network-wide information freshness. ESAoI is jointly affected by both the UAVs trajectory and the resource allocation, which are coupled with each other and make the analysis of ESAoI challenging. To tackle this challenge, we introduce a joint trajectory planning and resource allocation procedure, where the UAVs firstly fly to their destinations and then hover to allocate resource blocks (RBs) during a time-slot. Based on this procedure, we formulate a trajectory planning and resource allocation problem for ESAoI minimization. To solve the mixed integer nonlinear programming (MINLP) problem with hybrid decision variables, we propose a TD3 trajectory planning and Round-robin resource allocation (TTP-RRA). Specifically, we exploit the exploration and learning ability of the twin delayed deep deterministic policy gradient algorithm (TD3) for UAVs trajectory planning, and utilize Round Robin rule for the optimal resource allocation. With TTP-RRA, the UAVs obtain their flight velocities by sensing the locations and the age of information (AoI) of the vehicles, then allocate the RBs to the vehicles in a descending order of AoI until the remaining RBs are not sufficient to support another successful uploading. Simulation results demonstrate that TTP-RRA outperforms the baseline approaches in terms of ESAoI and average AoI (AAoI).

AB Traffic crashes remain a leading cause of accidental human death where aggressive driving is a significant contributing factor. To review the driver's performance presented in aggressive driving, this systematic review screens 2412 pieces of relevant literature, selects and synthesizes 31 reports with 34 primary studies that investigated the driver's control performance among the general driver population in four-wheeled passenger vehicles and published with full text in English. These 34 selected studies involved 1731 participants in total. By examining the selected 34 studies, the measures relating to vehicle speed (e.g., mean speed, n = 22), lateral control (e.g., lane deviation, n = 17) and driving errors (e.g., violation of traffic rules, n = 12) were reported most frequently with a significant difference observed between aggressive driving and driving in the control group. The result of the meta-analysis indicates that the aggressive driving behaviour would have 1) a significantly faster speed than the behaviour in the control group with an increase of 5.32 km/h (95% confidence interval, [3.27, 7.37] km/h) based on 8 studies with 639 participants in total; 2) 2.51 times more driving errors (95% confidence interval, [1.32, 3.71] times) than the behaviour in the control group, based on 5 studies with 136 participants in total. This finding can be used to support the identification and quantification of aggressive driving behaviour, which could form the basis of an in-vehicle aggressive driving monitoring system.

AB The rapid growth of Autonomous Vehicle (AV) technology and the integration of edge computing grasp new challenges along with the ever-increasing mobile internet traffic and services. Tackling such challenges through customized edge computing services is the critical research in 6G Vehicle-to-Everything (6G-V2X) communication. V2X contributes detailed information about the current navigation of vehicles, automatic payments for toll roads, parking fees and other services. With the countless, unique, and personalized service requirements of AVs over computation-intensive applications, exploring the edge resources for the excellent Quality of Service (QoS) provision is the greatest concern. This paper proposes a Federated Learning and edge Cache-assisted Cybertwin (FLCC) framework for personalized service provision in 6G-V2X. Integration of cybertwin in 6G enables the connectivity of the physical system to the digital realm, allowing for adequate instantaneous wireless access. The FLCC jointly considers the edge cooperation and optimizations through the proposed Federated Multi-agent Deep Reinforcement Learning based (FM-DRL) algorithm. The FM-DRL algorithm balances the FLCC's learning accuracy. It minimizes the time and cost by taking the factors such as cybertwin association, training data batch size, and bandwidth. Finally, caching is performed using the Federated Reinforcement Learning-based Edge Caching (FREC) algorithm to obtain the desired datasets required that train the model for providing personalized 6G-V2X services for the AVs. Numerical studies and simulation results reveal that the proposed system outperforms the baseline learning approaches by 17.6%.

AB Recently, many studies have been performed worldwide to extend the persistence of underwater operations by autonomous underwater vehicles. Underwater battery recharging technology is one of the solutions even though challenges still remain. The docking function plays an important role not only in battery recharging but also in other advanced applications, such as intervention. Visual servoing in undersea environments inevitably encounters difficulties in recognizing the environment when captured images are disturbed by noise. This study describes the effective recognition performance and robustness against air bubble disturbances in images captured by a real-time position and orientation (pose) tracking and servoing system using stereo vision for a visual-servoing-type underwater vehicle. The recognition of the vehicle pose based on dynamic images captured by dual video cameras was performed by a real-time multistep genetic algorithm (RM-GA). In previous studies, the docking performance was investigated under the condition that there were no disturbances in the captured images that address image degradation. In this paper, the robustness of the RM-GA against air bubble disturbances was verified through visual servoing and docking experiments in a pool test to confirm that the system can continue to recognize the pose of the 3-D marker and can maintain the desired pose by visual servoing. Then, the effectiveness of the proposed system against real disturbances such as turbidity that may degrade the visibility of the system in the sea was confirmed by conducting the docking experiment in a real sea, having verified the practicality of the proposed method.

AB Autonomous localization and mapping in complex environments are prerequisites for the autonomous intelligence of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs). Current strategies to boost localization precision integrate various information sources, including inertial data, point features, and line features. While line features offer richer structural insights, their extraction and computation are extremely time-consuming, challenging the system's real-time responsiveness. Addressing this, we propose a visual-inertial navigation coupled localization method based on adaptive point-line feature extraction (VIN-APL). This method features an adaptive extraction mechanism that can dynamically adjust the line feature extraction threshold in response to environmental texture variations and optimize the balance between localization accuracy and computation cost better. Experiment results show that VIN-APL achieves better localization accuracy than VIN system (VINS)-Mono in most of the tested sequences, especially the more difficult ones, with an average localization error reduction of 13.58%. Compared with PL-VINS, VIN-APL not only achieves superior accuracy across most sequences but also reduces the average computation time for line feature extraction nodes by 45.72%.

ID POWER-SYSTEMS; OPERATION; SUPPORT
AB Increasing penetration of replenished renewable energy sources (RES) to the power grid is inevitable and brings stability challenges to traditional electric power systems (EPS). One of them is the frequency fluctuation due to the high participation of RES in the EPS. To reduce the grid frequency deviation, in this paper, an autonomous frequency regulation (FR) controller is proposed using the power of battery energy storage systems (BESS) in electric vehicle charging stations (EVCS) while providing the charging service. A proportional-integral (PI) controller scheme with a contribution factor is used in the proposed FR controller. The contribution factor determines the maximum power from BESS used for the proposed FR. The required power for the FR is then used to generate the setpoint for the inner-loop current controller of the grid-connected inverter (GCI). An impedance-based stability analysis considering the PI current controller and PLL gains for the LCL-filtered GCI is conducted. For the performance evaluation, the proposed FR controller is demonstrated in the IEEE 14-bus power system in PSCAD simulation.

AB The 402-mile of Interstate 80 in Wyoming was selected by the U.S. Department of Transportation to develop, test, and deploy a suite of Connected Vehicle (CV) applications (WYDOT CV Pilot). It is expected that after full deployment of CV technology, the pilot will improve safety and mobility under adverse weather conditions by creating new ways to communicate road and travel information to both drivers and fleet managers. In this regard, this research employed an integrated microsimulation modeling approach to assess the safety performance of the WYDOT CV Pilot. A 23-mile representative I-80 corridor was selected for developing the micro simulation models. Traffic flow and driving behavior data under winter snowy weather condition were collected to calibrate the baseline microsimulation model. A driving simulator experiment was conducted to quantitatively investigate the impacts of CV technology on driving behavior; accordingly, the driving behavior data under CV environment were employed to properly update the calibrated CV microsimulation models. The safety effectiveness of the WYDOT CV Pilot were assessed for various demand levels and CV penetration rates. It was concluded that WYDOT CV applications increased drivers' situation awareness under adverse weather conditions, and thus reduced the crash risk. The reductions in conflicts displayed a decreasing trend with the increase of CV penetration rates, but the reduction was not significant when CV penetration was lower than 10 percent. The maximum reduction in conflicts was 85 percent when all trucks were equipped with CV technology.

ID CONNECTED VEHICLES; FORCE MODEL
AB Intelligent-driving technologies play crucial roles in reducing road-traffic accidents and ensuring more convenience while driving. One of the significant challenges in developing an intelligent vehicle is how to operate it safely without causing fear in other human drivers. This paper presents a new behavioral decision-making model to achieve both safety and high efficiency and also to reduce the adverse effect of autonomous vehicles on the other road users while driving. Moreover, we attempt to adapt the model for human drivers so that users can understand, adapt, and utilize intelligent-driving technologies. Furthermore, this paper proposes a combined spring model for assessing driving risk. Thus, we analyze some driving characteristics of drivers and choose "safety" and "high efficiency" as the two main factors that are pursued by drivers while driving. Based on the principle of least action, a multiobjective optimization cost function is established for the decision-making model. Finally, we design six unprotected left-turn scenarios at a T-intersection and three unprotected left-turn scenarios at a standard two-lane intersection for applying simulation algorithm and provide a decision-making map for developing intelligent-driving technologies. Based on the principle of least action, this paper demonstrates that optimization theory can give insight into drivers' behavior and can also contribute to the development of intelligent-driving algorithms. The experimental results reveal that the behavioral decision-making model can always avoid collision accidents on the premise of ensuring certain efficiency, and it can achieve 97.01%, 94.52%, 96.67%, 91.18%, 101.27%, 83.33%, 102.94%, 103.03%, and 105.77% of time to intersection's maximum pass rate in the considered nine scenarios.

AB Computational fluid dynamics, CFD, is becoming an essential tool in the prediction of the hydrodynamic efforts and flow characteristics of underwater vehicles for manoeuvring studies. However, when applied to the manoeuvrability of autonomous underwater vehicles, AUVs, most studies have focused on the determination of static coefficients without considering the effects of the vehicle control surface deflection. This paper analyses the hydrodynamic efforts generated on an AUV considering the combined effects of the control surface deflection and the angle of attack using CFD software based on the Reynolds-averaged Navier-Stokes formulations. The CFD simulations are also independently conducted for the AUV bare hull and control surface to better identify their individual and interference efforts and to validate the simulations by comparing the experimental results obtained in a towing tank. Several simulations of the bare hull case were conducted to select the k-omega SST turbulent model with the viscosity approach that best predicts its hydrodynamic efforts. Mesh sensitivity analyses were conducted for all simulations. For the flow around the control surfaces, the CFD results were analysed according to two different methodologies, standard and nonlinear. The nonlinear regression methodology provides better results than the standard methodology does for predicting the stall at the control surface. The flow simulations have shown that the occurrence of the control surface stall depends on a linear relationship between the angle of attack and the control surface deflection. This type of information can be used in designing the vehicle's autopilot system. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

ID SLIDING-MODE CONTROL
AB Experiments with two formation controllers for marine unmanned surface vessels are reported. The formation controllers are designed using the nonlinear robust model-based sliding mode approach. The marine vehicles can operate in arbitrary formation configurations by using two leader-follower control schemes. For the design of these controller schemes 3 degrees of freedom (DOFs) of surge, sway, and yaw are assumed in the planar motion of the marine surface vessels. Each vessel only has two actuators; therefore, the vessels are underactuated and the lack of a kinematic constraint puts them into the holonomic system category. In this work, the position of a control point on the vessel is controlled, and the orientation dynamics is not directly controlled. Therefore, there is a potential for an oscillatory yaw motion to occur. It is shown that the orientation dynamics, as the internal dynamics of this underactuated system, is stable, i.e., the follower vehicle does not oscillate about its control point during the formation maneuvers. The proposed formation controller relies only on the state information obtained from the immediate neighbors of the vessel and the vessel itself. The effectiveness and robustness of formation control laws in the presence of parameter uncertainty and environmental disturbances are demonstrated by using both simulations and field experiments. The experiments were performed in a natural environment on a lake using a small test boat, and show robust performance to parameter uncertainty and disturbance. This paper reports the first experimental verification of the above mentioned approach, whose unique features are the use of a control point, the zero-dynamic stability analysis, the use of leader-follower method and a nonlinear robust control approach.

AB Depth control is crucial for underwater vehicles, not only to perform certain tasks that require the vehicle to be still at a given depth but also because most propeller-driven vehicles waste a considerable amount of energy to counteract the passively tuned positive buoyancy. The use of a variable buoyancy system (VBS) can effectively address these items, increasing the energetic efficiency and thus mission length. Achieving accurate depth controllers is, however, a complex task, since experimental controller development in sea or even in test pools is unpractical and the use of simulation requires accurate vertical motion models whose parameters might be difficult to obtain or measure. The development of simple, yet comprehensive, dynamic models for devices incorporating VBS is therefore of upmost importance, as well as developing procedures that allow a simple determination of their parameters. This work contributes to this field by deriving a unified model for the vertical motion of a VBS actuated device, irrespective of the specific technological actuation solution employed, whether it be electromechanical or electrohydraulic. A concise analysis of the open-loop stability of the unified model is presented and a straightforward yet efficient procedure for identifying several of its parameters is introduced. This identification procedure is designed to be convenient and can be carried out in shallow waters, such as test pools, while its results are applicable to the deeper water model as well. To validate the procedure, experimental values obtained from an electromechanical VBS actuated device are used. Closed-loop control of the electromechanical VBS actuated device is conducted through simulation and experimental tests. The results confirm the effectiveness of the proposed unified model and the parameter identification methodology.

ID CHARGING STRATEGIES; DISTRIBUTION NETWORKS; MANAGEMENT; SYSTEMS; IMPACT
AB High deployment of electric vehicles (EVs) imposes great challenges for the distribution grids, especially in unbalanced systems with notable voltage variations which detrimentally affect security of supply. On the other hand, with development of Vehicle-to-Grid technology, EVs may be able to provide numerous services for grid support, e.g., voltage control. Implemented electronic equipment will allow them to exchange reactive power for autonomous voltage support without communicating with the distribution system operator or influencing the available active power for primary transportation function. This paper proposes a voltage dependent EV reactive power control and quantifies its impact on a real Danish low-voltage grid. The observed network is a heavily unbalanced three-phase four-wire grid modeled in Matlab SimPowerSystems based on real hourly measurement data. Simulations are performed in order to evaluate phase-to-neutral voltage support benefits as well as to address neutral-to-ground values, active power losses and the unbalances at the same time. The analysis shows that reactive power support both raises minimum phase-to-neutral voltage magnitudes and improves voltage dispersion while the energy losses are not notably increased. Further on, since the control is voltage dependent, provided reactive power is unequal among the phases leading to greater support on heavily loaded phases and decreased unbalances caused by residential consumption. Hence, implementation of such a phase-wise enhanced voltage support could defer the need for grid reinforcement in case of large EV penetration rates, especially in highly unbalanced networks.

AB The implementationof computation offloading is a challenging issue in the remote areas where traditional edge infrastructures are sparsely deployed. In this study, the authors propose a unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)-enabled edge computing framework, where a group of UAVs fly around to provide the near-users edge computing service. They study the computation migration problem for the complex missions, which can be decomposed as some typical task-flows considering the inter-dependency of tasks. Each time a task appears, it should be allocated to a proper UAV for execution, which is defined as the computation migration or task migration. Since the UAV-ground communication data rate is strongly associated with the UAV location, selecting a proper UAV to execute each task will largely benefit the missions response time. They formulate the computation migration decision making problem as a Markov decision process, in which the state contains the extracted observations from the environment. To cope with the dynamics of the environment, they propose an advantage actor-critic reinforcement learning approach to learn the near-optimal policy on-the-fly. Simulation results show that the proposed approach has a desirable convergence property, and can significantly reduce the average response time of missions compared with the benchmark greedy method.

AB As the basic link of autonomous navigation in agriculture, crop row detection is vital to achieve accurate detection of crop rows for autonomous navigation. Machine vision algorithms are easily affected by factors such as changes in field lighting and weather conditions, and the majority of machine vision algorithms detect early periods of crops, but it is challenging to detect crop rows under high sheltering pressure in the middle and late periods. In this paper, a crop row detection algorithm based on LiDAR is proposed that is aimed at the middle and late crop periods, which has a good effect compared with the conventional machine vision algorithm. The algorithm proposed the following three steps: point cloud preprocessing, feature point extraction, and crop row centerline detection. Firstly, dividing the horizontal strips equally, the improved K-means algorithm and the prior information of the previous horizontal strip are utilized to obtain the candidate points of the current horizontal strip, then the candidate points information is used to filter and extract the feature points in accordance with the corresponding threshold, and finally, the least squares method is used to fit the crop row centerlines. The experimental results show that the algorithm can detect the centerlines of crop rows in the middle and late periods of maize under the high sheltering environment. In the middle period, the average correct extraction rate of maize row centerlines was 95.1%, and the average processing time was 0.181 s; in the late period, the average correct extraction rate of maize row centerlines was 87.3%, and the average processing time was 0.195 s. At the same time, it also demonstrates accuracy and superiority of the algorithm over the machine vision algorithm, which can provide a solid foundation for autonomous navigation in agriculture.

AB Using multiple mobile robots in search missions offers a lot of benefits, but one needs a suitable and competent motion control algorithm that is able to consider sensor characteristics, the uncertainty of target detection, and complexity of needed maneuvers in order to make a multiagent search autonomous. This article provides a methodology for an autonomous 2-D search using multiple unmanned (aerial or possibly other) vehicles. The proposed methodology relies on an accurate calculation of target occurrence probability distribution based on the initial estimated target distribution and continuous action of spatial variant search agent sensors. The core of the autonomous search process is a high-level motion control for multiple search agents which utilizes the probabilistic model of target occurrence via a heat equation-driven area coverage (HEDAC) method. This centralized motion control algorithm is tailored for handling a group of search agents that are heterogeneous in both motion and sensing characteristics. The motion of agents is directed by the gradient of the potential field which provides a near-ergodic exploration of the search space. The proposed method is tested on three realistic search mission simulations and compared with three alternative methods, where HEDAC outperforms all alternatives in all tests. Conventional search strategies need about double the time to achieve the proportionate detection rate when compared to HEDAC controlled search. The scalability test showed that increasing the number of an HEDAC controlled search agents, although somewhat deteriorating the search efficiency, provides needed speed-up of the search. This study shows the flexibility and competence of the proposed method and gives a strong foundation for possible real-world applications.

AB For the inspection of structures, particularly bridges, it is becoming common to replace humans with autonomous systems that use unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV). In this paper, a framework for autonomous bridge inspection using a UAV is proposed with a four-step workflow: (a) data acquisition with an efficient UAV flight path, (b) computer vision comprising training, testing and validation of convolutional neural networks (ConvNets), (c) point cloud generation using intelligent hierarchical dense structure from motion (DSfM), and (d) damage quantification. This workflow starts with planning the most efficient flight path that allows for capturing of the minimum number of images required to achieve the maximum accuracy for the desired defect size, then followed by bridge and damage recognition. Three types of autonomous detection are used: masking the background of the images, detecting areas of potential damage, and pixel-wise damage segmentation. Detection of bridge components by masking extraneous parts of the image, such as vegetation, sky, roads or rivers, can improve the 3D reconstruction in the feature detection and matching stages. In addition, detecting damaged areas involves the UAV capturing close-range images of these critical regions, and damage segmentation facilitates damage quantification using 2D images. By application of DSfM, a denser and more accurate point cloud can be generated for these detected areas, and aligned to the overall point cloud to create a digital model of the bridge. Then, this generated point cloud is evaluated in terms of outlier noise, and surface deviation. Finally, damage that has been detected is quantified and verified, based on the point cloud generated using the Terrestrial Laser Scanning (TLS) method. The results indicate this workflow for autonomous bridge inspection has potential.

AB Although existing research identified influences of age and gender on Automated Vehicle (AV) acceptance, the underlying reasons were not revealed. A potential reason is that age and gender are exogenous variables, which do not change by other variables. There must exist endogenous variables, such as the built environment and personal factors, such as affordability, travel needs, exposure to AV knowledge, acting as mediating factors that bridge the exogenous variables and AV acceptance. However, these mediating effects have not been discovered, validated, and quantified. Therefore, this paper provides a new viewpoint in unveiling how ages and genders influence acceptance of AV by quantitatively revealing hidden mediating effects focusing on the built environment and personal factors. A statewide survey was conducted in Kentucky. Besides demographical information, respondents' personal information such as travel needs, afford-ability, exposure to AV knowledge, and the built environment were collected. Results reveal that males with high levels of travel needs and affordability better accept AV due to higher familiarity and more experience riding AV. Younger adults are more likely to have higher AV acceptance levels than older adults because younger adults tend to live in an urban setting with higher exposure levels to AV technology. Results suggest that experience in riding an AV, the most influential factor, improves acceptance by 44.8%. The research informs transportation agencies of a better understanding of how people of different ages and genders accept AV.

AB Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) are playing an increasingly important role in people's daily lives due to their low cost of operation, low requirements for ground support, high maneuverability, high environmental adaptability, and high safety. Yet UAV path planning under various safety risks, such as crash and collision, is not an easy task, due to the complicated and dynamic nature of path environments. Therefore, developing an efficient and flexible algorithm for UAV path planning has become inevitable. Aimed at quality-oriented UAV path planning, this paper is designed to analyze UAV path planning from two aspects: global static planning and local dynamic hierarchical planning. Through a theoretical and mathematical approach, a three-dimensional UAV path planning model was established. Based on the A* algorithm, the search strategy, the step size, and the cost function were improved, and the OPEN set was simplified, thereby shortening the planning time and greatly improving the execution efficiency of the algorithm. Moreover, a dynamic exploration factor was added to the exploration mechanism of Q-learning to solve the exploration-exploitation dilemma of Q-learning to adapt to the local dynamic path adjustment for UAVs. The global-local hybrid UAV path planning algorithm was formed by combining the two. The simulation results indicate that the proposed planning model and algorithm can efficiently solve the problem of UAV path planning, improve the path quality, and can be a significant reference for solving other problems related to path planning, such as the reliability, security, and safety of UAV, when embedded into the heuristic function of the proposed algorithm.

TI Formation and reconfiguration of tight multi-lane platoons

DE Connected and Automated Vehicles; Optimization-based motion planning;
   Dual decomposition; Formation and reconfiguration; Collision avoidance;
   Tight maneuvering
AB Advances in vehicular communication technologies are expected to facilitate cooperative driving in the future. Connected and Automated Vehicles (CAVs) are able to collaboratively plan and execute driving maneuvers by sharing their perceptual knowledge and future plans. In this paper, an architecture for autonomous navigation of tight multi-lane platoons traveling on public roads is presented. Using the proposed approach, CAVs are able to form single or multi-lane platoons of various geometrical configurations. They are able to reshape and adjust their configurations according to changes in the environment. The proposed architecture consists of two main components: an offline motion planner system and an online hierarchical control system. The motion planner uses an optimization-based approach for cooperative formation and reconfiguration in fight spaces. A constrained optimization scheme is used to plan smooth, dynamically feasible and collision-free trajectories for all the vehicles within the platoon. The paper addresses online computation limitations by employing a family of maneuvers precomputed offline and stored on a look-up table on the vehicles. The online hierarchical control system is composed of three levels: a traffic operation system (TOS), a decisionmaker, and a path-follower. The TOS determines the desired platoon reconfiguration. The decision-maker checks the feasibility of the reconfiguration plan based on real-time information about the surrounding traffic. The reconfiguration maneuver is executed by a low-level path-following feedback controller in real-time. The effectiveness of the approach is demonstrated through simulations of three case studies: (1) formation reconfiguration (2) obstacle avoidance, and (3) benchmarking against behavior-based planning in which the desired formation is achieved using a sequence of motion primitives.

ID AUTONOMOUS VEHICLES
AB Innovations in transportation can contribute to reaching relevant societal objectives (e.g. reduce emissions, congestion levels and/or risks). To determine which innovations to stimulate (and which not) it is important for policy makers to assess their effects on beforehand. Expert judgement is an often-used method for this purpose. Although expert opinions can provide useful input for decision-making, these judgement are potentially subject to change, for example, due to new information becoming available or because the (academic) discussion about the innovation in question takes a new turn. Studies that explicitly study stability and change in expert judgements are rare, but highly relevant to determine the reliability of experts' assessments. To address this gap, this study assesses experts' judgments at multiple points in time focusing on the effects of a transport innovation with potentially widespread societal implications, namely Automated Vehicles (AVs). To this end a survey was administrated to a group of experts involved in the WISE-ACT project. The results indicate that expert opinions towards this innovation are generally favorable; AVs are believed to reduce congestion delays, greenhouse gas emissions and traffic accidents. Although the consulted experts are generally quite stable in their opinions, they are becoming less optimistic about these positive effects over time. A Q-factor analysis additionally reveals two clusters of experts, one with a positive and one a negative outlook on AVs. The latter group beliefs that AVs will lower the value of travel time, thereby increasing travel demand, and, in turn, emission and congestion levels. Overall, the changing and diverging opinions among experts indicate that the transition to AVs is not necessarily regarded as a desirable one.

AB Road traffic safety has attracted increasing research attention, in particular in the current transition from human-driven vehicles to autonomous vehicles. Surrogate measures of safety are widely used to assess traffic safety but they typically ignore motion uncertainties and are inflexible in dealing with two-dimensional motion. Meanwhile, learning-based lane-change and trajectory prediction models have shown potential to provide accurate prediction results. We therefore propose a prediction-based driving risk metric for two-dimensional motion on multi-lane highways, expressed by the maximum risk value over different time instants within a prediction horizon. At each time instant, the risk of the vehicle is estimated as the sum of weighted risks over each mode in a finite set of lane-change maneuver possibilities. Under each maneuver mode, the risk is calculated as the product of three factors: lane-change maneuver mode probability, collision probability and expected crash severity. The three factors are estimated leveraging two-stage multi-modal trajectory predictions for surrounding vehicles: first a lane-change intention prediction module is invoked to provide lane-change maneuver mode possibilities, and then the mode possibilities are used as partial input for a multi-modal trajectory prediction module. Working with the empirical trajectory dataset highD and simulated highway scenarios, the proposed two-stage model achieves superior performance compared to a state-of-the-art prediction model. The proposed risk metric is computationally efficient for real-time applications, and effective to identify potential crashes earlier thanks to the employed prediction model.

AB The process of modelling vehicle motion in a road traffic environment requires the integration of trajectory generation with vehicle control. The steps involved here are generating a feasible trajectory based on the existing traffic and tracking the trajectory to control it with a steering angle input. Since the parameters of a physical system vary with changes in operating conditions, it is important to consider robustness when designing controllers. This article aims at developing a trajectory-following model with robust steering control strategies to accurately follow a generated trajectory. In this study, performance-based proportional, robust proportional and sliding mode control strategies are designed for trajectory following. The robustness of the proportional controller is established using Kharitonov's theorem, which is compared with a proportional controller tuned for performance. Sliding mode control is designed for robustness and chattering elimination using two kinds of reaching laws - a constant reaching law and a novel power rate exponential reaching law. The controllers are designed using a dynamic bicycle model considering the error with respect to the trajectory. The controllers are then evaluated in IPG CarMaker (R). The resulting trajectories and control inputs are compared for the considered control methodologies using the ISO double lane change and the Slalom tests. Sliding mode control with power rate exponential reaching law is concluded to be more robust as compared to the other controllers, with lower response times, up to 84% lower heading angle deviations from the trajectory and an overshoot of only 3.2% in lane changing.

AB Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs)-based sensor network is an effective mechanism for recognising and tracking of manoeuvring targets as well as expanding the monitoring coverage in the battlefield. However, there exists redundancy among the spectrum data collected by a UAV monitor within a data collection period, which may waste storage space and reduce the speed of data uploaded to the control centre. The authors assume that each UAV is equipped with an edge computing server and propose a delta compression method, which can save cache space and transfer time. First, they present a cost model and evaluation model for delta compression of the COPY/ADD class. Then an optimisation problem is formulated aiming to obtain the optimal delta encoding. Additionally, a maximal total length of copied fragments (MTLC) algorithm is proposed to find more mutually separatedL-grams common fragments between the data collected at two adjacent moments. Theoretical analysis proves that the MTLC algorithm can generate a good delta encoding with the maximum total length and then the minimum total number of the COPYs. Moreover, numerical results show that MTLC has better performance in constructing a good delta encoding than the simple greedy and hash suffix array delta algorithms.

AB Electric vehicles have penetrated the Dutch market, which increases the potential for decreased local emissions, the use and storage of sustainable energy, and the roll-out and use of electric car-sharing business models. This development also raises new potential issues such as increased electricity demand, a lack of social acceptance, and infrastructural challenges in the built environment. Relevant stakeholders, such as policymakers and service providers, need to align their values and prioritize these aspects. Our study investigates the prioritization of 11 Dutch decision-makers in the field of public electric vehicle charging. These decision-makers prioritized different indicators related to measurements (e.g., EV adoption rates or charge point profitability), organization (such as fast- or smart-charging), and developments (e.g., the development of mobility-service markets) using the bestworst method. The indicators within these categories were prioritized for three different scenario's in time. The results reveal that priorities will shift from EV adoption and roll-out of infrastructure to managing peak demand, using more sustainable charging techniques (such as V2G), and using sustainable energy towards 2030. Technological advancements and autonomous charging techniques will become more relevant in a later time period, around 2040. Environmental indicators (e.g., local emissions) were consistently valued low, whereas mobility indicators were valued differently across participants, indicating a lack of consensus. Smart charging was consistently valued higher than other charging techniques, independent of time period. The results also revealed that there are some distinct differences between the priorities of policymakers and service providers. Having a systematic overview of what aspects matter supports the policy discussion around EVs in the built environment.

AB Cellular Vehicle-to-everything (V2X) is evolving from a communication technology for safety messages towards a platform for advanced V2X services such as platooning and autonomous driving. The development of technical specifications for V2X communications is done across several task specification groups (TSGs) and working groups (WGs) within 3rd Generation Partnership Project (3GPP). In this paper, we focus on radio access network (RAN) aspects for direct communication between user equipments (UEs), which is known as sidelink (SL) communication. Resource allocation for SL communication can be performed in one of two modes. In the first mode, resource allocation is centralized in the network. In the second mode, resource allocation is performed in a distributed manner among UEs, where resource selection is performed at a transmitting UE, i.e., the transmitting UE determines time and frequency resources for a SL transmission without the assistance of a base station. In this paper, we review V2X evolution from 4G to 5G in 3GPP focusing on resource allocation aspects defined in Long-Term Evolution (LTE) and New Radio (NR) specifications, with particular attention given to the difference in design and performance of each. We highlight the key 3GPP standard developments on V2X resource allocation which includes enhanced resource reselection mechanisms and partial sensing schemes. It is observed that NR V2X resource reselection mechanism can provide up to 20% of reliability improvement over LTE V2X and NR V2X partial sensing scheme can provide up to 95% of reduced power consumption over full sensing scheme.

AB Drivers of conditionally automated vehicles may occasionally be required to take control of their vehicle due to system boundaries, but their performance in such cases might be impaired if they were engaged in non-driving tasks. In this study, we conducted an experiment in a driving simulator, where the non-driving task involved playing a video game. We tested whether, after a take-over request (TOR), driver behaviour can be predicted from measures of game engagement. A sample of 28 participants drove in two counterbalanced conditions-manual driving and automated driving-and needed to change lanes at a certain time in their trip following auditory and visual requests. In the automated condition, drivers could play an endless runner game and were instructed to deactivate the automated mode to change lanes when they received a TOR. We used the proportion of glance durations on the game and the time between game sessions as indicators of game engagement. Findings showed that drivers were highly engaged in the video game during the automated driving session (more than 70% of the time) and that the inspection of driving-related areas of interests was significantly altered by this engagement. Moreover, the two indicators of game engagement predicted drivers' response times to the TOR. Our findings suggest that indices of game engagement might assist in setting better timing for TORs and therefore, that it might be beneficial to synchronize measures of game engagement consoles with automated vehicle decision algorithms.

AB This paper addresses the development of a stereo vision-based obstacle avoidance system using MOOS-IvP for small and medium-sized Unmanned Surface Vehicles (USVs). Existing methods predominantly rely on optical sensors such as LiDAR and cameras to discern maritime obstacles within the short- to mid-range distances. Nonetheless, conventional cameras encounter challenges in water conditions that curtail their effectiveness in localizing obstacles and planning paths. Furthermore, LiDAR has limitations regarding angular resolution and identifying objectness due to data sparsity. To overcome these limitations, our proposed system leverages a stereo camera equipped with enhanced angular resolution to augment situational awareness. The system employs recursive estimation techniques to ascertain the position and dimensions of proximate obstacles, transmitting this information to the onboard control unit, where MOOS-IvP behaviour-based software produces navigation decisions. Through the real-time fusion of data obtained from the stereo vision system and navigational data, the system is able to achieve Enhance Situational Awareness (ESA) and facilitate well-informed navigation decisions. Developing a state-of-the-art maritime object detection technique, the system adeptly identifies obstacles and swiftly responds via a vision integration protocol. During field tests, our system proves the efficacy of the proposed ESA approach. This paper also presents a comprehensive analysis and discussion of the results derived from deploying the proposed system on the Suraya Surveyor USV platform across numerous scenarios featuring diverse obstacles. The results from these various scenarios demonstrate the system's accurate obstacle detection capabilities under challenging conditions and highlight its significant potential for safe USV operations.

AB With the growing popularity of the Internet-of-Vehicles (IoV), it is of pressing necessity to understand transportation traffic patterns and their impact on wireless network designs and operations. Vehicular mobility patterns and traffic models are the keys to assisting a wide range of analyses and simulations in these applications. This study surveys the status quo of vehicular mobility models, with a focus on recent advances in the last decade. To provide a comprehensive and systematic review, the study first puts forth a requirement-model-application framework in the IoV or general communication and transportation networks. Existing vehicular mobility models are categorized into vehicular distribution, vehicular traffic, and driving behavior models. Such categorization has a particular emphasis on the random patterns of vehicles in space, traffic flow models aligned to road maps, and individuals' driving behaviors (e.g., lane-changing and car-following). The different categories of the models are applied to various application scenarios, including underlying network connectivity analysis, off-line network optimization, online network functionality, and real-time autonomous driving. Finally, several important research opportunities arise and deserve continuing research efforts, such as holistic designs of deep learning platforms which take the model parameters of vehicular mobility as input features, qualification of vehicular mobility models in terms of representativeness and completeness, and new hybrid models incorporating different categories of vehicular mobility models to improve the representativeness and completeness.

AB The recent deployment of highly automated vehicles (AVs) in various cities highlights the potential improvement of transportation safety but also reveals the need for improved interaction between AVs and other road users, particularly vulnerable road users (VRUs). The reduction of driver involvement in this AV-VRU interaction results in the absence of human-to-human communication cues and thus calls for new system designs. Researchers have proposed designing external human-machine interfaces (e-HMIs) to replace these communication cues and improve the AV-VRU interaction. However, designing e-HMIs is complex and requires consideration of various factors, such as stakeholder responsibilities, context of use, user needs, implementation, design principles, and usability testing. This paper examines potential e-HMI design solutions from the perspective of experts to determine user needs and identify challenges. An online survey was conducted with 47 experts in the AV and VRU field to gather their opinions on anticipated issues in AV-VRU interaction, preferred e-HMI design options, and related concerns. Both quantitative and qualitative analyses of the data revealed that experts view "Awareness" and "Intent" as the most important information to be communicated through visual e-HMIs placed on AVs. Open-ended questions also showed that there were fewer experts concerned about "Awareness" and "Intent" compared with other information types, and more experts concerned about auditory cues compared with visual cues and about VRU wearable or handheld devices installation locations compared with other locations. These findings provide insights into the efficiency, feasibility, effectiveness, and challenges in developing e-HMIs for improved and safer communication between AVs and VRUs.

AB ObjectiveSurrogate safety measures (SSMs) are developed and applied as alternatives or complements of safety analyses mainly due to important road crash data availability and reliability limitations. Automated vehicles (AVs) have recently emerged as a prominent solution to mitigate transport externalities and increase road traffic safety. Due to the novelty of the technology and the lack of real-world data, traffic simulation combined with SSMs is the most common approach to quantify their impact. This study aims to provide an overview of the state of the practice and, more specifically, examine the applicability of applied SSMs on higher levels of AVs (HAVs).MethodsThe methodological approach consists of a comprehensive literature search, which aims to provide an overview of the applied SSMs, followed by a critical assessment of the findings.ResultsIn total, 17 studies and 11 different SSMs were identified and reviewed. Findings suggest that available SSMs are suitable measures to appropriately estimate the relative safety performance of HAVs and indicate their potential implications due to their expected rule-based driving behavior. However, in some cases, it was noticed that they could not efficiently capture the technological capabilities of HAVs, e.g., shorter headways and faster reaction times, which may lead to false alarms.ConclusionsDespite the available evidence, there are still significant gaps and certain limitations, as no comparisons between different measures exist, or the validity of the applied measures could not be assessed based on historical road crash data. This work aims to help researchers and practitioners choose the most appropriate SSMs to evaluate HAVs' safety performance. Finally, several research gaps are identified, and recommendations for potential future research directions are presented.

AB Recently, unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) swarm communication has drawn much attention in search and rescue (SAR) missions owing to its wide wireless coverage and increasing autonomy in navigation. In this article, we consider maximizing the downlink wireless coverage of a UAV swarm in an unknown mission area by controlling the quasistationary deployments of UAVs. Particularly, the stochastic wireless link failures caused by channel fading and noise in UAV-to-UAV communication links are considered in coverage control. Specifically, due to delay sensitivity and onboard energy limitation of UAV-enabled SAR networks, we study a distributed control strategy where swarm UAVs can address the coverage problem by exchanging only the local information. In this case, the wireless coverage problem is divided into several distributed optimization subproblems. However, due to the integer variable and nonlinear constraints, each subproblem is nonconvex and mutually coupling, which makes it difficult to solve via standard convex optimization solvers. Thus, we model the UAV swarm network as an undirected random graph and then solve the optimization subproblems by formulating a UAV swarm wireless coverage game. As per the designed utility function and potential function of the formulated game, existence of the pure Nash equilibrium is discussed and a distributed algorithm is developed to achieve the best Nash equilibrium. We analyze the convergence property and computational complexity of the proposed algorithm. Meanwhile, we analyze effects of the initial learning rate and step size on algorithm performance from both theoretical and simulation results. Simulation results show that the proposed algorithm improves the coverage by around 58% when compared with initial performance.

AB Emerging virtual reality (VR) applications require high data rate transmission and low end-to-end latency, which has become one of the main challenges for future wireless networks. Unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) mounted base stations and computing facilities can be used to provide better wireless connectivity and computing services to edge VR users to meet their computing needs and reduce the end-to-end latency. We propose a novel UAV assisted mobile edge computing (MEC) network to enable high-quality mobile 360-degree video VR applications by leveraging UAVs to provide the required communication and computing needs. Then, we formulate the joint UAV placement, MEC and radio resource allocation, and 360-degree video content layer assignment (UAV-MV) problem, which aims to select the allocation of computing and communications resources and the location of the UAVs such that the delivered quality of experience (QoE) is maximized across the mobile VR users, given various system constraints. We show that the problem is NP-hard, and decompose it into three lower-complexity subproblems that we solve sequentially. We design an approximation algorithm with performance guarantees that solves the UAV-MV problem based on the solutions to the three subproblems. Our simulation results show that the average QoE enabled by the proposed algorithm is 15% and 90% greater relative to two competitive reference methods.

AB Self-driving systems execute an ensemble of different self-driving workloads on embedded systems in an endto-end manner, subject to functional and performance requirements. To enable exploration, optimization, and end-to-end evaluation on different embedded platforms, system designers critically need a benchmark suite that enables flexible and seamless configuration of self-driving scenarios, which realistically reflects realworld self-driving workloads' unique characteristics. Existing CPU and GPU embedded benchmark suites typically (1) consider isolated applications, (2) are not sensor-driven, and (3) are unable to support emerging self-driving applications that simultaneously utilize CPUs and GPUs with stringent timing requirements. On the other hand, full-system self-driving simulators (e.g., AUTOWARE, APOLLO) focus on functional simulation, but lack the ability to evaluate the self-driving software stack on various embedded platforms. To address design needs, we present Chauffeur, the first open-source end-to-end benchmark suite for self-driving vehicles with configurable representative workloads. Chauffeur is easy to configure and run, enabling researchers to evaluate different platform configurations and explore alternative instantiations of the self-driving software pipeline. Chauffeur runs on diverse emerging platforms and exploits heterogeneous onboard resources. Our initial characterization of Chauffeur on different embedded platforms - NVIDIA Jetson TX2 and Drive PX2 - enables comparative evaluation of these GPU platforms in executing an end-to-end self-driving computational pipeline to assess the end-to-end response times on these emerging embedded platforms while also creating opportunities to create application gangs for better response times. Chauffeur enables researchers to benchmark representative self-driving workloads and flexibly compose them for different self-driving scenarios to explore end-to-end tradeoffs between design constraints, power budget, real-time performance requirements, and accuracy of applications.

AB Efficient vehicle-to-everything (V2X) communications improve traffic safety, enable autonomous driving, and help to reduce environmental impacts. To achieve these objectives, accurate channel estimation in highly mobile scenarios becomes necessary. However, in the V2X millimeter-wave massive MIMO system, the high mobility of vehicles leads to the rapid time-varying of the wireless channel and results in the existing static channel estimation algorithms no longer applicable. In this paper, we propose a sparse Bayes tensor and DOA tracking inspired channel estimation for V2X millimeter wave massive MIMO system. Specifically, by exploiting the sparse scattering characteristics of the channel, we transform the channel estimation into a sparse recovery problem. In order to reduce the influence of quantization errors, both the receiving and transmitting angle grids should have super-resolution. We obtain the measurement matrix to increase the resolution of the redundant dictionary. Furthermore, we take the low-rank characteristics of the received signals into consideration rather than singly using the traditional sparse prior. Motivated by the sparse Bayes tensor, a direction of arrival (DOA) tracking method is developed to acquire the DOA at the next moment, which equals the sum of the DOA at the previous moment and the offset. The obtained DOA is expected to provide a significant angle information update for tracking fast time-varying vehicular channels. The proposed approach is evaluated over the different speeds of the vehicle scenarios and compared to the other methods. Simulation results validated the theoretical analysis and demonstrate that the proposed solution outperforms a number of state-of-the-art researches.

AB Autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) are subjected to a very large impact load during the water-entry process, which may damage the structure of the vehicle and affect its motion trajectory. In this paper, five kinds of models with different nose shapes are tested under different water-entry velocities and angles, and the impact acceleration signals are obtained by a sensor. First, the accuracy of the experimental data is verified by comparison with the velocity obtained by the high-speed camera. Then, the ensemble empirical mode decomposition (EEMD) method combined with modal analysis is used to analyse the acceleration signal composition. Subsequently, a numerical simulation model based on the arbitrary Lagrangian Eulerian (ALE) method to describe the water-entering process of the vehicle is established, and the accuracy and capability of the numerical algorithm is verified by comparison with the experimental data. Finally, the frequency-domain characteristics of the impact load are analysed through the shock response spectrum (SRS) method. The result shows that the maximum acceleration shock spectrum of the impact load is related to the peak pulse width of the impact load and independent of the peak value. The smaller the pulse width is, the larger the inflection point frequency and magnification of the shock response spectrum are. The inflection point frequency of the shock response spectrum usually corresponds to the second-order bending natural frequency of the vehicle. The conclusions in this paper will be useful for the design and analysis of the water-entry impact structure of AUVs.

AB Fully Automated Vehicles (AVs) have been widely expected to revolutionise the future travel experience. Recent studies have shown that their impact may also reach beyond the travel episode, and lead their users to alter other activities performed during the day - their daily lifestyles. This study is among the first to empirically investigate the changes that travellers expect in their daily activities with AVs. To this aim, we created an interactive stated activitytravel survey, in which respondents designed their current daily schedule and, following that, redesigned it while imagining that their most frequently used travel mode is replaced with an AV. We administered the survey to 509 commuters in the Netherlands and analysed (changes in) onboard and stationary activity patterns using the multiple discrete-continuous extreme value (MDCEV) model. Results show a clear increase in the prevalence of various on-board activities in the AV compared to current modes, and even stronger increase for the high income and higher educated groups. Changes in stationary activities are less pronounced: no changes in the aggregate, but some changes within particular socio-demographic groups. Specific changes in stationary activities were associated with specific changes in on-board activities for the higher educated respondents: switching to AVs, they were more likely than others to add on-board work, meals, and leisure to their trips and more likely to add a getting ready activity to their stationary schedules. This study contributes to the growing body of literature that recognises and models onboard activities as an integral part of daily schedules.

AB Underwater vehicles (UVs) are subjected to various environmental disturbances due to ocean currents, propulsion systems, and un-modeled disturbances. In practice, it is very challenging to design a control system to maintain UVs stayed at the desired static position permanently under these conditions. Therefore, in this study, a nonlinear dynamics and robust positioning control of the over-actuated autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) under the effects of ocean current and model uncertainties are presented. First, a motion equation of the over-actuated AUV under the effects of ocean current disturbances is established, and a trajectory generation of the over-actuated AUV heading angle is constructed based on the line of sight (LOS) algorithm. Second, a dynamic positioning (DP) control system based on motion control and an allocation control is proposed. For this, motion control of the over-actuated AUV based on the dynamic sliding mode control (DSMC) theory is adopted to improve the system robustness under the effects of the ocean current and model uncertainties. In addition, the stability of the system is proved based on Lyapunov criteria. Then, using the generalized forces generated from the motion control module, two different methods for optimal allocation control module: the least square (LS) method and quadratic programming (QP) method are developed to distribute a proper thrust to each thruster of the over-actuated AUV. Simulation studies are conducted to examine the effectiveness and robustness of the proposed DP controller. The results show that the proposed DP controller using the QP algorithm provides higher stability with smaller steady-state error and stronger robustness.

AB Traffic simulation models are frequently used to evaluate the safety of signalized intersections, especially when testing unconventional designs or investigating the effects of emerging technologies such as connected and autonomous vehicles. In this approach, vehicle trajectories extracted from traffic simulation are usually analyzed using the surrogate safety assessment model (SSAM) to estimate the number and severity of traffic conflicts. However, recent research has shown that evaluating safety using SSAM has several limitations. First, a rigorous calibration procedure must be applied to the simulation model to obtain reliable conflict results. Second, simulation models in many cases do not accurately represent actual driving behavior. Subsequently, they often fail to capture the actual mechanisms generating near-misses. This paper presents a new procedure, alternative to SSAM, for evaluating the safety of signalized intersections. The procedure combines simulated vehicle trajectories with real-time safety models to predict rear-end conflicts. The conflict prediction is based on dynamic traffic parameters, such as traffic volume and shock wave characteristics, repeatedly measured over a short time interval (a few seconds). To validate the proposed procedure, its performance was investigated in predicting traffic conflicts extracted from 54 hours of real-world video data at two signalized intersections in the city of Surrey, British Columbia. The predicted conflict results were compared with SSAM. Overall, the results showed that the proposed procedure outperforms SSAM in relation to accuracy of conflict prediction. Lastly, a case study of using the proposed procedure in evaluating the safety impact of a recently developed connected-vehicles application is presented.

ID ALLOCATION
AB Studying the task assignment problem of multiple underwater robots has a broad effect on the field of underwater exploration and can be helpful in military, fishery, and energy. However, to the best of our knowledge, few studies have focused on multi-constrained underwater detection task assignment for heterogeneous autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) clusters with autonomous decision-making capabilities, and the current popular heuristic methods have difficulty obtaining optimal cluster unit task assignment results. In this paper, a fast graph pointer network (FGPN) method, which is a hybrid of graph pointer network (GPN) and genetic algorithm, is proposed to solve the task assignment problem of detection/communication AUV clusters, and to improve the assignment efficiency on the basis of ensuring the accuracy of task assignment. A two-stage detection algorithm is used. First, the task nodes are clustered and pre-grouped according to the communication distance. Then, according to the clustering results, a neural network model based on graph pointer network is used to solve the local task assignment results. A large-scale cluster cooperative task assignment problem and a detection/communication cooperative work mode are proposed, which transform the cooperative cooperation problem of heterogeneous AUV clusters into a Multiple Traveling salesman problem (MTSP) for solving. We also conducted a large number of experiments to verify the effectiveness of the algorithm. The experimental results show that the solution efficiency of the method proposed in this paper is better than the traditional heuristic method on the scale of 300/500/750/1,000/1,500/2,000 task nodes, and the solution quality is similar to the result of the heuristic method. We hope that our ideas and methods for solving the large-scale cooperative task assignment problem can be used as a reference for large-scale task assignment problems and other related problems in other fields.

AB An important issue in autonomous vehicle development is the transition phase between autonomous and manual driving. Here, we focused on a vibrotactile signal that warns the driver 1 min before they must take over. Our goal was to design a signal detectable by, and satisfactory for, all drivers. After listing parameters defining a vibrotactile signal, we performed a design-of-experiments study to select 16 signals for evaluation by 80 participants of different ages, body mass indexes, and genders. In a car on the road, autonomous driving conditions were simulated with the participant in the front passenger seat, who performed a task unrelated to driving. Whenever the participant detected a signal, they gave a satisfaction score. Modeling enabled us to evaluate the effects of the signal parameters and participant characteristics on satisfaction and detection. Moreover, we obtained specifications for the design of a tactile signal according to our two criteria.
   Practical applicationsTo the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to focus on the sensory aspect of a tactile signal in a car environment. Both functional (i.e., signal detection) and hedonic aspects are important. We investigated the influence of gender, age, and body mass index of the participants on signal detection and satisfaction score, and optimized the satisfaction score under detection constraints. We use a 3-point method to reach those two goals: 1 Constructing the design-of-experiments (DoE) based on signal parameters that influence the two criteria and can be tuned.
   2 Sensory evaluation of the signals from the DoE.
   3 Modeling to evaluate the influence of each parameter and determine optimal values.
   Understanding the influence of the participant's characteristics, coupled with an optimization approach, will benefit the design of automated cars as well as other tactile interfaces, such as smartphones, connected wristbands, or touchscreens.

AB This paper introduces an adaptive interactive multi-model algorithm for the navigation system of the unmanned underwater vehicle (UUV). The underwater environment is diverse and time-varying. Obtaining high-precision navigation is very important for the safety and effectiveness of autonomous navigation of unmanned underwater vehicles, which makes the reliability of UUV navigation-related sensors particularly demanding. When the un-derwater environment has absorbing substances or a deep-sea environment, the Doppler velocity log (DVL) will produce outliers or even fail. When the vehicle navigates to a flat terrain area and terrain aided navigation (TAN) performs navigation parameter matching, multiple adaptation positions will appear, resulting in abnormal measurement data. Similarly, when UUV sails to a strong magnetic area, magnetic compass (MCP) will be disturbed, etc. To improve the robustness of navigation and reduce the influence of the change of system model and measurement noise model caused by environmental factors, an adaptive interactive multi-model algorithm is proposed, which is carried out with the UUV based INS/DVL/MCP/TAN integrated navigation system. For the problem that the measurement noise of the system changes, different models are organized into a collection, and according to different situations, the corresponding model or hybrid model is selected in the collection of models to describe the measurement noise, so as to realize the seamless switching of the system model. The simulation results show that the adaptive multi-model algorithm can effectively control the impact of system noise model uncertainty on navigation accuracy, so that UUV has higher accuracy and less computation than single navi-gation and traditional algorithms, and has robustness and scalability.

AB Interactions with other road users influence the perceived safety and comfort of pedestrians. Yet the relationships among perceptions of yielding, safety, and comfort are poorly understood. To enhance understanding of these key concepts, the objectives of this study are to determine how perception of pedestrian safety at unsignalized crosswalks differs from perception of comfort, and the relationship of each with perception of yielding. A generalized structural equations model is developed using data from an online survey in which 366 participants (i.e., "perceivers") rated yielding, safety, and comfort for sample videos of pedestrian interactions with motor vehicles and bicycles. Results show that an individual's perception of yielding plays a crucial role in mediating the effects of interaction attributes (e.g., vehicle speed, proximity) and perceiver attributes (e.g., travel habits) on their perceptions of pedestrian safety and comfort. For example, people who bicycle more frequently perceive pedestrians as more comfortable than people who walk more frequently, rooted in misalignment on what constitutes adequate yielding. Strategies to address pedestrian comfort can focus on a set of key yielding behaviors by drivers and cyclists - partic-ularly allowing the pedestrian to cross first. Motor vehicle drivers must exhibit stronger yielding behavior (e.g., allow a larger time gap) than bicycles to achieve the same level of perceived pedestrian safety and comfort. Although perceptions of safety and comfort are strongly related and similarly impacted by yielding, researchers should be cautious about using the concepts interchangeably because they are differently impacted by attributes of the interaction and perceiver.

AB Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) equipped with different sensors can provide data with high spatiotemporal resolution and have broad application prospects. During the flight of the UAV, changes in illumination, exposure time, etc., will cause different degrees of radiometric differences between images, resulting in a calibration relationship established on a single image that cannot be applied to other images; in addition, the vignetting effect also significantly changes the brightness distribution inside an image, thus posing challenges for radiometric calibration of UAV images. In this article, based on block adjustment (BA), we proposed a radiometric BA model under the consideration of vignetting and the light-dark differences between images. The proposed method requires only a small number of calibration blankets, thus reducing the complexity of the experiment. The results from two study areas showed that the proposed method could compensate for vignetting to a certain extent and the radiometric consistency of the two datasets was improved from 12.9%-21.8% to 4.7%-12.7%. Validated using ground samples, the mean root mean square error (RMSE) and mean relative percent error (MRPE) of all five bands were 0.054, 21.8%, and 0.037, 20.4% in the two study areas, respectively. The total uncertainty was less than 8.1%. When there were obvious light-dark differences between images, such as in the visible light bands, our method could significantly improve the accuracy of the radiometric calibration.

AB To extend the transmission range governed by limited transmit power, collaborative beamforming (CB) can be employed with a virtual antenna array (VAA) constructed by an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) swarm. CB techniques combined with physical layer security (PLS) algorithms are known to better secure transmissions of sensitive information in the presence of eavesdropping attacks, compared to co-located antenna-based schemes. In particular, analog collaborative beamforming (ACB) with random VAA topologies, which is suitable for UAV networks due to its lower signaling/channel estimation overhead compared to the digital CB, can provide a significantly higher secrecy rate by creating noise-like signals at eavesdroppers. However, the increase in energy consumption to improve secrecy rate had been ignored in the existing ACB-based PLS schemes, which is of paramount importance considering the limited onboard energy of UAVs. Thus, motivated by such limitation, in this paper, we examine the security energy efficiency of the ACB-based PLS technique, where a group of UAVs (or VAA elements) randomly change their locations in a distributed manner to randomize the array factor of the VAA, i.e., a stochastic VAA. The proposed stochastic VAA outperforms the existing static VAA in terms of secrecy energy efficiency as verified by analytic and numerical results. Further, the impact of phase errors of the proposed scheme is also presented, which indicates the significance of the accurate phase estimation.

AB Driver Assistance Systems (DAS) have been progressively incorporated into commercial vehicles in recent years. All these systems are paving the way for the forthcoming autonomous vehicle which will become a reality in the near future. Existing systems are based on numerous electronic systems with advanced skills, high performances, and high degrees of adaptability and intelligence. As is to be expected, these cutting-edge features require, in most cases, the use of powerful computing platforms. However, the deployment of such platforms is not an easy task, since they have to be integrated in the vehicle where there exist important restrictions regarding size, power consumption and cost. In this sense, every smart proposal aimed at reducing the complexity of these systems without degrading performance, is always a valuable contribution in the field. In this work, we propose a methodology to reduce the dimensionality of a driver distraction recognition system. The methodology is based on a multi-objective genetic algorithm that looks for the minimum set of useful features collected during the driving task and also for the simplest recognition system. The recognition algorithm is an Extreme Learning Machine (ELM) whose simplicity and fast learning procedure make it especially suitable to be used by a Genetic Algorithm which needs to evaluate thousands of candidate solutions. The proposed methodology has been tested with a real-world database collected from different drivers performing an itinerary with an instrumented car. The results obtained validate the proposal as a method to reduce the complexity of a driver distraction recognition system.

AB A necessary condition for the effective integration of automated vehicles in our daily lives is their acceptance by passengers inside and pedestrians and cyclists outside the automated vehicle. 119 respondents experienced an automated shuttle ride with a 'hidden steward on board' in a mixed traffic environment in Berlin-Schoneberg. A mixed-method approach was applied gathering qualitative interview data during the ride and quantitative questionnaire data after the ride. Responses were classified into three main categories: (1) Perceived safety, (2) interactions with automated shuttles in crossing situations, and (3) communication with automated shuttles. Respondents associated their perceptions of safety with the low speed, dynamic object and event identification, longitudinal and lateral control, pressing the emergency button inside the shuttle, their general trust in technology, sharing the shuttle with fellow travellers, the operation of the shuttle in a controlled environment, and the behaviour of other road users outside the shuttle. Respondents pressed the emergency button inside the automated shuttle on 28 out of 62 test rides in order to test its behavior. They further expected to be more cautious in crossing the road before an automated shuttle due to the lack of eye contact with the human driver and a lack of trust in the behavior of the automated shuttle, and expected road users testing the automated shuttle due to the conservative driving behavior of automated shuttles. We recommend future research into the hypothesis that the acceptance of automated shuttles will be associated with the perceived safety of and their effective and intuitive interaction and communication with both passengers and other road users.

AB This study presents a distributed fault-tolerant cooperative control (FTCC) strategy to achieve the attitude synchronisation tracking control of networked unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) in the presence of actuator faults and model uncertainties. By utilising the fuzzy neural networks (FNNs), the unknown non-linear terms induced by actuator faults and model uncertainties are estimated as lumped uncertainties. A set of distributed sliding-mode estimators (DSMEs) is then employed to estimate the leader UAV's attitudes for the follower UAVs via a distributed communication network. Based on the estimated knowledge from FNNs and DSMEs, a group of distributed FTCC laws is developed for all follower UAVs by using the fractional-order calculus. It is proven that with the proposed control scheme, all follower UAVs can track the attitudes of the leader UAV and the tracking errors are uniformly ultimately bounded even when a portion of networked UAVs encounters multiple actuator faults. Comparative simulation results are presented to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach.

AB As one technique for autonomous driving, vehicular networks can achieve high efficiency with vehicle-andinfrastructure cooperation, bringing high safety and many valueadded services. To achieve higher communication efficiency, much effort has been done to cope with the resource allocation issues for vehicular networks. Nevertheless, due to the strong nonconvexity and nonlinearity, the classical joint resource allocation problem in vehicular networks is typically NP-hard. The multiagent reinforcement learning (MARL) has emerged as a promising solution to tackle this challenge but its stability and scalability are not satisfactory when the amount of vehicles gets increased. In this article, we mainly investigate the issue of joint spectrum and power allocation in vehicular communication networks, and carefully consider the interactions between the vehicles and environment by incorporating the cooperative stochastic game theory with MARL, named complete-game MARL (CG-MARL), to achieve a better convergence and stability with the theoretical computational complexity O(n(N)) with ndenoting the dimension of action space and N denoting the number of V2X Vehicular. Furthermore, the mean-field game (MFG) theory is employed to further enhance the MARL for decreasing the horrible computing resource consumption caused by the CGMARL to O(n(2)) while maintaining an approximate performance. The simulation results demonstrate that the proposed meanfield-aided MARL (MF-MARL) for vehicular network resource allocation can achieve 95% near-optimal performance with much lower complexity, which indicates its significant potentials in the scenarios with massive and dense vehicles.

AB Compared with the traditional environment, a connected environment in which multiple types of intelligent vehicles share roads will be more complicated. However, do changes in the traffic environment affect the driver's distraction level and distraction recognition? Relatively few studies have addressed these questions. This study constructs traditional and connected environments and conducts driving simulation experiments. Distracted driving data for 60 drivers were collected in each environment, and the one-way repeated analysis of variance (ANOVA) method was used to select the distraction indices with significant differences as the input indices. An independent t-test was applied to analyse changes in the distraction indices in the two environments. The results show that the distraction indices, including the standard deviation (SD) of the horizontal fixation angles, blink frequency, mean pupil diameter, mean saccade speed, SD of the steering wheel angle, mean speed and SD of the lane acceleration, differ in the two environments; therefore, the distraction recognition model in the traditional environment is no longer suitable for connected environments. A distraction state recognition model developed with a stacking-based ensemble learning algorithm composed of a support vector machine (SVM), extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost), long short-term memory (LSTM), and bi-directional LSTM with an attention mechanism (AT-Bi-LSTM) was proposed for each environment. The recognition accuracy reaches 95.71% in the traditional environment, and the accuracy rate reaches 97.92% in the connected environment. Compared with traditional algorithms, the proposed approach yields greater recognition accuracy and can be applied in intelligent vehicle distraction early warning assistance systems to improve road safety.

AB With the rapid development of intelligent transportation system, the research on vehicle stability can be a theoretical basis for realizing autonomous driving technology. The previous stability control strategies have not taken into account the tire force saturation factor, the slip rate, and the robustness of the control system sufficiency. According to the characteristic that the torque of each wheel can be distributed independently, a torque distribution algorithm under emergency conditions is proposed. The proposed torque distribution algorithm is constructed using three hierarchical controllers. The upper controller attempts to judge whether the vehicle is in stable state using the phase plane method. Also, it judges whether the wheels are slipping. The middle controller aims to calculate the demands for the desired traction force and yaw moment, whereas the lower controller is designed to translate those virtual signals into actual actuator commands. When designing the middle controller, a sliding mode control method is utilized to guarantee system stability and robustness by taking into account various factors, including lateral wind, and sensor noise. For the lower controller, the control allocation optimization method is utilized to determine an appropriate control input for each in-wheel motor by considering the road conditions, adhesion utilization, and maximum output torque of the motor. The numerical simulation studies are conducted to evaluate the performance of the torque distribution algorithm. Comparison results indicate that the proposed algorithm presents better performance to distribute the appropriate torque for each wheel and ensure the stability of the vehicle under emergency conditions.

AB Fish are remarkable in their ability to maneuver and to control their body position. This ability is the result of the coordinated movement of fins which extend from the body and form control surfaces that can create and vector forces in 3-D. We have embarked on a research program designed to develop a maneuvering propulsor for unmanned undersea vehicles (UUVs) that is based on the pectoral fin of the bluegill sunfish. For this, the anatomy, kinematics, and hydrodynamics of the sunfish pectoral fin were investigated experimentally and through the use of computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulations. These studies identified that the kinematics of the sunfish pectoral fin are very complex and are not easily described by traditional "rowing"and "flapping"-type kinematics. A consequence of the complex motion is that the pectoral fin can produce forward thrust during both its outstroke (abduction) and instroke (adduction), and while doing so generates only small lateral and lift forces. The results of the biological studies were used to guide the design of robotic pectoral fins which were built as experimental devices and used to investigate the mechanisms of thrust production and control. Because of a design that was based heavily on the anatomy of the sunfish fin, the robotic pectoral fins had the level of control and degrees of freedom necessary to reproduce many of the complex fin motions used by the sunfish during steady swimming. These robotic fins are excellent experimental tools, and are an important first step towards developing propulsive devices that will give the next generation of UUVs the ability to produce and control thrust like highly maneuverable fish..

A large number of sensors are placed in the ocean to establish ocean sensor networks to obtain more information about the marine environment, crustal dynamic changes and so on. With the development of science and technology, Autonomous Underwater Vehicles (AUV) appear and are widely used in marine sensor networks. Due to the complex and changeable ocean environment, the slow speed of traditional and the lack of reasonable path planning and other reasons, AUV waste a lot of time and energy, which cannot efficiently collect information. In this paper, the Unmanned Aerial Underwater Vehicle (UAUV) is introduced into the ocean sensor network. Establish a two-dimensional scene model, find the best water entry point for UAUV to complete the task in the shortest time and minimum power consumption by traversing the search algorithm, and compare the performance of UAUV cross domain mode and underwater mode to collect marine sensor data. Meanwhile, establishing three-dimensional ocean sensor scene model, and using DDQN algorithm to solve the path planning problem of UAUV. The results show that the cross-domain mode of UAUV in the two-dimensional scene model saves 74.7% times and 24.34% energy compared with the traditional underwater mode. In the three-dimensional scene model, the UAUV is trained to the optimal path by the DDQN algorithm, which saves 60.94% of the time and 20.26% of the energy compared to the traditional underwater mode. The results prove the feasibility, stability and efficiency of UAUV introduction into marine sensor network, the effectiveness of DDQN algorithm to solve UAUV path planning problems.

AB Due to their strong risk tolerance, low manufacturing cost, and good maneuverability, unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) have been widely used in various fields. Among related challenges, coordinated task assignment is a key scientific issue for autonomous control of UAVs. In this article, based on the idea of fuzzy C-means clustering and the ant colony optimization algorithm, a cooperative multiple task reallocation problem with target precedence constraints for heterogeneous UAVs is proposed. The contributions of this research are the performance evaluation of the original algorithms in a dynamic context, consideration of changes in some attributes of the environment, and the extension of these algorithms to properly address more realistic dynamic emergent adjustment scenarios. According to the corresponding task reallocation strategy, the scenarios are divided into three categories: the complete redistribution strategy can effectively cope with scenarios where tasks have changed significantly, the partial adjustment strategy can induce partial responses to the changes of individual tasks, and group redistribution can effectively solve the problem of task target threat rating changes. The simulation results show that the dynamic reallocation model of multi-UAV tasks in dynamic emergent adjustment scenarios can achieve better performance to complete the corresponding tasks based on the proposed scheme. In addition, we deployed the developed graphical modeling and analysis software platform to implement the dynamic reallocation model of multi-UAV tasks in dynamic emergent scenarios, and the validity and reliability of the proposed task reallocation model were verified.

AB In this article, an effective energy-efficiency optimization problem is investigated in the cognitive unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) communication system, where the moving following UAV (FUAV) transmits collected data to the leading UAV (LUAV) by reusing the spectrum of the ground primary user. For this scenario, a novel joint UAV trajectory and resource allocation optimization algorithm is proposed. We aim to maximize the energy efficiency of the cognitive UAV communication systems under interference, shortest step size, collision prevention, and speed constraints. However, this optimization problem is difficult to be solved, as it is nonconvex and involves strong relations among many variables. To address this issue, we first decompose the original optimization problem into four subproblems: 1) spectrum sensing duration subproblem; 2) spectrum sensing threshold subproblem; 3) transmitted power subproblem; and 4) FUAV trajectory optimization subproblem. For spectrum sensing duration subproblem and spectrum sensing threshold subproblem, their optimal solutions can be efficiently solved via a golden section search method. For the transmitted power subproblem, the closed-form expression of the optimal transmitted power is deduced. For the nonconvex FUAV trajectory optimization subproblem, we consider the shortest step size design under known starting and destination positions and then obtain an approximate solution of FUAV trajectory via the successive convex optimization (SCO) technique. Finally, an alternate iterative framework with fast convergence is designed to solve the original optimization problem. The simulation results show that the proposed algorithm has 18 times improvement in energy efficiency compared with the straight flight scheme with lower energy consumption.

AB There is currently a significant interest in the use of autonomous vehicles in many industrial sectors. One such example is the ever increasing use of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs), particularly in military operations. This enables dangerous missions to be accomplished without risk to a pilot. UAVs also have potential civil applications which would require their certification and the demonstration that they are able to respond safety to any potential circumstances. The aircraft would therefore need to be capable of responding safely to the occurrence of component failures, the emergence of threats such as other aircraft in the neighboring airspace, and changing weather conditions. The likelihood that an aircraft will successfully complete any mission can be predicted using phased mission analysis techniques. The predicted mission unreliability can be updated in response to changing circumstances. In the event that the likelihood of mission failure becomes too high then changes have to be made to the mission plan. If these calculations could be carried out fast enough then the quantification procedure could be used to establish an acceptable response to any new conditions. With a view to using the methodology in the context described above, this paper investigates ways in which phased mission analysis can be improved to reduce the calculation time. The methodology improves the processing capability for a UAV phased mission analysis by taking into account the specific characteristics of the fault tree structures which provide the causes of phase failure for a UAV mission. It also carries out as much of the quantification as possible in advance of the mission plan being formulated. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB A new type of thrusting technology, loosely inspired by the locomotion of cephalopods, offers promising low-speed maneuvering capabilities for a new generation of underwater vehicles and robots. The actuators consist of a small cavity with a moving wall on one side and an orifice on the other side. The net effect of periodic movement of the moving wall is the ingestion of low-momentum fluid inside the cavity and then the expulsion of the fluid as a pulsatile jet from the orifice, with no net mass flux. Continuous operation of the actuator results in a synthetic jet. The actuators provide a net positive momentum flux with zero net mass flux. They are compact with no extruding components to negatively impact the vehicle's drag at cruising speed. Parameters controlling the pulsatile jet and its thrust are identified. The thruster was empirically tested for a large range of frequencies and stroke ratios. The thrust characteristics of the device with respect to frequency was seen to converge to a single thrust coefficient. A model was developed to predict the thrust coefficient. The effect of the stroke ratios on the thrust coefficient is investigated. The model accurately predicts the observed thrust coefficient for stroke ratios up to five where the vortex ring pinchoff occurs. The accuracy of the model degrades for stroke ratios above the formation number where part of the expelled jet is pulled back into the cavity. Additionally, these devices have thrust tracking times faster than those reported for typical propellor-type thrusters, and deliver a fully quantized level of thrust.

AB Collecting broad ocean region data to leverage large-scale sensors is a valid method to handle ocean health problems associated with human activities (wind turbine deployment, nuclear wastewater discharge, etc.). When using the novel collection scheme, reducing the total energy consumption (TEC) of boat-assisted drones to collect sensor data is challenging. The objective of this study was to minimize the TEC of boats and drones (owing to their limited battery capacity) during marine environment sensor data collection. To achieve this, new models for drone hovering in wind, data collection, and related wireless communication have been developed, and the TEC minimization problem has been formulated as a new specialized distance-constrained capacitated vehicle routing problem. The problem is divided into four subproblems to reduce complexity. Based on these four subproblems, an improved heuristic algorithm was proposed. In the algorithm, the drone hovering position and boat waypoint are determined using the K-means clustering algorithm and the smallest enclosing circle algorithm. Based on the position and waypoint, the routes of drones and boats were optimized using the Lin-Kernighan heuristic 3 algorithm, thus minimizing the TEC. The simulation results demonstrate that when the boat waypoint is 3 and the sensor number is 2000, owing to the strong local and global search ability, the TEC in the scheme is 0.03x10(8)J less than that of the graph attention neural network method (GANN), while the scheme also provides time saving, scalability, and flexibility.

AB Multi unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) network is a promising solution to providing wireless coverage to ground users in challenging rural areas (such as Internet of Things (IoT) devices in farmlands), where the traditional cellular networks are sparse or unavailable. A key challenge in such networks is the 3-D placement of all UAV base stations (BSs) such that the formed multi-UAV network: 1) utilizes a minimum number of UAVs while ensuring-2) backhaul connectivity directly (or via other UAVs) to the nearby terrestrial BS; and 3) wireless coverage to all ground users in the area of operation. This joint backhaul-and-coverage-aware drone deployment (BoaRD) problem is largely unaddressed in the literature and, thus, is the focus of this article. We first formulate the BoaRD problem as integer linear programming (ILP). However, the problem is NP-hard and, therefore, we propose a low complexity algorithm with a provable performance guarantee to solve the problem efficiently. Our simulation study shows that the Proposed algorithm performs very close to that of the Optimal algorithm (solved using ILP solver) for smaller scenarios, where the area size and the number of users are relatively small. For larger scenarios, where the area size and the number of users are relatively large, the proposed algorithm greatly outperforms the baseline approaches-Backhaul-aware Greedy and random algorithm, respectively, by up to 17% and 95% in utilizing fewer UAVs while ensuring 100% ground-user coverage and backhaul connectivity for all deployed UAVs across all considered simulation setting.

AB Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) equipped with hyperspectral scanners and light detection and ranging (LiDAR) can flexibly acquire rich spectral and geometric information about the observation scene. To combine the complementary advantages of multisource data, the stereo registration of hyperspectral images and LiDAR data has become one of the hot topics in the remote sensing community. However, existing research works are more focused on exploiting intensity information from multisource data, which is applicable to data acquired on manned vehicle platforms or satellite platforms. For UAV platforms with poor stability and limited load, the low signal-to-noise ratio of LiDAR data and the complex distortion of push-broom images bring great challenges to stereo registration. Under this circumstance, an intensity-independent stereo registration method is proposed in this article, which is based on the physical model of the integrated system and the sensor detection principles. Specifically, the proposed method utilizes the position and orientation system (POS) to reduce the impact of UAV platform motion on hyperspectral imaging, and projection errors are eliminated by the ray tracing model with aid of LiDAR data. Finally, a virtual ray decomposition model based on geometric features is constructed to realize the stereo registration of hyperspectral images and LiDAR data. Compared with an advanced solution and professional processing software, the proposed method has shown better registration performance on two data of different scenarios.

AB The highly competitive and rapidly advancing autonomous vehicle race has been on for several years now, and it has made the driver-assistance systems a shadow of their former self. Nevertheless, automated vehicles have many obstacles on the way, and until we have them on the roads, promising solutions that can be achievable in the near future should be sought-after. Driving-support technologies have proven themselves to be effective in the battle against car crashes, and with Vehicular Ad hoc Networks (VANETs) supporting them, their efficiency is expected to rise steeply. In this work, we propose and implement a driving-support system which, on the one hand, could immensely benefit from major advancement of VANETs, but on the other hand can effectively be implemented as a stand-alone system. The proposed system consists of a non-intrusive integrated fuzzy-based system able to detect a risky situation in real time and alert the driver about the danger. It makes use of the information acquired from various in-car sensors as well as from communications with other vehicles and infrastructure to evaluate the condition of the considered parameters. The parameters include factors that affect the driver's ability to drive, such as his/her current health condition and the inside environment in which he/she is driving, the vehicle speed, and factors related to the outside environment such as the weather and road condition. We show the effect of these parameters on the determination of the driving risk level through simulations and experiments and explain how these risk levels are translated into actions that can help the driver to manage certain risky situations, thus improving the driving safety.

AB We explore how the hypothetical provision of Wi-Fi on transit affects the willingness of nontransit commuters (solo drivers, ridesharers, and cyclists) in Northern California (N = 1402) to switch from their current mode to public transit with internet access (PTWIA). Beyond the prima facie interpretation of our survey results, they shed light on the heterogeneously-perceived utility of hands-free travel more generally, and, as such, speak to an automated-vehicle future. We develop latent class binary choice models of the likelihood of switching to PTWIA, stratified by current commute mode. Each model identifies two latent classes, based largely on work-related attitudes: solo drivers divide into the work-oriented (22%) and pleasure-oriented (78%); ridesharers into the over-traveled monotaskers (77%) and multitasking commuters (23%); and cyclists into workoriented (28%) and non-work-oriented (72%). Thus, non-work-oriented commuters are a sizable majority of non-transit users, and also have a much lower weighted probability of switching to PTWIA (0.17, on average) compared to the work-oriented commuters (0.48). In sum, workfriendly hands-free travel can be an appealing alternative to those who are oriented toward working (and especially on the commute), but (1) not for all of them, and (2) such people only constitute about a quarter of the non-transit commuters (in Northern California). These results provide empirical insight into the extent to which the productive use of travel time made possible by automated vehicles will be exploited by future commuters.

AB The automotive industry has presented a variety of external human-machine interfaces (eHMIs) for automated vehicles (AVs). However, there appears to be no consensus on which types of eHMIs are clear to vulnerable road users. Here, we present the results of two large crowdsourcing surveys on this topic. In the first survey, we asked respondents about the clarity of 28 images, videos, and patent drawings of eHMI concepts presented by the automotive industry. Results showed that textual eHMIs were generally regarded as the clearest. Among the non-textual eHMIs, a projected zebra crossing was regarded as clear, whereas light-based eHMIs were seen as relatively unclear. A considerable proportion of the respondents mistook non-textual eHMIs for a sensor. In the second survey, we examined the effect of perspective of the textual message (egocentric from the pedestrian's point of view: 'Walk', 'Don't walk' vs. allocentric: 'Will stop', 'Won't stop') and color (green, red, white) on whether respondents felt safe to cross in front of the AV. The results showed that textual eHMIs were more persuasive than color-only eHMIs, which is in line with the results from the first survey. The eHMI that received the highest percentage of 'Yes' responses was the message Walk' in green font, which points towards an egocentric perspective taken by the pedestrian. We conclude that textual egocentric eHMIs are regarded as clearest, which poses a dilemma because textual instructions are associated with practical issues of liability, legibility, and technical feasibility.

AB This paper proposes a method for planning the three-dimensional path for low-flying unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) in complex terrain based on interfered fluid dynamical system (IFDS) and the theory of obstacle avoidance by the flowing stream. With no requirement of solutions to fluid equations under complex boundary conditions, the proposed method is suitable for situations with complex terrain and different shapes of obstacles. Firstly, by transforming the mountains, radar and anti-aircraft fire in complex terrain into cylindrical, conical, spherical, parallelepiped obstacles and their combinations, the 3D low-flying path planning problem is turned into solving streamlines for obstacle avoidance by fluid flow. Secondly, on the basis of a unified mathematical expression of typical obstacle shapes including sphere, cylinder, cone and parallelepiped, the modulation matrix for interfered fluid dynamical system is constructed and 3D streamlines around a single obstacle are obtained. Solutions to streamlines with multiple obstacles are then derived using weighted average of the velocity field. Thirdly, extra control force method and virtual obstacle method are proposed to deal with the stagnation point and the case of obstacles' overlapping respectively. Finally, taking path length and flight height as sub-goals, genetic algorithm (GA) is used to obtain optimal 3D path under the maneuverability constraints of the UAV. Simulation results show that the environmental modeling is simple and the path is smooth and suitable for UAV. Theoretical proof is also presented to show that the proposed method has no effect on the characteristics of fluid avoiding obstacles.

ID SAFETY VERIFICATION
AB In Machine Learning (ML)-enabled autonomous systems (MLASs), it is essential to identify the hazard boundary of ML Components (MLCs) in the MLAS under analysis. Given that such boundary captures the conditions in terms of MLC behavior and system context that can lead to hazards, it can then be used to, for example, build a safety monitor that can take any predefined fallback mechanisms at runtime when reaching the hazard boundary. However, determining such hazard boundary for an ML component is challenging. This is due to the problem space combining system contexts (i.e., scenarios) and MLC behaviors (i.e., inputs and outputs) being far too large for exhaustive exploration and even to handle using conventional metaheuristics, such as genetic algorithms. Additionally, the high computational cost of simulations required to determine any MLAS safety violations makes the problem even more challenging. Furthermore, it is unrealistic to consider a region in the problem space deterministically safe or unsafe due to the uncontrollable parameters in simulations and the non-linear behaviors of ML models (e.g., deep neural networks) in the MLAS under analysis. To address the challenges, we propose MLCSHE (ML Component Safety Hazard Envelope), a novel method based on a Cooperative Co-Evolutionary Algorithm (CCEA), which aims to tackle a high-dimensional problem by decomposing it into two lower-dimensional search subproblems. Moreover, we take a probabilistic view of safe and unsafe regions and define a novel fitness function to measure the distance from the probabilistic hazard boundary and thus drive the search effectively. We evaluate the effectiveness and efficiency of MLCSHE on a complex Autonomous Vehicle (AV) case study. Our evaluation results show that MLCSHE is significantly more effective and efficient compared to a standard genetic algorithm and random search.

AB Cooperative unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) swarms could expand the mission capability of the single UAV and the overall combat effectiveness. We consider the dynamic scenarios where an UAV swarm confronts multiple maneuvering high-value targets (HVTs) and multiple maneuvering attackers. In such hostile scenarios, each UAV of the UAV swarm would generally strive to survive through collaboratively offending their opponents and self-defense from potential attacks. We consider modeling UAV swarms as biologically inspired mobile adaptive networks to imitate the dynamic confrontations of UAV swarms. It is essential to develop an efficient motion control mechanism underpinned by both target tracking and decision making so as to enhance the capability of UAV swarms. We formulate a distributed modularized framework incorporating collaboratively tracking multiple opponents, making successive and prompt decisions, and controlling motion mechanism for mobile adaptive networks. We develop the diffusion multitask interactive Kalman filter to efficiently track multiple preys (HVTs) and multiple predators (attackers). We further develop the collaborative decision making on prey pursuit or predator evasion such that each UAV would acquire early warnings and predictions of the most hypothetically threatening predators to enhance the effectiveness of self-defense. Moreover, we develop a composite motion control mechanism, such that each UAV would be steered toward the prey or away from any approaching predator in a self-organized manner at a variable speed. The modular design of the proposed framework would promote the affordability and adaptability of UAV swarms. Illustrative simulation results validate the efficacy of the proposed distributed framework and the underlying algorithms.

AB With the advancement of science and technology, the development and application of unmanned mobile vehicles (UMVs) have emerged as topics of crucial concern in the global industry. The development goals and directions of UMVs vary according to their industrial uses, which include navigation, autonomous driving, and environmental recognition; these uses have become the priority development goals of researchers in various fields. UMVs employ sensors to collect environmental data for environmental analysis and path planning. However, the analysis function of a single sensor is generally affected by natural environmental factors, resulting in poor identification results. Therefore, this study introduces fusion technology that employs heterogeneous sensors in the Ackerman UMV, leveraging the advantages of each sensor to enhance accuracy and stability in environmental detection and identification. This study proposes a fusion technique involving heterogeneous imaging and LiDAR (laser imaging, detection, and ranging) sensors in an Ackerman UMV. A camera is used to obtain real-time images, and YOLOv4-tiny and simple online real-time tracking are then employed to detect the location of objects and conduct object classification and object tracking. LiDAR is simultaneously used to obtain real-time distance information of detected objects. An inertial measurement unit is used to gather odometry information to determine the position of the Ackerman UMV. Static maps are created using simultaneous localization and mapping. When the user commands the Ackerman UMV to move to the target point, the vehicle control center composed of the robot operating system activates the navigation function through the navigation control module. The Ackerman UMV can reach the destination and instantly identify obstacles and pedestrians when in motion.

AB Recent developments in vehicle automation require simulations of human-robot interactions in the road traffic context, which can be achieved by computational models of human behavior such as game theory. Game theory provides a good insight into road user behavior by considering agents' interdependencies. However, it is still unclear whether conventional game theory is suitable for modeling vehicle-pedestrian interactions at unsignalized locations or if more complex models like behavioral game theory are needed. Hence, we compared four game-theoretic models based on two different payoff formulations and two solving algorithms, to answer this question. Unlike the most previous studies that employed naturalistic datasets to test and validate such models, this study utilized a distributed simulation dataset to test and compare the models. The study was conducted by connecting a CAVE-based pedestrian simulator to a motion-based driving simulator to replicate the traffic scenarios for 32 pedestrian-driver pairs. The findings demonstrated that there is a high variability between participant pairs' behaviors. Our proposed behavioral game-theoretic model outperformed other models in predicting the interaction outcome. This translates to a decrease by 70% and 67% in the root mean squared error (RMSE) when compared to the baseline model, for marked and unmarked crossings, respectively. The model can also predict which interaction will take the longest time to resolve. According to our results, road users cannot be expected to behave in line with the Nash equilibrium of conventional game theory that underscores the complexity of human behavior with implications for the testing and development of automated vehicles.

AB The capability of docking, refueling, repairing, and updating microsatellites using automatic autonomous vehicles will be of significance critical value for design and operation of several space systems in the near feature. Automatic docking capability was successfully tested by many institutions such as National Space Development Agency in Japan, European Space Agency, National Aeronautics and Space Administration in USA, etc. However, there is still much more space for improvement of degree of automation during the process of docking with large deviations of the initial attitude. A novel automatic autonomous probe-cone docking mechanism used for microsatellite docking is proposed. This docking mechanism is designed according to the design indices such as miniaturization, degree of automation and automatic capture capability within large deviation of the initial attitude. On the basis of the virtual work principle, the dynamics modeling of the docking process is presented. The position of the contact point is then analyzed. Comprehensive system level simulation is conducted in the 13 kinds of typical operating conditions with the initial deviations. Capture performance is analyzed. The simulation results show that the docking mechanism can be smoothly captured within 2 s in all cases of large attitude deviation between the active and passive spacecrafts. A virtual prototype model of the docking mechanism is established through ADAMS for further verifying the correctness of the buffer parameter model and the autonomous docking capability. A laboratory platform is designed for on-the-ground experimental validation of the property of mini probe-cone docking mechanism. Repeated docking tests prove the proposed design of the mini probe-cone docking mechanism system for its high reliability, and automatic capture capability within large attitude range. The kinetic model of the docking capture process and the mechanism structure could provide some references for similar mechanism design of in-orbit spacecraft.

ID STATE ESTIMATION; MODEL
AB Autonomous systems such as Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) need to be able to recognise and track crowds of people, e.g. for rescuing and surveillance purposes. Large groups generate multiple measurements with uncertain origin. Additionally, often the sensor noise characteristics are unknown but measurements are bounded within certain intervals. In this work we propose two solutions to the crowds tracking problem with a box particle filtering approach and with a convolution particle filtering approach. The developed filters can cope with the measurement origin uncertainty in an elegant way, i.e. resolve the data association problem. For the box particle filter (PF) we derive a theoretical expression of the generalised likelihood function in the presence of clutter. An adaptive convolution particle filter (CPF) is also developed and the performance of the two filters is compared with the standard sequential importance resampling (SIR) PF. The pros and cons of the two filters are illustrated over a realistic scenario (representing a crowd motion in a stadium) for a large crowd of pedestrians. Accurate estimation results are achieved.

AB Traffic control strategy plays a significant role in obtaining sustainable objectives because it not only improves traffic mobility but also enhances traffic management systems. It has been developed and applied by the research community in recent years and still offers various challenges and issues that may require the attention of researchers and engineers. Recent technological developments toward connected and automated vehicles are beneficial for improving traffic safety and achieving sustainable goals. There is a need to develop a survey on traffic control techniques, which could provide the recent developments in the traffic control strategy and could be useful in obtaining sustainable goals. This survey presents a comprehensive investigation of traffic control techniques by carefully reviewing existing methods from a new perspective and reviews various traffic control strategies that play an important role in achieving sustainable objectives. First, we present traffic control modeling techniques that provide a robust solution to obtain reasonable traffic and sustainable mobilities. These techniques could be helpful for enhancing the traffic flow in a freeway traffic environment. Then, we discuss traffic control strategies that could be helpful for researchers and practitioners to design a robust freeway traffic controller. Second, we present a comprehensive review of recent state-of-the-art methods on the vehicle design control strategy, which is followed by the traffic control design strategy. They aim to reduce traffic emissions and energy consumption by a vehicle. Finally, we present the open research challenges and outline some recommendations which could be beneficial for obtaining sustainable goals in traffic systems and help researchers understand various technical aspects in the deployment of traffic control systems.

AB Objective A driving simulator study explored how drivers behaved depending on their initial role during transitions between highly automated driving (HAD) and longitudinally assisted driving (via adaptive cruise control). Background During HAD, drivers might issue a take-over request (TOR), initiating a transition of control that was not planned. Understanding how drivers behave in this situation and, ultimately, the implications on road safety is of paramount importance. Method Sixteen participants were recruited for this study and performed transitions of control between HAD and longitudinally assisted driving in a driving simulator. While comparing how drivers behaved depending on whether or not they were the initiators, different handover strategies were presented to analyze how drivers adapted to variations in the authority level they were granted at various stages of the transitions. Results Whenever they initiated the transition, drivers were more engaged with the driving task and less prone to follow the guidance of the proposed strategies. Moreover, initiating a transition and having the highest authority share during the handover made the drivers more engaged with the driving task and attentive toward the road. Conclusion Handover strategies that retained a larger authority share were more effective whenever the automation initiated the transition. Under driver-initiated transitions, reducing drivers' authority was detrimental for both performance and comfort. Application As the operational design domain of automated vehicles (Society of Automotive Engineers [SAE] Level 3/4) expands, the drivers might very well fight boredom by taking over spontaneously, introducing safety issues so far not considered but nevertheless very important.

AB In this paper, a lightweight, high-definition mapping method is proposed for autonomous driving to address the drawbacks of traditional mapping methods, such as high cost, low efficiency, and slow update frequency. The proposed method is based on multi-source data fusion perception and involves generating local semantic maps (LSMs) using multi-sensor fusion on a vehicle and uploading multiple LSMs of the same road section, obtained through crowdsourcing, to a cloud server. An improved, two-stage semantic alignment algorithm, based on the semantic generalized iterative closest point (GICP), was then used to optimize the multi-trajectories pose on the cloud. Finally, an improved density clustering algorithm was proposed to instantiate the aligned semantic elements and generate vector semantic maps to improve mapping efficiency. Experimental results demonstrated the accuracy of the proposed method, with a horizontal error within 20 cm, a vertical error within 50 cm, and an average map size of 40 Kb/Km. The proposed method meets the requirements of being high definition, low cost, lightweight, robust, and up-to-date for autonomous driving.

AB Recent road trials have shown that guaranteeing the safety of driving decisions is essential for the wider adoption of autonomous vehicle technology. One promising direction is to pose safety requirements as planning constraints in nonlinear, nonconvex optimization problems of motion synthesis. However, many implementations of this approach are limited by uncertain convergence and local optimality of the solutions achieved, affecting overall robustness. To improve upon these issues, we propose a novel two-stage optimization framework: In the first stage, we find a solution to a mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) formulation of the motion synthesis problem, the output of which initializes a second nonlinear programming (NLP) stage. The MILP stage enforces hard constraints of safety and road rule compliance generating a solution in the right subspace, while the NLP stage refines the solution within the safety bounds for feasibility and smoothness. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework via simulated experiments of complex urban driving scenarios, outperforming a state-of-the-art baseline in metrics of convergence, comfort, and progress.

AB The small-drone technology domain is the outcome of a breakthrough in technological advancement for drones. The Internet of Things (IoT) is used by drones to provide inter-location services for navigation. But, due to issues related to their architecture and design, drones are not immune to threats related to security and privacy. Establishing a secure and reliable network is essential to obtaining optimal performance from drones. While small drones offer promising avenues for growth in civil and defense industries, they are prone to attacks on safety, security, and privacy. The current architecture of small drones necessitates modifications to their data transformation and privacy mechanisms to align with domain requirements. This research paper investigates the latest trends in safety, security, and privacy related to drones, and the Internet of Drones (IoD), highlighting the importance of secure drone networks that are impervious to interceptions and intrusions. To mitigate cyber-security threats, the proposed framework incorporates intelligent machine learning models into the design and structure of IoT-aided drones, rendering adaptable and secure technology. Furthermore, in this work, a new dataset is constructed, a merged dataset comprising a drone dataset and two benchmark datasets. The proposed strategy outperforms the previous algorithms and achieves 99.89% accuracy on the drone dataset and 91.64% on the merged dataset. Overall, this intelligent framework gives a potential approach to improving the security and resilience of cyber-physical satellite systems, and IoT-aided aerial vehicle systems, addressing the rising security challenges in an interconnected world.

AB This study originated with the intent of qualifying traffic string stability from empirical observations. A new responsiveness angle measure was developed to assess driver instincts under vehicle-following conditions. In this measure, the degree of the follower vehicle's attention towards its leader vehicle's actions is quantified. In understanding string stability in the traffic stream and assessing the propagation of disturbances, the newly conceptualized measure was used along with a discrete Fourier transform to measure the frequencies associated with responsiveness angle sequences. In this transform, a higher frequency of the angle depicts unstable conditions and vice versa. In assessing string stability from the empirical observations, vehicular trajectory data were developed from three study sections. Two study sections tended to have homogeneous lane-wise traffic, whereas the third section had mixed (heterogeneous) traffic. The results of the string stability analysis over the study sections showed that string stability varied with the change in traffic flow conditions, road geometries, and traffic flow type. In the case of free-flow conditions, the traffic streams were found to be stable with marginal disturbances in the responsiveness angle. From the analysis, it was observed that, in the case of study Section 3, around 26 instances of the stream were extremely unstable conditions (frequency equal to 10). For study Sections 1 and 2, the traffic stream was unsteady for 4 and 13 instances, respectively. However, as the traffic flow level rose, string stability deteriorated. This study demonstrated a novel approach to analyzing string stability based on actual traffic conditions that can be implemented in real time for traffic stream monitoring.

TI Effect of cognitive load on drivers ' State and task performance during

AB This research paper explores the impact of cognitive load on drivers' physiological state and driving performance during an automated driving to manual control transition scenario, using a driving simulator. Whilst driving in the automated mode, cognitive load was manipulated using the "N-Back" task, which participants engaged with via a visual display. Results suggest that non-optimal levels of workload during the automated driving conditions impair driving performance, especially lateral control of the vehicle, and the magnitude of this impairment varied with increasing cognitive load. In addition to these findings, the present paper introduces a novel method for determining stabilisation times of both driver state and driving performance indicators following a transition of vehicle control. Using this method we demonstrate that mean and standard deviation of lane position impairments were found to take longer to stabilise following transition to manual driving following a higher level of cognitive load during the automated driving period, taking up to 22 s for driving performance to normalise after take-over. In addition, heart rate parameters take between 20 and 30 s to stabilise following a planned take-over request. Finally, this paper demonstrates how the magnitude of cognitive load can be estimated in context of automated driving using physiological measures, captured by consumer electronic devices. We discuss the impact our findings have on the design of SAE Level 3 systems. Relevant suggestions are provided to the research community and automakers working on future implementation of vehicles capable of conditional automation.

AB Technological advances have recently led to the development of urban air mobility (UAM), an alternative transportation mode with several concepts including vehicles operated by on-demand fully-automated vertical take-off and landing aircraft (VTOL) for intra-city passenger transportation. However, despite a growing interest in UAM, understanding users' perceptions to it remains limited. This research aims to identify and quantify the factors affecting the adoption and use of UAM, based on relevant tools from the literature, such as recurring factors in studies on aerial vehicle concepts, ground autonomous vehicles, but also acceptance models, such as the Technology Acceptance Model by Davis et al. (1989). A stated-preference survey was developed to assess the perception of users in terms of adoption time horizon, including options such as the first six years of the service's implementation, "unsure", and "never". The obtained results were evaluated using exploratory factor analyses, and the specification and estimation of suitable discrete choice models, multinomial logit models (MNLs) and ordered logit models (OLMs), with adoption time horizon as dependent variable. Findings revealed the importance of safety and trust, affinity to automation, data concerns, social attitude, and socio-demographics for adoption. Factors, such as the value of time savings, the perception of automation costs, and service reliability, were also found to be highly influential. There was also an indication that skeptical respondents, i.e. answering "unsure", had a behavior similar to late and non-adopters, i.e. adoption time horizon higher than six years or answering "never". The summarized results were represented in an extended Technology Acceptance Model for urban air mobility, and provided insights for policymakers and industrial stakeholders.

AB This paper presents a complete review of computer vision algorithms and vision-based intelligent applications, that are developed in the field of the Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) in the latest decade. During this time, the evolution of relevant technologies for UAVs; such as component miniaturization, the increase of computational capabilities, and the evolution of computer vision techniques have allowed an important advance in the development of UAVs technologies and applications. Particularly, computer vision technologies integrated in UAVs allow to develop cutting-edge technologies to cope with aerial perception difficulties; such as visual navigation algorithms, obstacle detection and avoidance and aerial decision-making. All these expert technologies have developed a wide spectrum of application for UAVs, beyond the classic military and defense purposes. Unmanned Aerial Vehicles and Computer Vision are common topics in expert systems, so thanks to the recent advances in perception technologies, modern intelligent applications are developed to enhance autonomous UAV positioning, or automatic algorithms to avoid aerial collisions, among others. Then, the presented survey is based on artificial perception applications that represent important advances in the latest years in the expert system field related to the Unmanned Aerial Vehicles. In this paper, the most significant advances in this field are presented, able to solve fundamental technical limitations; such as visual odometry, obstacle detection, mapping and localization, et cetera. Besides, they have been analyzed based on their capabilities and potential utility. Moreover, the applications and UAVs are divided and categorized according to different criteria.

AB In autonomous driving, the camera and LiDAR are complementary to each other through their strengths, and many autonomous vehicles and robot recognition systems utilize cameras and LiDAR. In order to effectively fuse the data of the camera and LiDAR attached to different positions and angles, we must perform camera-LiDAR extrinsic calibration. Most existing camera-LiDAR calibration methods infer the results by constructing a camera-LiDAR feature pair using features acquired from a single frame. It has the disadvantage that it is challenging to draw results. In this paper, we used sequential LiDAR data to extract features by accumulating LiDAR frames effectively. By using the location information between the accumulated frame (global) and the single frame (local) to convert the features detected from the global to the local, the shortcomings of LiDAR's single frame with few features were supplemented. Methods for detecting feature points in LiDAR are described step-by-step, and the advantages and excellence of this camera-LiDAR calibration system are shown through quantitative/qualitative evaluation methods. As a result, the proposed system outputs superior performance compared to other systems.

AB To reduce the discrepancy between the source and target domains, a new multi-label adaptation network (ML-ANet) based on multiple kernel variants with maximum mean discrepancies is proposed in this paper. The hidden representations of the task-specific layers in ML-ANet are embedded in the reproducing kernel Hilbert space (RKHS) so that the mean-embeddings of specific features in different domains could be precisely matched. Multiple kernel functions are used to improve feature distribution efficiency for explicit mean embedding matching, which can further reduce domain discrepancy. Adverse weather and cross-camera adaptation examinations are conducted to verify the effectiveness of our proposed ML-ANet. The results show that our proposed ML-ANet achieves higher accuracies than the compared state-of-the-art methods for multi-label image classification in both the adverse weather adaptation and cross-camera adaptation experiments. These results indicate that ML-ANet can alleviate the reliance on fully labeled training data and improve the accuracy of multi-label image classification in various domain shift scenarios.

AB This article examines how people respond to the presence of a flying robot under various operating conditions using traditional human physiological measures and a novel head movement measurement. A central issue to the integration of flying robotic systems into human-populated environments is how to improve the level of comfort and safety for people around them. Traditional motion control algorithms in robotics tend to focus on the actual safety of collision avoidance. However, people's perceived safety is not necessarily equivalent to the actual safety of the vehicle. Therefore flight control systems must account for people's perception of safety beyond the actual safety of the aerial vehicles in order to allow for successful interaction between humans and the unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs). Across three experiments participants passively observed quadrotor trajectories in a simulated virtual reality environment. Quadrotor flight characteristics were manipulated in terms of speed, altitude, and audibility to examine their effect on physiological arousal and head motion kinematics. Physiological arousal was greater when the quadrotor was flying with the audio on than off, and at eye-height than overhead, and decreased over repeated exposure. In addition, head acceleration away from the UAVs indicating defensive behavior was stronger for faster speed and audible UAVs. These data suggest head acceleration can serve as a new index specific for measuring perceived safety. Applications intended for human comfort need to consider constraints from specific measures of perceived safety in addition to traditional measures of general physiological arousal.

AB This paper reviews and prospects the research in transportation systems management with the presence of dynamic wireless charging (DWC) electric vehicles (EVs). DWC is based on inductive coupling that allows EVs to get charged wirelessly by driving over the coils installed in the ground. Thus, DWC is also known as 'charging-while-driving' or 'in-motion charging', which is regarded as one of the most promising charging solutions for EVs. The road that is equipped with wireless chargers underneath its surface is called a wireless charging lane (WCL). The deployment of WCLs will lead to a profound change in the field of transportation systems management. We give a review of recent studies on related topics including WCL allocation and related decisions, energy consumption of EVs considering WCLs, and pricing of EVs for the use of DWC facilities. Based on the analysis of the existing studies, we identify the needs for more flexible WCL design and allocation models, as well as novel ways that incorporate the complexities in energy consumption by EVs and routing behaviour into traffic network analysis. In addition, we emphasise the research opportunities of dynamic traffic modelling and real-time control considering DWC and EVs with state-of-charge (SOC) constraints. A high-level dynamic system model and a general model-based control problem are formulated in this regard. Finally, we foresee a demand for finer traffic management in the WCL environment enabled by emerging technologies such as the internet of vehicles (IoV) and autonomous driving.

AB Worldwide, the persistent trend of human and animal life losses, as well as damage to properties due to wildlife-vehicle collisions (WVCs) remains a significant source of concerns for a broad range of stakeholders. To mitigate their occurrences and impact, many approaches are being adopted, with varying successes. Because of their increased versatility and increasing efficiency, Artificial Intelligence-based methods have been experiencing a significant level of adoption. The present work extensively reviews the literature on intelligent systems incorporating sensor technologies and/or machine learning methods to mitigate WVCs. Included in our review is an investigation of key factors contributing to human-wildlife conflicts, as well as a discussion of dominant state-of-the-art datasets used in the mitigation of WVCs. Our study combines a systematic review with bibliometric analysis. We find that most animal detection systems (excluding autonomous vehicles) are relying neither on state-of-the-art datasets nor on recent breakthrough machine learning approaches. We, therefore, argue that the use of the latest datasets and machine learning techniques will minimize false detection and improve model performance. In addition, the present work covers a comprehensive list of associated challenges ranging from failure to detect hotspot areas to limitations in training datasets. Future research directions identified include the design and development of algorithms for real-time animal detection systems. The latter provides a rationale for the applicability of our proposed solutions, for which we designed a continuous product development lifecycle to determine their feasibility.

AB A fast-running human detection system for the unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) based on optical flow and deep convolution networks is proposed in this study. In the system, running humans can be detected in real-time at the speed of 15 frames per second (fps) with an 81.1% detection accuracy. To fast locate the candidate targets, optical flow representing the motion information is calculated with every two successive frames. A series of prior-processing operations, including spatial average filtering, morphological expansion and outer contour extraction, are performed to extract the regions of interest. A classification model based on small-kernel convolution networks is proposed to achieve the accurate recognition of the running people in various backgrounds. In the model, small convolutional filters are adopted to accelerate the speed of the data representation. Moreover, a total of 60,000 samples are collected to enhance the robustness of the model to adapt to the complex outdoor UAV scenes. The proposed method is compared with other deep learning frameworks for object detection. Field experiments on UAV videos are performed to verify that the proposed system can effectively detect the running people targets in real-time.

ID AUTONOMOUS BRAKING; STABILITY; MUSCULATURE; SPINE
AB Objective: The objective of this study is to determine the contribution of Chile's 2005 child restraint legislation to the reduction in child severe traffic injuries.
   Methods: We analyzed motor vehicle injury data from Chile's Ministry of Transport National Road Safety Commission from 2000 to 2012 to determine the effect of Chile's 2005 mandatory child restraint legislation. Using time-series robust random effects models we assessed the effect of the law on two dependent variables: (1) child severe traffic injuries per vehicle fleet; and (2) child severe traffic injuries per population. The independent variable was the 2005 enactment of Chile's mandatory child restraint legislation. We added the following control variables: Number of tickets per year per police officer; motor vehicle fleet; alcohol consumption; number of crashes; and unemployment rate.
   Results: There was a 23.6% [95% confidence interval (CI) 0.98-48.89, P<.001] reduction in child severe traffic injuries per population two years after Chile's enactment of child restraint legislation, and a 47.9% [95% CI 4.87-91.06, P<.001] reduction in child severe traffic injuries per vehicle three years after the enactment. These reductions in severe child injuries were short-lived.
   Conclusions: Evidence from Chile shows that there was a reduction in child injuries after the enactment of its law, but only in the short-term. In the context of child restraint use, measures such as police enforcement, public information campaigns, and involvement of public health professionals in educating parents may be required to reinforce safety improvements in the long term.

AB Large number of Internet of Things (IoT) devices deployed on demand to monitor surroundings and offload computation-intensive tasks to edge servers, which favors low-latency IoT applications. However, some of them scatter in areas with limited or no available communication infrastructure (no-ACI), which rises a huge challenge for task offloading, due to when and which devices have tasks cannot be known in advance. In this article, a trust-based active notice task offloading (TANTO) scheme in the aerial computing system (ACS) assisted by the unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) is proposed to provide trust and low-delay task offloading for resource-limited IoT devices in areas with no-ACI. The main innovations of TANTO in ACS are as follow: 1) a novel task offloading mechanism for IoT devices in networks with no-ACI is proposed, where devices broadcast task offloading notice, making it easy for UAV to know where tasks need to offload without aimless search, which can effectively reduce UAV's flight distance and task completion delay at the same time; 2) a trust calculation and reasoning method is proposed to calculate network trust, and divide the network into grids with different trust values, which guides UAV through grids with higher trust to increase the task completion rate and reduce delay; and 3) an online UAV trajectory optimization algorithm is proposed to dynamically prioritize tasks with urgent deadline. A large number of experimental results show that TANTO has better performance than previous studies in terms of task completion rate, tasks' average completion time, and UAV's flight cost.

AB Unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) is at the heart of modern traffic sensing research due to its advantages of low cost, high flexibility, and wide view range over traditional traffic sensors. Recently, increasing efforts in UAV-based traffic sensing have been made, and great progress has been achieved on the estimation of aggregated macroscopic traffic parameters. Compared to aggregated macroscopic traffic data, there has been extensive attention on higher-resolution traffic data such as microscopic traffic parameters and lane-level macroscopic traffic parameters since they can help deeply understand traffic patterns and individual vehicle behaviours. However, little existing research can automatically estimate microscopic traffic parameters and lane-level macroscopic traffic parameters using UAV videos with a moving background. In this study, an advanced framework is proposed to bridge the gap. Specifically, three functional modules consisting of multiple processing streams and the interconnections among them are carefully designed with the consideration of UAV video features and traffic flow characteristics. Experimental results on real-world UAV video data demonstrate promising performances of the framework in microscopic and lane-level macroscopic traffic parameters estimation. This research pushes off the boundaries of the applicability of UAVs and has an enormous potential to support advanced traffic sensing and management.

AB This study is concerned with integrated target search, tasking and tracking using multiple fixed-wing unmanned air vehicles (UAVs). The problem is to design control logic and optimise flight paths for UAVs. The fixed-wing UAVs are required to cooperatively search the potential targets in the area of operation (AO) and keep monitoring and tracking the found targets according to a certain predefined minimal revisit time. Each UAV can only communicate with its neighbours and also flight autonomy is designed for individual UAVs. High level control logic based on finite state automaton model, integrating the four modes of operations, that is, take-off mode, fly-to-AO mode, search mode and tracking mode, is developed. For the target search, an improved decentralised coverage based algorithm is designed for fixed-wing UAVs. Task assignment is developed based on contract net protocol. For the target tracking, the optimal paths are derived for the UAVs to continuously monitoring multiple static targets. The developed integrated multi-agent system is evaluated by a hybrid three-dimensional simulation system using a real miniature fixed-wing UAV dynamic model.

AB In the rapidly advancing domain of vehicular traffic management and autonomous driving, accurate lane change predictions are paramount for ensuring safety and optimizing traffic flow. This study introduces a comprehensive two-stage prediction model that harnesses the capabilities of long short-term memory (LSTM) for anticipating vehicular lane changes. Initially, we employed a variety of models, such as regression methods, SVMs, and a multilayer perceptron, to categorize lane change behaviors. The dataset was then segmented based on vehicle trajectories and lane change patterns. In the subsequent phase, we utilized the superior classification outcomes from LinearSVC to curate our training data. We developed two dedicated LSTM networks tailored to specific datasets: the lane-keeping LSTM (LK-LSTM) and the lane-changing LSTM (LC-LSTM). By integrating insights from both models, we achieved a comprehensive prediction of vehicular lane changes. Our results indicate that the unified prediction model markedly enhances prediction precision. Accurate lane change predictions offer valuable contributions to advanced driver-assistance systems (ADAS), with the potential to minimize traffic mishaps and enhance traffic fluidity. As we transition to a more autonomous automotive era, refining these predictions becomes essential in seamlessly merging human and automated driving experiences.

AB Wireless charging of automated guided vehicles (AGVs) has been widely used because of its high security and convenience. However, due to the inevitable misalignment between the coupling coils, the charging system cannot maintain the constant current (CC) or constant voltage (CV) output. Therefore, this article proposes a misalignment-tolerant fractional-order wireless power transfer (FOWPT) system with CC or CV output. According to the principle of the fractional-order autonomous circuit, the natural resonant frequency and operating frequency can be adjusted adaptively with the change of transfer distance and load. Benefiting from the frequency characteristics and the new implementation method of the FOWPT, the system maintains CC and CV output, and the horizontal and vertical misalignment tolerances are within 44.4% and 22.2%, respectively. Therefore, the proposed system improves the freedom and convenience of charging, and provides a new wireless charging solution for AGVs. Future article will focus on more concise modeling and implementation methods of fractional-order systems, and improving the performance of the FOWPT.

AB The increasing demand in the development of autonomous driving systems makes the employment of automotive radars unavoidable. Such a motivation for the demonstration of fully-autonomous vehicles brings the challenge of secure driving under high traffic jam conditions. In this paper, we present the investigation of Advanced Driver Assistance Systems (ADAS) radars from the perspective of electronic warfare (EW). Close to real life, four ADAS jamming scenarios have been defined. Considering these scenarios, the necessary jamming power to jam ADAS radars is calculated. The required jamming Effective Radiated Power (ERP) is -2 dBm to 40 dBm depending on the jamming scenario. These ERP values are very low and easily realizable. Moreover, the effect of the jamming has been investigated on the radar detection at radar Range Doppler Map (RDM) and 2-Dimensional Constant False Alarm Rate (2D-CFAR). Furthermore, the possible jamming system requirements have been investigated. It is noted that the required jamming system will not require high-end technology. It is concluded that for the security of automotive driving, the ADAS radar manufacturer should consider the intentional jamming and related Electronic Counter Countermeasures (ECCM) features in the design of ADAS radars.

TI UAV Swarm Confrontation Using Hierarchical Multiagent Reinforcement
   Learning
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF AEROSPACE ENGINEERING
LA English
DT Article
AB With the development of unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) technology, UAV swarm confrontation has attracted many researchers' attention. However, the situation faced by the UAV swarm has substantial uncertainty and dynamic variability. The state space and action space increase exponentially with the number of UAVs, so that autonomous decision-making becomes a difficult problem in the confrontation environment. In this paper, a multiagent reinforcement learning method with macro action and human expertise is proposed for autonomous decision-making of UAVs. In the proposed approach, UAV swarm is modeled as a large multiagent system (MAS) with an individual UAV as an agent, and the sequential decision-making problem in swarm confrontation is modeled as a Markov decision process. Agents in the proposed method are trained based on the macro actions, where sparse and delayed rewards, large state space, and action space are effectively overcome. The key to the success of this method is the generation of the macro actions that allow the high-level policy to find a near-optimal solution. In this paper, we further leverage human expertise to design a set of good macro actions. Extensive empirical experiments in our constructed swarm confrontation environment show that our method performs better than the other algorithms.

AB In this paper, a leader-follower formation control strategy is presented based on adaptive neural network and disturbance observer, which is aimed at resolving model uncertainties as well as the time-varying disturbances for autonomous underactuated surface vessels. The model uncertainties which can be expressed by unknown nonlinear functions are approximated and compensated by the adaptive neural network. The disturbance observer introduced can estimate time-varying disturbances and compensate them to the feedforward control loop, so as to make the external time-varying disturbances suppressed and the robustness of controller against the disturbances improved. The dynamic surface control technology is applied in the procedure of designing the controller through utilizing the backstepping method, which solves the computational explosion of the derivative of virtual control signals. Finally, through Lyapunov analysis, the stability of adaptive neural formation control system is proved and all the error signals uniformly converge to a very small range ultimately. The excellent performance of the presented formation control strategy is demonstrated through numerical simulations.

ID IMAGE FUSION; TARGET
AB Object detection is an important perception task in autonomous driving and advanced driver assistance systems. The visible camera is widely used for perception, but its performance is limited by illumination and environmental variations. For robust vision-based perception, we propose a deep learning framework for effective sensor fusion of the visible camera with complementary sensors. A feature-level sensor fusion technique, using skip connection, is proposed for the sensor fusion of the visible camera with the millimeter-wave radar and the thermal camera. The two networks are called the RV-Net and the TV-Net, respectively. These networks have two input branches and one output branch. The input branches contain separate branches for the individual sensor feature extraction, which are then fused in the output perception branch using skip connections. The RVNet and the TVNet simultaneously perform sensor-specific feature extraction, feature-level fusion and object detection within an end-to-end framework. The proposed networks are validated with baseline algorithms on public datasets. The results obtained show that the feature-level sensor fusion is better than baseline early and late fusion frameworks.

AB Ocean acidification alters the oceanic carbonate system, increasing potential for ecological, economic, and cultural losses. Historically, productive coastal oceans lack vertically resolved high-resolution carbonate system measurements on time scales relevant to organism ecology and life history. The recent development of a deep ion-sensitive field-effect transistor (ISFET)-based pH sensor system integrated into a Slocum glider has provided a platform for achieving high-resolution carbonate system profiles. From May 2018 to November 2019, seasonal deployments of the pH glider were conducted in the central Mid-Atlantic Bight. Simultaneous measurements from the glider's pH and salinity sensors enabled the derivation of total alkalinity and calculation of other carbonate system parameters including aragonite saturation state. Carbonate system parameters were then mapped against other variables, such as temperature, dissolved oxygen, and chlorophyll, over space and time. The seasonal dynamics of carbonate chemistry presented here provide a baseline to begin identifying drivers of acidification in this vital economic zone.

We focus on vision-based MoCap, where the objective is to estimate the trajectory of body pose, and shape of a single moving person using multiple micro aerial vehicles. State-of-the-art solutions to this problem are based on classical control methods, which depend on hand-crafted system, and observation models. Such models are difficult to derive, and generalize across different systems. Moreover, the non-linearities, and non-convexities of these models lead to sub-optimal controls. In our work, we formulate this problem as a sequential decision making task to achieve the vision-based motion capture objectives, and solve it using a deep neural network-based RL method. We leverage proximal policy optimization (PPO) to train a stochastic decentralized control policy for formation control. The neural network is trained in a parallelized setup in synthetic environments. We performed extensive simulation experiments to validate our approach. Finally, real-robot experiments demonstrate that our policies generalize to real world conditions.

AB Humans and other animals are exquisitely attuned to their context. Context affects almost all aspects of behavior, and it does so for the mast part automatically, without a conscious reasoning effort. This would be a very useful property for an artificial agent to have: upon recognizing its context, the agent's behavior would automatically adjust to fit it. This paper describes context-mediated behavior (CMB), an approach to context-sensitive behavior we have developed over the past few years for intelligent autonomous agents. In CMB, contexts are represented explicitly as contextual schemas (c-schemas). An agent recognizes its context by finding the c-schemas that match it, then it merges these to form a coherent representation of the current context. This includes not only a description of the context, but also information about how to behave in it. From that point until the next context change, knowledge for context-sensitive behavior is available with no additional effort. This is used to influence perception, make predictions about the world, handle unanticipated events, determine the context-dependent meaning of concepts, focus attention and select actions. CMB is being implemented in the Orca program, an intelligent controller for autonomous underwater vehicles. (C) 1998 Academic Press Limited.

AB A field boundary with a single entrance as well as the entry and exit paths of the tractor based on the entrance location are key design requirements that must be considered when planning an effective path for an autonomous tractor operating in a paddy field to avoid collisions with the embankments that hold floodwater. In creating a complete in-field coverage path, an entry-exit path planner that generates paths to/from the start/end points of the auto-traveled path is needed to achieve effective field operations for a fully autonomous tractor. In this study, a novel path planner for the entry and exit operations of an autonomous tractor was developed using the A* algorithm to enable the tractor located at the entrance to automatically go to the start point of an agricultural task and return to the entrance after completing the agricultural task. An occupancy grid map with virtual obstacles was designed and the A* algorithm was applied to it to create a path for the tractor to reach its destination via the entry-exit path accurately in terms of positioning and heading. Two path-smoothing processes, a line-of-sight path smoother (LOPS) and a collinear-node path smoother (CNS), were performed to reduce redundant turning and control waypoints derived by the A* algorithm. The feasibility of using the developed algorithms was investigated via computer simulations followed by field tests with a 60-kW autonomous tractor. The simulation results confirm that the entry and exit paths generated by the proposed planner effectively guided the tractor to reach the given target points in terms of location and direction under the various entry, start, and end conditions by reducing the lateral and heading errors compared with those obtained without using the proposed search space and smoothers. For validation testing in two real paddy fields, the entry-exit paths were successfully generated in response to different entrance locations and the tractor followed the entry path and started the operation at the start point of the work path with a lateral deviation of <= 8.5 cm. In addition, the tractor navigated the exit path automatically and reached the destination with a lateral deviation of <12 cm and a heading error of <22. to the entrance and the operator was then able to drive the tractor to exit the field easily without backward navigation.

AB Lane markings are mymargin a key element for Autonomous Driving. The generation of high definition maps and ground-truth data require extensive manual labor. In this paper, we present an efficient and robust method for the offline annotation of lane markings, using low-density LIDAR point clouds and odometry information. The odometry is used to accumulate the scans and to process them using blocks following the trajectory of the vehicle. At each block, candidate lane marking points are detected by generating virtual scan-lines and applying a dynamically optimized filter function to the LIDAR intensity values. The lane markings are tracked block wise, and their width is estimated and classified as either solid or dashed. The results are lists of connected 3D points that represent the different lane markings. The accuracy of the proposed method was tested against manually labeled recordings. A novel evaluation methodology focused on the lateral precision of detections is presented. Moreover, a web user interface was used to load the produced annotations, achieving a reduction of 60% in the annotation time, as compared to a fully manual baseline.

ID RECOGNITION
AB As interest in autonomous driving has increased in recent years, various sensors have been developed for use in vehicles to detect and classify traffic signs. When road traffic facilities are not recognized owing to the malfunction of sensors, point cloud data and images collected by mobile mapping systems (MMSs) are used to construct high-definition maps containing road traffic facility information. However, when traffic signs, among the targets of high-definition map construction, are constructed using point cloud data, it becomes difficult to detect and classify traffic signs because they are highly reflective. In this study, we detected and sub-classified traffic signs by combining Mask Regions with Convolutional Neuron Network (Mask R-CNN) and Inception-v3 models based on image data obtained using MMSs. Image data obtained by various types of MMS were used to detect traffic signs and classification results were verified. The detection accuracy of traffic signs was 87.6% and the classification accuracy was 77.5%; thus, the method proposed in this study can be used to automatically construct traffic signs for high-definition maps.

AB In this paper, the distributed formation control problem for multiple autonomous surface vessels in the presence of uncertain dynamics and environment disturbances is considered based on an extended state observer (ESO). The objective is to drive the vessels to automatically track the time-varying trajectory in a desired formation under the communication protocol that only a part of vessels can obtain the information of reference trajectory, and the communication topology graph is directed. A distributed formation control algorithm based on a dynamic surface control (DSC) technique and the outputs of the ESO is proposed for the marine surface vessels. The ESO is used to estimate the velocity signals and total disturbances including uncertain dynamics and environmental disturbances. The DSC is developed to design the control law for avoiding the calculation explosion of virtual law caused by a backstepping technique. All the error signals in the closed-loop system are proved to be bound by using the Lyapunov theory. Numerical simulation results are provided to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed distributed formation control approach.

AB This paper presents a new hybrid control approach for vision-based navigation applied to autonomous robotic automobiles in urban environments. It is composed by a visual servoing (VS) for road lane following (as deliberative control) and a dynamic window approach (DWA) for obstacle avoidance (as reactive control). Typically, VS applications do not change the velocities to stop the robot in dangerous situations or avoid obstacles while performing the navigation task. However, in several urban conditions, these are elements that must be dealt with to guarantee the safe movement of the car. As a solution for this problem, in this paper, a line-following VS controller will be used to perform road lane following tasks with obstacle avoidance, validating its control outputs in a new image-based dynamic window approach (IDWA). The final solution combines the benefits of both controllers (VS+IDWA) for optimal lane following and fast obstacle avoidance, taking into account the car kinematics and some dynamics constraints. Experiments in a challenging scenario with both simulated and real experimental car show the viability of the proposed methodology.

AB Depth estimation has been an essential task for many computer vision applications, especially in autonomous driving, where safety is paramount. Depth can be estimated not only with traditional supervised learning but also via a self-supervised approach that relies on camera motion and does not require ground truth depth maps. Recently, major improvements have been introduced to make self-supervised depth prediction more precise. However, most existing approaches still focus on single-frame depth estimation, even in the self-supervised setting. Since most methods can operate with frame sequences, we believe that the quality of current models can be significantly improved with the help of information about previous frames. In this work, we study different ways of integrating recurrent blocks and attention mechanisms into a common self-supervised depth estimation pipeline. We propose a set of modifications that utilize temporal information from previous frames and provide new neural network architectures for monocular depth estimation in a self-supervised manner. Our experiments on the KITTI dataset show that proposed modifications can be an effective tool for exploiting temporal information in a depth prediction pipeline.

AB Pedestrian trajectory prediction in dynamic, multi-agent traffic junction scene is an important problem in the context of self-driving cars. Accurately predicting the trajectory of the agent, especially the pedestrian with high randomness, is of great significance to autonomous driving technology. In this paper, we propose Multi-PPTP, a novel trajectory prediction model that first utilizes a composite rasterized map to model the complex representations and interactions of road components, including dynamic obstacles (e.g., pedestrians, vehicles, and cyclists) and static road information (e.g., lanes, traffic lights, and sidewalks). Then it uses MapNet and AgentNet to extract spatio-temporal features by deep convolutional networks and LSTM to automatically derive relevant features, and next exploits Interaction-AttNet aggregate features to learn the high interactions among all components by affine transformation and multi-head attention mechanism. Additionally, we also propose a series of unique loss functions to predict multiple possible trajectories of each pedestrian while estimating their probabilities. Following extensive offline evaluation and comparison to the state-of-the-art models, our approach outperforms significantly the state-of-the-art models on our large scale in-house and public nuScenes dataset.

AB This paper investigates the vision-based autonomous driving with deep learning and reinforcement learning methods. Different from the end-to-end learning method, our method breaks the vision-based lateral control system down into a perception module and a control module.The perception module which is based on a multi-task learning neural network first takes a driver-view image as its input and predicts the track features. The control module which is based on reinforcement learning then makes a control decision based on these features. In order to improve the data efficiency, we propose visual TORCS (VTORCS), a deep reinforcement learning environment which is based on the open racing car simulator (TORCS). By means of the provided functions, one can train an agent with the input of an image or various physical sensor measurement, or evaluate the perception algorithm on this simulator. The trained reinforcement learning controller outperforms the linear quadratic regulator (LQR) controller and model predictive control (MPC) controller on different tracks. The experiments demonstrate that the perception module shows promising performance and the controller is capable of controlling the vehicle drive well along the track center with visual input.

AB In order that fully self-driving vehicles can be realized, it is believed that systems where the driver shares control and authority with the intelligent vehicle offer the most effective solution. An understanding of driving intention is the key to building a collaborative autonomous driving system. In this study, the proposed method incorporates the spatiotemporal features of driver behavior and forward-facing traffic scenes through a feature extraction module; the joint representation was input into an inference module for obtaining driver intentions. The feature extraction module was a two-stream structure that was designed based on a deep three-dimensional convolutional neural network. To accommodate the differences in video data inside and outside the cab, the two-stream network consists of a slow pathway that processes the driver behavior data with low frame rates, along with a fast pathway that processes traffic scene data with high frame rates. Then, a gated recurrent unit, based on a recurrent neural network, and a fully connected layer constitute an intent inference module to estimate the driver's lane-change and turning intentions. A public dataset, Brain4Cars, was used to validate the proposed method. The results showed that compared with modeling using the data related to driver behaviors, the ability of intention inference is significantly improved after integrating traffic scene information. The overall accuracy of the intention inference of five intents was 84.92% at a time of 1 s prior to the maneuver, indicating that making full use of traffic scene information was an effective way to improve inference performance.

AB Objective: This article estimates the safety potential of a current commercially available connected vehicle technology in real-world crashes.
   Method: Data from the Centre for Automotive Safety Research's at-scene in-depth crash investigations in South Australia were used to simulate the circumstances of real-world crashes. A total of 89 crashes were selected for inclusion in the study. The crashes were selected as representative of the most prevalent crash types for injury or fatal crashes and had potential to be mitigated by connected vehicle technology. The trajectory, speeds, braking, and impact configuration of the selected in-depth cases were replicated in a software package and converted to a file format allowing "replay" of the scenario in real time as input to 2 Cohda Wireless MK2 onboard units. The Cohda Wireless onboard units are a mature connected vehicle technology that has been used in both the German simTD field trial and the U.S. Department of Transport's Safety Pilot project and have been tuned for low false alarm rates when used in the real world. The crash replay was achieved by replacing each of the onboard unit Global Positioning System (GPS) inputs with the simulated data of each of the involved vehicles. The time at which the Cohda Wireless threat detection software issued an elevated warning was used to calculate a new impact speed using 3 different reaction scenarios and 2 levels of braking.
   Results: It was found that between 37 and 86% of the simulated crashes could be avoided, with highest percentage due a fully autonomous system braking at 0.7 g. The same system also reduced the impact speed relative to the actual crash in all cases. Even when a human reaction time of 1.2s and moderate braking of 0.4 g was assumed, the impact speed was reduced in 78% of the crashes. Crash types that proved difficult for the threat detection engine were head-on crashes where the approach angle was low and right turn-opposite crashes.
   Conclusions: These results indicate that connected vehicle technology can be greatly beneficial in real-world crash scenarios and that this benefit would be maximized by having the vehicle intervene autonomously with heavy braking. The crash types that proved difficult for the connected vehicle technology could be better addressed if controller area network (CAN) information is available, such as steering wheel angle, so that driver intent can be inferred sooner. More accurate positioning in the real world (e.g., combining satellite positioning and accelerometer data) would allow the technology to be more effective for near-collinear head-on and rear-end crashes, because the low approach angles that are common in such crashes are currently ignored in order to minimize false alarms due to positioning uncertainty.

AB The advent of automated and algorithmic technology requires people to consider them when assigning responsibility for something going wrong. We focus on a focal question: who or what should be responsible when both human and machine drivers make mistakes in human-machine shared-control vehicles? We examined human judgments of responsibility for automated vehicle (AV) crashes (e.g., the 2018 Uber AV crash) caused by the distracted test driver and malfunctioning automated driving system, through a sequential mixed-methods design: a text analysis of public comments after the first trial of the Uber case (Study 1) and vignette-based experiment (Study 2). Studies 1 and 2 found that although people assigned more responsibility to the test driver than the car manufacturer, the car manufacturer is not clear of responsibility from their perspective, which is against the Uber case's jury decision that the test driver was the only one facing criminal charges. Participants allocated equal responsibility to the normal driver and car manufacturer in Study 2. In Study 1, people gave different and sometimes antagonistic reasons for their judgments. Some commented that human drivers in AVs will inevitably feel bored and reduce vigilance and attention when the automated driving system is operating (called "passive error"), whereas others thought the test driver can keep attentive and should not be distracted (called "active error"). Study 2's manipulation of passive and active errors, however, did not influence responsibility judgments significantly. Our results might offer insights for building a socially-acceptable framework for responsibility judgments for AV crashes.

AB Automated Mobility-on-Demand (AMoD) systems, in which fleets of automated vehicles provide on-demand services, are expected to transform urban mobility systems. Motivated by the rapid development of AMoD services delivered by self-driving car companies, an agent-based model (ABM) has been developed to study the coexistence phenomena of multiple AMoD operators competing for customers. The ABM is used to investigate how changes in pricing strategies, assignment methods, and fleet sizes affect travelers' choice of different AMoD services and the operating performance of competing operators in the case-study city of The Hague, in the Netherlands. Findings suggest that an optimal assignment algorithm can reduce the average waiting time by up to 24% compared to a simple heuristic algorithm. We also find that a larger fleet could increase demand but lead to higher waiting times for its users and higher travel times for competing operators' users due to the added congestion. Notably, pricing strategies can significantly affect travelers' choice of AMoD services, but the effect depends strongly on the time of the day. Low-priced AMoD services can provide high service levels and effectively attract more demand, with up to 64.7% of customers choosing the very early morning service [5:30 AM,7:20 AM]. In the subsequent morning hours, high-priced AMoD services are more competitive in attracting customers as more idle vehicles are available. Based on the quantitative analysis, policies are recommended for the government and service operators. (C) 2022 The Author(s). Published by Elsevier B.V.

AB Planning a practical three-dimensional (3-D) flight path for unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) is a key challenge for the follow-up management and decision making in disaster emergency response. The ideal flight path is expected to balance the total flight path length and the terrain threat, to shorten the flight time and reduce the possibility of collision. However, in the traditional methods, the tradeoff between these concerns is difficult to achieve, and practical constraints are lacking in the optimized objective functions, which leads to inaccurate modeling. In addition, the traditional methods based on gradient optimization lack an accurate optimization capability in the complex multimodal objective space, resulting in a nonoptimal path. Thus, in this article, an accurate UAV 3-D path planning approach in accordance with an enhanced multiobjective swarm intelligence algorithm is proposed (APPMS). In the APPMS method, the path planning mission is converted into a multiobjective optimization task with multiple constraints, and the objectives based on the total flight path length and degree of terrain threat are simultaneously optimized. In addition, to obtain the optimal UAV 3-D flight path, an accurate swarm intelligence search approach based on improved ant colony optimization is introduced, which can improve the global and local search capabilities by using the preferred search direction and random neighborhood search mechanism. The effectiveness of the proposed APPMS method was demonstrated in three groups of simulated experiments with different degrees of terrain threat, and a real-data experiment with 3-D terrain data from an actual emergency situation.

AB In this paper, a novel prediction-discrepancy based on innovative particle filter (PDIPF) is proposed to solve the unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) positioning problem in the presence of the global positioning system (GPS) spoofing attack, supposing that the GPS spoofing effects are in the form of unknown but bounded errors. To cope with the GPS spoofing attacks as unknown sudden changes of system state variables, the compensation of the GPS spoofing effects is adaptively done in two basic parts of PDIPF algorithm including particle weighting and covariance matrix adaption. In addition, a theorem is developed which verifies that the output estimation error is upper bounded by a given probability with the help of the adapted covariance matrix. Besides, the particle weight calculation in PDIPF is done with respect to the prediction discrepancy of generated particles from the GPS measurements. The proposed PDIPF is used to decrease the effects of any GPS spoofing errors with different probability density functions and estimate true position of UAV in the presence of the GPS spoofing attacks. The algorithm is applied to the inertial navigation system/GPS/Loran-C integration systems. Simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed PDIPF algorithm in terms of accuracy and redundancy.

AB LiDAR sensors are extensively used in autonomous vehicles and their optimal use is a critical concern. In this paper, we propose an embedded software architecture for multiple LiDAR sensors, i.e., a fusion system that acts as an embedded system for processing data from multiple LiDAR sensors. The fusion system software comprises multiple clients and a single server. The client and server are connected through inter-process communication. Multiple clients create processes to process the data from each LiDAR sensor via a multiprocessing method. Our approach involves a scheduling method for efficient multiprocessing. The server uses multithreading to optimize the internal functions. For internal communication within the fusion system, multiple clients and a single server are connected using the socket method. In sequential processing, the response time increases in proportion to the number of connected LiDAR sensors. By contrast, in the proposed software architecture, the response time decreases in inverse proportion to the number of LiDAR sensors. As LiDAR sensors become increasingly popular in the field of autonomous driving, the results of this study can be expected to make a substantial contribution to technology development in this domain.

AB Because the signals of global positioning system (GPS) satellites are susceptible to obstructions in urban environment with many high buildings around, the number of GPS useful satellites is usually less than six. In this case, the receiver autonomous integrity monitoring (RAIM) method cannot exclude faulty satellite. In order to improve the performance of RAIM method and obtain the reliable positioning results with five satellites, the series of receiver clock bias (RCB) is regarded as one useful satellite and used to aid RAIM method. From the point of nonlinear series, a grey-Markov model for predicting the RCB series based on grey theory and Markov chain is presented. And then the model is used for aiding RAIM method in order to exclude faulty satellite. Experimental results demonstrate that the prediction model is fit for predicting the RCB series, and with the clock-based RAIM method the faulty satellite can be correctly excluded and the positioning precision of GPS receiver can be improved for the case where there are only five useful satellites.

AB Autonomous pollination robots have received significant attention in recent years. It is expected that these robots will assist farmers in pollinating plants effectively. Despite employing various pollination methods, delivering pollen autonomously and precisely to pistils (the reproductive organs of flowers) remains a challenge. This is due to the small size of pistils, as well as difficulty in their rotation and orientation identification. Under this background, we present a novel method for detecting the orientation and area of the rotated pistil, known as PSTL_Orient, which we combine with servoing techniques and flower detection to develop an autonomous pollination robot. The experimental results demonstrate the superiority of our proposed PSTL_Orient in comparison to existing state-of-the-art methods in the detection of the orientation and rotation of pistil anchors. Additionally, the proposed pollination robot can achieve a 91.08 % accuracy in detecting flowers and an 86.19 % success rate in pollinating the small pistils of forsythia flowers. By being mounted on a ground vehicle, the proposed robotic arm system can help farmers in practical large-scale greenhouse environments.

AB Automated Shuttle buses (ASB) are considered an essential and sustainable direction for the future application of autonomous driving technology in public transportation. As the driver's role gradually decreases and disappears, the Human-Machine Interface (HMI) for information exchange and communication between users and ASB takes a more prominent role and progressively becomes a hotspot in research. However, the unpredictability and complexity of autonomous driving, an exceptionally fast-growing technology, have hindered its future study. This work first reviewed related literature in three categories: internal, external, and station of the ASB. Secondly, the importance of systemic and speculative design is affirmed by exploring existing HMI designs for ASB. Thirdly, the concepts for ASB resulting from three parallel workshops were analyzed. Finally, online questionnaires and interviews completed the critical reflection and discussion. The results show that the introduction of tools and methods related to systemic and speculative design into the design process of the HMI for ASB may help designers to think critically about the future uncertainty of ASB and to deal with the complexity of the system.

AB This paper presents a novel scheme of demagnetization monitoring and life extending control for traction systems driven by permanent magnet synchronous motors (PMSMs). Firstly, the offline training is carried to evaluate fatigue damage of insulated gate bipolar transistors (IGBTs) under different flux loss based on first-principle modeling. Then an optimal control law can be extracted by turning down the power distribution factor of the demagnetizing PMSM until all damages of IGBTs turn to balance. Next, the similarity based empirical modeling is employed to online estimate remaining flux of PMSMs, which is used to update the power distribution factor by referring the optimal control law for the health-oriented autonomous control. The proposed strategy can be demonstrated by a case study of traction drive system coupled with dual-PMSMs. Compared with traditional control strategy, the results show that the novel scheme can not only guarantee traction performance but also extend remaining useful life (RUL) of the system after suffering demagnetization fault.

AB The relative motion control for the unmanned quadrotors autonomous shipboard landings is investi-gated in this study. The shipboard landing missions are divided into two phases including the position approaching phase and the vertical landing phase. Relative pose kinematics and dynamics are modeled in the quadrotor's body-fixed frame, where the kinematic couplings resulted from the difference between ship's centre of mass and desired landing site and the unknown external disturbances of two vehicles are considered in the modeling and control design. In the position approaching phase, because of the under-actuated property of quadrotors, the adaptive backstepping technique is combined with an auxiliary system and a command filter to develop the guidance and control laws. Subsequently, the relative altitude-attitude controller is designed for the vertical landing phase. Stability analysis shows that the position approaching errors in the first phase and the landing errors in the second phase ultimately converge to small neighborhoods of zero, and numerical simulation validates the effectiveness of the proposed strategy.

AB In this article, we present a monocular visual reactive navigation system capable of navigating at high speeds, without GPS, in unknown complex cluttered environments. The system, called R-ADVANCE (Rapid Adaptive Prediction for Vision-based Autonomous Navigation, Control, and Evasion), consists of a set of biologically inspired visual perception and reactive control algorithms that provide low-computation reactive obstacle avoidance while navigating at high speeds in search of a goal object. These algorithms, along with basic planning, and augmented with low-precision visual odometry, were implemented on a micro unmanned aerial vehicle and tested in a number of challenging environments. While each of the individual algorithmic and hardware elements has been previously studied in limited environments, this work is the first time that these novel components have been integrated and flight-tested. To achieve fast flight, an NVIDIA Tegra TK1 was used as the main processor, allowing us to parallelize the system to process 1280 x 720 video streams at 40 fps, reaching flight speeds up to 19 m/s (approximate to 68 km/h) or 42 mph.

AB Semantic bird-eye-view (BEV) grid map is a straightforward data representation for semantic environment perception. It can be conveniently integrated with downstream tasks, such as motion planning, trajectory prediction, etc. Most existing methods of semantic BEV grid-map generation adopt supervised learning, which requires extensive hand-labeled ground truth to achieve acceptable results. However, there exist limited datasets with hand-labeled ground truth for semantic BEV grid map generation, which hinders the research progress in this field. Moreover, manually labeling images is tedious and labor-intensive, and it is difficult to manually produce a semantic BEV map given a front-view image. To provide a solution to this problem, we propose a novel semi-supervised network to generate semantic BEV grid maps. Our network is end-to-end, which takes as input an image from a vehicle-mounted front-view monocular camera, and directly outputs the semantic BEV grid map. We evaluate our network on a public dataset. The experimental results demonstrate the superiority of our network over the state-of-the-arts.

AB Nowadays, multirotors are playing important roles in abundant types of missions. During these missions, entering confined and narrow tunnels that are barely accessible to humans is desirable yet extremely challenging for multirotors. The restricted space and significant ego airflow disturbances induce control issues at both fast and slow flight speeds, meanwhile bringing about problems in state estimation and perception. Thus, a smooth trajectory at the proper speed is necessary for safe tunnel flights. To address these challenges, in this letter, a complete autonomous aerial system that can achieve smooth flights through tunnels with dimensions as narrow as to 0.6 m is presented. The system contains a motion planner that generates smooth mini-jerk trajectories along the tunnel center lines, which are extracted according to the map and Euclidean distance field (EDF), and its practical speed range is obtained through computational fluid dynamics (CFD) and flight data analyses. Extensive flight experiments on the quadrotor are conducted inside multiple narrow tunnels to validate the planning framework as well as the robustness of the whole system.

AB The Autonomous Underwater Vehicle (AUV) is usually equipped with multiple sensors, such as an inertial navigation system (INS), ultra-short baseline system (USBL), and Doppler velocity log (DVL), to achieve autonomous navigation. Multi-source information fusion is the key to realizing high-precision underwater navigation and positioning. To solve the problem, a fusion scheme based on factor graph optimization (FGO) is proposed. Due to multiple iterations and joint optimization of historical data, FGO could usually show a better performance than the traditional Kalman filter. In addition, considering that USBL and DVL are usually heavily influenced by the environment, outliers are often present. A robust integrated navigation algorithm based on a maximum correntropy criterion and FGO scheme is proposed. The proposed algorithm solves the problem of multi-sensor fusion and non-Gaussian noise. Numerical simulations and field tests demonstrate that the proposed FGO scheme shows a better performance and robustness than the traditional Kalman filter. Compared with the traditional Kalman filtering, the positioning accuracy is improved by 5.3%, 9.1%, and 5.1% in the east, north, and height directions. It can realize a more accurate navigation and positioning of underwater multi-sensors.

AB Automated transit networks (ATN) are subject to intensive research. Many models of ATN systems have been analyzed and many features have been studied. However, most paper use a single benchmark, test selected features, and use author's own measures for the network itself and its operation. This paper presents several benchmarks of ATN systems and their characteristics being the subject of research. We show that general measures are rarely used to assess network size, its regularity, demand structure, and traffic parameters. We also show that scalar variables are not used for comparison, which makes them doubtful. We propose a set of measures for several of the most important features of ATN systems. They are generally based on scalars elaborated using square measures and entropy. Such a set of measures may be used to compare various benchmarks and their performance.

AB In this article, an autonomous robotic fish is designed for underwater operations like object detection and tracking along with collision avoidance. The computer-aided design model for prototype robotic fish is designed using the Solid Works (R) software to export an stereolithography (STL) file to MakerBot, a 3D printer, to manufacture the parts of robotic fish using polylactic acid thermoplastic polymer. The precise maneuverability of the robotic fish is achieved by the propulsion of a caudal fin. The oscillation of the caudal fin is controlled by a servomotor. A combination of visual and ultrasonic sensors is used to track the position and distance of the desired object with respect to the fish and also to avoid the obstacles. The robotic fish has the ability to detect an object up to a distance of 90 cm at normal exposure conditions. A computational fluid dynamics analysis is conducted to analyze the fluid hydrodynamics (flow rate of water and pressure) around the hull of a robotic fish and the drag force acting on it. A series of experimental results have shown the effectiveness of the designed underwater robotic fish.

AB Understanding human merging behavior patterns at freeway on-ramps is important for assisting the decisions of autonomous driving. This study develops a primitive-based framework to identify the driving patterns during merging processes and reveal the evolutionary mechanism in congested traffic flow at freeway on-ramps. The Nonhomogeneous Hidden Markov Model is introduced to decompose the merging processes into primitives containing semantic information. Then, the time-series K-means clustering is used to group these primitives with variable-length time series into interpretable merging behavior patterns. Different from traditional state segmentation methods (e.g. Hidden Markov Model), the model proposed in this study considers the dependence of transition probability on exogenous variables, thereby revealing the influence of covariates on the evolution of driving patterns. This approach is evaluated in the merging area at a freeway on-ramp using the INTERACTION dataset. Results demonstrate that the proposed approach can deeply analzye the complicated merging processes and provide interpretable merging behavior patterns as well as the evolutionary mechanism. The findings in this study can be useful for designing and improving the merging decision-making of autonomous vehicles.

AB Semantic segmentation plays a critical role in scene understanding for self-driving vehicles. A line of efforts has proven that global context matters in urban scene segmentation due to massive scale changes. However, we find that existing methods suffer from local ambiguities when dissipating continuous local context, i.e. scrambling to a huge receptive field of global cues by coarse pooling. To this end, this paper proposes a new Context Aggregation Module (CAM) that consists of two primary components: context encoding using no coarse pooling but encoder-decoders with appropriate sampling scales and gated fusion that extends gate attention mechanism to balance different-scale context during feature fusion. Weeding out coarse pooling and applying the encoder-decoder inherits the merits of exploring global context while avoiding the drawback of losing local contextual continuity. We then construct a Context Aggregation Network (CANet) and conduct extensive evaluations on challenging autonomous driving benchmarks of Cityscapes, CamVid and BDD100K. Consistently improved results evidence the effectiveness. Notably, we attain competitive mIoU 82.7% on Cityscapes and optimal mIoU 80.5% on CamVid.

AB Many militaries envision a technologically advanced future with a strong innovative capability and therefore invest in so-called innovation hubs focused on experimenting with new modes of operation with drones and (semi-)autonomous vehicles. However, there appears to be a discrepancy between these military visions and soldiers' lived experiences on the ground. This article presents an ethnographic study of one innovation hub: the Robots and Autonomous Systems unit of the Dutch Army. Examining this unit through an analytical framework of sociotechnical imaginaries and expectations, we first outline how "innovation" and "military" imaginaries are integrated so that technological innovation is presented as necessary, desirable, and inevitable for military futures. Second, we explore soldiers' experiences of military innovation, identifying friction between the strategic and operational levels. At the strategic level, soldiers experience meaning and purpose in their work whereas, at the operational level, soldiers' expectations, practices, and experiences do not align with the "innovative military future" imaginary, resulting in disillusionment. With this empirical study, we contribute to a better understanding of how large-scale visions of technological "progress" play out in military practice.

AB The future trajectory prediction of heterogeneous traffic-agents for autonomous vehicles in mixed traffic scene is of great significance for safe and reliable driving. Thus, we propose the Multi-View Adaptive Hierarchical Spatial Graph Convolution Network (MVHGN) to predict the future trajectories of heterogeneous traffic-agents. Firstly, multiple logical correlations are obtained based on the time series data of traffic-agents and a multi-view logical network is constructed. The multi-view logical feature extraction is realized based on the graph convolution module. Then, combining the multi-view logical features and the adaptive spatial topology network, the logical-physical features at the micro level are mined through the graph convolution module; based on the logical-physical features at the micro level and the regional clustering network at the macro level, the global logical-physical features are obtained. Finally, the model predicts the future trajectories of traffic-agents based on the encoder-decoder structure of the GRU. For the Apolloscape trajectory data set, the performance of our proposed method MVHGN is better than that of the comparison models.

AB To implement an unmanned autonomous obstacle avoidance system, this paper presents a novel distance estimation method based on an improved spherical optical flow algorithm using a panoramic sensor. The method uses a panoramic sensor to extend the field of view. This paper investigates a panoramic sensor imaging model and the optical flow field and then derives the improved spherical optical flow algorithm. Based on the spatial structure characteristics of the panoramic image, the proposed spherical optical flow smoothness constraint is introduced into the spherical optical flow field. Combing the smoothness constraint with the spherical optical flow equation, the spherical optical flow value is solved for. The motion model of a panoramic sensor, which is the distribution of spherical optical flow field with the condition that the panoramic sensor has self-translational motion, is developed. According to the spherical optical flow value, the motion model and the velocity of the panoramic sensor, a distance estimation mechanism and a computational method are proposed for an Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV). Simulations show that the method can extract the distance information effectively and offers good accuracy. (c) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Navigation technology is one of the most important challenges in the applications of autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) which navigate in the complex undersea environment. The ability of localizing a robot and accurately mapping its surroundings simultaneously, namely the simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) problem, is a key prerequisite of truly autonomous robots. In this paper, a modified-FastSLAM algorithm is proposed and used in the navigation for our C-Ranger research platform, an open-frame AUV. A mechanical scanning imaging sonar is chosen as the active sensor for the AUV. The modified-FastSLAM implements the update relying on the on-board sensors of C-Ranger. On the other hand, the algorithm employs the data association which combines the single particle maximum likelihood method with modified negative evidence method, and uses the rank-based resampling to overcome the particle depletion problem. In order to verify the feasibility of the proposed methods, both simulation experiments and sea trials for C-Ranger are conducted. The experimental results show the modified-FastSLAM employed for the navigation of the C-Ranger AUV is much more effective and accurate compared with the traditional methods.

AB Self-driving cars are going to be the main future mode of transportation. However, such systems like, any other cyber-physical system, are vulnerable to attack vectors and uncertainties. As a response, resilience-based approaches are being developed. However, the approaches lack a sound attack model that recognizes the attack vectors and vulnerabilities such a system would have and that does a proper severity analysis of such attacks. Moreover, the existing attack models are too generic. Currently, the domain lacks such specific work pertaining to self-driving cars. Given the technology and architecture of self-driving cars, the field requires a domain-specific attack model. This paper gives a review of the attack models and proposes a domain-specific attack model for self-driving cars. The proposed attack model, severity-based analytical attack model for resilience (SAAMR), provides attack analysis based on existing models. Also, a domain-based severity score for attacks is calculated. Further, the attacks are classified using the decision-tree method and predictions of the type of attacks are given using long short-term memory network.

AB ADAS and autonomous technologies in vehicles become more and more complex, which increases development time and expenses. This paper presents a new real-time ADAS multisensory validation system, which can speed up the development and implementation processes while lowering its cost. The proposed test system integrates a high-quality 3D CARLA simulator with a real-time-based automation platform. We present system experimental verifications on several types of sensors and testing system architectures. The first, open-loop experiment explains the real-time capabilities of the system based on the Mobileye 6 camera sensor detections. The second experiment runs a real-time closed-loop test of a lane-keeping algorithm (LKA) based on the Mobileye 6 line detection. The last experiment presents a simulation of Velodyne VLP-16 lidar, which runs a free space detection algorithm. Simulated lidar output is compared with the real lidar performance. We show that the platform generates reproducible results and allows closed-loop operation which, combined with a real-time collection of event information, promises good scalability toward complex ADAS or autonomous functionalities testing.

AB The adaptive nature of cyber physical systems (CPS) comes from the fact that they are deeply immersed in the physical environments that are inherently dynamic. CPS also have stringent requirements on real-time operation and safety that are fulfilled by rigorous model design and verification. In the real-time literature, adaptation is mostly limited to off-line modeling of well known and predicted transitions; but this is not appropriate for cyber physical systems as each transition can have unique and unknown characteristics. In the adaptive systems literature, adaptation solutions are silent about timely execution and about the underlying hardware possibilities that can potentially speed up execution. This paper presents a solution for designing adaptive cyber physical systems by using parametric models that are verified during the system execution (i.e., online), so that adaptation decisions are made based on the timing requirements of each particular adaptation event. Our approach allows the system to undergo timely adaptations that exploit the potential parallelism of the software and its execution over multicore processors. We exemplify the approach on a specific use case with autonomous vehicles communication, showing its applicability for situations that require time-bounded online adaptations.

AB Underwater glider (UG) is the only marine equipment in the field of ocean observation that can realize unmanned autonomous, all-weather and wide-area continuous 3-D observation. The rapid individualized design (RID) and full lifecycle management (FLM) make two difficulties to be solved in the industrialization development of UGs since the UG system involves interdisciplinary multiphysics and there exists multisource uncertainties in complex ocean environment. With the application of new information technologies in industry, the above problems can be effectively solved by the digital twin (DT)-driven methodology. In this article, an architecture of DT-driven RID and FLM for UGs is first put forward based on our previous theoretical research and technique development. Then, the proposed architecture of DT-driven methodology is researched in detail in terms of its digital modeling, design optimization, virtual verification and practical application. Finally, Petrel developed by China is introduced, and a typical preliminary application of DT-driven methodology is presented based on petrel to verify its feasibility. The architecture proposed in this article is also appropriate for other types of autonomous underwater vehicles.

DE Autonomous vehicle navigation; experience replay; explanations;
   reinforcement learning
AB Human environments are often regulated by explicit and complex rulesets. Integrating Reinforcement Learning (RL) agents into such environments motivates the development of learning mechanisms that perform well in rule-dense and exception-ridden environments such as autonomous driving on regulated roads. In this letter, we propose a method for organising experience by means of partitioning the experience buffer into clusters labelled on a per-explanation basis. We present discrete and continuous navigation environments compatible with modular rulesets and 9 learning tasks. For environments with explainable rulesets, we convert rule-based explanations into case-based explanations by allocating state-transitions into clusters labelled with explanations. This allows us to sample experiences in a curricular and task-oriented manner, focusing on the rarity, importance, and meaning of events. We label this concept Explanation-Awareness (XA). We perform XA experience replay (XAER) with intra and inter-cluster prioritisation, and introduce XA-compatible versions of DQN, TD3, and SAC. Performance is consistently superior with XA versions of those algorithms, compared to traditional Prioritised Experience Replay baselines, indicating that explanation engineering can he used in lieu of reward engineering for environments with explainable features.

AB The ability to recognize and identify terrain characteristics is an essential function required for many autonomous ground robots such as social robots, assistive robots, autonomous vehicles, and ground exploration robots. Recognizing and identifying terrain characteristics is challenging because similar terrains may have very different appearances (e.g., carpet comes in many colors), while terrains with very similar appearance may have very different physical properties (e.g., mulch versus dirt). In order to address the inherent ambiguity in vision-based terrain recognition and identification, we propose a multi-modal self-supervised learning technique that switches between audio features extracted from a microphone attached to the underside of a mobile platform and image features extracted by a camera on the platform to cluster terrain types. The terrain cluster labels are then used to train an image-based real-time CNN (Convolutional Neural Network) to predict terrain types changes. Through experiments, we demonstrate that the proposed self-supervised terrain type recognition method achieves over 80% accuracy, which greatly outperforms several baselines and suggests strong potential for assistive applications.

AB The automotive glazing projection display pertains to projecting information onto unique glazing materials in a car through projection equipment, a new direction of Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) in the intelligent cockpit. The core issue in glazing projection is determining what information should be projected onto the car's glazing and the area to which it should be projected. To address this issue, we conducted a focus group comprising 12 people. We distributed 1082 questionnaires to investigate future autonomous driving contexts, user information demands based on glazing projection, and regional preferences for displaying such information. We selected five contexts and nine high-rated features to design a driver-specific display interface. We conducted eye-movement experiments to investigate the effect of the projection interface on the driver's gaze behaviors under different display areas and subsequently modified the display areas. This study confirms the feasibility of the glazing projection display and provides theoretical support for HCI development in the intelligent cockpit.

AB Improving the reliability of nighttime pedestrian detection is a crucial challenge towards the design of robust autonomous systems. Not surprisingly, most pedestrian fatalities occur in low-illumination settings, thus emphasizing the need for new algorithmic advances. This work presents a novel pedestrian detection approach that makes a number of crucial modifications to the state-of-the-art YOLOV5-PANet architecture, in order to improve the reliability of features extracted from nighttime images. More specifically, the proposed architecture systematically incorporates powerful shuffle attention mechanisms and a transformer module to improve the feature learning pipeline. Instead of advocating the use of other sensing modalities that are better suited for nighttime detection, our approach relies only on conventional RGB cameras and is hence broadly applicable. Our empirical studies with nighttime pedestrian detection benchmarks show that with only minimal increase in model complexity, our approach provides significant improvements in detection efficacy over existing solutions. Finally, we explore the impact of post-hoc network pruning on the speed-accuracy trade-off of our approach and demonstrate that it is well suited for reduced memory/compute requirements.

AB Human experience is regarded as an indispensable part of artificial intelligence in the process of controlling or decision making for autonomous cargo ships. In this paper, a novel Deep Q-Network-based (DQN) approach is proposed, which performs satisfactorily in controlling a cargo ship automatically without any human experience. At the very beginning, we use the model of KRISO Very Large Crude Carrier (KVLCC2) to describe a cargo ship. To manipulate this ship has to conquer great inertia and relatively insufficient driving force. Subsequently, customary waterways, regulations, conventions are described with Artificial Potential Field and value-functions in DQN. Based on this, the artificial intelligence of planning and controlling a cargo ship can be obtained by undertaking sufficient training, which can control the ship directly, while avoiding collisions, keeping its position in the middle of the route as much as possible. In simulation experiments, it is demonstrated that such an approach performs better than manual works and other traditional methods in most conditions, which makes the proposed method a promising solution in improving the autonomy level of cargo ships.

AB The application of Doppler-based LIght Detection and Ranging (LIDAR) technology for determining track curvature and lateral irregularities, including alignment and gage variation, are investigated. The proposed method uses track measurements by two low-elevation, slightly tilted LIDAR sensors nominally pointed at the rail gage face on each track. The Doppler LIDAR lenses are installed with a slight forward angle to measure track speed in both longitudinal and lateral directions. The lateral speed measurements are processed for assessing the track gage and alignment variations, using a method that is based on the frequency bandwidth dissimilarities between the vehicle speed and track geometry irregularity. Using the results from an extensive series of tests with a body-mounted Doppler LIDAR system on-board a track geometry measurement railcar, the study indicates a close match between the LIDAR measurements and those made with existing sensors on-board the railcar. The field testing conducted during this study indicates that LIDAR sensors could provide a reliable, non-contact track monitoring instrument for field use in various weather and track conditions, potentially in a semi-autonomous or autonomous manner.

AB Powered parafoils are a kind of flexible winged vehicle. In order to realize safe and accurate homing of powered parafoils, a multiphase homing trajectory planning scheme is proposed according to their flight characteristics, and a new particle swarm optimization algorithm based on chaos searching (CPSO) is applied as a tool to optimize the designed homing path. Because it is hard to get the satisfied mechanism model, and moreover, there exist lots of disturbances in actual flight environments, traditional control methods cannot ensure the tracking accuracy. Therefore, ADRC controllers are applied to solve such problems. For ADRC, uncertain items of the model and external disturbances are estimated by extended state observer and compensated by real-time dynamic feedback. Simulation results show that the multiphase homing trajectory can fulfill the requirements of fixed-point and upwind landing. The designed ADRC controllers can efficiently overcome the internal and external disturbances and track the desired path rapidly and steadily. Compared with proportion integration differentiation (PID) controllers, ADRC controllers possess better robustness and anti-disturbance ability.

AB We present a leader-follower formation control algorithm based on replicator-mutator dynamics and complex Laplacian. The networked multi-agent system is composed of several multiple mobile autonomous agents keeping its formation. Replicator-mutator dynamics are used to reach consensus of the formation, to assure a faster convergence time for a leader-follower formation, and to avoid potential collisions between followers. First, we calculate the normalized Laplacian matrix of the associated communication graph and develop a consensus algorithm based on replicator-mutator dynamics. Then, we determine the complex Laplacian matrix for a particular planar formation. Finally, we obtain the position of the followers and we draw a geometric formation in a defined trajectory. The algorithm may modify the consensus agreement by modifying the mutation strength and the value of strategies frequency in geometric formations and avoiding potential collisions between followers. The proposed control algorithm maintains the formation geometric in any path in the complex plane and can be used with an unlimited number of vehicles without modifying the algorithm. Simulations are presented to illustrate the effectiveness of our formation control algorithm. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

ID EVOLUTION
AB This paper introduces a novel framework for the design of distributed agents that must complete externally generated tasks but also can volunteer to process tasks encountered by other agents. To reduce the computational and communication burden of coordination between agents to perfectly balance load around the network, the agents adjust their volunteering propensity asynchronously within a fictitious trading economy. This economy provides incentives for nontrivial levels of volunteering for remote tasks, and thus load is shared. Moreover, the combined effects of diminishing marginal returns and network topology lead to competitive equilibria that have task reallocations that are qualitatively similar to what is expected in a load-balancing system with explicit coordination between nodes. In the paper, topological and algorithmic conditions are given that ensure the existence and uniqueness of a competitive equilibrium. Additionally, a decentralized distributed gradient-ascent algorithm is given that is guaranteed to converge to this equilibrium while not causing any node to over-volunteer beyond its maximum task-processing rate. The framework is applied to an autonomous-air-vehicle example, and connections are drawn to classic studies of the evolution of cooperation in nature.

ID PRINCIPAL COMPONENT ANALYSIS
AB This paper presents a method for ascertaining the relevance of inputs in vision-based tasks by exploiting temporal coherence and predictability. In contrast to the tasks explored in many previous relevance experiments, the class of tasks examined in this study is one in which relevance is a time-varying function of the previous and current inputs, The method proposed in this paper dynamically allocates relevance to inputs by using expectations of their future values. As a model of the task is learned, the model is simultaneously extended to create task-specific predictions of the future values of inputs, Inputs that are not relevant, and therefore not accounted for in the model, will not be predicted accurately. These inputs can be de-emphasized, and, in rum, a new, improved, model of the task created, The techniques presented in this paper have been successfully applied to the vision-based autonomous control of a land vehicle, vision-based hand tracking in cluttered scenes, and the detection of faults in the plasma-etch step of semiconductor wafers, (C) 1997 Elsevier Science B.V.

AB We consider the target tracking problem on a sphere with topographic structure. For a given moving target on the unit sphere, we suggest a double-integrator autonomous system of multiple agents that track the given target under the topographic influence. Through this dynamic system, we can obtain a control design for target tracking on the sphere and the adapted topographic data provides an efficient agent trajectory. The topographic information, described as a form of friction in the double-integrator system, affects the velocity and acceleration of the target and agents. The target information required by the tracking agents consists of position, velocity, and acceleration. We can obtain practical rendezvous results when agents utilize only target position and velocity information. If the acceleration data of the target is accessible, we can get the complete rendezvous result using an additional control term in the form of the Coriolis force. We provide mathematically rigorous proofs for these results and present numerical experiments that can be visually confirmed.

AB Weakly electric fish can perform complex cognitive tasks based on extracting information from blurry electric images projected from their immediate environment onto their electro-sensitive skin. In particular they can be trained to recognize the intrinsic properties of objects such as their shape, size and electric nature. They do this by means of novel perceptual strategies that exploit the relations between the physics of a self-generated electric field, their body morphology and the ability to perform specific movement termed probing motor acts (PMAs). In this article we artificially reproduce and combine these PMAs to build an autonomous control strategy that allows an artificial electric sensor to find electrically contrasted objects, and to orbit around them based on a minimum set of measurements and simple reactive feedback control laws of the probe's motion. The approach does not require any simulation models and could be implemented on an autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) equipped with artificial electric sense. The AUV has only to satisfy certain simple geometric properties, such as bi-laterally (left/right) symmetrical electrodes and possess a reasonably high aspect (length/width) ratio.

AB Several studies have demonstrated positive effects of advanced parking assistants (APA) on driver comfort and parking performance. However, learning effects while handling the APA system and possible transfer effects on manual parking have not yet been discussed. In this study, N = 18 subjects parked parallel in a test area (26 manoeuvres) and in real traffic (nine manoeuvres). One half of the manoeuvres was done without a parking assistant, one half with a semi-autonomous APA system that utilises automatic steering. The APA system did not control speed by accelerating or braking. Parking performance and glance behaviour in selected manoeuvres were analysed as well as drivers' judgements and observations by an in-vehicle experimenter. Consistent with earlier studies, the APA system facilitates parking. Learning effects particularly appear in glance behaviour and maximum velocity during the first parking motion as also do the number of errors while handling the system. Using the APA system repeatedly might influence parking without an assistant as well: the more manoeuvres are carried out with the APA system, the more often the drivers look into the display during manual parking. The implications of this study are discussed.

AB Development of robust dynamical systems and networks such as autonomous, aircraft systems capable of accomplishing complex missions faces challenges due to the dynamically evolving uncertainties coming from model uncertainties, necessity to operate in a hostile cluttered urban environment, and the distributed and dynamic nature of the communication and computation resources. Model-based robust design is difficult because of the complexity of the hybrid dynamic models including continuous vehicle dynamics, the discrete models of computations and communications, and the size of the problem. We will overview recent advances in methodology and tools to model, analyze, and design robust autonomous aerospace systems operating in uncertain environment, with stress on efficient uncertainty quantification and robust design using the case studies of the mission including model-based target tracking and search, and trajectory planning in uncertain urban environment. To show that the methodology is generally applicable to uncertain dynamical systems, we will also show examples of application of the new methods to efficient uncertainty quantification of energy usage in buildings, and stability assessment of interconnected power networks.

ID ROBUST LOCALIZATION
AB High-definition (HD) maps are becoming increasingly important for autonomous vehicles and advanced driver assistance systems (ADAS), as they provide detailed and accurate information about the road environment. Vision localization using HD maps can improve accuracy, but maps can become outdated. Image perception can be useful for HD map change detection. However, achieving robust and high-precision alignment between images and HD maps is challenging in varying environmental conditions. In addition, evaluating alignment in the absence of ground truth data is inconvenient. This article proposes a trajectory interpolation-based method for reconstructing lane markings from images to detect road changes when compared with the HD grid map. Images and HD maps are registered using a distance transform and cross-entropy-based optimization. The article also proposes a metric based on intersection over union for evaluating alignment accuracy. Experiments were conducted using a third-party-collected campus dataset and the Argoverse2 open-source dataset to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed methods in detecting road changes and achieving high-precision image and HD map fusion.

AB Assurance cases are used to communicate and assess confidence in critical system properties, e.g., safety and security. Historically, assurance cases have been manually created documents, validated by engineers through lengthy and error-prone processes. Recently, system assurance practitioners have begun adopting model-based approaches to improve the efficiency and quality of system assurance activities. This becomes increasingly important, for example, to ensure the safety of robotics and autonomous systems (RASs), as they are adopted into society. Such systems can be highly complex, and so it is a challenge to manage the development life-cycle and improve efficiency, including coordination of validation activities, and change impact analysis in interconnected system assurance artifacts. However, adopting model-based approaches require skills in the model management languages, which system assurance practitioners may not be acquainted with. In this article, we contribute an automated validation framework for the model-based assurance cases, which promotes the usage of a constrained natural language (CNL), that can be automatically transformed and executed against engineering models involved in assurance case development. We apply our approach to a case study based on an autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV).

AB During last decade the scientific research on Unmanned Aerial Vehicless (UAVs) increased spectacularly and led to the design of multiple types of aerial platforms. The major challenge today is the development of autonomously operating aerial agents capable of completing missions independently of human interaction. To this extent, visual sensing techniques have been integrated in the control pipeline of the UAVs in order to enhance their navigation and guidance skills. The aim of this article is to present a comprehensive literature review on vision based applications for UAVs focusing mainly on current developments and trends. These applications are sorted in different categories according to the research topics among various research groups. More specifically vision based position-attitude control, pose estimation and mapping, obstacle detection as well as target tracking are the identified components towards autonomous agents. Aerial platforms could reach greater level of autonomy by integrating all these technologies onboard. Additionally, throughout this article the concept of fusion multiple sensors is highlighted, while an overview on the challenges addressed and future trends in autonomous agent development will be also provided.

AB When moving in generic indoor environments, robotic platforms generally rely solely on information provided by onboard sensors to determine their position and orientation. However, the lack of absolute references often leads to the introduction of severe drifts in estimates computed, making autonomous operations really hard to accomplish. This paper proposes a solution to alleviate the impact of the above issues by combining two vision-based pose estimation techniques working on relative and absolute coordinate systems, respectively. In particular, the unknown ground features in the images that are captured by the vertical camera of a mobile platform are processed by a vision-based odometry algorithm, which is capable of estimating the relative frame-to-frame movements. Then, errors accumulated in the above step are corrected using artificial markers displaced at known positions in the environment. The markers are framed from time to time, which allows the robot to maintain the drifts bounded by additionally providing it with the navigation commands needed for autonomous flight. Accuracy and robustness of the designed technique are demonstrated using an off-the-shelf quadrotor via extensive experimental tests.

AB Inspection of ship hulls and marine structures using autonomous underwater vehicles has emerged as a unique and challenging application of robotics. The problem poses rich questions in physical design and operation, perception and navigation, and planning, driven by difficulties arising from the acoustic environment, poor water quality and the highly complex structures to be inspected. In this paper, we develop and apply algorithms for the central navigation and planning problems on ship hulls. These divide into two classes, suitable for the open, forward parts of a typical monohull, and for the complex areas around the shafting, propellers and rudders. On the open hull, we have integrated acoustic and visual mapping processes to achieve closed-loop control relative to features such as weld-lines and biofouling. In the complex area, we implemented new large-scale planning routines so as to achieve full imaging coverage of all the structures, at a high resolution. We demonstrate our approaches in recent operations on naval ships.

ID SLIDING MODE CONTROL; DESIGN
AB Steer-by-wire (SBW) systems are considered as one of the most significant innovations among the technologies developed for advanced driver-assistance systems and autonomous vehicles. The main control challenge in a SBW system is to follow the steering commands in the face of parametric uncertainties and external disturbances; crucially, perturbations in inertial parameters and damping forces give rise to state-dependent uncertainties, which cannot be bounded a priori by a constant. However, the state-of-the-art control methods of SBW system rely on a priori bounded uncertainties, and thus, become inapplicable when state-dependent dynamics become unknown. This work, to the best of the authors' knowledge for the first time, proposes an adaptive control framework that can tackle the state-dependent uncertainties and external disturbances in a typical SBW system without any a priori knowledge of their structures and of their bounds. The stability of the closed-loop system is studied analytically via uniformly ultimately bounded notion and the effectiveness of the proposed solution is verified via simulations against the state-of-the-art solution.

AB Image recognition and classification have been widely used for research in computer vision systems. This paper aims to implement a new strategy called Wiener-Granger Causality theory for classifying natural scenery images. This strategy is based on self-content images extracted using a Content-Based Image Retrieval (CBIR) methodology (to obtain different texture features); later, a Genetic Algorithm (GA) is implemented to select the most relevant natural elements from the images which share similar causality patterns. The proposed method is comprised of a sequential feature extraction stage, a time series conformation task, a causality estimation phase, causality feature selection throughout the GA implementation (using the classification process into the fitness function). A classification stage was implemented and 700 images of natural scenery were used for validating the results. Tested in the distribution system implementation, the technical efficiency of the developed system is 100% and 96% for resubstitution and cross-validation methodologies, respectively. This proposal could help with recognizing natural scenarios in the navigation of an autonomous car or possibly a drone, being an important element in the safety of autonomous vehicles navigation.

AB Traffic signs play a crucial role in regulating traffic and facilitating cautious driving. Automatic traffic sign recognition is one of the key tasks in autonomous driving. Accuracy in the classification of traffic signs is therefore very important for the navigation of a vehicle. Here, a reliable and robust convolutional neural network (CNN) is presented for classifying these signs. The proposed classifier is a weighted multi-CNN trained with a novel methodology. It achieves a near state-of-the-art recognition rate of 99.59% when tested on the German traffic sign recognition benchmark dataset. Compared to the existing classifiers, the proposed one is a low-complexity network that recognises a test image in 10ms when running on an NVIDIA 980 Ti GPU system. The results demonstrate its suitability and reliability in high-speed driving scenarios.

AB Experts and practitioners have worked long and hard toward achieving functionally capable robots. While numerous areas of progress have been achieved, ethical control of unmanned systems meeting legal requirements has been elusive and problematic. Common conclusions that treat ethical robots as an always-amoral philosophical conundrum requiring undemon-strated morality-based artificial intelligence are simply not sensible or repeatable. Patterning after successful practice by human teams shows that precise mission definition and task execution using well-defined, syntactically valid vocabularies is a necessary first step. Addition of operational constraints enables humans to place limits on robot activities, even when operating at a distance under gapped communications. Semantic validation can then be provided by a Mission Execution Ontology to confirm that no logical or legal contradictions are present in mission orders. Thorough simulation, testing, and certification of qualified robot responses are necessary to build human authority and trust when directing ethical robot operations at a distance. Together these capabilities can provide safeguards for autonomous robots possessing the potential for lethal force. This approach appears to have broad usefulness for both civil and military application of unmanned systems at sea.

ID ODOMETRY
AB This paper studies the autonomous docking between an Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) and a Mobile Platform (MP) based on UWB and vision sensors. To solve this problem, an integrated estimation and control scheme is proposed, which is divided into three phases: hovering, approaching and landing. In the hovering phase, the velocity of the MP and relative position between the MP and UAV are estimated by using geometric tools and Cayley-Menger determinant based on ultra-wideband distance measurements; in the approaching phase, a recursive least squares optimization algorithm with a forgetting factor is proposed, which uses distance, displacement and MP's velocity to estimate the relative position between the UAV and MP. With the estimated relative position, UAV can approach MP until reaching a distance such that MP is within the field of view of UAV; in the landing phase, the UWB measurement value and visual perception attitude are integrated with the UAV on-board naviga-tion sensor of the UAV to perform the precision landing. Simulation and experiment results verify the effectiveness and feasibility of the proposed integrated navigation scheme.(c) 2022 The Franklin Institute. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB Perceiving humans in the context of Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS) often relies On multiple cameras or expensive LiDAR sensors. In this work, we present a new cost-effective vision-based method that perceives humans' locations in 3D and their body orientation from a single image. We address the challenges related to the ill-posed monocular 3D tasks by proposing a neural network architecture that predicts confidence intervals in contrast to point estimates. Our neural network estimates human 3D body locations and their orientation with a measure of uncertainty. Our proposed solution (i) is privacy-safe, (ii) works with any fixed or moving cameras, and (iii) does not rely on ground plane estimation. We demonstrate the performance of our method with respect to three applications: locating humans in 3D, detecting social interactions, and verifying the compliance of recent safety measures due to the COVID-19 outbreak. We show that it is passible to rethink the concept of "social distancing" as a form of social interaction in contrast to a simple location-based rule. We publicly share the source code towards an open science mission.

AB Underwater autonomous navigation technology is a key link for AUV to complete various underwater missions successfully. In this paper, we have proposed a position correction model based on hybrid gated RNN, which does not need to establish a motion model like typical navigation algorithms, to avoid modeling errors in the navigation process. According to the low update rate of GPS and the slip data caused by the coverage of GPS antenna during the process of floating and diving, it does not meet the actual requirements of navigation and control. We proposed to use improved EKF and iSAM as the output of the training dataset to filter out GPS slips, then the position error is corrected at the same time. First, the normalized input sequence is fed to the two-layer hybrid gated RNN with BiLSTM output mode as sequence and LSTM output mode as last, and then the processed data is fed to the two fully connected layers with a dropout layer added in the middle. After that, the output of the position correction model can be obtained through the regression layer. To confirm the validity of the proposed model, we conducted sea trials to compare the proposed model with EKF and iSAM. The experimental results prove that the proposed position correction model performs better than EKF and iSAM in all aspects, and the correction model trained with iSAM is more effective than that trained with EKF.

AB A dynamic and flexible manufacturing environment presents many challenges in the movement of autonomous mobile robots (AMRs), leading to delays due to the complexity of operations while negotiating even a simple route. Therefore, an understanding of rules related to AMR movement is important both from a utility perspective as well as a safety perspective. Our survey from literature and industry has revealed a gap in methodology to test rules related to AMR movement in a factory environment. Testing purely through simulations would not able to capture the nuances of shop floor interactions whereas physical testing alone would be incredibly time-consuming and potentially hazardous. This work presents a new methodology that can make use of observations of AMR behaviour on selected cases on the shop floor and build up the fidelity of those simulations based on observations. This paper presents the development of a Highway Code for AMRs, development of simulation models for an ideal AMR (based on the rules from the Highway Code), and physical testing of real AMR in an industrial environment. Finally, a behavioural comparison of an ideal AMR and a real AMR in five scenarios (taken from the shop floor of an industrial partner) is presented. This work could enable informed decisions regarding the implementation of AMRs through identification of any adverse behaviours which could then be mitigated either through improvements on the AMR or through establishing shop floor protocols that reduce the potential impact of these behaviours.

AB Advances in technological innovation have been deployed to support autonomous or semi-autonomous vehicles in many industries. A question that remains unanswered is why very little progress has been made in remote pilotage over the past 15 years. This paper draws together theories from innovation management and the high reliability organisation literatures to shed light on this question. Using a case study of two Australian ports, we examine a business case for remote pilotage demonstrating that despite positive cost benefit models, ambiguities in benefits exist throughout the ecosystem. The discussion sheds light on unique challenges that port executives face where it is necessary to simultaneously develop a strategy to: (1) manage the internal innovation process, and (2) manage the external consequences of the innovation by mobilising allies, managing opponents, and converting those who are indifferent to the innovation. The main contribution of this paper is to show that any assessment of the innovation challenge facing remote pilotage and enhanced navigational assistance requires the maritime industry to ask new questions not previously considered.

ID SIMULTANEOUS LOCALIZATION
AB In this paper we address the problem of autonomous navigation in very large unstructured environments. A new hybrid metric map (HYMM) structure is presented that combines feature maps with other metric representations in a consistent manner. The global feature map is partitioned into a set of connected local triangular regions (LTRs), which provide a reference for a detailed multidimensional description of the environment. The HYMM framework permits the combination of efficient feature-based simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) algorithms for localization with, for example, occupancy grid maps for tasks such as obstacle avoidance, path planning or data association. This fusion of feature and grid maps has several complementary properties;for example, grid maps can assist data association and can facilitate the extraction and incorporation of new landmarks as they become identified from multiple vantage points. In this paper we also present a path-planning technique that efficiently maintains the estimated cost of traversing each LTR. The consistency of the SLAM algorithm is investigated with the introduction of exploration techniques to guarantee a certain measure of performance for the estimation process. Experimental results in outdoor environments are presented to demonstrate the performance of the algorithms proposed.

ID PHOTON; RANGE
AB Imaging systems with temporal resolution play a vital role in a diverse range of scientific, industrial, and consumer applications, e.g., fluorescent lifetime imaging in microscopy and time-of-flight (ToF) depth sensing in autonomous vehicles. In recent years, single-photon avalanche diode (SPAD) arrays with picosecond timing capabilities have emerged as a key technology driving these systems forward. Here we report a high-speed 3D imaging system enabled by a state-of-the-art SPAD sensor used in a hybrid imaging mode that can performmulti-event histogramming. The hybrid imaging modality alternates between photon counting and timing frames at rates exceeding 1000 frames per second, enabling guided upscaling of depth data from a native resolution of 64 x 32 to 256 x 128. The combination of hardware and processing allows us to demonstrate high-speed ToF 3D imaging in outdoor conditions and with low latency. The results indicate potential in a range of applications where real-time, high throughput data are necessary. One such example is improving the accuracy and speed of situational awareness in autonomous systems and robotics.

AB This work reports a master-slave separate parallel intelligent mobile robot for the fully autonomous transportation of pallets in the smart factory logistics. This separate parallel intelligent mobile robot consists of two independent sub robots, one master robot and one slave robot. It is similar to two forks of the forklift, but the slave robot does not have any physical or mechanical connection with the master robot. A compact driving unit was designed and used to ensure access to the narrow free entry under the pallets. It was also possible for the mobile robot to perform a synchronous pallet lifting action. In order to ensure the consistency and synchronization of the motions of the two sub robots, high-gain observer was used to synchronize the moving speed, the lifting speed and the relative position. Compared with the traditional forklift AGV (Automated Guided Vehicle), the mobile robot has the advantages of more compact structure, higher expandability and safety. It can move flexibly and take zero-radius turn. Therefore, the intelligent mobile robot is quite suitable for the standardized logistics factory with small working space.

DE Rough-Terrain Mobile Robots; 3D Perception; Terrain Traversability;
   Unevenness Point Descriptor
AB In recent years, the use of imaging sensors that produce a three-dimensional representation of the environment has become an efficient solution to increase the degree of perception of autonomous mobile robots. Accurate and dense 3D point clouds can be generated from traditional stereo systems and laser scanners or from the new generation of RGB-D cameras, representing a versatile, reliable and cost-effective solution that is rapidly gaining interest within the robotics community. For autonomous mobile robots, it is critical to assess the traversability of the surrounding environment, especially when driving across natural terrain. In this paper, a novel approach to detect traversable and non-traversable regions of the environment from a depth image is presented that could enhance mobility and safety through integration with localization, control and planning methods.
   The proposed algorithm is based on the analysis of the normal vector of a surface obtained through Principal Component Analysis and it leads to the definition of a novel, so defined, Unevenness Point Descriptor. Experimental results, obtained with vehicles operating in indoor and outdoor environments, are presented to validate this approach.

AB The demands of a growing population and a developing global economy will require an increase in agricultural yield of 70% over the next 30 years. However, achieving this goal is only possible with a sustainable intensification of agricultural systems. Spraying drones are one of the available technologies that could help meet this goal. Presently, the use of spraying drones is limited by both the legal framework and the lack of scientific knowledge about the drift they generate compared to conventional terrestrial spraying platforms. However, the flexibility that spraying drones provide, their characteristic vertical spraying, and the downwash airflow produced by the rotors might reduce drift. This study aimed to compare the drift generated by a conventional orchard sprayer to that generated by a spraying drone in a commercial superhigh-density olive orchard. Trials to assess the sedimented drift of both spraying platforms were conducted in the South Iberian Peninsula in 2022. Our results show that the drone sprayer required less than half the distance to sediment 90% of the sprayed volume compared to a conventional mist blower.

AB As autonomous ships become the future trend for maritime transportation, it is of importance to develop intelligent autonomous navigation systems to ensure the navigation safety of ships. Among the three core components (sensing, planning and control modules) of the system, an accurate detection of target ships' navigation information is critical. Within a typical maritime environment, the existence of sensor noises as well as the influences generated by varying environment conditions largely limit the reliability of using a single sensor for environment awareness. It is therefore vital to use multiple sensors together with a multi-sensor data fusion technology to improve the detection performance. In this paper, a fuzzy logic-based multi-sensor data fusion algorithm for moving target ships detection has been proposed and designed using both AIS and radar information. A two-stage fuzzy logic association method has been particularly developed and integrated with Kalman filtering to achieve a computationally efficient performance. The effectiveness of the proposed algorithm has been tested and validated in simulations where multiple target ships are transiting with complex movements.

ID TRACKING
AB Occupancy grid is a popular environment model that is widely applied for autonomous navigation of mobile robots. This model encodes obstacle information into the grid cells as a reference of the space state. However, when navigating on roads, the planning module of an autonomous vehicle needs to have semantic understanding of the scene, especially concerning the accessibility of the driving space. This paper presents a grid-based evidential approach for modeling semantic road space by taking advantage of a prior map that contains lane-level information. Road rules are encoded in the grid for semantic understanding. Our approach focuses on dealing with the localization uncertainty, which is a key issue, while parsing information from the prior map. Readings from an exteroceptive sensor are as well integrated in the grid to provide real-time obstacle information. All the information is managed in an evidential framework based on Dempster-Shafer theory. Real road results are reported with qualitative evaluation and quantitative analysis of the constructed grids to show the performance and the behavior of the method for real-time application.

AB In this letter, we present the design of a miniature (100 mm) autonomous underwater robot that is low-cost ($ 100), easy to manufacture, and highly maneuverable. A key aspect of the robot design that makes this possible is the use of low-cost magnet-in-coil actuators, which have a small profile and minimal sealing requirements. This allows us to create a robot with multiple flapping fin propulsors that independently control robot motions in surge, heave, and yaw. We present several results on the robot, including 1) quantified open-loop swimming characteristics; 2) autonomous behaviors using a pressure sensor and an inertial measurement unit (IMU) to achieve controlled swimming of prescribed trajectories; 3) feedback from an optic sensor to enable homing to a light source. The robot is designed to form the basis for underwater swarm robotics testbeds, where low cost and ease of manufacture are critical, and three-dimensional (3-D) maneuverability allows testing complex coordination inspired by natural fish schools. Individually, miniature and low-cost underwater robots can also provide a platform for the study of 3-D autonomy and marine vehicle dynamics in educational and resource-constrained settings.

AB Lidar, a technology at the heart of autonomous driving and robotic mobility, performs 3D imaging of a complex scene by measuring the time of flight of returning light pulses. Many technological challenges, including enhancement of the observation field of view (FoV), acceleration of the imaging frame rate, improvement of the ambiguity range, reduction of fabrication cost, and component size, must be simultaneously addressed so that lidar technology reaches the performance needed to strongly impact the global market. We propose an innovative solution to address the problem of wide FoV and extended unambiguous range using an acousto-optic modulator that rapidly scans a large-area metasurface deflector. We further exploit a multiplexing illumination technique traditionally deployed in the context of telecommunication theory to extend the ambiguity range and to drastically improve the signal-to-noise ratio of the measured signal. Compacting our metasurface-scanning lidar system to chip-scale dimension would open new and exciting perspectives, eventually relevant to the autonomous vehicles and robotic industries.

AB Trajectory prediction in urban scenarios is critical for high-level automated driving systems. However, this task is associated with many challenges. On the one hand, a scene typically includes different traffic participants, such as vehicles, buses, pedestrians, and cyclists, which may behave differently. On the other hand, an agent may have multiple plausible future trajectories based on complex interactions with the other agents. To address these challenges, we propose a multiagent, multimodal trajectory prediction method based on neural networks, which encodes past motion information, group context, and road context to estimate future trajectories by learning from the interactions of the agents. At inference time, multiple realistic future trajectories are predicted. Our solution is based on an encoder-decoder architecture that can handle a variable number of traffic participants. It uses vectors of agent features as inputs rather than images, and it is designed to run on a physical autonomous car, addressing the real-time operation requirements. We evaluate the method using the inD dataset for each type of traffic participant and provide information about its integration into an actual self-driving car.

AB When performing a specific task, a Multi-Agent System (MAS) not only needs to coordinate the whole formation but also needs to coordinate the dynamic relationship among all the agents, which means judging and adjusting their positions in the formation according to their location, velocity, surrounding obstacles and other information to accomplish specific tasks. This paper devises an integral separation feedback method for a single-agent control with a developed robot motion model; then, an enhanced strategy incorporating the dynamic information of the leader robot is proposed for further improvement. On this basis, a method of combining second-order formation control with path planning is proposed for multiple-agents following control, which uses the system dynamic of one agent and the Laplacian matrix to generate the consensus protocol. Due to a second-order consensus, the agents exchange information according to a pre-specified communication digraph and keep in a certain following formation. Moreover, an improved path planning method using an artificial potential field is developed to guide the MAS to reach the destination and avoid collisions. The effectiveness of the proposed approach is verified with simulation results in different scenarios.

AB Maritime Autonomous Surface Ships (MASS) receive enormous attention in recent years. Compared to an individual MASS, greater efficiency and operational capability can be realized by cooperative MASS. An increasing number of researches propose different methods for cooperative multiple ships, such as cooperative collision avoidance, formation control, etc. However, in existing research, hydrodynamic effects, such as the ship-ship and confined water effects, are ignored when designing motion controllers for ships. In fact, in the cooperative scenarios, MASS are close to each other, where hydrodynamic effects significantly impact ship motions. Neglecting hydrodynamic interactions may lead to control failures. Thus, this paper aims at connecting the research on cooperative control of multi-MASS and hydrodynamic effects. Systematic reviews on existing literature on cooperative MASS are carried out in this work. Subsequently, mentioned cooperative scenarios are analyzed, and the parameters involving hydrodynamic interactions are collected. Then, existing research on hydrodynamic effects related to the cooperative scenarios is reviewed to summarize the impacts of hydrodynamics on cooperative motion control of MASS.

DT Article
DE UAV network; swarm intelligent; flocking control; energy
AB The collaboration of multiple unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) has stimulated the emergence of a novel wireless network paradigm named UAV network. UAV network, compared with uncoordinated UAV systems could provide wider coverage, better monitoring, and understanding of the interested area, and smarter decision-making. However, realizing the full potential of UAV network in dynamic environments poses great challenges in topology/flocking control, energy conservation, and quality of service guarantee. In this backdrop, this paper proposes a swarm intelligence-inspired autonomous flocking control scheme for UAV networks. First, based on the concept of intelligent emergence of swarm agents, a swarm intelligence-inspired multi-layer flocking control scheme is built for the flocking control problem. Second, an integrated sensing and communication method is put forward to regulate how a UAV can calculate its distances to its neighbors and its deflection angle. Finally, a series of experiments are conducted on our simulator developed on OMNeT++ and the flocking prototype to evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed scheme. The simulation and experimental results have shown that the proposed scheme could realize efficient flocking control with low energy consumption and satisfied the quality of service.

AB This paper is concerned with the problem of using deep reinforcement learning methods to enable safe navigation of UAVs in unknown large-scale environments containing a large number of obstacles. The ability of UAV to navigate autonomously is a precondition for performing disaster rescue and logistics deliveries. In this paper, the perception-constrained navigation of UAV is modeled as a partially observable Markov decision process (POMDP), and a fast recurrent stochastic valued gradient algorithm based on the actot-critic framework is designed for online solution. Compared with traditional SLAM-based and reactive obstacle avoidance-based approaches, the proposed navigation method can map the raw sensing information into navigation signals, and the learned policy deployed to the UAV can avoid the memory occupation and computational consumption required for real-time map building. Through experiments in a newly designed simulation environment, it is demonstrated that the proposed algorithm can enable the UAV to navigate safely in unknown cluttered large-scale environments and outperform the state-of-the-art DRL algorithm in terms of performance.

AB This paper presents an output-feedback control method for cooperative diving of multiple homogenous under-actuated saucer-type autonomous underwater gliders (AUGs) subjected to unmeasured velocities, model uncertainties, as well as unknown environmental disturbances. A robust cooperative diving controller is constructed by using a modular back-stepping design method. First, a fuzzy observer combined with a low-frequency learning scheme is presented to identify the unknown AUG dynamics as well as to estimate the unmeasured velocities. Second, a commanded guidance law is designed based on the observed velocities and a vertical line-of-sight guidance scheme at the kinematic level, and fuzzy dynamic control law is developed at the kinetic level. Finally, a non-periodic path update law based on an event-triggered mechanism is designed to reduce the communication frequency. By using the cascade theory, the stability of the closed-loop system is analyzed. The simulation results are provided to show the effectiveness of the proposed output-feedback control approach for saucer-type AUGs.

AB Autonomous vehicles need to understand their surroundings geometrically and semantically to plan and act appropriately in the real world. Panoptic segmentation of LiDAR scans provides a description of the surroundings by unifying semantic and instance segmentation. It is usually solved in a bottom-up manner, consisting of two steps. Predicting the semantic class for each 3D point, using this information to filter out "stuff " points, and cluster "thing " points to obtain instance segmentation. This clustering is a post-processing step with associated hyperparameters, which usually do not adapt to instances of different sizes or different datasets. To this end, we propose MaskPLS, an approach to perform panoptic segmentation of LiDAR scans in an end-to-end manner by predicting a set of non-overlapping binary masks and semantic classes, fully avoiding the clustering step. As a result, each mask represents a single instance belonging to a "thing " class or a "stuff " class. Experiments on SemanticKITTI show that the end-to-end learnable mask generation leads to superior performance compared to state-of-the-art heuristic approaches.

AB UAVs can be deployed in many scenarios to provide various types of services via 6G edge communication. In these scenarios, it is necessary to obtain the position of the UAVs in a timely and accurate manner to avoid UAV collisions. In this paper, we consider improved passive localization algorithms aimed at reducing convergence time and adapting to extreme conditions. For the sake of reducing the complexity of signals and ensuring the reliability of receiving processes, we reconsidered the angle between arrival signals as the feature in positioning. Then, according to the characteristics of the positioning process, we draw on the cyclical process of the iterative greedy algorithm to construct the coding, destruction, and reorganization process to guide the movement of the UAV. Moreover, an improved Metropolis criterion is added to prevent falling into the local optimal solution. Finally, the proposed algorithm is verified in the simulation results. The results show that the algorithm can achieve precise positioning and excellent track planning within a small number of iterations, and it reduces the amount of information carried by the signal and convergence time compared with the traditional method.

ID ROAD NETWORK MODEL
AB High-definition (HD) map is one of the key assets for autonomous driving, which supports various modules such as behavior prediction and motion planning of autonomous vehicles by providing accurate and rich geometric and semantic information. However, at present, the scalability and computa-tional efficiency of HD map generation cannot meet the needs of highly automated driving. Specifically, efficiently obtaining the optimal parameters of the road's reference path is still an open problem. In this paper, we propose a fast and robust path reconstruction method, which compresses the dense points of a reference line into sparse parameters with minimal loss of information. The reconstructed path consists of segmented linear curvature contours, which are straight lines, circular arcs, and clothoids. The optimum result is obtained through linear programming for short-path reconstruction, and for the long paths, a fast progressive reconstruction approach is used to find a feasible solution. Experimental results on both randomly generated data and the GPS-collected trajectories show that com-pared with existing methods, the proposed method can generate more accurate path reconstruction, and the computational time is greatly reduced.

AB Intelligent mobile robots that can move independently were laid out in the real world around 100 years ago during the second world war after advancements in computer science. Since then, mobile robot research has transformed robotics and information engineering. For example, robots were crucial in military applications, especially in teleoperations, when they emerged during the second world war era. Furthermore, after the implementation of artificial intelligence (AI) in robotics, they became autonomous or more intelligent. Currently, mobile robots have been implemented in many applications like defense, security, freight, pattern recognition, medical treatment, mail delivery, infrastructure inspection and developments, passenger travel, and many more because they are more intelligent nowadays with artificial intelligence technology. To study the developments of mobile robots, we have studied an extensive literature survey of the last 50 years. In this article, we discuss a complete century of mobile robotics research, major sensors used in robotics, some major applications of mobile robots, and their impact on our lives and in applied engineering.

AB Material handling systems are progressively becoming robotized in e-commerce distribution centers. Mobile material handling solutions cut labor costs, work 24/7, and improve system efficiency. These and many other merits make them a perfect fit for e-commerce fulfillment centers. This paper presents analytical models for Last-Mile-Delivery and Meetin-Aisle mobile solutions and compares them with traditional manual order picking. We study the potential business cases of these two warehousing mobile solutions through estimating the number of required robots and pickers under different throughput rates, pick cycle, picking area size, and storage policy scenarios. We evaluate the performance of the models through multiple analyses. A simulation model is built to evaluate the accuracy of the proposed models. Then, we design a collection of experiments to study the performance of the proposed models. The results unveil that the Last-Mile-Delivery better fits the cases with higher throughput rates, while Meet-in-Aisle is a suitable solution for facilities with large picking areas and low picks per cycle.

AB The navigation is a substantial issue in the field of robotics. Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) is a principle for many autonomous navigation applications, particularly in the Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) denied environments. Many SLAM methods made substantial contributions to improve its accuracy, cost, and efficiency. Still, it is a considerable challenge to manage robust SLAM, and there exist several attempts to find better estimation algorithms for it. In this research, we proposed a novel Bayesian filtering based Airborne SLAM structure for the first time in the literature. We also presented the mathematical background of the algorithm, and the SLAM model of an autonomous aerial vehicle. Simulation results emphasize that the new Airborne SLAM performance with the exact flow of particles using for recursive state estimations superior to other approaches emerged before, in terms of accuracy and speed of convergence. Nevertheless, its computational complexity may cause real-time application concerns, particularly in high-dimensional state spaces. However, in Airborne SLAM, it can be preferred in the measurement environments that use low uncertainty sensors because it gives more successful results by eliminating the problem of degeneration seen in the particle filter structure.

ID VISION
AB The AI-in-the-loop system (AIS) has been widely used in various autonomous decision and control systems, such as computing vision, autonomous vehicle, and collision avoidance systems. AIS generates and updates control strategies through learning algorithms, which make the control behaviors non-deterministic and bring about the test oracle problem in AIS testing procedure. The traditional system mainly concerns about properties of safety, reliability, and real-time, while AIS concerns more about the correctness, robustness, and stiffness of system. To perform an AIS testing with the existing testing techniques according to the testing requirements, this paper presents an extendable framework of AI-in-the-loop system testing by exploring the key steps involved in the testing procedure, named ExtendAIST, which contributes to define the execution steps of ExtendAIST and design space of testing techniques. Furthermore, the ExtendAIST framework provides three concerns for AIS testing, which include: (a) the extension points; (b) sub-extension points; and (c) existing techniques commonly present in each point. Therefore, testers can obtain the testing strategy using existing techniques directly for corresponding testing requirements or extend more techniques based on these extension points.

AB This paper explores radar methods to measure the coordinates (distance and height) of objects on or beside a road. Knowledge of these parameters is essential in the development of autonomous or semi-autonomous cars, as well as to improve driving safety. It is shown that the height is best found by trilateration from sensors at multiple locations on a vehicle. The novelty of the work consists in the formulation of the problem and in its solution using a low-THz radar trilateration approach. The expressions obtained allow calculating the coordinates of targets using a number of different methods of radar trilateration. The influence of the system parameters on the accuracy of measurement using different methods of trilateration has been analyzed. The assumptions made were verified by the experimental system based on a 300-GHz ultra-wideband radar. Experimental results are in good agreement with theoretical calculations; they confirmed the practicality of obtaining high-accuracy height measurements on distributed targets such as pedestrians. The physical basis of the techniques developed would also allow the plan position of a target to be found using the same approach.

ID CLASSIFICATION; SHOTS
AB One of the most important aesthetic concepts in autonomous Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) cinematography is the UAV/Camera Motion Type (CMT), describing the desired UAV trajectory relative to a (still or moving) physical target/subject being filmed. Usually, for the drone to autonomously execute such a CMT and capture the desired shot in footage, the 3D states (positions/poses within the world) of both the UAV/camera and the target are required as input. However, the target's 3D state is not typically known in non-staged settings. This paper proposes a novel framework for reformulating each desired CMT as a set of requirements that interrelate 2D visual information, UAV trajectory and camera orientation. Then, a set of CMT-specific vision-driven Proportional-Integral-Derivative (PID) UAV controllers can be implemented, by exploiting the above requirements to form suitable error signals. Such signals drive continuous adjustments to instant UAV motion parameters, separately at each captured video frame/time instance. The only inputs required for computing each error value are the current 2D pixel coordinates of the target's on-frame bounding box, detectable by an independent, off-the-shelf, real-time, deep neural 2D object detector/tracker vision subsystem. Importantly, neither UAV nor target 3D states are required ever to be known or estimated, while no depth maps, target 3D models or camera intrinsic parameters are necessary. The method was implemented and successfully evaluated in a robotics simulator, by properly reformulating a set of standard, formalized UAV CMTs.

ID STRATEGIES
AB This brief considers the target guarding problem (TGP) with a single pursuer P, a single evader E, and a stationary target T. The goal of P is to prevent E from capturing T, by intercepting E as far away from T as possible. An optimal solution to this problem, referred to as a command to optimal interception point (COIP), was proposed recently. This guidance law requires the positions of the agents involved. Typically, aerial sensors, such as GPS, used for obtaining these data may not always perform robustly on the field, thereby reducing the autonomy of the vehicles. The computational complexity of the expressions in the COIP law also makes it difficult for a real-time implementation. Here, the TGP is revisited and the optimal solution is reformulated to expressions that are suitable for autonomous systems with ranging sensors mounted on them. These expressions also allow for seamless real-time implementation in robotic hardware. The reformulation enables the optimal solution to be coded as a lookup table requiring minimal memory to further increase the speed of computations. An experimental setup with mobile robots is then used to validate the claims. The case of T lying in E's dominance region is considered a lost game for P. However, this is true only if E plays optimally. If E plays suboptimally P stands a chance to win the game. This case, which has not been analyzed earlier, is also discussed in this brief, and an optimal strategy for P is presented.

AB To achieve fully autonomous operation for Unmanned Aerial Systems (UAS) it is necessary to integrate multiple and heterogeneous technical solutions (e.g., control-based methods, computer vision methods, automated planning, coordination algorithms, etc.). The combination of such methods in an operational system is a technical challenge that requires efficient architectural solutions. In a robotic engineering context, where productivity is important, it is also important to minimize the effort for the development of new systems. As a response to these needs, this paper presents Aerostack, an open-source software framework for the development of aerial robotic systems. This framework facilitates the creation of UAS by providing a set of reusable components specialized in functional tasks of aerial robotics (trajectory planning, self localization, etc.) together with an integration method in a multi-layered cognitive architecture based on five layers: reactive, executive, deliberative, reflective and social. Compared to other software frameworks for UAS, Aerostack can provide higher degrees of autonomy and it is more versatile to be applied to different types of hardware (aerial platforms and sensors) and different types of missions (e.g. multi robot swarm systems). Aerostack has been validated during four years (since February 2013) by its successful use on many research projects, international competitions and public exhibitions. As a representative example of system development, this paper also presents how Aerostack was used to develop a system for a (fictional) fully autonomous indoors search and rescue mission.

AB An RTK-DGPS (Real Time Kinematic Differential Global Positioning System) based autonomous field navigation system including automated headland turns was developed to provide a method for crop row mapping combining machine vision, and to evaluate the benefits of a behaviour based reactive layer in a hybrid deliberate systems architecture. Two experiments were performed at the same time: following of pre-planned paths reconstructed from crop row positions based on RTK-DGPS and crop row mapping by combining vision-based row detection with RTK-DGPS information. The standard deviation, mean, minimum and maximum lateral error of the robot vehicle while following a straight path on the field with RTK-DGPS at a speed of 0.3 m s(-1) were respectively 1.6, 0.1, -4.5 and 3.4 cm. The standard deviation, mean, minimum and maximum of the heading error were 0.008, 0.000, -0.022 and 0.023 rad. The point-in-polygon algorithm proved to be a suitable method for detection in which part of the field the actuator position coordinates or the field of view of the camera are located. A smooth headland path that connected to the subsequent path along the crop was generated in realtime using a spline based algorithm. The hybrid deliberate software architecture with a behaviour based reactive layer allowed a convenient evaluation of the robot performance. Results from the field experiments showed that the implement can be guided along a defined path with cm precision using an autonomous robot navigating in a field. (C) 2011 IAgrE.

AB Information technology and personalized demands are driving the transportation system from passive transportation to active service provision. Autonomous transportation systems (ATSs) are resultantly emerging. A strongly related system architecture can effectively support the planning, construction, and operation of ATS. The current research on the relationship between architectures focuses on the definition of elements and the description of interfaces; however, insufficient research has examined the mapping relationship of the architectural elements. Therefore, to construct a set of architecture systems with explicit mapping relationships, we proposed an information flow (IF) extraction method based on data flow (DF) text to realize automated mapping between logical DF and physical IF. First, to better describe the ATS, we deconstructed the system with service as the basic unit, introduced the structure and constituent elements of the logical and physical architecture, and summarized the mapping principles of the architectural elements. Next, we extracted the DF set based on flow attributes and implemented the vectorization of the DF text. Then, we obtained the similarity of the DFs through text semantic analysis and completed the identification of similar DFs. Finally, to realize the independent construction of IF, we designed a graph-based DF aggregation method to complete the automated mapping of architectural elements. Experimental results showed that the construction method of IF proposed in this article met the requirements of ATS architecture and could effectively support the design and construction of the ATS architecture system.

AB In this article, a real-time road-Object Detection and Tracking (LR_ODT) method for autonomous driving is proposed. This method is based on the fusion of lidar and radar measurement data, where they are installed on the ego car, and a customized Unscented Kalman Filter is employed for their data fusion. The merits of both devices are combined using the proposed fusion approach to precisely provide both pose and velocity information for objects moving in roads around the ego car. Unlike other detection and tracking approaches, the balanced treatment of both pose estimation accuracy and its real-time performance is the main contribution in this work. The proposed technique is implemented using the high-performance language C++ and utilizes highly optimized math and optimization libraries for best real-time performance. Simulation studies have been carried out to evaluate the performance of the LR_ODT for tracking bicycles, cars, and pedestrians. Moreover, the performance of the Unscented Kalman Filter fusion is compared to that of the Extended Kalman Filter fusion showing its superiority. The Unscented Kalman Filter has outperformed the Extended Kalman Filter on all test cases and all the state variable levels (-24% average Root Mean Squared Error). The employed fusion technique shows how outstanding is the improvement in tracking performance compared to the use of a single device (-29% Root Mean Squared Error with lidar and -38% Root Mean Squared Error with radar).

ID OBSTACLE AVOIDANCE
AB Path-keeping requires unmanned surface vehicles (USVs) to follow a planned path in autonomous navigation. It is essential for USVs to carry out autonomous tasks such as collecting various data of water quality and surrounding terrain for exploration and protection of water environments. However, due to obstacle avoidance and other factors such as wind, water waves, and dynamics of USVs, USVs usually deviate from the original planned path during autonomous navigation. This paper proposes a novel path-keeping algorithm based on the artificial potential field method (PK-APF) for USVs. To minimize the deviation between the actual path and the original planned path, the vertical distance and the virtual foot points of the current position of USVs to the original path (a line connecting the previous navigation point and the next navigation point) are calculated. When the vertical distance is larger than a threshold, we regard the vertical foot point as a virtual goal point to guide the USVs to navigate the original path in real-time to achieve high-precision path-keeping. Obstacle avoidance is simulated in the MATLAB and Virtual RobotX (VRX) simulators, and the influence of wind and water waves is considered in VRX. Experiments are conducted in typical scenarios and results show that PK-APF outperforms the traditional APF by at least 22%. The work provides an important basis for real-life environments. Substantial further work is planned for applying the method on a physical USV.

AB In state-of-the-art deep learning for object recognition, Softmax and Sigmoid layers are most commonly employed as the predictor outputs. Such layers often produce overconfidence predictions rather than proper probabilistic scores, which can thus harm the decision-making of 'critical' perception systems applied in autonomous driving and robotics. Given this, we propose a probabilistic approach based on distributions calculated out of the Logit layer scores of pre-trained networks which are then used to constitute new decision layers based on Maximum Likelihood (ML) and Maximum a-Posteriori (MAP) inference. We demonstrate that the hereafter called ML and MAP layers are more suitable for probabilistic interpretations than Softmax and Sigmoid-based predictions for object recognition. We explore distinct sensor modalities via RGB images and LiDARs (RV: range-view) data from the KITTI and Lyft Level-5 datasets, where our approach shows promising performance compared to the usual Softmax and Sigmoid layers, with the benefit of enabling interpretable probabilistic predictions. Another advantage of the approach introduced in this paper is that the so-called ML and MAP layers can be implemented in existing trained networks, that is, the approach benefits from the output of the Logit layer of pre-trained networks. Thus, there is no need to carry out a new training phase since the ML and MAP layers are used in the test/prediction phase. The Classification results are presented using reliability diagrams, while detection results are illustrated using precision-recall curves.

AB Robotic Information Gathering (RIG) is a foundational research topic that answers how a robot (team) collects informative data to efficiently build an accurate model of an unknown target function under robot embodiment constraints. RIG has many applications, including but not limited to autonomous exploration and mapping, 3D reconstruction or inspection, search and rescue, and environmental monitoring. A RIG system relies on a probabilistic model's prediction uncertainty to identify critical areas for informative data collection. Gaussian processes (GPs) with stationary kernels have been widely adopted for spatial modeling. However, real-world spatial data is typically non-stationary-different locations do not have the same degree of variability. As a result, the prediction uncertainty does not accurately reveal prediction error, limiting the success of RIG algorithms. We propose a family of non-stationary kernels named Attentive Kernel (AK), which is simple and robust and can extend any existing kernel to a non-stationary one. We evaluate the new kernel in elevation mapping tasks, where AK provides better accuracy and uncertainty quantification over the commonly used stationary kernels and the leading non-stationary kernels. The improved uncertainty quantification guides the downstream informative planner to collect more valuable data around the high-error area, further increasing prediction accuracy. A field experiment demonstrates that the proposed method can guide an Autonomous Surface Vehicle (ASV) to prioritize data collection in locations with significant spatial variations, enabling the model to characterize salient environmental features.

AB Constant detection and monitoring of archaeological sites and objects have always been an important national goal for many countries. The early identification of changes is crucial to preventive conservation. Archaeologists have always considered using service drones to automate collecting data on and below the ground surface of archaeological sites, with cost and technical barriers being the main hurdles against the wide-scale deployment. Advances in thermal imaging, depth imaging, drones, and artificial intelligence have driven the cost down and improved the quality and volume of data collected and processed. This paper proposes an end-to-end framework for archaeological sites detection and monitoring using autonomous service drones. We mount RGB, depth, and thermal cameras on an autonomous drone for low-altitude data acquisition. To align and aggregate collected images, we propose two-stage multimodal depth-to-RGB and thermal-to-RGB mosaicking algorithms. We then apply detection algorithms to the stitched images to identify change regions and design a user interface to monitor these regions over time. Our results show we can create overlays of aligned thermal and depth data on RGB mosaics of archaeological sites. We tested our change detection algorithm and found it has a root mean square error of 0.04. To validate the proposed framework, we tested our thermal image stitching pipeline against state-of-the-art commercial software. We cost-effectively replicated its functionality while adding a new depth-based modality and created a user interface for temporally monitoring changes in multimodal views of archaeological sites.

AB Treating potential polluted water sources is urgent and challenging, especially for natural water sources. Numerous research groups focus on either smart water monitoring or new adsorbent. However, either aspect alone is insufficient for complex nature water source treatment. Here, integrating the state-of-art machine learning technique, a sustainable silk-based bioadsorbent, and wireless Internet of Things, an integrated automated drone-delivery solar driven onsite water monitoring & treatment system (WMTS) for the contaminated nature water sources is developed. In short, the embedded sensors and microprogrammed control unit capture and upload the real-time monitoring data to the cloud server for data analysis and optimized treatment strategy. Meanwhile, a grid map system based on the satellite remote sensing images directs the minimum number of WMTS units to cover the entire polluted region. Finally, unmanned aerial vehicles provide autonomous dispatch, operation, and maintenance, especially in hard-to-reach sites. Overall, this work offers a general, sustainable, energy-efficient, and closed-loop solution toward efficiently alerting and on-site treating nature water source contamination.

AB Estimating motion from visual cameras has become a promising art in the area of autonomous navigation and constant efforts are being made toward improving the accuracy of these estimates. In this paper, an improvement in the visual odometry algorithm is proposed that takes cues from both the forward and backward motion estimates. An error is formulated based on the consistency which measures the difference between the forward and backward motion. This error is used in a feedback mechanism to improve the triangulated 3D point estimates, thereby improving the pose estimate. Additionally, a novel means to incorporate information from multiple stereo camera setups has been devised to improve the pose estimate. The proposed scheme of joint forward-backward VO with multiple cameras and feedback mechanism (JFBVO-FM) is validated on two publicly available datasets having different environmental conditions and camera motion, that is, KITTI and EuRoC Micro Aerial Vehicle (MAV) datasets. The results are analyzed both qualitatively and quantitatively, and the proposed scheme is found to perform better as compared to the state-of-the-art methods in most of the sequences.

AB The cornerstone to achieve the development of autonomous ground driving with the lowest possible risk of collision in real traffic environments is themovement estimation obstacle. Predicting trajectories of multiple obstacles in dynamic traffic scenarios is a major challenge, especially when different types of obstacles such as vehicles and pedestrians are involved. According to the issues mentioned, in this work a novel method based on Bayesian dynamic networks is proposed to infer the paths of interest objects (IO). Environmental information is obtained through stereo video, the direction vectors of multiple obstacles are computed and the trajectories with the highest probability of occurrence and the possibility of collision are highlighted. The proposed approach was evaluated using test environments considering different road layouts and multiple obstacles in real-world traffic scenarios. A comparison of the results obtained against the ground truth of the paths taken by each detected IO is performed. According to experimental results, the proposed method obtains a prediction rate of 75% for the change of direction taking into consideration the risk of collision. The importance of the proposal is that it does not obviate the risk of collision in contrast with related work.

ID FAULT-TOLERANCE
AB Neural Network (NN) accelerators are essential in many emerging applications e.g., autonomous systems in making mission-critical decisions, health-care solutions to assist with diagnoses, etc. Any soft or hard failure during operation can potentially have catastrophic consequences in many of these applications. For instance, inaccurate classification during object recognition and tracking in autonomous vehicles can lead to crashes and subsequent injuries to the passengers. Therefore, testing Neural Network accelerators to ensure reliability and integrity of the underlying hardware is a crucial task to ensure the functionality, especially the ones that are used in mission-critical applications. Conventional functional, stuck-at and delay tests are not sufficient to characterize the ML systems since they face new test and validation challenges. This paper is aimed to provide a perspective on new test requirements and design for test techniques to cover ML features and detect various type of faults in NN accelerator. We discuss First-In-First-Out (FIFO) and Scratchpad based neural network hardware accelerators and propose test methods to detect the faults as well as fault location in different modules of the accelerator including MAC unit, Activation function module, and Processing Element (PE) registers.

AB This paper presents the kinematics of a planar multibody vehicle which is aimed at the exploration, data collection, non-destructive testing and general autonomous navigation and operations in confined environments such as pipelines. The robot is made of several identical modules hinged by passive revolute joints. Every module is actuated with four active revolute joints and can be regarded as a parallel mechanism on a mobile platform. The proposed kinematics allows to overcome the nonholonomic kinematic constraint, which characterizes typical wheeled robots, resulting into a higher number of degrees of freedom and therefore augmented actuation inputs. Singularities in the kinematics of the modules are analytically identified. We present the dimensional synthesis of the length of the arms obtained as the solution of an optimization problem with respect to a suitable dexterity index. Simulation results illustrate a kinematic control path following inside pipes. Critical scenarios such as 135 degrees elbows and concentric restriction are explored. Path following shows the kinematic capability of deployment of the robot for autonomous operations in pipelines, with feedback implemented by on-board sensors.

AB The UAV is emerging as one of the greatest technology developments for rapid network coverage provisioning at affordable cost. The aim of this paper is to outsource network coverage of a specific area according to a desired quality of service requirement and to enable various entities in the network to have intelligence to make autonomous decisions using blockchain and auction mechanisms. In this regard, by considering a multiple-UAV network where each UAV is associated to its own controlling operator, this paper addresses two major challenges: the selection of the UAV for the desired quality of network coverage and the development of a distributed and autonomous real-time monitoring framework for the enforcement of service level agreement (SLA). For a suitable UAV selection, we employ a reputation-based auction mechanism to model the interaction between the business agent who is interested in outsourcing the network coverage and the UAV operators serving in closeby areas. In addition, theoretical analysis is performed to show that the proposed auction mechanism attains a dominant strategy equilibrium. For the SLA enforcement and trust model, we propose a permissioned blockchain architecture considering Support Vector Machine (SVM) for real-time autonomous and distributed monitoring of UAV service. In particular, smart contract features of the blockchain are invoked for enforcing the SLA terms of payment and penalty, and for quantifying the UAV service reputation. Simulation results confirm the accuracy of theoretical analysis and efficacy of the proposed model.

AB Mobile autonomous platforms are revolutionizing our understanding of ocean systems by providing a solution for the four-dimensional observation problem faced in the ocean. The sensors commonly used in autonomous platforms, however, leave a large gap in our observations of the food chain between primary producers and large predators. Echosounders have the potential to fill this gap. Here, we present details of a new, commercially available quantitative scientific echosounder specifically designed to meet the challenges of deployment in autonomous platforms, including those of relatively low power and small size, while providing data comparable to systems deployed from ships. We detail the integration into a Slocum glider of this echosounder and both upward- and downward-looking transducers to provide guidance for those considering similar efforts. We also identify key features of the system and the challenges that must be overcome to ensure collection of high-quality data. The most important feature of the integrated glider is that it carries instruments capable of providing depth profiles of bio-optical and environmental variables that are synoptic with the echosounder data. On a dive-by-dive basis, we can use these co-located data to quantify relationships between the acoustic, bio-optical, and environmental data. A field deployment of the echosounder-equipped glider elucidated the processes driving diel migration in zooplankton and nekton in Monterey Bay, emphasizing the novel science questions that can be addressed using contemporary means of accessing the sea and new, integrated tools for describing the habitat and its inhabitants.

AB Understanding animal movements that underpin ecosystem processes is fundamental to ecology. Recent advances in animal tags have increased the ability to remotely locate larger species; however, this technology is not suitable for up to 70% of the world's bird and mammal species. The most widespread technique for tracking small animals is to manually locate low-power radio transmitters from the ground with handheld equipment. Despite this labor-intensive technique being used for decades, efforts to reduce or automate this process have had limited success. Here, we present an approach for tracking small radio-tagged animals by using an autonomous and lightweight aerial robot. We present experimental results where we used the robot to locate critically endangered swift parrots (Lathamus discolor) within their winter range. The system combines a miniaturized sensor with newly developed estimation algorithms to yield unambiguous bearing- and range-based measurements with associated measures of uncertainty. We incorporated these measurements into Bayesian data fusion and information-based planning algorithms to control the position of the robot as it collected data. We report estimated positions that lie within about 50 meters of the true positions of the birds on average, which are sufficiently accurate for recapture or observation. Further, in comparison with experienced human trackers from locations where the signal was detectable, the robot produced a correct estimate as fast or faster than the human. These results provide validation of robotic systems for wildlife radio telemetry and suggest a way for widespread use as human-assistive or autonomous devices.

AB Smooth camber morphing aircraft offer increased control authority and improved aerodynamic efficiency. Smart material actuators have become a popular driving force for shape changes, capable of adhering to weight and size constraints and allowing for simplicity in mechanical design. As a step towards creating uncrewed aerial vehicles (UAVs) capable of autonomously responding to flow conditions, this work examines a multifunctional morphing airfoil's ability to follow commands in various flows. We integrated an airfoil with a morphing trailing edge consisting of an antagonistic pair of macro fiber composites (MFCs), serving as both skin and actuator, and internal piezoelectric flex sensors to form a closed loop composite system. Closed loop feedback control is necessary to accurately follow deflection commands due to the hysteretic behavior of MFCs. Here we used a deep reinforcement learning algorithm, Proximal Policy Optimization, to control the morphing airfoil. Two neural controllers were trained in a simulation developed through time series modeling on long short-term memory recurrent neural networks. The learned controllers were then tested on the composite wing using two state inference methods in still air and in a wind tunnel at various flow speeds. We compared the performance of our neural controllers to one using traditional position-derivative feedback control methods. Our experimental results validate that the autonomous neural controllers were faster and more accurate than traditional methods. This research shows that deep learning methods can overcome common obstacles for achieving sufficient modeling and control when implementing smart composite actuators in an autonomous aerospace environment.

AB Architecture selection for systems undergoing rapid technological and market change is challenging. It is desirable to select architectures that can provide cost-effective possibilities for future changes and avoid architecture lock-in. However, optimal architectures for prevailing conditions may not be changeable for future adaptation. This tension between objectives for system (product) development for both short-term and long-term competitiveness has been an enduring challenge for system architects. Here, we use time-expanded decision networks (TDNs) with time-varying costs and demands to systematically explore future architecture transition pathways and strategically identify useful designs. We demonstrate a new application for autonomous driving (AD) systems, a nascent technology, where the design and capabilities of constituent components (such as sensors, processors, and data communication links) are still evolving and significant market and regulatory uncertainties persist. In this case, we model technology costs with time-based factors to explicitly include future trends. The results show that as cost differences between architectures increase and demand for new functionality changes with time, the approach is able to identify potential transition points between architecture choices that optimize the net present value (NPV) of the system. For some of the specific scenarios analyzed in this study, the NPV with optimal architecture transitions is at least 10-20% larger as compared with fixed cases. Overall, this work presents a case for planning and partly constructing architecture transition roadmaps for new systems wherein dominant architectures have not emerged.

AB Autonomous flight of unmanned full-size rotor-craft has the potential to enable many new applications. However, the dynamics of these aircraft, prevailing wind conditions, the need to operate over a variety of speeds and stringent safety requirements make it difficult to generate safe plans for these systems. Prior work has shown results for only parts of the problem. Here we present the first comprehensive approach to planning safe trajectories for autonomous helicopters from takeoff to landing. Our approach is based on two key insights. First, we compose an approximate solution by cascading various modules that can efficiently solve different relaxations of the planning problem. Our framework invokes a long-term route optimizer, which feeds a receding-horizon planner which in turn feeds a high-fidelity safety executive. Secondly, to deal with the diverse planning scenarios that may arise, we hedge our bets with an ensemble of planners. We use a data-driven approach that maps a planning context to a diverse list of planning algorithms that maximize the likelihood of success. Our approach was extensively evaluated in simulation and in real-world flight tests on three different helicopter systems for duration of more than 109 autonomous hours and 590 pilot-in-the-loop hours. We provide an in-depth analysis and discuss the various tradeoffs of decoupling the problem, using approximations and leveraging statistical techniques. We summarize the insights with the hope that it generalizes to other platforms and applications.

AB Autonomous maneuver decision-making methods for air combat often rely on human knowledge, such as advantage functions, objective functions, or dense rewards in reinforcement learning, which limits the decision-making ability of unmanned combat aerial vehicle to the scope of human experience and result in slow progress in maneuver decision-making. Therefore, a maneuver decision-making method based on deep reinforcement learning and Monte Carlo tree search is proposed to investigate whether it is feasible for maneuver decision-making without human knowledge or advantage function. To this end, Monte Carlo tree search in continuous action space is proposed and neural networks-guided Monte Carlo tree search with self-play is utilized to improve the ability of air combat agents. It starts from random behaviors and generates samples consisting of states, actions, and results of air combat through self-play without using human knowledge. These samples are used to train the neural network, and the neural network with a greater winning rate is selected by simulations. Then, repeat the above process to gradually improve the maneuver decision-making ability. Simulations are conducted to verify the effectiveness of the proposed method, and the kinematic model of the missile is used in simulations instead of the missile engagement zone to test whether the maneuver decision-making method is effective or not. The simulation results of the fixed initial state and random initial state show that the proposed method is efficient and can meet the real-time requirement.

AB Introduction of autonomous and connected trucks (ACTs) is expected to result in drastic changes in operational characteristics of freight shipments, which may in turn have significant impacts on highway safety, vehicle fuel consumption, and infrastructure durability. One such important change is the formation of truck platoons which can be defined as the convoy of trucks travelling in a very close distance. Reducing congestion, regulating traffic, and improving fuel efficiency are some of reported and expected benefits of platooning. Yet such platooning operations may accelerate the damage accumulation within pavement structures because the lateral position of successive trucks within a lane is expected to be similar (i.e., channelized traffic) and the time between two consecutive axle loads (i.e., resting period) is expected to be reduced. Therefore, this study develops a platooning-control strategy for a fleet of ACTs such that the lateral position of trucks and spacing between them can be explicitly optimized to minimize damage to the pave-ment. Pavement damage is simulated using recently developed pavement performance models. On the other hand, fluid dynamics models were developed to compute fuel-cost due to aerodynamic drags. Three numerical optimization algorithms, genetic algorithms, particle swarm optimization and pattern search algorithm were used to solve the objective function. The proposed control strategy efficiency is demonstrated through a case study; relative costs to agencies and users could be reduced by 9%.

AB Application of terrain-vehicle mechanics for determination and prediction of mobility performance of autonomous wheeled mobile robot (AWMR) in rough terrain is a new research area currently receiving much attention for both terrestrial and planetary missions due to its significant role in design, evaluation, optimization, and motion control of AWMRs. In this paper, decoupled closed form terramechanics considering important wheel-terrain parameters is applied to model and predict traction. Numerical analysis of traction performance in terms of drawbar pull, tractive efficiency, and driving torque is carried out for wheels of different radii, widths, and lug heights, under different wheel slips. Effects of normal forces on wheels are analyzed. Results presented in figures are discussed and used to draw some conclusions. Furthermore, a multiobjective optimization (MOO) method for achieving optimal mobility is presented. The MOO problem is formulated based on five independent variables including wheel radius r, width b, lug height h, wheel slip s, and wheel rotation angle theta with three objectives to maximize drawbar pull and tractive efficiency while minimizing the dynamic traction ratio. Genetic algorithm in MATLAB is used to obtain optimized wheel design and traction control parameters such as drawbar pull, tractive efficiency, and dynamic traction ratio required for good mobility performance. Comparison of MOO results with experimental results shows a good agreement. A method to apply the MOO results for online traction and mobility prediction and control is discussed.

AB In this paper, a novel approach for autonomously catching fast flying objects is presented, as inspired by the Mohamed Bin Zayed International Robotics Challenge (MBZIRC) 2020. In this competition, an autonomous Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) was used to intercept a ball carried by a fast flying drone. The presented solution utilizes a 3D LiDAR sensor for quick and robust target detection. The trajectory of the target is estimated and predicted to select a suitable interception position. The interceptor UAV is navigated into the interception position to safely approach the target. The interception position is frequently being adjusted based on the updated estimation and prediction of the target's motion to ensure that the ball is caught in the dedicated onboard net. After a successful interception is detected, the UAV lands in a designated landing area. The proposed concept was intensively tested and refined in demanding outdoor conditions with strong winds and varying perception conditions to achieve the robustness required by both the demanding application and the competition. In the MBZIRC 2020 competition, our solution scored second place in Challenge 1 and first place in a combined Grand Challenge. This manuscript will provide a detailed description of the applied methods and an evaluation of our approach with data collected from real-world experiments. In addition, we present achievements of our R & D towards the transition from the MBZIRC competition to an autonomous drone interceptor, which was the main motivation of this challenge.

AB Commuters worldwide can now travel to work using unmanned subway services while tourists may travel to holiday destinations on planes that employ automatic flight control equipment. More recently, autonomous buses have made their debut in several cities. Technological advances in transport services, however, are accompanied by challenges to passengers' perceived safety and the acceptability of the technology. While passengers' anxiety and fear appear to reduce their acceptance of new technologies, trust has been shown to positively affect their acceptance of automation and autonomous vehicles. In this vein, the present study investigates the trustworthiness of automated subway services in Korea with regard to passenger anxiety and fear. First, automated subway-specific trustworthiness factors are identified through exploratory factor analysis. Subsequently, the effects of the identified factors on passenger anxiety and fear are examined using structural equation modeling. The results indicate that attributes that contribute to the trustworthiness of automated subways are grouped into automation- and service-related factors: 'automation trustworthiness' and 'service trustworthiness', both of which appear to negatively affect passengers' anxiety and fear, mediated by the passengers' sense of certainty and coping potential. The negative effects of trustworthiness on anxiety and fear indicate that strengthening of the trustworthiness factors must be accompanied with technological advances in transportation. The implications for strengthening the trustworthiness of unmanned automated subways and other transport services employing autonomous features are presented, correspondingly, in this study.

In this paper, we present an industrial experience in which we build a complete autonomous driving system, from the sensor units to the car control equipment, and we describe its adoption and testing phase on the field. We report how we organize data fusion and map manipulation to represent the required reality. We focus on the communication and synchronization issues between the data-fusion device and the path-planner, between the CPU and the GPU units, and among different CUDA kernels implementing the core local planner module. In these frameworks, we propose simple representation strategies and approximation techniques which guarantee almost no penalty in terms of accuracy and large savings in terms of memory occupation and memory transfer times. We show how we adopt a recent implementation on parallel many-core devices, such as CUDA-based GPGPU, to reduce the computational burden of rapidly exploring random trees to explore the state space along with a given reference path. We report on our use of the controller and the vehicle simulator. We run experiments on several real scenarios, and we report the paths generated with the different settings, with their relative errors and computation times. We prove that our approach can generate reasonable paths on a multitude of standard maneuvers in real time.

TI Bioinspired design of a landing system with soft shock absorbers for

AB One of the main challenges for autonomous aerial robots is to land safely on a target position on varied surface structures in real-world applications. Most of current aerial robots (especially multirotors) use only rigid landing gears, which limit the adaptability to environments and can cause damage to the sensitive cameras and other electronics onboard. This paper presents a bioinpsired landing system for autonomous aerial robots, built on the inspire-abstract-implement design paradigm and an additive manufacturing process for soft thermoplastic materials. This novel landing system consists of 3D printable Sarrus shock absorbers and soft landing pads which are integrated with an one-degree-of-freedom actuation mechanism. Both designs of the Sarrus shock absorber and the soft landing pad are analyzed via finite element analysis, and are characterized with dynamic mechanical measurements. The landing system with 3D printed soft components is characterized by completing landing tests on flat, convex, and concave steel structures and grassy field in a total of 60 times at different speeds between 1 and 2 m/s. The adaptability and shock absorption capacity of the proposed landing system is then evaluated and benchmarked against rigid legs. It reveals that the system is able to adapt to varied surface structures and reduce impact force by 540N at maximum. The bioinspired landing strategy presented in this paper opens a promising avenue in Aerial Biorobotics, where a cross-disciplinary approach in vehicle control and navigation is combined with soft technologies, enabled with adaptive morphology.

AB Considering importance of the autonomous driving applications for mobile devices, it is imperative to develop both fast and accurate semantic segmentation models. Thanks to emergence of Deep Learning (DL) techniques, the segmentation models enhanced their accuracy. However, this improved performance of currently popular DL models for self-driving car applications come at the cost of time and computational efficiency. Moreover, networks with efficient model architecture experience lack of accuracy. Therefore, in this study, we propose robust, efficient, and fast network (REF-Net) that combines carefully formulated encoding and decoding paths. Specifically, the contraction path uses mixture of dilated and asymmetric convolution layers with skip connections and bottleneck layers, while the decoding path benefits from nearest neighbor interpolation method that demands no trainable parameters to restore original image size. This model architecture considerably reduces the number of trainable parameters, required memory space, training, and inference time. In fact, the proposed model required nearly 90 times fewer trainable parameters and approximately 4 times less memory space that allowed 3-fold faster training runtime and 2-fold inference speedup in the conducted experiments using Cambridge-driving Labeled Video Database (CamVid) and Cityscapes datasets. Moreover, despite its notable efficiency in terms of memory and time, the REF-Net attained superior results in several segmentation evaluation metrics that showed roughly 2%, 4%, and 3% increase in pixel accuracy, Dice coefficient, and Jaccard Index, respectively.

AB To construct a safe and sound autonomous driving system, object detection is essential, and research on fusion of sensors is being actively conducted to increase the detection rate of objects in a dynamic environment in which safety must be secured. Recently, considerable performance improvements in object detection have been achieved with the advent of the convolutional neural network (CNN) structure. In particular, the YOLO (You Only Look Once) architecture, which is suitable for real-time object detection by simultaneously predicting and classifying bounding boxes of objects, is receiving great attention. However, securing the robustness of object detection systems in various environments still remains a challenge. In this paper, we propose a weighted mean-based adaptive object detection strategy that enhances detection performance through convergence of individual object detection results based on an RGB camera and a LiDAR (Light Detection and Ranging) for autonomous driving. The proposed system utilizes the YOLO framework to perform object detection independently based on image data and point cloud data (PCD). Each detection result is united to reduce the number of objects not detected at the decision level by the weighted mean scheme. To evaluate the performance of the proposed object detection system, tests on vehicles and pedestrians were carried out using the KITTI Benchmark Suite. Test results demonstrated that the proposed strategy can achieve detection performance with a higher mean average precision (mAP) for targeted objects than an RGB camera and is also robust against external environmental changes.

AB Occupant safety remains one of the most challenging and significant design considerations in the automotive and transportation industry. Nevertheless, independently developed active or passive safety systems may lead to unsatisfactory protective performance under the critical driving scenarios. This study aimed to conduct multiobjective optimization of the cooperative controls between autonomous emergency steering (AES) and occupant restraint system (ORS) to explore the potential occupant injury reduction capability as well as mechanisms subjected to a frontal collision. First, a multiple simulation approach comprising PreScan/Simulink, LS-DYNA, Madymo was used to correlate the control parameters of the safety systems and occupant injuries quantitatively. Then the control parameters of AES and ORS were selected as the design variables after sensitivity analysis, and injury responses of the sampling points were extracted by the multiple simulation approach. Surrogate models and multiobjective optimization algorithm were used to determine the optimum design in cooperative controls of AES and ORS maneuvers, from which in-depth effect mechanisms that contributed to the improvement of occupant protection were identified. Compared to the baseline design, the optimum control parameters of AES-ORS integration substantially decreased the occupant injuries of the head, chest and neck, and consequently led to a reduction of 33.02% in the overall injury risk. This study is anticipated to demonstrate a new design approach for the control system, thereby enhancing occupant safety.

AB In state-of-the-art deep neural network (DNN), the layer-wise activation maps leads to significant data movement in hardware accelerators operating on real-time streaming inputs. We explore an architecture-aware algorithmic approach to reduce data movement and the resulting latency and power consumption. This article presents an attention-based feedback for controlling input data, referred to as the activation pruning, that reduces activation maps in early layers of a DNN network which are critical for reducing data movement in real-time AI processing. The proposed approach is demonstrated for coupling RGB and Lidar images to perform real-time perception and local motion planning in autonomous systems. Lidar data is used to determine "Pixels of Interest"(PoI) in an RGB image depending on their distance from sensor, prune the RGB image to perform object detection only within the PoI, and use the detected objects to perform local motion planning. Experiments on sequences from KITTI dataset shows the activation pruning maintains quality of motion planning while increasing the sparsity of the activation maps. The sparsity-aware computing architectures is considered to leverage activation sparsity for improved performance. The simulation results show that proposed activation pruning algorithm reduces data movement (38.5%), computational load (30.1%), and memory latency (76.3%) in sparsity-aware compute architecture, leading to faster perception and lower energy consumption.

DE System validation; semantic segmentation; autonomous driving
AB One of the fundamental challenges in the design of perception systems for autonomous vehicles is validating the performance of each algorithm under a comprehensive variety of operating conditions. In the case of vision-based semantic segmentation, there are known issues when encountering new scenarios that are sufficiently different to the training data. In addition, even small variations in environmental conditions, such as illumination and precipitation, can affect the classification performance of the segmentation model. Given the reliance on visual information, these effects often translate into poor semantic pixel classification which can potentially lead to catastrophic consequences when driving autonomously. This paper presents a novel method for analyzing the robustness of semantic segmentation models and provides a number of metrics to evaluate the classification performance over a variety of environmental conditions. The process incorporates an additional sensor (lidar) to automate the process and improve the system integrity, eliminating the need for labor-intensive hand labeling of validation data. The experimental results are presented based on multiple datasets collected at different times of the year with different environmental conditions. We extract the "Road" class using the lidar to demonstrate the concepts, but this could be extended to other classes with different feature detection algorithms. These results show that the semantic segmentation performance varies depending on the weather, camera parameters, and existence of shadows. The results also demonstrate how the metrics can be used to compare and validate the performance after making improvements to a model, and compare the performance of different networks.

AB Germany is by far the largest contributor of greenhouse gas emissions in the European Union but adopted its own climate action plan to achieve greenhouse gas neutrality by 2050. The country's third-largest emitter of greenhouse gas emissions is the transportation sector. As of January 2019, 99.7% of heavy-duty trucks registered in Germany run on diesel while the share of alternative fuel-powered passenger cars increases steadily. Apart from rising emissions, the industry faces a growing shortage of qualified truck drivers. A solution to increasing emissions and the shortage of drivers are autonomous and alternative fuel-powered heavy-duty trucks. We employed a choice-based conjoint analysis with employees from freight companies in Germany to find out how they assess the main attributes of innovative trucks. Our results reveal that the maximum driving range is the most important attribute followed by the refueling/recharging time. Tank-to wheel emissions, on the other hand, was ranked as the least relevant attribute. Moreover, we present customers' preference shares for future heavy-duty trucks until 2035. According to our results, freight companies are generally open to switching from conventional to low emission and (conditionally-) automated heavy-duty trucks, however, a close collaboration between truck manufacturers, customers, infrastructure companies, and policymakers is essential to spur the penetration of autonomous and alternative fuel-powered heavy-duty trucks.

TI Modeling realistic optical aberrations to reuse existing drive scene
   recordings for autonomous driving validation
SO JOURNAL OF ELECTRONIC IMAGING

AB Training autonomous vehicles requires lots of driving sequences in all situations. Collecting and labeling these drive scenes is a very time-consuming and expensive process. Currently, it is not possible to reuse these drive scenes with different optical properties, because there exists no numerically efficient model for the transfer function of the optical system. We present a numerical model for the point spread function (PSF) of an optical system that can efficiently model both experimental measurements and lens design simulations of the PSF. The numerical basis for this model is a nonlinear regression of the PSF with an artificial neural network. The novelty lies in the portability and the parameterization of this model. We present a lens measurement series, yielding a numerical function for the PSF that depends only on the parameters defocus, field, and azimuth. By convolving existing images and videos with this PSF, we generate images as if seen through the measured lens. The methodology applies to any optical scenario, but we focus on the context of autonomous driving, where the quality of the detection algorithms depends directly on the optical quality of the used camera system. With this model, it is possible to reuse existing recordings, with the potential to avoid millions of test drive miles. The parameterization of the optical model allows for a method to validate the functional and safety limits of camera-based advanced driver assistance systems based on the real, measured lens actually used in the product.

AB Given that sensor-based perception systems are utilized in autonomous vehicle applications, it is essential to validate such systems to ensure their robustness before they are deployed. In this study, we propose a comprehensive simulation-based process to verify and enhance the robustness of sensor-based perception systems in relation to corruption. Firstly, we introduce a methodology and scenario-based corruption generation tool for creating a variety of simulated test scenarios. These scenarios can effectively mimic real-world traffic environments, with a focus on corruption types that are related to safety concerns. An effective corruption similarity filtering algorithm is then proposed to eliminate corruption types with high similarity and identify representative corruption types that encompass all considered corruption types. As a result, we can create efficient test scenarios for corruption-related robustness with reduced testing time and comprehensive scenario coverage. Subsequently, we conduct vulnerability analysis on object detection models to identify weaknesses and create an effective training dataset for enhancing model vulnerability. This improves the object detection models' tolerance to weather and noise-related corruptions, ultimately enhancing the robustness of the perception system. We use case studies to demonstrate the feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed procedures for verifying and enhancing robustness. Furthermore, we investigate the impact of various "similarity overlap threshold" parameter settings on scenario coverage, effectiveness, scenario complexity (size of training and testing datasets), and time costs.

AB In this paper, we present a challenging stereo-inertial dataset collected onboard a sports utility vehicle (SUV) for the tasks of visual-inertial odometry (VIO), simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM), autonomous driving, object detection, and other computer vision techniques. We recorded a large set of time-synchronized stereo image sequences (2 x 1280 x 720 @ 30 fps RGB) and corresponding inertial measurement unit (IMU) readings (400 Hz) from a Stereolabs ZED2 camera, along with centimeter-level-accurate six-degree-of-freedom ground truth (100 Hz) from a u-blox GNSS-IMU navigation device with real-time kinematic correction signals. The dataset comprises 34 sequences recorded during November 2020 in Wuhan, the largest city of Central China. Further, the dataset contains abundant unique urban scenes and features of a complex modern metropolis, which have rarely appeared in previously released benchmarks. Results from milestone VIO/SLAM algorithms reveal that methods exhibiting excellent performance on established datasets such as KITTI and EuRoC perform unsatisfactorily when moved outside the laboratory to the real world. We expect our dataset to reduce this limitation by providing more challenging and diverse scenarios to the research community. The full dataset with raw and calibrated data is publicly available along with a lightweight MATLAB/Python toolbox for preprocessing and evaluation. The dataset can be downloaded in its entirety from the uniform resource locator (URL) we provide in the main text.

AB A wireless network of buoys, two autonomous robotic boats, and an autonomous tethered vertical profiling system were used to characterize phytoplankton dynamics and spatiotemporal changes in chemical and physical forcing factors in a small montane lake (Lake Fulmor, Idyllwild, California). Three deployments each year were conducted in 2005 and 2006 to examine seasonal changes in the structure of the lake and phytoplankton assemblage, as well as fine-scale temporal and spatial variations. The buoys yielded fine-scale temporal patterns of in situ fluorescence and temperature, while the vertical profiling system yielded two-dimensional, cross-sectional profiles of several parameters. The autonomous vehicles provided information on fluorescence and corresponding temperature patterns across the surface of the lake. Average, lake-wide chlorophyll concentrations increased 10-fold seasonally, and strong anoxia developed in the hypolimnion during the summer. The latter process dramatically affected vertical chemical gradients in the 5 m water column of the lake. Small-scale spatial (<1 m) and temporal (minutes) heterogeneity in fluorescence were surprisingly large. These variations were due predominantly to vertical mixing of the phytoplankton assemblage and to phytoplankton vertical migratory behavior. Large peaks in fluorescence at 0.5-m occurred at very short time intervals (minutes) during all deployments, and appeared to be due to upward mixing of deeper dwelling eukaryotic phytoplankton during early-mid-summer, or downward mixing of surface-associated cyanobacteria during late summer.

AB Point cloud object detection is a pivotal technology in autonomous driving and robotics. Currently, the majority of cutting-edge point cloud detectors utilize Bird's Eye View (BEV) for detection, as it allows them to take advantage of well-explored 2D detection techniques. Nevertheless, dimensionality reduction of features from 3D space to BEV space unavoidably leads to information loss, and there is a lack of research on this issue. Existing methods typically obtain BEV features by collapsing voxel or point features along the height dimension via a pooling operation or convolution, resulting in a significant decrease in geometric information. To tackle this problem, we present a new point cloud backbone network for grid-based object detection, MDRNet, which is based on adaptive dimensionality reduction and multi-level spatial residual strategies. In MDRNet, the Spatial-aware Dimensionality Reduction (SDR) is designed to dynamically concentrate on the essential components of the object during 3D-to-BEV transformation. Moreover, the Multi-level Spatial Residuals (MSR) strategy is proposed to effectively fuse multi-level spatial information in BEV feature maps. Our MDRNet can be employed on any existing grid-based object detector, resulting in a remarkable improvement in performance. Numerous experiments conducted on nuScenes, KITTI and DAIR-V have shown that MDRNet surpasses existing SOTA approaches. In particular, on the nuScenes dataset, we attained an impressive 7.2% mAP and 5.0% NDS enhancement compared with CenterPoint.

AB Intelligent and coordinated unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) swarm combat will be the main mode of warfare in the future, and mechanistic design of autonomous cooperation within swarms is the key to enhancing combat effectiveness. Exploration of the essential features and patterns of autonomous collaboration in unmanned swarms has become the focus of scientific research and technological applications, in keeping with the evolving conceptions of the military theatre. However, given the unique attributes of the military and the novelty of the warfare mode of unmanned swarms, few achievements have been reported in the existing research. In this study, we analysed the military requirements of unmanned swarm operations and proposed an analytic framework for autonomous collaboration. Then, a literature review addressing swarm evolution dynamics, game-based swarm collaboration, and collaborative evolution on complex networks was conducted. Next, on the basis of the above work, we designed a community network for unmanned swarm cooperation and constructed a collaborative evolution model based on the multiplayer public goods game (PGG). Furthermore, according to the "network" and "model", the dynamic evolution process of swarm collaboration was formally deduced. Finally, a simulation was conducted to analyse the influence of relevant parameters (i.e., swarm size, degree distribution, cost, multiplication factor) on the collaborative behaviour of unmanned swarms. According to the simulation results, some reasonable suggestions for collaborative management and control in swarm operation are given, which can provide theoretical reference and decision-making support for the design of coordination mechanisms and improved combat effectiveness in unmanned swarm operation.

DE Field robotics; motion and path planning; perception and autonomy;

AB Tunnel construction using the drill-and-blast method requires the 3D measurement of the excavation front to evaluate underbreak locations. Considering the inspection and measurement task's safety, cost, and efficiency, deploying lightweight autonomous robots, such as unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV), becomes more necessary and popular. Most of the previous works use a prior map for inspection viewpoint determination and do not consider dynamic obstacles. To maximally increase the level of autonomy, this letter proposes a vision-based UAV inspection framework for dynamic tunnel environments without using a prior map. Our approach utilizes a hierarchical planning scheme, decomposing the inspection problem into different levels. The high-level decision maker first determines the task for the robot and generates the target point. Then, the mid-level path planner finds the waypoint path and optimizes the collision-free static trajectory. Finally, the static trajectory will be fed into the low-level local planner to avoid dynamic obstacles and navigate to the target point. Besides, our framework contains a novel dynamic map module that can simultaneously track dynamic obstacles and represent static obstacles based on an RGB-D camera. After inspection, the Structure-from-Motion (SfM) pipeline is applied to generate the 3D shape of the target. To our best knowledge, this is the first time autonomous inspection has been realized in unknown and dynamic tunnel environments. Our flight experiments in a real tunnel prove that our method can autonomously inspect the tunnel excavation front surface.

TI Controls and Standards for Interoperable Wireless Power Transfer in

SO NAVAL ENGINEERS JOURNAL
LA English
DT Article
AB Unmanned and autonomous systems are used extensively for Navy missions and will continue to play a large role in future Navy and joint scenarios. While most of these systems are able to perform their mission without human interaction, limitations in the amount of power that can be stored place a fundamental limit on the overall system autonomy. Inductive wireless power transfer provides a way to recharge unmanned systems (vehicles, sensors, etc.) at close proximity without the need for direct electrical contact through wires or electrodes. This type of inductive power transfer has been demonstrated at power levels ranging from a few watts to kilowatts, and from applications ranging from personal electronics to automotive. One challenge with implementing wireless power transfer for unmanned Navy applications is the vast array of systems to be charged due to variations in power levels, physical dimensions, and other operational requirements.
   Additionally, autonomy of the power transfer operation itself must be achieved (i.e. it must start and stop without external involvement). A few wireless power transfer systems have been demonstrated, but are either vendor or platform specific. This work presents the development of hardware and algorithms for autonomous, inductive wireless power transfer that is geared towards interoperability across an array of Navy systems. Specifically, the presented system demonstrates initiation, monitoring, and termination of power transfer with a battery to battery efficiency of above 70%. The framework of a wireless power transfer standard is also presented, which provides interoperability by allowing systems of different power levels and charge rates to be charged from a single charging station.

AB Perching at speed is among the most demanding flight behaviours that birds perform(1,2) and is beyond the capability of most autonomous vehicles. Smaller birds may touch down by hovering(3-8), but larger birds typically swoop up to perch(1,2)-presumably because the adverse scaling of their power margin prohibits hovering(9) and because swooping upwards transfers kinetic to potential energy before collision(1,2,10). Perching demands precise control of velocity and pose(11-14), particularly in larger birds for which scale effects make collisions especially hazardous(6,15). However, whereas cruising behaviours such as migration and commuting typically minimize the cost of transport or time of flight(16), the optimization of such unsteady flight manoeuvres remains largely unexplored(7,17). Here we show that the swooping trajectories of perching Harris' hawks (Parabuteo unicinctus) minimize neither time nor energy alone, but rather minimize the distance flown after stalling. By combining motion capture data from 1,576 flights with flight dynamics modelling, we find that the birds' choice of where to transition from powered dive to unpowered climb minimizes the distance over which high lift coefficients are required. Time and energy are therefore invested to provide the control authority needed to glide safely to the perch, rather than being minimized directly as in technical implementations of autonomous perching under nonlinear feedback control(12) and deep reinforcement learning(18,19). Naive birds learn this behaviour on the fly, so our findings suggest a heuristic principle that could guide reinforcement learning of autonomous perching.

   segmentation; self-driving cars; autonomous drones
AB Semantic segmentation (SS) aims to classify each pixel into one of the pre-defined classes. This task plays an important role in self-driving cars and autonomous drones. In SS, many works have shown that most misclassified pixels are commonly near object boundaries with high uncertainties. However, existing SS loss functions are not tailored to handle these uncertain pixels during training, as these pixels are usually treated equally as confidently classified pixels and cannot be embedded with arbitrary low distortion in Euclidean space, thereby degenerating the performance of SS. To overcome this problem, this paper designs a Hyperbolic Uncertainty Loss (HyperUL), which dynamically highlights the misclassified and high-uncertainty pixels in Hyperbolic space during training via the hyperbolic distances. The proposed HyperUL is model agnostic and can be easily applied to various neural architectures. After employing HyperUL to three recent SS models, the experimental results on Cityscapes, UAVid, and ACDC datasets reveal that the segmentation performance of existing SS models can be consistently improved. Additionally, reliable measurement of model uncertainty plays a key role in real-world applications such as autonomous controls of vehicles and drones. To meet this requirement, we propose the Hyperbolic Uncertainty Estimation method, which is easily implemented by only post-processing the generated Hyperbolic embeddings. By this approach, we can calculate the uncertainty values almost for free. Quantitative and qualitative results on Cityscapes, UAVid, and ACDC datasets verify that our proposed uncertainty estimation method usually outputs more meaningful results compared with popular MC-dropout and ensembling methods.

AB Manufacturing flexibility improves a firm's ability to react in timely manner to customer demands and to increase production system productivity without incurring excessive costs and expending an excessive amount of resources. The emerging technologies in the Industry 4.0 era, such as cloud operations or industrial Artificial Intelligence, allow for new flexible production systems. We develop and test an analytical model for a throughput analysis and use it to reveal the conditions under which the autonomous mobile robots (AMR)-based flexible production networks are more advantageous as compared to the traditional production lines. Using a circular loop among workstations and inter-operational buffers, our model allows congestion to be avoided by utilizing multiple crosses and analyzing both the flow and the load/unload phases. The sensitivity analysis shows that the cost of the AMRs and the number of shifts are the key factors in improving flexibility and productivity. The outcomes of this research promote a deeper understanding of the role of AMRs in Industry 4.0-based production networks and can be utilized by production planners to determine optimal configurations and the associated performance impact of the AMR-based production networks in as compared to the traditionally balanced lines. This study supports the decision-makers in how the AMR in production systems in process industry can improve manufacturing performance in terms of productivity, flexibility, and costs.

ID EXTENDED OBJECT
AB This paper presents a target tracking algorithm based on 4D millimeter-wave radar point cloud information for autonomous driving applications, which addresses the limitations of traditional 2 + 1D radar systems by using higher resolution target point cloud information that enables more accurate motion state estimation and target contour information. The proposed algorithm includes several steps, starting with the estimation of the ego vehicle's velocity information using the radial velocity information of the millimeter-wave radar point cloud. Different clustering suggestions are then obtained using a density-based clustering method, and correlation regions of the targets are obtained based on these clustering suggestions. The binary Bayesian filtering method is then used to determine whether the targets are dynamic or static targets based on their distribution characteristics. For dynamic targets, Kalman filtering is used to estimate and update the state of the target using trajectory and velocity information, while for static targets, the rolling ball method is used to estimate and update the shape contour boundary of the target. Unassociated measurements are estimated for the contour and initialized for the trajectory, and unassociated trajectory targets are selectively retained and deleted. The effectiveness of the proposed method is verified using real data. Overall, the proposed target tracking algorithm based on 4D millimeter-wave radar point cloud information has the potential to improve the accuracy and reliability of target tracking in autonomous driving applications, providing more comprehensive motion state and target contour information for better decision making.

ID OBSTACLE AVOIDANCE; VISUAL NAVIGATION; ENVIRONMENT
AB Autonomous exploration is a longstanding goal of the robotics community. Aerial drone navigation has proven to be especially challenging. The stringent requirements on cost, weight, maneuverability, and power consumption do not allow exploration approaches to easily be employed or adapted to different types of environments. End-to-End Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) techniques based on Convolutional Networks approximators, which grant constant-time computation, predefined memory usage, and deliver high visual perception capabilities, represent a very promising alternative to current state of the art solutions relying on metric environment reconstruction. In this work, we address the autonomous exploration problem with aerial robots with a monocular camera based on DRL. Specifically, we propose a novel asymmetric actor-critic model for drone exploration that efficiently leverages ground truth information provided by the simulator environment to speed up learning and enhance final exploration performances. Furthermore, in order to reduce the sim-to-real gap for exploration, we present a novel mixed reality framework that allows an easier, smoother, and safer simulation to real-world transition. Both aspects allow to further exploit the great potential of simulation engines and contribute to reducing the risk associated with directly deploying algorithms on a physical platform with no intermediate step between the simulation and the real world. This is well-known to create several safety concerns and be dangerous when deploying aerial vehicles. Experimental results with a drone exploring multiple environments show the effectiveness of the proposed approach.

In this paper observed the rotational Doppler shift phenomenon of the acoustic vortex in an underwater environment by using a Fresnel-spiral zone plate for the construction of the focused acoustic vortex with controllable topological charge. The positive and negative rotation speeds of the spinning object are precisely determined with the rotational frequency shift and the acoustic vortex's topological charge. The rotational Doppler effect of acoustic vortex provides a possibility to improve the detection and recognition accuracy of Autonomous Underwater Vehicles with propellers.

AB Professional learning communities can be effective vehicles for teacher learning and instructional improvement, partly because they help change professional culture. However, little is known about how these changes occur. We used activity systems analysis to investigate the development of professional learning communities and their teacher leaders (N=9) based on interviews and observations over 2 years. Activity systems analysis enables researchers to understand change within complex qualitative data sets by finding systemic relations within the activity, specifying contradictions in the system, and explicating outcomes. The resulting activity system illuminates the transformation of a mostly private, autonomous, and egalitarian culture to one of nascent collaboration, reflection, and shared values, as well as teacher leaders' development of agency.

AB Autonomous off-road navigation of robotic ground vehicles has important applications on Earth and in space exploration. Progress in this domain has been retarded by the limited lookahead range of three-dimensional (3D) sensors and by the difficulty of heuristically programming systems to understand the traversability of the wide variety of terrain they can encounter. Enabling robots to learn from experience may alleviate both of these problems. We define two paradigms for this, learning from 3D geometry and learning from proprioception, and describe initial instantiations of them as developed under DARPA and NASA programs. Field test results show promise for learning traversability of vegetated terrain and learning to extend the lookahead range of the vision system. (c) 2007 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

AB Lane localization is one of the core tasks in an autonomous driving system. It receives the visual information collected by the camera and the lane marks and road edges information outputted from the perception module and gives lane index for the subsequent decision module. Traditional rule-based lane localization methods using navigation maps can only be effective in regular road scenarios and have poor generalization ability. High-Definition Map (HD map) was originally thought to solve the lane localization problem, but due to the regulations of the relevant departments, HD map is currently not allowed to be used in autonomous driving systems. In addition, many multi-sensor fusion methods have been proposed to solve the lane localization problem. However, due to the extremely strict safety requirements of autonomous driving systems, these well-designed solutions make it difficult to meet the requirements in terms of robustness, efficiency, and stability. To solve these problems, we innovatively define the lane localization task as a classification problem. First, to better utilize the perceptual information outputted from the perceptual model, we design an image-generating method that projects the perceptual information onto a new image and ensures that our model can learn the perceptual features wisely. Second, to better fuse the perceptual and visual information, we propose a fusion structure deep learning neural network named LLNet to address the lane localization problem in an end-to-end manner. Finally, to ensure the generalization ability, robustness, and stability of LLNet, we conduct extensive comparison experiments on a large-scale real-world dataset, with a total mileage of over 400 km. The experiments show that our approach remarkably outperforms the deep learning classification baselines. In the discussion part of this paper, we give a comprehensive and detailed elaboration for the effectiveness of various designs in our LLNet. To our knowledge, LLNet is the first lane localization method based entirely on deep learning. LLNet is added to the self-driving suite for a kind of mass production vehicle that will be available in the summer of 2022, with an expected sales volume more than 300,000.

AB Featured Application
   Splitting of formerly only integrated inference from object recognition and other trained (and potentially untrained) machine learning approaches has broad applicability in all application scenarios that rely on these types of models, with connected autonomous cars, smart city applications, and video surveillance being prominent examples.
   With increasing numbers of computer vision and object detection application scenarios, those requiring ultra-low service latency times have become increasingly prominent; e.g., those for autonomous and connected vehicles or smart city applications. The incorporation of machine learning through the applications of trained models in these scenarios can pose a computational challenge. The softwarization of networks provides opportunities to incorporate computing into the network, increasing flexibility by distributing workloads through offloading from client and edge nodes over in-network nodes to servers. In this article, we present an example for splitting the inference component of the YOLOv2 trained machine learning model between client, network, and service side processing to reduce the overall service latency. Assuming a client has 20% of the server computational resources, we observe a more than 12-fold reduction of service latency when incorporating our service split compared to on-client processing and and an increase in speed of more than 25% compared to performing everything on the server. Our approach is not only applicable to object detection, but can also be applied in a broad variety of machine learning-based applications and services.

TI Field testing the applicability of motorcycle autonomous emergency
   braking (MAEB) during pre-crash avoidance maneuver
SO TRAFFIC INJURY PREVENTION

DT Article
DE Motorcycle; active safety; autonomous emergency braking; lane-change
   maneuver; avoidance maneuver
AB Objective
   Autonomous Emergency Braking (AEB) is a promising technology for crash avoidance or pre-crash impact speed reduction through the automatic application of braking force. Implementation of AEB technology on motorcycles (MAEB) is still problematic as its interaction with the rider may compromise the safety. In previous studies, MAEB interventions at low decelerations were shown to be easily manageable by common riders in straight line condition, but they were not previously tested in lateral maneuvers such as lane change and swerving, which are common in pre-crash situations. The objective of this paper is to assess the applicability of MAEB activation during lateral avoidance maneuver and to estimate its benefits in this scenario.
   Methods
   Field tests were carried out involving common riders as participants, using a test protocol developed on the experience of previous studies. The test vehicle was a sport-touring motorcycle equipped with an automatic braking system that could be activated remotely by researchers to simulate MAEB intervention. The motorcycle was equipped with outriggers to prevent capsizing. The Automatic Braking (AB) interventions using a nominal deceleration of 0.3 g were deployed at pseudo-random times in conditions of straight-line travel and a sharp lane-change maneuver emulating a pre-crash avoidance action. The straight-line trials were used as the reference condition for analysis.
   Results
   Thirty-one participants experienced AB interventions in straight-line and lane-change at an average speed of 44.5 km/h. The automatic braking was deployed in all the key phases of the avoidance maneuver. The system reached a deceleration of 0.3 g for a time of intervention of approximately 1 s. The participants were consistently able to control the vehicle during the automatic braking interventions and were always able to complete the lane-change maneuver. The speed reductions obtained with the AB interventions during lane change were very similar to those obtained in the straight-line conditions.
   Conclusions
   MAEB interventions with decelerations up to 0.3 g can be easily managed by motorcycle riders not only in straight-line conditions but also during an avoidance maneuver. Further investigations using higher deceleration values are now possible.

AB Here we describe a proof-of-concept autonomous unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) system that utilizes the fluorescence characteristics unique to different materials to scan and acquire targets in the field that includes fossils, rocks and minerals, organisms and archaeological artefacts. This is possible because these targets are often highly fluorescent against lower fluorescence backgrounds and may exhibit different colours. To detect these targets from a moving UAV, we utilize laser-stimulated fluorescence. This involves an intense laser beam that-unlike regular UV light-can project greater distances and generate sufficient fluorescence for targets to be detected on the UAV camera many metres above the ground. The system involves a lightweight UAV programmed to fly a waypoint pattern autonomously at night over the area of interest. LIDAR maintains its height above the terrain. A near-UV laser is projected across the ground as a horizontal line directly below the UAV. Co-mounted with the laser is a small highly sensitive video camera stabilized on a motion-controlled gimbal that records the laser line during the flight. An intermittent, powerful white light strobe flashes during the flight to record the UAV's ground position in the scanned area. The UAV returns with the laser video at the end of each autonomous mission. This video is post-processed, extracting the laser line data into a long continuous scan image showing the fluorescing ground targets. Initial analysis determines what colour the targets fluoresce so that a specific colour range can be extracted from the image to identify the locations of the detected targets. The white light strobe images are then used to quickly follow-up on the detections. This system holds the promise of becoming the lowest 'ground truth' layer in the mix of high-altitude map data produced by satellite- and airplane-based Geographic Information Systems. With centimetre resolution and the geochemical differences shown via fluorescence, this system will increase the scale and efficiency of data collection involving fossils, rocks and minerals including mineable materials, fluorescent organisms including biogenic mineral producers like shellfish as well as archaeological artefacts. Thus, the fields of evolution, ecology, Earth and planetary science, archaeology and other subjects involving fluorescent targets would all benefit from this new system.

TI Tethered and Untethered Vehicles: The Future Is in the Past
SO MARINE TECHNOLOGY SOCIETY JOURNAL

DT Editorial Material
AB Underwater vehicle development Canada has been active for more than 40 years. Most of this work has been carried out in British Columbia. The developments include manned submersibles (subs), remotely operated vehicles (ROVs), autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs), and unmanned underwater vehicles. The users of these vehicles include offshore petroleum, telephone cable maintenance, science, surveying, salvage, and military. The enabling technologies for these integrations are mature.
   Today, some services may not be provided by relevant agencies with marine missions worldwide because they are short of the funding needed to discharge duties. There is the constant lament that there are not enough ships, people, or hardware. Perhaps if we are smart enough, we can accomplish a portion of these tasks using advanced technology, which is sometimes considered to be unconventional wisdom-namely robotics.
   Some may observe that many types of underwater vehicles already exist, or at least subsets exist. Therefore, some might wonder if they are any good and why are not more people using them. The reasons are that there is confusion regarding where to establish the boundary conditions for proper comparisons of performance. Another issue is the lack of appreciation of the state of technological evolution. Also, A potential vehicle integrations have not been fielded.
   Another important aspect concerning acceptance that limits the use of vehicles is the changes required in the personnel establishment and the training of people who will use them. We are in a period of transition, and in these transitional periods, false starts can be expected as the vision of the customer and the supplier is sometimes not clear because of a lack of experience. We sometimes see this lack of experience manifested in specifications that describe impossible-to-build vehicles. In this Situation, there are often enormously expensive development efforts attempting to meet impossible specifications.
   This paper presents the use of existing integrations, which have contributed to the development of hybrid vehicles. This contributes to the capability to integrate systems to acquire the data to support the acquisition of data for the submission to the Internal Sea Bed Authority in accordance with Article 76 for those countries that have ratified the United Nations "Law of the Sea" Treaty.
   Article 76 provides instructions regarding how coastal states exercise sovereign rights beyond the customary 200 nautical mile limit. The procedures for defining the outer limits of extended jurisdiction are based upon bathymetric and geological criteria. The procedures impose requirements to assemble, manipulate, visualize, and analyze a wide range of information in an accurate and well-documented fashion that is consistent with the reporting requirements of the International Seabed Authority. Underwater vehicles will be used to obtain some of the information required.
   We need to look at the past and present to project the future.
   "Time present and time past are both perhaps present in time future, and time future contained in time past." T.S. Elliot, 1888-1995
   Over the last four decades, there has been a series of revolutions in our ability to conduct underwater work.
   To date, we appear to have moved through four revolutions. Each of these has adopted the use of their predecessor systems. These are manned subs, ROVs, AUVs, and hybrids.

AB AUV docking requires the platform to have both wide range cruising and accurate operating abilities, to against challenges of ocean currents, obstacles, and constraints. This paper proposed an evolutionary-based method, for the purpose of docking path optimization. First, the ocean environment and constraints are analyzed and modeled. Next, the control points are designed to satisfy the model constraints. Then, the adaptive law and quantum behavior are introduced in particle swarm optimization (PSO), to achieve global time-optimization. Finally, the proposed approach is evaluated via Monte-Carlo trials, which demonstrates a significant improvement with respect to the state-of-the-art approaches.

AB Evolution of public road transportation systems requires analysis and planning tools to improve service quality. A wide range of road transportation simulation tools exist with a variety of applications in planning, training and demonstration. However, few simulation models take into account traveler behaviors and vehicle operation specific to public transportation. We present in this paper a bus-network simulation tools which include these specificities and allows to analyze and evaluate a bus-network at diverse space and time scales. We adopt a multiagent approach to describe the global system operation as behaviors of numerous autonomous entities such as buses and travelers. (C) 2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

ID OPTIMIZATION; NETWORK; SYSTEMS
AB Fuzzy logic controllers are gaining a wide recognition in many industrial applications since they are generally robust under varying operating conditions. However, it may be difficult to design a good controller when observations about the system are scarce or when the system has large number of inputs and outputs. These limitations may result in a system with less than optimal performance. This paper presents an algorithm for optimizing the performance of a fuzzy logic controller using nonlinear programming techniques. As an example, this method is applied to the problem of designing a fuzzy logic controller for the navigation of an autonomous vehicle. The results of the computer simulation and comparison with other techniques for designing fuzzy logic controller are presented and discussed.

TI Domain-Specific Approximation for Object Detection

DT Article
AB There is growing interest in object detection in advanced driver assistance systems and autonomous robots and vehicles. To enable such innovative systems, we need faster object detection. In this article, we investigate the trade-off between accuracy and speed with domain-specific approximations (DSAs) for two state-of-the-art deep learning-based object detection meta-architectures. We study the effectiveness of applying approximation both statically and dynamically to understand their potential and applicability. By conducting experiments on the ImageNet VID dataset, we show that DSA has great potential to improve the speed of the system without deteriorating the accuracy of object detectors. To this end, we present our insights on harvesting DSA and devise a proof-of-concept runtime, AutoFocus, that exploits dynamic DSA.

AB This note presents a novel method to design a controller for the formation of networked mobile robots, where the communication between the members of the group is affected by variable time-delay. The control objective is twofold: to maintain the formation during the motion along a desired path and guarantee no collisions with obstacles or adjacent robots. Initially, an innovative dynamical model is formulated for the system; afterwards, the notion of model predictive control is employed to ensure collision avoidance with guaranteed stability. Simulation results are provided to demonstrate the applicability and effectiveness of the suggested method.

TI Atmosphere Effects on Sonar Sensor Model for UAS Applications

DT Article
AB The use of Unmanned Aerial System (UAS) applications is growing in both civilian and military fields. Fully autonomous UAS applications are useful to a variety of disciplines; for example, they can provide structural damage inspections in critical or dangerous areas (e.g. the L'Aquila earthquake in Italy, or Hurricane Ike in Galveston, Texas, USA). However, in some conditions, such as urban or low altitude operations, the Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) receiver antenna is prone to losing the line-of-sight from the satellite, making GNSS unable to deliver high quality positon information. This is quite dangerous for closed-loop control systems during the landing phase. In these cases, an ultrasonic sensor may be very useful for altitude control during the vehicle landing.

AB The paper describes the results of testing experiments for solving problems of thermometry and positioning of an autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) in the Korean Strait in a shallow sea with less than 10 m of water. The studies were conducted on acoustic tracks up to 615 m long, sensed with complex phase-shift keyed signals with a centeral frequency of 2500 Hz. Under field experiment conditions, it was shown that the resolution of the structure of pulse responses makes it possible to sense temperature changes less than one degree and to secure positioning of the AUV with an accuracy better than 1 m when operating in the near-bottom layer.

AB In curve design such as highway design and motion planning of autonomous vehicles, it may be important to minimize the maximum curvature. In this paper we address the problem of minimizing the maximum curvature of a quadratic Bezier curve within a boundary constraint determined by a tetragonal concave polygon. The curve is parameterized by lengths between its control points, called the "control lengths". Finally, numerical results demonstrate applicability of the method to smooth a piecewise linear path resulting from a path search technique. The results apply whenever it is desired to have a smooth transition between intersecting straight lines. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB In this study, a quasi-autonomous vision-based method is newly proposed for detecting loosened bolts in critical connections. The main idea of the approach is to estimate the rotational angles of bolts from the connection images by integrating deep learning technology with image processing techniques. Firstly, a regional convolutional neural network (RCNN)-based deep learning algorithm is developed to automatically detect and crop plausible bolts in the connection image. Also, the Hough line transform (HLT)-based image processing algorithm is designed to automatically estimate the bolt angles from the cropped bolt images. Secondly, the proposed vision-based approach is validated for bolt-loosening detection in a lab-scale girder connection using images captured by a smartphone camera. The accuracy of the RCNN-based bolt detector and the HLT-based bolt angle estimator are examined under different levels of perspective distortion and shooting distance. Finally, the practicality of the proposed vision-based method is verified on a real-scale girder bridge connection containing numerous bolts. The images of the connection are captured by an unmanned aerial vehicle and transferred to a computer where a quasi-autonomous bolt-loosening detection process is performed via the proposed algorithm. The experimental results demonstrate potentials of the proposed approach for quasi real-time bolt-loosening monitoring of large bolted connections. The results show that the perspective angle should not go beyond 40 degrees to ensure the accuracy of the detection results.

AB For autonomous vehicles, the acquisition frequency difference between LiDAR (10-20 Hz) and camera (over 100 Hz) makes simultaneous update of two perceptive systems (2D/3D) less efficient. Nowadays, frame interpolation is in urgent need for increasing frame rate of point cloud sequences obtained by LiDAR. However, a major limitation of current full supervised methods is that high frame rate ground truth sequences are hard to access. We propose a novel Self-supervised Point Cloud Frame Interpolation Network (SPINet) accommodating with variable motion situation, retaining geometric consistency, but without the necessity of utilizing G.T. data. Extensive experiments show that our proposed SPINet outperforms the current full supervised methods.

The proposed SWS ecosystem has two primary components: a mapping service which generates large-scale landmark maps, and the SWS vehicle itself, which is a client of the mapping service. The SWS prototype integrates 3D LIDAR/imaging systems which provide robust perception in unstructured, outdoor environments. It also leverages these same sensors for map-based localization. In demonstrating the efficacy of the approach, the SWS navigated autonomously over a distance of more than 12 km in a representative urban environment without once losing localization, and without the use of GPS.

AB Safe, precise, and efficient lunar landings must detect and avoid hazardous boulders, craters, and slopes while identifying predeployed assets and managing fuel consumption. This paper describes an algorithm to designate landing points during lunar descent. Inputs to the algorithm are the lander footprint, divert AV costs, detected hazards, and identified points of interest. The algorithm is designed to accept any number of input cost functions and constraints, ensuring flexibility to a variety of missions. The input cost functions are weighted and input into a search algorithm that returns all feasible landing points on the map, prioritized by the weighted cost function. The output of the algorithm is a set of landing aim points. The algorithm provides onboard crew or autonomous robotic vehicles with landing point designation capabilities.

ID TRACKING
AB The equations of state evolution of a linear-jump system have a hybrid structure in which a modal-state process indexes the model of dynamic evolution of the base state. When the state measurements are noisy, the intrinsic nonlinearities in the system make it difficult to achieve acceptable performance with control algorithms based upon conventional estimators. Effective control reconfiguration requires that the correlation between the state and modal errors be computed. This paper presents an estimation algorithm that can be used in this context. It is shown by an example that closed-loop performance is improved when certain cross moments are utilized. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Quadrotors are autonomous aerial vehicles widely developed in the last decade due to their small size, low weight and vertical take off and landing capabilities. Nowadays, some demanding applications involve the quadrotor interacting with rigid objects, requiring stable contact and force tracking. In this paper, an attitude control is proposed to handle force tracking by exploiting the high couplings among force, position and attitude dynamics. The proposed controller enforces a fractional sliding motion in finite-time to guarantee robust force tracking stabilisation in spite of disturbances and dynamical uncertainties. Experiments show additional theoretical and technological features to incorporate this flight mode in applications.

   HURRICANE; VARIABILITY; TRANSPORT; RADAR; ADCP
AB Bathymetry, current, temperature, and depth (CTD) measurements using a small, mobile, autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) platform are described. Autonomous surveys of a shallow water column off the east coast of Florida during December 1997 were carried out using a 2.13-m long, 0.53-m maximum diameter Ocean Explorer series AUV, equipped with a 1200-kHz acoustic Doppler current profiler (ADCP) and a CDT package. At a speed of 1-2 m s(-1), this AUV can perform preprogrammed missions over a period of several hours, collecting in situ oceanographic data and storing it on an onboard datalogger. The vehicle may also carry side-scan sonar or a custom small-scale turbulence measurement package or other instruments for subsidiary measurements. The versatility of the AUV allows measurement of oceanographic data over a substantial region, the motion of the platform being largely decoupled from that of any surface mother ship.
   In the missions of 5 and 11 December 1997, "lawn mower pattern" AUV surveys were conducted over 1 km(2) regions on the east coast of Florida, north of Fort Lauderdale, at depths of 7 and 3 m, respectively, in a water column where the depth ranged from 10 to 32 m. During 5 December, the region was subjected to a cold front from the northwest. Local wind measurements show presence of up to 10 m s(-1) winds at temperatures of up to 10 degrees -15 degreesC below normal for the time of the year. The fixed ADCP indicates occurrence of significant internal wave activity in the region. The data collected using the mobile AUV are utilized to develop a map of the bottom topography and examine current, temperature, and density variations in the context of the background information from a fixed bottom-mounted ADCP and Coastal-Marine Automated Network buoys. The work described here is a significant step in the development of an autonomous oceanographic sampling network, illustrating the versatility of an AUV platform. The data collected during the missions described will form part of a bank for information on the impact of a cold front on shallow subtropical waters. The authors expect to repeat the missions during other such fronts.

AB In this article, the Lyapunov theory for uniform practical asymptotic stability (UPAS) is presented and utilized to solve the problem of position control of a planar underwater snake robot (USR). First sufficient conditions for UPAS of a time-varying nonlinear system and a theorem for UPAS of cascaded systems are presented. These are then utilized to design controllers that stabilize the position of a USR when approaching from such a direction that the USR moves against the current. A simulation study of the controller applied to the ideal case is then studied to investigate how the controller performs. Then, the theoretical results are validated through a high-fidelity simulation study.

AB This paper presents a novel dense optical-flow algorithm to solve the monocular simultaneous localisation and mapping (SLAM) problem for ground or aerial robots. Dense optical flow can effectively provide the ego-motion of the vehicle while enabling collision avoidance with the potential obstacles. Existing research has not fully utilised the uncertainty of the optical flow-at most, an isotropic Gaussian density model has been used. We estimate the full uncertainty of the optical flow and propose a new eight-point algorithm based on the statistical Mahalanobis distance. Combined with the pose-graph optimisation, the proposed method demonstrates enhanced robustness and accuracy for the public autonomous car dataset (KITTI) and aerial monocular dataset.

Planned trajectories are compressed using neural networks resulting in considerable reduction of data packet size, while being robust to propagation delays and uncertainty in neighbors' trajectories. Collision avoidance is achieved by means of spatially filtered potential field. Analytical results proving ISpS and generalized small gain conditions are presented for both strongly-and weakly-connected networks, and illustrated by simulations.

AB The effective tracking area of ultra short baseline (USBL) systems strongly relates to the safety of autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs). This problem has not been studied previously. A method for determining the effective tracking area using acoustic theory is proposed. Ray acoustic equations are used to draw rays, which ascertain the effective space. The sonar equation is established in order to discover the available range of the USBL system and the background noise level using sonar characteristics. The available range defines a hemisphere like enclosure. The overlap of the effective space with the hemisphere is the effective area for USBL systems tracking AUVs. Lake and sea trials show the proposed method's validity.

AB Static stabilization of a decentralized discrete-time single-integrator network that is subject to Markovian variation in the communication/sensing topology is considered. In particular, we develop sufficient conditions on the Markovian topology for mean-square stabilization using a decentralized static controller that has no knowledge of the underlying Markov state. Our analysis exposes a deep connection between decentralized control of single-integrator networks with Markovian topology and those with fixed topology: static stabilization of the network with Markovian topology is possible whenever the steady-state time-average of the Markovian topology is amenable to static (fixed-topology-based) decentralized control.

AB Vision guides flight behaviour in numerous insects. Despite their small brain, insects easily outperform current man-made autonomous vehicles in many respects. Examples are the virtuosic chasing manoeuvres male flies perform as part of their mating behaviour and the ability of bees to assess, on the basis of visual motion cues, the distance travelled in a novel environment. Analyses at both the behavioural and neuronal levels are beginning to unveil reasons for such extraordinary capabilities of insects. One recipe for their success is the adaptation of visual information processing to the specific requirements of the behavioural tasks and to the specific spatiotemporal properties of the natural input.

ID ALGORITHM; DESIGN
AB Supported by a novel field definition and recent control theory results, a new method to avoid local minima is proposed. It is formally shown that the system has an attracting equilibrium at the target point, repelling equilibriums in the obstacle centers and saddle points on the borders. Those unstable equilibriums are avoided capitalizing on the established Input-to-State Stability (ISS) property of this multistable system. The proposed modification of the PF method is shown to be effective by simulation for a two variable integrator and then applied to a unicycle-like wheeled mobile robots which is subject to additive input disturbances.

AB This paper presents a distributed deployment algorithm for a network of autonomous agents. The main goal is to perform a coverage task when the sensor effectiveness of each agent varies during the mission. It is also assumed that the agents are subject to communication delays induced by communication faults. To improve the overall performance and guarantee the collision avoidance, the guaranteed multiplicatively-weighted Voronoi (GMW-Voronoi) diagram is introduced. A distributed coverage control is then provided to drive agents in such a way that the coverage performance function is minimized over the regions assigned to agents. The effectiveness of the proposed algorithm is evaluated by simulations.

Tartan Racing's Boss won the competition, completing the course in just over 4 h. This paper describes the software infrastructure developed by the team to support the perception, planning, behavior generation, and other artificial intelligence components of Boss. We discuss the organizing principles of the infrastructure, as well as details of the operator interface, interprocess communications, data logging, system configuration, process management, and task framework, with attention to the requirements that led to the design. We identify the requirements as valuable reusable artifacts of the development process.

AB This article presents a novel recovery method for fixed-wing unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), aimed at enabling operations from marine vessels. Instead of using the conventional method of using a fixed net on the ship deck, we propose to suspend a net under two cooperative multirotor UAVs. While keeping their relative formation, the multirotor UAVs are able to intercept the incoming fixed-wing UAV along a virtual runway over the sea and transport it back to the ship. In addition to discussing the concept and design a control system, this paper also presents experimental validation of the proposed concept for a small-scale UAV platform.

It considers different kind of sensors: infrared and visual cameras and fire detectors. The system is based on a set of multipurpose low-level image-processing functions including segmentation, stabilization of sequences of images, and geo-referencing, and it also involves data fusion algorithms for cooperative perception. It has been tested in field experiments that pursued autonomous multi-UAV cooperative detection, monitoring, and measurement of forest fires. This paper presents the overall architecture of the perception system, describes some of the implemented cooperative perception techniques, and shows experimental results on automatic forest fire detection and localization with cooperating UAVs.

The proposed adjustment mechanism with the PD controller have been designed for the altitude movement, directional and lateral dynamics of a fixed-wing miniture aerial autonomous vehicle (MAV). Several simulations have been carried out in order to analyze the response of the modified MIT rule.

AB We describe a new technology that can provide near real-time telemetry of sensor data from the ocean bottom without a moored buoy or a cable to shore. The breakthrough technology that makes this system possible is an autonomous surface vehicle called a Wave Glider developed by Liquid Robotics, Inc. of Sunnyvale, CA, which harvests wave and solar energy for motive and electrical power. We present results from several deployments of a prototype system that demonstrate the feasibility of this concept. We also demonstrated that a wave glider could tow a suitably designed ocean bottom package with acceptable loss of speed. With further development such a system could be deployed autonomously and provide real-time telemetry of data from seafloor sensors.

AB The successful mission of an autonomous airborne system like an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) strongly depends on its accurate navigation. While GPS is not always available and pose estimation based solely on Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU) drifts, image-based navigation may become a cheap and robust additional pose measurement device. For the actual navigation update a landmark-based approach is used. It is essential that the used landmarks are well chosen. Therefore we introduce an approach for evaluating landmarks in terms of the matching distance, which is the maximum misplacement in the position of the landmark that can be corrected. We validate the evaluations with our 3D reconstruction system working on data captured from a helicopter. Copyright (C) 2009 S. Lang and M. Kirchhof.

ID DOPPLER CURRENT PROFILER
AB Many zooplankton species perform diel vertical migrations (DVM) which, in conjunction with vertical current shear, complicate the use of conventional fixed-depth drifters to account for advection. Here we illustrate the first use of an autonomous Vertically Migrating Drifter (VMD) to mimic DVM behavior. The vehicle resides within different subsurface layers at different times of day through either active hover cycles or passive drifts. It moves vertically between these layers at speeds comparable to those recorded for migratory populations. In this mode, it can be utilized as a tool to estimate the advection of migratory zooplankton in regions of high vertical current shear and can be employed as a Lagrangian tracer when attempting to sample the same population repeatedly over time.

AB The main stream of development of autonomous driving technology (ADT) is for four-wheel motor vehicles. ADT for motorcycles has received scant attention. The motorcycle stability tends to diminish when being driven at extremely low speed. This study addresses how a motorcycle should be stabilized under low-speed driving. To obtain a linearized motorcycle model without skidding, we introduce a model based on SPACAR, a finite element method computation program. Moreover, velocity-dependent gain-scheduling linear quadratic regulator (LQR) is applied. The experimental results demonstrate stabilized driving responses at 1.5 km/h, which is slower than a person's typical walking speed. (c) 2021 Institute of Electrical Engineers of Japan.

AB Teams of land-based, airborne, or submerged robots constitute a new breed of robotic systems for which the issue of controlled behavior arises naturally. In this brief, we model the dynamics of the robot team in the discrete-event system (DES) framework and design a reconfigurable system that can handle situations in which robot units may switch offline. In particular, we exploit the dichotomy between controllable and uncontrollable behavior to synthesize a supervisor using only controllable events, but also one whose structure adapts to uncontrollable events. This brief presents a novel method based on learning and verification for restoring supervision as well as behavioral assurance of the team.

AB In this paper, we consider a problem of autonomous search using single or multiple Unmanned Ariel Vehicles (UAVs) mounted with downward-facing cameras. A model of the effectiveness of the search sensor, camera, in this case, is essential for developing strategies for optimal deployment and path planning of UAVs for efficient search. The probability of detection of a target of interest as a function of its distance from the point directly below the camera is used to model the search effectiveness. We carried out experiments and obtained a search effectiveness model for a camera in the laboratory environment using ArUco markers and triangular shapes as targets.

AB The implementation of autonomous vehicles involves an increase in the number and depth of system interactions in comparison to user-driven cars. There is a corresponding need to address the system safety implications of autonomy. Traditional hazard analysis techniques are not designed to identify hazardous states caused by system interactions. An emerging technique based on systems theory, Systems Theoretic Process Analysis (STPA), allows for inclusion of system-level causal factors by focusing on component interactions. This study researches the application of STPA to a lane keeping assist system, resulting in identification of design constraints and requirements needed to engineer a safer system.

We then provide basic kinematic and dynamic modeling of drones and their principle of flight. Some representative motion control techniques are then presented, which take into account the issue of under-actuation of the drones. State estimation problem of the drones, that is crucial for their proper flying, yet, should be done only by using onboard sensors and their sensor fusion, is explained. Some emerging research directions requiring capability beyond typical drones are also mentioned.

AB Using inter-satellite range data, the combined autonomous orbit determination problem of a lunar satellite and a probe on some special orbits is studied in this paper. The problem is firstly studied in the circular restricted three-body problem, and then generalized to the real force model of the Earth-Moon system. Two kinds of special orbits are discussed: collinear libration point orbits and distant retrograde orbits. Studies show that the orbit determination accuracy in both cases can reach that of the observations. Some important properties of the system are carefully studied. These findings should be useful in the future engineering implementation of this conceptual study.

One of the best solutions to reduce the global warming is generation of power from the carbon neutral and negative technologies. In view of this, harvesting energy from the photosynthesis is one of the best viable solution. The Microphotosynthetic cell (mu PSC), presented in this work, functions on the principle of photosynthesis and respiration. Typical power produced by a mu PSC varies in the range of 0.1-10 mW.

AB In this paper, we consider the problem of routing multiple robots to service spatially distributed requests at specified time instants. We show that such a routing problem can be formulated as a pure assignment problem. Additionally, we incorporate connectivity constraints into the problem by requiring that range-constrained robots ensure a connected information exchange network at all times. We discuss the feasibility aspects of such a spatio-temporal routing problem, and derive the minimum number of robots required to service the requests. Moreover, we explicitly construct the corresponding routes for the robots, with the total length traveled as the cost to be minimized. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved,

AB The topic of this paper is systems that need be designed such that no single fault can cause failure at the overall level. A methodology is presented for analysis and design of fault-tolerant architectures, where diagnosis and autonomous reconfiguration can replace high cost triple redundancy solutions and still meet strict requirements to functional safety. The paper applies graph-based analysis of functional system structure to find a novel fault-tolerant architecture for an electrical steering where a dedicated AC-motor design and cheap voltage measurements ensure ability to detect all relevant faults. The paper shows how active control reconfiguration can accommodate all critical faults and the fault-tolerant abilities are demonstrated on a warehouse truck hardware.

A unified equipment and process modelling approach is adopted in this paper. The influence of automated guided vehicle (AGV) velocity and positioning control on the time needed to perform a material handling task, and the AGV service time are investigated. The salient features of this research are: modelling intelligent material handling in a distribution centre considering the effect of dynamic constraints on the velocity profiles of an automated handling equipment (a sideload forklift AGV); modelling and simulating controlled vision-based positioning of an AGV; and simulating the process model and drawing conclusions about the possible benefits of autonomous material handling.

TI Simultaneous Utilization of Multiple Radio Access Networks in Ubiquitous
   6G Connectivity for Autonomous Ships: Opportunities and Challenges

AB The growing significance of ubiquitous 6G connectivity within the maritime sector is a consequence of its evolution into an era characterized by the adoption of autonomous ships. This evolution necessitates the development of adaptable communication capabilities, even in the face of increasing heterogeneity in Radio Access Networks (RANs). This heterogeneity is a consequence of the extended lifespans of maritime communication technologies used by both legacy and emerging ships at sea, in contrast to the generational shift seen in terrestrial communication technologies. This paper undertakes a comprehensive examination and provides an insightful overview of communication technologies within the framework of 3rd Generation Partnership Project (3GPP) standards with the aim of preparing for the forthcoming 6G standardization to enable ubiquitous 6G connectivity in the maritime domain. The primary focus of this paper is the mobile RAN entities (e.g., satellites and uncrewed aerial vehicles (UAVs)) positioned for integration into the 5G and beyond systems. These entities are distinguished by their differences from conventional terrestrial RAN entities, which are typically stationary on land. This integration enables User Equipment (UE) to connect to various RAN entities, including mobile RANs, interconnected with core networks, thereby granting UE secure access to external internets through 5G and beyond systems, enabling them to enjoy a diverse range of application services, even in areas beyond terrestrial coverage, such as at sea. This paper further conducts an in-depth analysis of a transport layer-level solution known as the Access Traffic Steering, Switching, and Splitting (ATSSS) feature enabling a concurrent connection to multiple RANs for data-traffic delivery. Furthermore, this paper explores opportunities and challenges for future research in the realm of forthcoming 6G standardization within 3GPP, especially when combined with the ATSSS features for the success of autonomous ships within the maritime sector. These considerations encompass the concept of autonomous ships as mobile RAN entities, the integration of legacy maritime communications into the 6G framework, and the variability in maritime channel measurements, generally employed as one of the criteria for selecting an appropriate RAN among multiple options, influenced by uncontrollable factors such as climate change.

AB Maneuvers of human-operated and autonomous marine vessels in the safety zone of drilling rigs, wind farms and other installations present a risk of collision. This article proposes an algorithmic toolkit that ensures maneuver safety, taking into account the restrictions imposed by ship dynamics. The algorithms can be used for anomaly detection, decision making by a human operator or an unmanned vehicle guidance system. We also consider a response to failures in the vessel's control systems and emergency escape maneuvers. Data used by the algorithms come from the vessel's dynamic positioning control system and positional survey charts of the marine installations.

AB The variance of a spectral estimate of a stochastic process is essential to the formulation and performance of a spectral classifier. The overall variance of a spectral estimate originates from two sources: the within-class spectral uncertainty and the variance introduced in the spectral estimation procedure. In this paper, we derive the total variance of a periodogram-based spectral estimate under some assumptions. Using this result, we formulate a linear spectral classifier based on Fisher's separability metric. The classifier is used to classify two oceanographic processes: ocean convection versus internal waves.

ID UNDERWATER
AB Underwater acoustic networks are generally formed by acoustically connected ocean bottom sensor nodes, autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs), and surface stations that serve as gateways and provide radio communication links to on-shore stations. The quality of service of such networks is limited by the low bandwidth of acoustic transmission channels, high latency resulting from the slow propagation of sound, and elevated noise levels in some environments. The long-term goal in the design of underwater acoustic networks is to provide for a self-configuring network of distributed nodes with network links that automatically adapt to the environment through selection of the optimum system parameters. This article considers several aspects in the design of shallow water acoustic networks that maximize throughput and reliability while minimizing power consumption.

AB A Doppler compensation system is presented which is suitable for high-data-rate acoustic communication between rapidly moving platforms such as autonomous underwater vehicles. The proposed approach provides a generic preprocessor to conventional adaptive receiver structures with only a marginal increase in computational load and hardware cost. The preprocessor employs a novel Doppler estimation technique and efficient sample rate con conversion to remove Doppler shift induced by platform velocity and acceleration. Performance predicted by simulation is compared to that of sea trials of a prototype communication system in the North Sea. Successful communication is demonstrated at 16 kbit/s with a transmitting platform moving at up to +/- 2.6 m/s.

AB In intelligent transportation systems, one key challenge for managing ride-hailing services is the balancing of traffic supply and demand while meeting passenger needs within vehicle availability constraints. Accurate origin-destination (OD) demand predictions can empower platforms to execute timely reallocation of cruising vehicles and improve ride-sharing services. Nonetheless, the complexity of OD-based demand prediction arises from intricate spatiotemporal dependencies and a higher need for precision compared to zone-based predictions, which leads to many unprecedented OD pairs. To tackle this issue, we design a comprehensive set of 102 features, including travel demand, passenger count, travel volume, liveliness, weather, and cross features. We also introduce an enhanced conformer model, which is composed of a single conformer block that integrates feedforward layers, multihead self-attention mechanisms, and depth-wise separable convolution layers. To address the cold-start problem and manage large values, we design a specific algorithm for OD pairs lacking training data and apply a technique to handle larger values. Our approach demonstrates a marked improvement in prediction performance, with an 18% decrease in the total travel demand error and up to a 47% reduction for certain larger values in some cases. Through extensive experiments on a dataset collected from a city, provided by a ride-hailing platform, our proposed methods significantly outperform the most advanced models.

AB Small unmanned air vehicles (UAVs) have many advantages, including low cost and flexible deployment. And they play an important role to collect the sensing data of Internet of Things (IoT). However, limited by the load capability, it is a big challenge for them to perform long-term, large range, or far distance tasks. In order to tackle these challenges, we propose to use assembly UAVs, in which we can jointly optimize the resource management, especially, the energy resource. The system model, energy cyclic cooperation, and one of the typical applications based on assembly UAVs are introduced. The energy cooperation problems are formulated and an in-air replenishing strategy (IA-RS) is proposed. Simulations show that the performances of the proposed IA-RS outperform those of the traditional on-ground replenishing strategy (OG-RS). The working time of task UAV (UAV-T) could reduce 8.3%-19.5%, and the freshness of the collected data and the collecting efficiency of the UAV-T can be improved. We also optimize the path of the replenishing UAVs (UAV-Rs). Simulations show that the proposed reinforcement learning (RL) algorithm has the best performances and acceptable complexity. Consequently, the efficiency of the IoT data collection task is improved by the proposed assembly UAVs.

SO JOURNAL OF ADVANCED TRANSPORTATION

DT Article
ID VEHICLES; TRUCK
AB As the emergence of the connected and autonomous vehicles (CAVs), the platooning technology is believed to play a key role in the future intelligent transportation system. However, current studies mainly focus on the beneficial sides of CAV platoons, and less attention is given to their negative effects. This study develops a mixed equilibrium model for CAV platoons and human-driven vehicles (HDVs), which consider both the positive and negative sides of CAV platooning. On the positive side, CAV platoons are assumed to follow user equilibrium (UE) route choice for their information advantages, while HDVs to follow stochastic user equilibrium (SUE). CAV platoons are also presumed to improve the road capacity. On the negative side, the speed of CAV platoons is slower than that of HDVs for safety stakes, which will impede the latter to overtake. The HDVs is split up into overtaking and nonovertaking flows with different speeds. Furthermore, the model is built up as a mixed UE-SUE equilibrium problem and reformulated as a nonlinear complementarity problem. In addition, an optimal path platooning method is proposed to reduce the negative effects, by integrating travel costs of both CAV platoons and HDVs into its objective function. Numerical results show that the introduction of CAV platoons may increase the travel cost at the initial stage, and the proposed method can effectively reduce the platooning disturbance, thus helps promoting the wider applications of CAV platoons.

Network service customers, on their side, monitor services provided to them, to optimize their network usage and apply, when required, penalties related to service failures. In future 6G networks, critical network applications such as remote surgery and connected vehicles will require these SLAs to be more dynamic, flexible, and automated to match their diverse requirements on network services. Moreover, these SLAs should be transparent to all stakeholders to address the trustworthiness on network services and service providers required by critical applications. Currently, there is no standardized method to immutably record and audit SLAs, leading to challenges in aspects such as SLA enforcement and accountability - traits essential for future network applications. This work explores new requirements for future service contracts, that is, on the evolution of SLAs. Based on those new requirements, we propose an end to end layered SLA architecture leveraging Distributed Ledger Technology (DLT) and smart contracts. Our architecture is inheritable by an existing telco-application layered architectural frameworks to support future SLAs. We also discuss some limitations of DLT and smart contracts and provide several directions of future studies.

AB Unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) can effectively work as temporary base station or access point in the air to transfer/receive data to/from ground terminals (GTs). However, UAV-GT links might be blocked by ground obstacles, like buildings in urban area, leading to a poor performance on data transferring rate. To address this problem, reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS), as a promising technique, can intelligently reflect the received signals between UAV and GT to significantly enhance the communication quality. Under this deployment of RIS-assisted UAV, we intend to jointly optimize the 3D-space of the UAV and the phase-shift of the RIS to maximize the data transferring rate of the UAV, while minimizing the UAV propulsion energy. The joint problem is non-convex in its original form and difficult to be timely solved by using traditional method, like successive convex approximation (SCA). Therefore, to facilitate the online decision making to this joint problem, we leverage deep reinforcement learning (DRL) to learn the near-optimal solution, and the well known Double Deep Q-Network (DDQN) and Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (DDPG) algorithms are ultilized. Numerical results show that DRL can effectively improve the energy-efficiency performance of the RIS-Assisted UAV system, compared with benchmark solutions.

AB Automated guided vehicles (AGVs) have been widely adopted in the logistic delivering of modern manufacturing. As a key performance index for an AGV, the positioning accuracy of commercial AGVs based on the traditional magnetic tracking approach is bigger than ?5mm, which cannot meet the requirement of many industrial applications. Thus, we proposed a novel magnetic tracking approach to improve the positioning accuracy of AGVs. A super strong magnetic nail, instead of the low-remanence magnetic nail, can be more easily tracked by a two-dimensional (2D) rather than 1 D sensor array. The magnetic flux intensity around the magnetic nail can be expressed as a dipole model. Hence, the location and orientation of the nail can be computed via the sensor array data and a hybrid optimization algorithm, which is combined by the particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm and Levenberg-Marquardt (LM) algorithm performed on a microcontroller. We carried out experiments to verify the performance of the proposed positioning system in a series of initial driving speeds and target distances, where an N35 neodymium magnetic nail functioned as the designated AGV positioning point. Results show that the average positioning accuracy is improved to ?1.69mm, and the positioning accuracy can be further improved by a better motion control strategy. In addition, our proposed magnetic tracking approach can be easily fused with other navigation approaches such as laser and inertial sensing.

AB Time-varying connectivity is one of main challenges faced by controlling a team of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) in the multipath fading channel, incurring low accuracy and significant convergence time of formation control law. To address this issue, in this study, a topology optimised based decentralised consensus is developed for controlling a multi-UAV system in a multipath fading channel, in which a formation structure reconfiguration scheme is proposed as well as a transmission power allocating algorithm to guarantee the control accuracy in a limited convergence time. In particular, the objective function for topology optimisation is well-designed by considering the second eigenvalue of Laplacian matrix of topology as a feasible index of connectivity degree. To improve the efficiency of information transmission, a specified consensus protocol is proposed with well-tailored packet format and signalling procedure for control messages. Through the comparative simulation results, the proposed consensus can achieve high convergence accuracy and less convergence time in a multipath fading channel, indicating high resilience of the proposed protocol under a multipath fading channel.

AB The control of underactuated Euler-Lagrange systems with uncertain and switched parameters is an important problem whose solution has many applications. The problem is challenging as standard adaptive control techniques do not extend to this class of systems due to structural constraints that lead to parameterization difficulties. This note proposes an adaptive switched control framework that handles the uncertainty and switched dynamics without imposing structural constraints. A case study inspired by autonomous vessel operations is used to show the effectiveness of the proposed approach.

ID ACOUSTIC COMMUNICATION
AB Very long-range underwater acoustic communication (UAC) is crucial for long cruising (>1000 km) autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs). Very long-range UAC source for AUV must exhibit high electro-acoustic efficiency (>60%) and compactness. This paper describes the Janus-Hammer Bell (JHB) transducer that has been designed for this purpose and meets those requirements. The transducer works on the 450-550 Hz bandwidth and reaches source level above 200 dB (ref. 1 mu Pa at 1m) with 1 kW excitation and full immersion capability. JHB source has been used for communication experiments by the Japanese institute for marine technology (Japan Agency for Marine-Earth Science and Technology) achieving a baud rate of 100 bits/s at 1000 km.

AB A novel autonomous obstacle avoidance controller for the safe landing of a Mars mission in hazardous terrain is developed. The controller uses iterative, closed-loop reactions based on feedback of the landing site terrain. The method was evaluated using a Monte Carlo simulation, including models of reference vehicle dynamics, landing site terrain, and a light detection and ranging sensor. An expected safe landing rate of approximately 60% was shown with no obstacle avoidance control. With the controller, success rates improved to 72.2% for a low control authority thruster design and 97.4% for a high control authority thruster design. The effectiveness of the novel strategy is compared to previous methods. Implications regarding the importance of control logic design and thruster design are inferred.

AB The distribution of irradiance in the upper ocean was examined from sensors mounted on an Autonomous Underwater Vehicle ( AUV). Apparent and inherent optical properties along with physical variability ranging from scales O( 10 cm) to O( 1 km) were collected off the coast of Oregon during the summer of 2004. Horizontal wavenumber spectra of downwelling irradiance showed that irradiance varied as a function of wavenumber and depth. The analysis indicates that irradiance variability between 1 and 20 m spatial scales was attributed to the focusing effects of surface wave geometry. The dominant wavelength of focusing at depths of 2 - 6 m was about 2 m for similar to 6 m s(-1) wind speeds. (c) 2005 Optical Society of America.

AB The paper presents neural dynamic optimization (NDO) as a method of optimal feedback control for nonlinear multi-input-multi-output (MIMO) systems. The main feature of NDO is that it enables neural networks to approximate the optimal feedback solution whose existence dynamic programming (DP) justifies, thereby reducing the complexities of computation and storage problems of the classical methods such as DR This paper mainly describes the theory of NDO, while the two other companion papers of this topic explain the background for the development of NDO and demonstrate the method with several applications including control of autonomous vehicles and of a robot arm, respectively.

DT Article
AB In this paper we present a compact direct current injection thermo-optic switch based on a Mach-Zehnder Interferometer configuration that is suitable for autonomous vehicle applications as it has a low heating resistance value of 97 Omega a rapid 2.16 ps switching time constant, and a P pi of 28 mW. The device relies on multimode interference to achieve low optical insertion losses of less than 1.1 dB per device, while allowing direct current injection to heat the waveguide and achieve fast operation speeds. Furthermore, the total resistive value can be tailored as the heating elements are placed in parallel. (C) 2019 Optical Society of America under the terms of the OSA Open Access Publishing Agreement

AB Two three-dimensional localization algorithms for a swarm of underwater vehicles are presented. The first is grounded on an extended Kalman filter (EKF) scheme used to fuse some proprioceptive data such as the vessel's speed and some exteroceptive measurements such as the time of flight (TOF) sonar distance of the companion vessels. The second is a Monte Carlo particle filter localization processing the same sensory data suite. The results of several simulations using the two approaches are presented, with comparison. The case of a supporting surface vessel is also considered. An analysis of the robustness of the two approaches against some system parameters is given.

Different possibilities allow to generate detailed maps of the environment based on chirp-sequence radar sensors for advanced driver assistance systems (ADASs). For the first time, this letter shows a qualitative comparison between synthetic aperture radar (SAR)- and occupancy grid map (OGM)-based environment representation using identical measurement data. The differences of existing signal processing chains as well as a visual measurement-based comparison of the resulting environmental maps is presented.

AB The Endeavour Segment of the Juan de Fuca Ridge is well known for its abundance of hydrothermal vents and chimneys. One-meter scale multibeam mapping data collected by an autonomous undersea vehicle revealed 572 chimneys along the central 14 km of the segment, although only 47 are named and known to be active. Hydrothermal deposits are restricted to the axial graben and the near-rims of the graben above a seismically mapped axial magma lens. The sparse eruptive activity on the segment during the last 4,300 years has not buried inactive chimneys, as occurs at more magmatically robust mid-ocean ridges.

AB The growth of 3D imaging across a range of sectors has driven a demand for beam steering technology. Fields as diverse as autonomous vehicles and medical imaging can benefit from a high speed, adaptable method of beam steering. We present a monolithic, submicrosecond electro-optic switch as a solution toward the need for reliability, speed, dynamic addressability, and compactness. Here, we demonstrate a laboratory-scale, solid-state light detection and ranging system, using the electro-optic switch to launch modulated coherent light into free space and then to collect the reflected signal. We use coherent detection of the reflected light to simultaneously extract the range and axial velocity of targets at each of the several electronically addressable output ports.

AB Autonomous Underwater Vehicle (AUV) can be utilized to directly measure the geomagnetic map in deep sea. The traditional map interpolation algorithms based on sampling continuation above the sea level yield low resolution and accuracy, which restricts the applications such as the deep sea geomagnetic positioning, navigation, searching and surveillance, etc. In this letter, we propose a Three-Dimensional (3D) Compressive Sensing (CS) algorithm in terms of the real trajectory of AUV which can be optimized with the required accuracy. The geomagnetic map recovered with the CS algorithm shows high precision compared with traditional interpolation schemes, by which the magnetic positioning accuracy can be greatly improved.

AB Consensus control for multiple autonomous underwater vehicles(AUVs) with imperfect information due to communication faults is established in this paper. Two novel fault tolerant consensus control techniques are addressed with respect to leaderless multiple AUV systems and leader -follower multiple AUV systems. The proposed control architectures are constructed so that each AUV exchanges information with its neighboring AUVs, i.e. distributed consensus control strategies are emphasized to tolerate information transmission faults for multiple AUV systems. The simulation study is carried out to show the effectiveness of the proposed theoretical analysis. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB In multi-component systems, individual components must be assigned to the tasks that they are to perform. In many applications, there are several possible task decompositions that could be used to achieve the task, and there are limited resources available throughout the system. We present a technique for making task assignments under these conditions. Constraint satisfaction is used to assign components to particular tasks. Heuristics suggest a task decomposition for which an assignment can be found efficiently. We have applied our technique to the problem of task assignment in systems of underwater robots and instrument platforms working together to collect data in the ocean.

ID KEY AGREEMENT SCHEME; ROUTING PROTOCOL; AUTHENTICATION; VANETS
AB Recently, vehicular ad hoc networks (VANETs) got much popularity and are now being considered as integral parts of the automobile industry. As a subclass of MANETs, the VANETs are being used in the intelligent transport system (ITS) to support passengers, vehicles, and facilities like road protection, including misadventure warnings and driver succor, along with other infotainment services. The advantages and comforts of VANETs are obvious; however, with the continuous progression in autonomous automobile technologies, VANETs are facing numerous security challenges including DoS, Sybil, impersonation, replay, and related attacks. This paper discusses the characteristics and security issues including attacks and threats at different protocol layers of the VANETs architecture. Moreover, the paper also surveys different countermeasures.

The working environment of multi-AUV (autonomous underwater vehicle) cooperative systems is complex and the reliability under different environmental conditions is different. This work adopts the Kraken normal mode method to get the transmission loss, and calculates the reliability of the communication link based on the relationship between the transmission loss and signal-to-noise ratio. All-terminal reliability of multi-AUV cooperative systems can be obtained.

AB As part of the upcoming Mars 2020 rover mission, NASA is planning to include an autonomous helicopter to demonstrate the feasibility and utility of using helicopters for Mars exploration. Helicopter flight on Mars is challenging due to the extremely thin atmosphere, which is only partially offset by a reduction in gravity. This paper focuses on flight dynamics and controllability issues for the Mars Helicopter: in particular, the areas in which the dynamics differs from typical behavior on Earth. The paper discusses insights gained from modeling and simulation, as well as system identification performed with a test vehicle in the relevant atmospheric conditions, which culminated in the first demonstration of controlled helicopter flight in Martian atmospheric conditions in May 2016.

It enables the simultaneous tracking of the target body and micro-Doppler components that originate from the motion of rotors (if any) onboard an unmanned air system. This not only delivers more accurate multi-target tracking, but also substantially improves the radar automatic target classification capability (e.g. discriminating between drone and non-drone targets). Challenging and diverse real staring radar datasets are used here to demonstrate the efficacy and benefits of the proposed track management approach.

DT Article
AB The main challenges of sequential estimations of underwater navigation applications are the internal/external measurement noise and the missing measurement situations. A quadratic interpolation-based variational Bayesian filter (QIVBF) is proposed to solve the underwater navigation problem of measurement information missing or insufficiency. The quadratic interpolation is used to improve the observed vector for the precision and stability of sequential estimations when the environment is changed or the measurement information is lost. The state vector, the predicted error covariance matrix, and the measurement noise matrix are derived based on the variational Bayesian method. Simulation results demonstrate the superiority of the proposed QIVBF compared with the traditional algorithm under the condition of measurement information lost by autonomous underwater vehicles.

AB The article presents an algorithmic framework for the automated analysis of benthic imagery data. The data are collected by an autonomous underwater vehicle for the purpose of population assessment of epibenthic organisms, such as scallops. The architecture consists of three layers of processing: visual attention, graph-cut segmentation methods, and template matching. The visual attention layer filters the imagery input, focusing subsequent processing only on regions in the images that are likely to contain target objects. The segmentation layer prepares for subsequent template matching. Finally, template matching classifies filtered objects into targets and distractors. The significance of the proposed approach is in its modular nature and its ability to process imagery datasets of low resolution, brightness, and contrast.

AB Featured Application A Smart Capsule enabling medical staff to activate intuitively autonomous delivery mission of drones for transportation of medical materials. In the last few years, many examples of blood and medicine delivery drones have been demonstrated worldwide, which mainly rely on aeronautical experience that is not common in the medical world. Speaking about drone delivery, attention should focus on the most important thing: the transported lifesaving good. Traditional boxes that monitor temperature are not usually in real time, and are not suitable for drone transportation because they are heavy and bulky. This means that the biomedical characteristics of delivery are of primary importance. A Smart Capsule, equipped with artificial intelligence (AI), is the first system ever proposed to provide a fully autonomous drone delivery service for perishable and high-value medical products, integrating real-time quality monitoring and control. It consists in a smart casing that is able to guide any autonomous aerial vehicle attached to it, specifically designed for transporting blood, organs, tissues, test samples and drugs, among others. The system monitors the conditions of the product (e.g., temperature, agitation and humidity) and adjusts them when needed by exploiting, for instance, vibrations to maintain the required agitation, ensuring that goods are ready to be used as soon as they are delivered. The Smart Capsule also leverages external temperature to reduce energy uptake from the drone, thus improving the drone's battery life and flight range. The system replaces the need for specialized drivers and traditional road-bound transportation means, while guaranteeing compliance with all applicable safety regulations. A series of 16 experimental tests was performed to demonstrate the possibility of using the smart capsule to manage the flight and internal good delivery. Eighty-one missions were carried out for a total of 364 min of flight. The Smart Capsule greatly improves emergency response and efficiency of healthcare systems by reducing delivery times by up to 80% and costs by at least 28%. The Smart Capsule and its enabling technology based on AI for drone deliveries are discussed in this paper. The aim of this work is to show the possibility of managing drone delivery with an AI-based device.

AB Aerial intelligent reconfigurable surface (IRS) is a promising technology to enhance channel quality in data delivery. In this article, we study an aerial IRS deployment problem to enable timely and reliable data delivery in a remote Internet of Things (IoT) scenario, in which an IRS mounted on an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) is adopted as a mobile relay to assist devices in uploading data to the base station (BS). The objective is to minimize the average Age of Information (AoI) of the data received by the BS over time by jointly determining the aerial IRS deployment position and phase shift, transmit power of devices, and data uploading time. Under the requirements of peak AoI (PAoI) and communication reliability, we formulate an average AoI minimization problem. Since the nonlinear relations among optimization variables make the formulated problem nonconvex and intractable to solve, we propose a block coordinate descent (BCD)-based iterative algorithm which decomposes the formulated problem into several subproblems. The variables are optimized in each subproblem individually in an alternately iterative manner to attain a near-optimal solution. Simulation results demonstrate the superiority of the proposed algorithm in improving the information freshness compared with the benchmark schemes.

ID LOCALIZATION
AB To satisfy the autonomous relative navigation demand of unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) formation in a GPS-denied environment, an angle-only relative navigation algorithm is proposed. First, the relative states in 3-dimension space are decoupled into relative motion along the horizontal plane and altitude by applying the relative azimuth between the north-east-down global frame and the body-fixed horizontal frame belonging to UAVs. Second, a relative dynamic and measurement model considering the measurement deviation of sensors are established. This solves the problem of colored noise in a majority of sensors used in practical engineering. Third, a consensus constraint model of relative states is established by introducing a geometric constraint among formation members. Additionally, a consensus-extended Kalman filter is designed. Finally, the angle-only relative navigation method is validated using standard Monte Carlo simulations. The simulation results show that all the states of the system are observable when the observability criterion is satisfied. The relative position accuracy achieved using gyros with a drift rate of 50 degrees/h, accelerometers with 1 mg deviation, and optical cameras with 1 degrees Gaussian white noise is within 10 m (3 sigma). Additionally, the method proposed in this study can be used to estimate the sensor measurement deviations effectively. Furthermore, it can be potentially applied to improve the absolute navigation accuracy of UAVs.

AB Power line detection plays an important role in automatic power inspection systems based on the vision sensor and unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV). The positioning of the power line is essential to assist in planning and navigation along the power line during the UAV-based power inspection process. For the along-line inspection problem of UAV power inspection, we developed a power line extraction (PLE) algorithm based on parallel line detection and straight line stretching. The proposed algorithm first extracts the image edges by the Canny algorithm and then constructs criterion functions for PLE based on power line feature information, e.g., length, width, and direction. Finally, the information on power line location, direction, width, and so on will be combined to get the exact power line regions. In order to effectively evaluate the accuracy and efficiency of the PLE algorithm, we constructed a power line dataset for UAV inspection and proposed a PLE effect evaluation method. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method can effectively reduce the influence of ground environment and other interference factors. Compared with other methods, the proposed algorithm is significantly better than the comparison methods in detecting power lines for the constructed dataset. Moreover, it is still a higher detection accuracy than the comparison methods when the power line is far away from UAV.

AB Aiming at the probe docking control problem in aerial recovery, this article proposes a neural-adaptive probe dynamics direct control algorithm with preassigned docking performance for the unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) to be recovered, even under multiple ambient airflow disturbances and initial docking deviations. The affine nonlinear dynamics of the probe in the inertial axis are formulated, together with the UAV's 6-DOF dynamics, for the convenience of the direct nonlinear docking control design. To compensate UAV's unmeasurable nonlinear dynamics with better approximation property and lower computational burden, the minimal learning parameter (MLP) technique based echo state network (ESN) approximators are constructed by employing the system state approximation errors to adaptively update neural weights learning. Then, to guarantee the preassigned docking performance required by the recovery safety, a finite-time prescribed performance control algorithm incorporated backstepping control law is developed to achieve the desired docking. Both the docking trajectory and forward docking velocity are not only always constrained within the preassigned performance constraints but also finely controlled to achieve accurate rendezvous with the target drogue. The closed-loop stability is discussed with Lyapunov analysis. Numerical simulations are conducted to validate the performance of the docking control algorithm.

AB The numerous applications of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) have caused them to receive growing interest worldwide. However, misused UAVs have caused significant public safety and privacy concerns. Therefore, developing an anti-UAV surveillance system is of paramount importance. In this paper, we propose a radar-based UAV swarm surveillance approach. A frequency estimation-based approach is used to obtain a coarse wave path difference estimate. Then, by combining the coarse estimate from the first stage with an estimate from the phase comparison method, a fine and unambiguous estimate of the wave path difference is derived. Through the solution of a system of nonlinear equations regarding the measured range and wave path difference, the proposed method is able to provide an unambiguous three-dimensional (3D) position estimate for a given UAV swarm. Once such 3D positions have been collected throughout an observation period, system tracks of the UAV swarm can be formed. With these tracks, a target object map (TOM) can be generated and handed over to an interceptor to counter the UAV swarm. Theoretical analyses of the accuracy of the estimation results and the restrictions of the proposed method are presented in detail. Several simulations are also carried out to evaluate the performance of the proposed method.

AB Long-range radars (LRRs) for higher level autonomous driving (AD) will require more antennas than simple driving assistance. The point at issue here is 50-60% of the LRR module area is used for antennas. To miniaturize LRR modules, we use horn and lens antenna with highly efficient gain. In this paper, we propose two high-density implementation techniques for radio-frequency (RF) front-end using horn and lens antennas. In the first technique, the gap between antennas was eliminated by taking advantage of the high isolation performance of horn and lens antennas. In the second technique, the RF front-end including micro-strip-lines, monolithic microwave integrated circuits, and peripheral parts is placed in the valley area of each horn. We fabricated a prototype LRR operating at 77 GHz with only one printed circuit board (PCB). To detect vehicles horizontally and vertically, this LRR has a minimum antenna configuration of one Tx antenna and four Rx antennas placed in 2x2 array, and 30 mm thickness. Evaluation results revealed that vehicles could be detected up to 320 m away and that the horizontal and vertical angle error was less than +/- 0.2 degrees, which is equivalent to the vehicle width over 280 m. Thus, horn and lens antennas implemented using the proposed techniques are very suitable for higher level AD LRRs.

AB In this paper, a dual droop-frequency diving coordinated control strategy is proposed for electric vehicle (EV) applications, where the hybrid energy storage system (HESS) with supercapacitors and batteries is integrated to prolong the life time of storage elements. The dynamic power allocation between the supercapacitor and batteries are obtained through the voltage cascaded control, upon which the high and low frequency power fluctuation are absorbed by the supercapacitors and batteries respectively to fully exploit the advantages of the supercapacitors and batteries. Moreover, the power capacity is scaled up by connecting storage blocks in parallel. A dual droop control scheme for parallel-connected energy storage system and its operation principle is introduced on the aspect of current sharing characteristic and state-of-charging (SOC) management. After detailed analysis and formula derivation, the corresponding loop parameters are designed. Through this control method, the current sharing performance is ensured and each block makes the self-adaptive adjustment according to their SOC. Consequently, the load power can be shared effectively, which helps to avoid the over-charge/ over-discharge operation and contributes to the life cycle of the energy storage system. Each module is autonomous controlled without the necessity of communication, which is easy, economic and effective to realize. Finally, the simulation and experimental results are exhibited to verify the effectiveness of the proposed control scheme.

AB We propose a new approach for the accurate numerical computation of high-order derivatives along geodesic curves on surfaces. The method is based on the observation that for geodesics the Darboux frame and the Frenet-Serret frame are locally equal up to a constant rotation around the tangent. It computes derivatives of arbitrary order from the result of the numerical method employed for computing the geodesic. Since it does not rely on finite difference approximations, no additional discretization errors are introduced. Applications of the method include motion planning of autonomous vehicles and geometric modeling with developable surfaces. (C) 2021 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The convergence of autonomous platforms for field-based phenotyping with advances in machine learning for big data analytics and rapid sequencing for genome description herald the promise of new insights and discoveries in the plant sciences. Han et al. (2021) leverage these emerging tools to navigate the challenging path from field-based mapping of phenotypic features to identifying specific genetic loci in the laboratory: in this case, loci responsible for regulating daily flowering time in lettuce. While their contribution neatly illustrates these exciting technological developments, it also highlights the work that remains to bridge these multidisciplinary fields to more fully deliver upon the promise of digital agriculture.

AB This paper studies the online learning control of a truck-trailer parking problem via adaptive dynamic programming (ADP). The contribution is twofold. First, a novel ADP method is developed for systems with parametric nonlinearities. It learns the optimal control policy of the linearized system at the origin, while the learning process utilizes online measurements of the full system and is robust with respect to nonlinear disturbances. Second, a control strategy is formulated for a commonly seen truck-trailer parallel parking problem, and the proposed ADP method is integrated into the strategy to provide online learning capabilities and to handle uncertainties. A numerical simulation is conducted to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed methodology.

AB Nonorthogonal multiple access (NOMA) and unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) are two promising technologies for the fifth generation (5G) and beyond networks. On the other hand, the transition environment from outdoor to indoor is an important problem in practical wireless communication. In this article, we mathematically study a multiantenna UAV-assisted communication system where a multiantenna base station (BS) communicates with indoor and outdoor users through a multiantenna UAV using the power-domain NOMA technique. The metric used to evaluate the system performance are outage probability (OP) and throughput of indoor and outdoor users under different communication urban environments. Moreover, the impacts of the UAV's altitude and location and the line-of-sight probability on system performance are also considered. We give the exact and asymptotic closed-form OP expressions and then optimize the transmission rate to maximize the throughput of each user and the overall system throughput. Numerical results show that better system performance can be achieved by controlling the altitudes and location of the UAV, selecting an appropriate transmission rate, or equipping BS and UAV with more antennas. Monte Carlo simulation results are provided to demonstrate the performance of the investigated system and the accuracy of the developed analytical results.

AB In this paper, the problem of the deployment and resource management for visible light communication (VLC)-enabled, reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RISs)-assisted unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) networks is investigated. In the considered model, UAVs provide terrestrial users with wireless services and illumination simultaneously. Moreover, RISs are utilized to further improve the channel quality between UAVs and users. This joint placement and resource management problem is constructed aiming at acquiring the optimal UAV deployment, RISs phase shift, user and RIS association that satisfies the users' needs with minimum consumption of the UAVs' energy. An iterative algorithm that alternately optimizes continuous and binary variables is proposed to solve this mixed-integer programming problem. Specifically, RISs phase shift optimization is solved by phases alignment method and semidefinite program algorithm. Next, the successive convex approximation algorithm is proposed to settle the UAV deployment problem. The user and RIS association variables are relaxed to the continuous ones before adopting the dual method to find the optimal solution. Moreover, a greedy algorithm is proposed as an alternative to RIS association optimization with low complexity. Simulation results show that the proposed two schemes harvest the superior performance of 34.85% and 32.11% energy consumption reduction over the case without RIS, respectively.

AB Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) have recently attracted tremendous attentions in both industries and academic communities. Thanks to the high mobility and flexibility, UAVs can be deployed in many scenarios to provide various types of services. In these scenarios, the position of the UAVs must be timely and accurately acquired to avoid UAV collisions and realize millimeter-wave beamforming. Particle swarm optimization (PSO) is a potential approach to fulfill localization under GPS-denied environment. However, it has the drawbacks of high complexity and relative large localization error. In this article, we consider the UAV localization problem based on improved PSO, which aims at reducing complexity and localization error. We firstly analyze the performance metrics and performance bounds of conventional PSO in the considered UAV localization scenario. Then, the particle initialization process is reconsidered, where a particle and search space reduction method is introduced as the hierarchical PSO (HPSO). Next, the particle updating schemes are redesigned based on the particle number, where the reference best particle is introduced to deal with the limitations in conventional PSO, this is called reference PSO (RPSO). Lastly, the proposed HPSO and RPSO are validated in simulation results. It is shown that the proposed PSO method has both reduced complexity and localization error compared with conventional PSO and other reference methods.

AB As a promising enabler for edge intelligence, Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAV) have become more and more important in Mobile Edge Computing Networks (MECN), such as communication, computation, collection and control service supply. Although Age of Information (AoI) minimization is indispensable for fresh information collection and computation in the UAV-aided MECN, some attackers can launch attacks to deteriorate the availability of precious channel resources, such as revealed channel access attacks (CAAs). Moreover, recent research has not considered the system's active probability and security issues concurrently, e.g., CAA, in the average AoI minimization process. In this paper, to deal with this problem, we consider an AoI-oriented channel access problem under CAA with a game theory viewpoint. Firstly, to obtain a MECN-based AoI indicator under CAA, the system model with active probability consideration is established. Next, the channel access-based AoI minimization problem is formulated from the viewpoint of the Ordinary Potential Game (OPG). Furthermore, two algorithms called AACSD and DCASD are proposed to determine channel access strategies, by which the Nash Equilibrium (NE) solution of the OPG could be reached. Finally, experiments are conducted under homogeneous and heterogeneous parameter settings, and the simulation results evaluate the correctness and effectiveness of our proposals.

AB This paper addresses the issue of cooperative control concerning the output synchronization of the linear time-invariant multi-input multi-output multi-agent system i.e., multi-unmanned aerial vehicle (a swarm of the drone), by designing observer-based consensus protocol with directed communication topology. Considering the leader following consensus tracking problem, an observer-based protocol is designed to obtain desirable output synchronization. The protocol design consists of a local observer for the leader drone and a distributed observer for the follower drones. Observer gains are optimized through a multi-step algorithm based on linear quadratic regulator controller and linear matrix inequalities. Most of the existing literature on cooperative control considers full state information for the controller as well as observer design. However, the protocol for the controller and observer design for consensus tracking of multi-unmanned aerial vehicles presented in this paper considers that only the relative partial states information from the corresponding neighboring drones are utilized. The designed algorithm is robust and guarantees that all the states of follower drones track the states of the leader drone and the consensus is achieved asymptotically even in the presence of external disturbances. Finally, considering the ideal and perturbed system, the efficacy of the analytical results are illustrated by comparative analysis using numerical simulations.

AB Technological advancements have focused increasing attention on Automated Mobility-on Demand (AMOD) as a promising solution that may improve future urban mobility. During the last decade, extensive research has been conducted on the design and evaluation of AMOD systems using simulation models. This paper adds to this growing body of literature by investigating the network impacts of AMOD through high-fidelity activity-and agent based traffic simulation, including detailed models of AMOD fleet operations. Through scenario simulations of the entire island of Singapore, we explore network traffic dynamics by employing the concept of the Macroscopic Fundamental Diagram (MFD). Taking into account the spatial variability of density, we are able to capture the hysteresis loops, which inevitably form in a network of this size. Model estimation results at both the vehicle and passenger flow level are documented. Environmental impacts including energy and emissions are also discussed. Findings from the case study of Singapore suggest that the introduction of AMOD may bring about significant impacts on network performance in terms of increased VKT, additional travel delay and energy consumption, while reducing vehicle emissions, with respect to the baseline. Despite the increase in network congestion, production of passenger flows remains relatively unchanged.

AB Aerial vehicles are difficult to stabilize, especially when acted upon by external forces. A hovering vehicle interacting with objects and surfaces must be robust to contact forces and torques transmitted to the airframe. These produce coupled dynamics that are distinctly different from those of free flight. While external contact is generally avoided, extending aerial robot functionality to include contact with the environment during flight opens up new and useful areas such as perching, object grasping, and manipulation. These mechanics may be modeled as elastic couplings between the aircraft and the ground, represented by springs in R-3 x SO(3). We show that proportional derivative and proportional integral derivative (PID) attitude and position controllers that stabilize a rotorcraft in free flight will also stabilize the aircraft during contact for a range of contact displacements and stiffnesses. Simulation of the coupled aircraft dynamics demonstrates stable and unstable modes of the system. We find analytical measures that predict the stability of these systems and consider, in particular, the planar system in which the contact point is directly beneath the rotor. We show through explicit solution of the linearized system that the planar dynamics of the object-helicopter system in vertical, horizontal, and pitch motion around equilibrium remain stable, within a range of contact stiffnesses, under unmodified PID attitude control. Flight experiments with a small-scale PID-stabilized helicopter fitted with a compliant gripper for capturing objects affirm our model's stability predictions.

AB Traffic-calming measures (TCMs) are non-invasive devices designed to improve road mobility and urban areas on a human scale. Despite their potential, they have been in use for a long time and now have to deal with the latest technological innovations in the automotive field, such as cooperative driving technologies (CDTs), to improve energy efficiency in cities. The goal of this study is to explore the safety and operational performances of TCMs featuring CDTs in urban areas. An urban-scale road network close to a seaside area in the City of Mazara del Vallo, Italy, was properly redesigned and simulated in AIMSUN to assess several design solutions, where connected and automated vehicles (CAVs) have been employed as a more energy-efficient public transportation system. Preliminarily, the fine-tuning process of model parameters included CAVs and human-operated vehicles (HOVs) flowing through the network up to saturation conditions. The safety of the planned solutions was tested by using surrogate measures. The micro-simulation approach allowed us to know in advance and compare the operational and safety performances of environmentally friendly solutions involving TCMs and CDTs. These results can also support urban road decision makers in pivoting urban-traffic-calming-based design solutions featuring cooperative driving technologies toward energy efficiency transitions for smart cities.

AB Unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)-assisted multi-access edge computing (MEC) has become one promising solution for energy-constrained devices to run the applications with high computation demand and stringent delay requirement in beyond 5G era. In this work, we study a multi-UAV-assisted two-stage MEC system in which UAVs provide the computing and relaying services to the mobile devices. Due to the limited computing resources, each UAV executes only a portion of the offloaded tasks from its associated MDs in the first stage. Hence, in the second stage, each UAV relays the portions of the tasks to the terrestrial base station (TBS) which has rich computing resources enough to handle all the tasks relayed to it. In this regard, we formulate a joint task offloading, communication and computation resource allocation problem to minimize the energy consumption of MDs and UAVs by considering the limited resources of UAVs and the tolerable latency of the tasks. The formulated problem is a mixed-integer non-convex problem which is NP hard. To solve the formulated optimization problem, we apply the Block Successive Upper-bound Minimization (BSUM) method which guarantees to obtain the stationary points of the non-convex objective function. Finally, the extensive evaluation results are conducted to show the superior performance of our proposed framework.

AB Residential microgrid is widely considered as a new paradigm of the home energy management system. The complexity of Microgrid Energy Scheduling (MES) is increasing with the integration of Electric Vehicles (EVs) and Renewable Generations (RGs). Moreover, it is challenging to determine optimal scheduling strategies to guarantee the efficiency of the microgrid market and to balance all market participants' benefits. In this paper, a Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) approach for residential MES is proposed to promote the autonomy and fairness of microgrid market operation. First, a multi-agent based residential microgrid model including Vehicle-to-Grid (V2G) and RGs is constructed and an auction-based microgrid market is built. Then, distinguish from Single-Agent Reinforcement Learning (SARL), MARL can achieve distributed autonomous learning for each agent and realize the equilibrium of all agents' benefits, therefore, we formulate an equilibrium-based MARL framework according to each participant' market orientation. Finally, to guarantee the fairness and privacy of the MARL process, we proposed an improved optimal Equilibrium Selection-MARL (ES-MARL) algorithm based on two mechanisms, private negotiation and maximum average reward. Simulation results demonstrate the overall performance and efficiency of proposed MARL are superior to that of SARL. Besides, it is verified that the improved ES-MARL can get higher average profit to balance all agents.

AB The tail-flapping propulsion of a robotic fish forms a hydrodynamic pressure field that depends primarily on the flapping frequency and amplitude. In a two-robot aligned group, the tail of the front robot generates an oscillating pressure that is detectable by its follower. This paper proposes a position estimator for the follower to locate the position of the leading robotic fish. The position estimator uses the hydrodynamic pressure measured on a sensor array installed on the forefront of the following vehicle body. We derive a potential flow model to describe the pressure field of the leader in the presence of the follower. Using this pressure field model, we further derive an observability measure which is used to determine the relative positions of the leader and follower for which the position estimator will produce a reliable estimate. The position estimator employs the Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm, due to the nonlinearity of the pressure model. Results from the observability analysis show that a satisfactory estimation of the leader position is achieved when the leader is located directly ahead, on the starboard-bow, or the port-bow of the follower, similar to the formation pattern generally found in a school of fish. The observability analysis also shows that poor estimation is obtained when the leader is abeam of the follower. Tank experiments confirm the observability analysis and also demonstrate the use of the position estimator for feedback control by the follower.

AB In this paper, a fault diagnosis problem for Hypersonic Air Vehicle (HAV) with sensor fault is concerned. Existing fault diagnosis models pay less attention to the problems of high-performance real-time diagnosis and Artificial Intelligence (AI) algorithm autonomous optimization. Therefore, a smart real-time fault diagnosis algorithm is put forward to automatically build a more accurate and rapid model in a short time. Based on the Temporal Convolutional Network (TCN) with tuning parameters optimizing by Strengthen Elitist Genetic Algorithm (SEGA), the Auto Temporal Convolutional Network (AutoTCN) is first proposed. To better diagnose the time-sequence sensor fault signal, the Sequential Probability Ratio Test (SPRT) method is introduced afterwards. Additionally, the Wavelet Packet Translation (WPT) is combined with TCN to enhance the mechanism and sensitivity of the extracted fault features. Experimental results from the HAV model with the Reaction Control System (RCS) control simulated under sensor fault are obtained. It is demonstrated that, for typical sensor faults greater than 8.89%, the real-time fault diagnosis accuracy of the proposed method may exceed 96%. The diagnosis delay is less than 0.05s. Moreover, on the computer equipped with an 8-core CPU, over 87.5% of the working time can be saved. (c) 2021 Elsevier Masson SAS. All rights reserved.

AB Connected and automated vehicles (CAVs) will undoubtedly transform many aspects of transportation systems in the future. In the meantime, transportation agencies must make investment and policy decisions to address the future needs of the transportation system. This research provides much-needed guidance for agencies about planning-level capacities in a CAV future and quantifyHighway Capacity Manual(HCM) capacities as a function of CAV penetration rates and vehicle behaviors such as car-following, lane change, and merge. As a result of numerous uncertainties on CAV implementation policies, the study considers many scenarios including variations in parameters (including CAV gap/headway settings), roadway geometry, and traffic characteristics. More specifically, this study considers basic freeway, freeway merge, and freeway weaving segments in which various simulation scenarios are evaluated using two major CAV applications: cooperative adaptive cruise control and advanced merging. Data from microscopic traffic simulation are collected to develop capacity adjustment factors for CAVs. Results show that the existence of CAVs in the traffic stream can significantly enhance the roadway capacity (by as much as 35% to 40% under certain cases), not only on basic freeways but also on merge and weaving segments, as the CAV market penetration rate increases. The human driver behavior of baseline traffic also affects the capacity benefits, particularly at lower CAV market penetration rates. Finally, tables of capacity adjustment factors and corresponding regression models are developed for HCM implementation of the results of this study.

AB The interest shown by some community of researchers to autonomous drones or UAVs (unmanned aerial vehicles) has increased with the advent of wireless communication networks. These networks allow UAVs to cooperate more efficiently in an ad hoc manner in order to achieve specific tasks in specific environments. To do so, each drone navigates autonomously while staying connected with other nodes in its group via radio links. This connectivity can deliberately be maintained for a while constraining the mobility of the drones. This will be suitable for the drones involved in a given path of a given transmission between a source and a destination. This constraint could be removed at the end of the transmission process and the mobility of each concerned drone becomes again independent from the others. In this work, we proposed a flocking-based routing protocol for UAVs called BR-AODV. The protocol takes advantage of a well known ad hoc routing protocol for on-demand route computation, and the Boids of Reynolds mechanism for connectivity and route maintaining while data is being transmitted. Moreover, an automatic ground base stations discovery mechanism has been introduced for a proactive drones and ground networks association needed for the context of real-time applications. The performance of BR-AODV was evaluated and compared with that of classical AODV routing protocol and the results show that BR-AODV outperforms AODV in terms of delay, throughput and packet loss.

AB The use of Multiple Input Multiple Output (MIMO) orthogonally coded waveforms sharing the same bandwidth, has the potential to increase area coverage rate in synthetic aperture sonar (SAS). The disadvantage is cross-talk between the waveforms. In this letter, the benefits and limitations are listed for a best case use of MIMO in SAS. A scheme is developed to emulate a MIMO system with realistic cross-talk that can be tested on non-MIMO SAS data. The impact of cross-talk is evaluated on simulated data and real data collected by a HISAS interfereometric SAS carried by a HUGIN autonomous underwater vehicle. The finding is that the negative impact of cross-talk on SAS is significant.

AB Star trackers are autonomous, high-accuracy electronic systems used to determine the attitude of a spacecraft. In recent years, commercial-off-the-shelf (COTS)-based star trackers are growing in importance for low-cost and short-duration missions, but their fault tolerance against soft errors has not been studied in detail. In this paper, we propose a self-healing system protected with ad hoc techniques that can be used as the first step to implement a fault-tolerant COTS-based star tracker for smallsat applications.

AB This paper put forwards a model-free adaptive neural finite-time formation-containment (FC) control scheme for time-delayed underactuated unmanned underwater vehicles (UUVs) with unknown dynamic models and some interaction information under switching topologies. The UUVs are steered by multiple child leaders moving along with a root leader, where all leaders are virtual and defined by a new generalized dynamic. A novel autoregressive model-based state predictor is created for each UUV, which can construct future motion states online relying on current and stored states. Considering the containment layer, a finite-time super-twisting observer is used to recover the unavailable interaction information. Moreover, observer-based finite-time kinematic guidance laws employing only 3D positions of the neighboring UUVs are devised, together with protocols for completing formation in finite time. Aiming to accurately identify unknown dynamics and control gains simultaneously, estimator-based adaptive neural networks are introduced exploiting both historical and real-time data. Finally, model-free anti-disturbance finite-time kinetic control protocols are designed based on the data-driven adaptive neural networks and nonlinear tracking differentiators. It is proven that all signals of the closed-loop FC system are bounded, the deployed FC tracking can be achieved in finite time. Simulation results verify the feasibility and superiority of the proposed FC control scheme.

AB This paper investigates the throughput of a non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA)-based cognitive radio (CR) system with multiple unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)-assisted relays under system performance and security constraints. We propose a communication protocol that includes an energy harvesting (EH) phase and multiple communication phases. In the EH phase, the multiple UAV relays (URs) harvest energy from a power beacon. In the first communication phase, a secondary transmitter (ST) uses the collected energy to send confidential signals to the first UR using NOMA. Simultaneously, a ground base station communicates with a primary receiver (PR) under interference from the ST. In the subsequent communication phases, the next URs apply the decode-and-forward technique to transmit the signals. In the last communication phase, the Internet of Things destinations (IDs) receive their signals in the presence of an eavesdropper (EAV). Accordingly, the outage probability of the primary network, the throughput of the secondary network, and the leakage probability at the EAV are analyzed. On this basis, we propose a hybrid search method combining particle swarm optimization (PSO) and continuous genetic algorithm (CGA) to optimize the UR configurations and the NOMA power allocation to maximize the throughput of the secondary network under performance and security constraints.

AB As an essential component of interferometric synthetic aperture radar (InSAR) measurements, phase unwrapping (PU) is a critical process that significantly impacts the accuracy and reliability of topography and deformation measurements. As an effective approach that can overcome the limitations of the Itoh condition, the multi baseline (MB) PU method is widely used in PU; however, when it comes to unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) InSAR systems that use a single antenna and repeat-pass mode for interferometric measurements, the time-varying baseline can pose a challenge since the airflow disturbance can prevent the repeat flight paths from remaining parallel. This makes the combination of baselines more complicated, which can impede the feasibility of using the MB PU for the UAV InSAR. As a result, using the relationship between different frequencies for PU is a promising alternative method. This article demonstrates that the frequency ratio design is a crucial factor in the success of the multifrequency (MF) PU method. An optimal frequency ratio design method for MF PU that maximizes the minimum Euclidean distance between the intersection vectors determined by the integer ambiguity vectors is proposed. The proposed method is validated using the simulated and experimental datasets, which provide evidence that PU accuracy can be greatly enhanced with the optimal frequency ratio.

AB Uncoordinated charging load of electric vehicles (EVs) increases the peak load of the power grid, thereby increasing the cost of electricity generation. The valley-filling charging scenario offers a cheaper alternative. This study proposes a novel decentralized valley-filling charging strategy, in which a day-ahead pricing scheme is designed by solving a minimum-cost optimization problem. The pricing scheme can be broadcasted to EV owners, and the individual charging behaviors can be indirectly coordinated. EV owners respond to the pricing scheme by autonomously optimizing their individual charge patterns. This device-level response induces a valley-filling effect in the grid at the system level. The proposed strategy offers three advantages: coordination (by the valley-filling effect), practicality (no requirement for a bidirectional communication/control network between the grid and EV owners), and autonomy (user control of EV charge patterns). The proposed strategy is validated in simulations of typical scenarios in Beijing, China. According to the results, the strategy (I) effectively achieves the valley-filling charging effect at 28% less generation cost than the uncoordinated charging strategy, (2) is robust to several potential affecters of the valley-filling effect, such as (system-level) inaccurate parameter estimation and (device-level) response capability and willingness (which cause less than 2% deviation in the minimal generation cost), and (3) is compatible with device-level multi-objective charging optimization algorithms.

AB Networks of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) are emerging in many application domains, e.g., military surveillance. To perform collaborative tasks, the involved UAVs exchange several types of information, e.g., sensor data and commands. The major question here is how to schedule the tasks under dynamic traffic flows to provide network services. Existing solutions use the Round-Robin Strategy (RRS), where the tasks are scheduled statistically by dividing the time into fixed-length rounds. However, the RRS wastes significant network and device resources due to task scheduling in each round. This paper proposes DROVE- a novel clustering approach that allows the UAVs for dynamic task scheduling. However, determining the task scheduling is crucial, as it significantly affects several network parameters, e.g., throughput. Therefore, we devise the problem of distributed task scheduling under dynamic traffic flow scenarios to optimize the throughput. We propose a clustering task scheduling algorithm to serve dynamic traffic flows. Particularly, we integrate the dynamic traffic flows into the Lyapunov drift analysis framework, and determine the throughput optimality of our proposed scheduling algorithm. We perform extensive simulations to validate the effectiveness of DROVE. The results show that DROVE outperforms the state-of-the-art solutions in terms of energy consumption, clustering overhead, throughput, end-to-end delay, flow success rate and packet drop rate.

AB The paper studies and compares nonlinear Kalman Filtering methods and Particle Filtering methods for estimating the state vector of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) through the fusion of sensor measurements. Next, the paper proposes the use of the estimated state vector in a control loop for autonomous navigation and trajectory tracking by the UAVs. The proposed nonlinear controller is derived according to the flatness-based control theory. The estimation of the UAV's state vector is carried out with the use of (i) Extended Kalman Filtering (EKF), (ii) Sigma-Point Kalman Filtering (SPKF), (iii) Particle Filtering (PF), and (iv) a new nonlinear estimation method which is the Derivative-free nonlinear Kalman Filtering (DKF). The performance of the nonlinear control loop which is based on these nonlinear state estimation methods is evaluated through simulation tests. Comparing the aforementioned filtering methods in terms of estimation accuracy and computation speed, it is shown that the Sigma-Point Kalman Filtering is a reliable and computationally efficient approach to state estimation-based control, while Particle Filtering is well-suited to accommodate non-Gaussian measurements. Moreover, it is shown that the Derivative-free nonlinear Kalman Filter is faster than the rest of the nonlinear filters while also succeeding accurate, in terms of variance, state estimates.

AB Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) have emerged as a viable option in numerous real-world applications. In large mission planning systems, demanding the effective completion of a wide variety of tasks, multi-UAV systems are significantly preferred. Collaborative task assignment and path planning have a significant impact on autonomous operation of multi-UAV systems. In this study, we propose a priority-aware task assignment and path planning (AMTP) algorithm based on actor-critic multi-agent reinforcement learning for multi-UAV operations. We utilize an actor-critic multi-agent framework based on centralized training and decentralized execution for task assignment and path planning of heterogeneous UAVs. A multi-agent deep deterministic policy gradient framework is used to train the system to deal with both the elements of the dynamic environment and the heterogeneity of UAVs and tasks. The critic network evaluates the policy by maintaining the global network state information and combines the actions of agents to simplify the training state. On the other hand, agents decide which actions to comply with their local observations to improve the policy. The performance evaluation results obtained through simulation show that the proposed AMTP outperforms existing methods in terms of task completion rate, load balancing, energy efficiency, and convergence time. & COPY; 2023 Elsevier Inc.

AB We developed an optimal work-scheduling algorithm for autonomous spraying electric robots in orchards. Or-chards are often located in mountainous areas, where the slopes are greater than those in plain areas. The work efficiency of agricultural operations in orchards thus depends on the quality of the work schedule, which in turn requires that the work schedule be optimized. We developed an algorithm that considers the returns of an agricultural robot electric vehicle to a replenishment base for pesticide refills and battery recharging. Our proposed method consists of three steps: the reconstruction of individual robots' work schedules, optimization of the overall work schedule, and optimization of the direction of entry for each driving lane in a schedule. We used a multi-layered genetic algorithm (LGA) to solve these problems. A comparison of the work schedules created by the LGA with those generated by other algorithms confirmed that the LGA can create an optimum or a subop-timum work schedule. We also created work schedules for multiple robots, which demonstrated that the pro-posed method can be applied to robot-operation problems such as the determination of the required number of robots within the constraints of total work time and robot specifications. Our results confirmed that the quality of a work schedule for robot EVs improves when the parameters related to robot modeling and field modeling are optimized, suggesting the possibility of applying the proposed method to robot and field design problems.

AB Autonomous flight of an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) or its weaponized variant named unmanned combat aerial vehicle (UCAV) requires a route or path determined carefully by considering the optimization objectives about the enemy threats and fuel consumption of the system being operated. Immune Plasma algorithm (IP algorithm or IPA) is one of the most recent optimization techniques and directly models the fundamental steps of a medical method also used for the COVID-19 disease and known as convalescent or immune plasma treatment. In this study, IP algorithm for which a promising performance has already been validated with a single population was first extended to a multi-population domain supported by a migration schema. Moreover, the usage of the donor as a source of plasma for the treatment operations of a receiver was remodeled. The new variant of the IPA empowered with the multi-population and modified donor usage approach was called Multi-IP algorithm or MULIPA. For investigating the solving capabilities of the MULIPA as a UCAV path planner, different battlefield scenarios and algorithm specific parameter configurations were used. The results obtained by the MULIPA were compared with the results of other meta-heuristic based path planners. The comparative studies between MULIPA and other techniques showed that newly proposed IPA variant is capable of finding more secure and fuel efficient paths for a UCAV system.

AB Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) can significantly improve the autonomy of the mining industry, and self-localization is the key to autonomous flights of underground UAVs. A localization method of visual-inertial sensor data fusion is proposed in this paper. The method aims to improve the localization accuracy and robustness of underground UAVs in dynamic environments. First, an algorithm for dynamic point detection and rejection is presented, which combines a semantic segmentation neural network, an optical flow method, and an epipolar constraint method. Second, a visual-inertial sensor fusion algorithm is used to enhance performance in areas lacking static visual features. It can also provide absolute scales to the localization results, as opposed to monocular systems. Finally, a hand-held multi-sensor data collection system is developed with accurate calibration, for imitating flights of underground UAVs and easing data collection in real underground tunnels. We evaluate our proposed localization method and compare it with state-of-art method VINS-Mono on both the public EuRoC dataset and our own collected data in underground tunnels. Experimental results show that the proposed visual-inertial localization method can improve the accuracy by more than 67% over VINS-Mono in high dynamic environments, and it can be applied to underground dynamic scenes with high robustness and accuracy.

AB The unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) technique combined with the cellular network is a promising and reliable technique to provide a low-cost, flexible, and easy-to-expandable network. In this article, we propose a UAV-assisted cooperative transmission network (UCTN), where UAVs and the base station (BS) transmit data jointly through the cooodination of the software-defined network (SDN). As the UAV has limited on-board energy, we aim to maximize the network energy efficiency (EE) by jointly optimizing the UAV-user association, UAV location, BS resource allocation, and the load allocation between the two systems. The formulated problem is a mixed-integer nonconvex optimization problem, which is intractable. To solve it, alternative optimization (AO) and Dinkelbach's method are adopted to recast the original problem into a tractable form. After that, the corresponding problem is divided into three subproblems and can be solved iteratively. An energy-constrained coalition game is proposed to solve the UAV-user association problem, and the UAV hovering point is carefully designed to balance the coalition serving time. Furthermore, the successive convex approximation (SCA) technique is adopted to optimize the BS transmit power and bandwidth allocation. Numerical experiments demonstrate that the proposed algorithm achieves significant performance gains over other benchmark schemes.

AB Modern automotive systems feature dozens of electronic control units (ECUs) for chassis, body and powertrain functions. These systems are costly and inflexible to upgrade, requiring ever increasing numbers of ECUs to support newfeatures such as advanced driver assistance (ADAS), autonomous technologies, and infotainment. To counter these challenges, we propose DriveOS, a safe, secure, extensible, and timing-predictable system for modern vehicle management in a centralized platform. DriveOS is based on a separation kernel, where timing and safety-critical ECU functions are implemented in a real-time OS (RTOS) alongside non-critical software in Linux or Android. The system enforces the separation, or partitioning, of both software and hardware among different OSes.
   DriveOS runs on a relatively low-cost embedded PC-class platform, supporting multiple cores and hardware virtualization capabilities. Instrument cluster, in-vehicle infotainment and advanced driver assistance system services are implemented in a Yocto Linux guest, which communicates with critical real-time services via secure shared memory. The RTOS manages a real-time controller area network (CAN) interface that is inaccessible to Linux services except via well-defined and legitimate communication channels. In this work, we integrate three Qt-based services written for Yocto Linux, running in parallel with a real-time longitudinal controller task and multiple CAN bus concentrators, for vehicular sensor data processing and actuation. We demonstrate the benefits and performance of DriveOS with a hardware-in-the-loop CARLA simulation using a real car dataset.

ID NOISE
AB An approach for the control of systems subject to harmonic disturbances with time-varying fundamental frequency is presented. The impetus for this approach is the active control of engine-induced vibrations in automotive vehicles, where the fundamental frequency, i.e., engine firing frequency, ranges from approximately 7 Hz at idle (800 rpm) to approximately 50 Hz (6000 rpm). The disturbance, which is assumed to enter the plant at the input, is modelled as the output of an autonomous state-space model, and a state observer is used to obtain estimates of the states of this disturbance model. From these state estimates, the disturbance is reconstructed and used as a control input (with a sign reversal). The state observer is time varying since it depends on the frequency measurement, which is commonly available in modern cars as an analogue or digital engine speed signal. Based on the current fundamental disturbance frequency, an observer gain is selected from a set of pre-computed gains. This provides a non-adaptive approach, where the frequency is used as a scheduling variable. Theoretical issues of the algorithm (observer design) are discussed, and real-time results (acceleration and sound measurements) obtained with an active control system for engine-induced vibrations in a car are presented. These results show a major reduction of sound and vibration levels in the passenger compartment of the vehicle. (C) 2003 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Automatic driving technology has developed over time and the path-following problem for four-wheel independent drive electric autonomous vehicles (4WID-EV) is a topic of increasing interest. During the path-following process, a consideration of uncertainties in vehicle modeling including parameter variation, modeling error, and external disturbances is made, which have an important effect on path-tracking performance. As so, we proposed a new path following control strategy that can be applied to robotics applications. First, it was determined to establish a 2 DOF dynamic model and path following error model, and were then converted to yaw angle tracking problems. Therefore, the desired control input of steering angle was obtained via yaw angle tracking controller. To estimate and compensate the uncertainties associated with systems, the nonlinear extended state observer (NESO) was designed while the NTSM controller was used to realize yaw angle tracking. Next, considering the system stability, a sliding mode controller with modified reaching law was used to obtain the desired additional yaw moment. Then, the optimized torque distributor was designed for allocating optimal tire forces. Finally, the simulation experiments were carried out in Matlab/Simulink and Carsim joint simulation platform. In conclusion, the proposed control scheme exhibits highly accurate path following as well as strong robustness to speed, tire-road friction coefficient and external disturbance.

ID CLASSIFICATION
AB Derris trifoliate, one of the most notorious invaders of mangroves in South China, seriously threatens the growth of mangroves and the stability of local ecosystem. In order to effectively control the spread of Derris trifoliate and stabilize the mangrove ecosystem, it is necessary to identify the distribution and simulate the occurrence of Derris trifoliate in mangrove forests. While previous methods for invasive plant mapping based on satellite images were limited by low temporal and spatial resolution, the newly born unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) images have provided a fast, fine-grained, and low-cost alternative for rapid invasive plant monitoring. However, extracting Derris trifoliate in mangrove forests based on UAV images is still a challenge. For one thing, it is difficult to collect enough data for model training, since the Derris trifoliate is hard to be distinguished in mangroves. For another thing, few existing methods can meet the requirements of high computing efficiency and low memory consumption of UAVs. Therefore, we proposed two lightweight deep learning networks based on DenseNet and VGG, namely, the lightweight DenseNet (LDN) and the lightweight VGG (LVG), and investigated the capability of LDN and LVG in identifying Derris trifoliate from mangrove forests with small amounts of data. This study has verified the effect of the lightweight deep learning algorithms for the accurate detection of mangrove invasive plants Derris trifoliate from UAV images.

AB Proprioceptive localization refers to a new class of robot egocentric localization methods that do not rely on the perception and recognition of external landmarks. These methods are naturally immune to bad weather, poor lighting conditions, or other extreme environmental conditions that may hinder exteroceptive sensors such as a camera or a laser ranger finder. These methods depend on proprioceptive sensors such as inertial measurement units and/or wheel encoders. Assisted by magnetoreception, the sensors can provide a rudimentary estimation of vehicle trajectory which is used to query a prior known map to obtain location. Named as graph-based proprioceptive localization, we provide a low cost fallback solution for localization under challenging environmental conditions. As a robot/vehicle travels, we extract a sequence of heading-length values for straight segments from the trajectory and match the sequence with a preprocessed heading-length graph (HLG) abstracted from the prior known map to localize the robot under a graph-matching approach. Using the information from HLG, our location alignment and verification module compensates for trajectory drift, wheel slip, or tire inflation level. We have implemented our algorithm and tested it in both simulated and physical experiments. The algorithm runs successfully in finding robot location continuously and achieves localization accurate at the level that the prior map allows (less than 10 m).

AB This paper reviews both the author's experience with managing highway network traffic on a real-time basis and the ongoing research into harnessing the potential of telecommunications and information technology (IT). On the basis of the lessons learned, this paper speculates about how telecommunications and IT capabilities can respond to current and future developments in traffic management. Issues arising from disruptive telecommunications technologies include the ready availability of real-time information, the crowdsourcing of information, the challenges of big data, and the need for information quality. Issues arising from transportation technologies include autonomous vehicles and connected vehicles and new taxi-like car-and bikesharing. Illustrations are drawn from the following core functions of a traffic management center: (a) detecting and resolving an incident (possibly through crowdsourcing), (b) monitoring and forecasting traffic (possibly through connected vehicles serving as sensors), (c) advising motorists about routing alternatives (possibly through real-time information), and (d) configuring traffic control strategies and tactics (possibly though big data). The conclusion drawn is that agility is the key to success in an ever-evolving technological scene. The solid guiding principle remains innovative and rigorous analytical procedures that build on the state of the art in the field, including both hard and soft technologies. The biggest modeling and simulation challenge remains the unknown, including such rapidly emerging trends as the Internet of things and the smart city.

AB Recently, air pollution has grown significantly, and it can frequently be challenging to identify the sources of contaminants. This article studies the deployment of multi-cooperative unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) to look for sources of pollution in an unknown region. Specifically, a probabilistic search strategy based on the Local Particle Swarm Optimization (LoPSO) method is suggested to design an optimal strategy that enhances the cooperative search of drones while cutting down on overall search time and improving source detection efficiency. The entire strategy is divided into two phases: exploration and exploitation. In the first phase, the detection and tracing of the plume is the favored task, in which each UAV operates in either the Greedy or LoPSO mode and chooses its path based on plane coordinates generated according to the active mode. By utilizing the areas with a high probability of discovering the source on flight mode LoPSO, the search is focused during the exploitation phase on the precise search of the exact location of the pollutant source. This is done under the direction of a probabilistic computation that uses the Bayesian process model to create and update the probability map of the pollutant source location as new sensor data becomes available. The simulation data of the proposed technique demonstrates promising results in terms of the complexity and accuracy attained in identifying pollution sources.

AB The autonomous parking of vehicles requires the ability to accurately locate an available parking slot in the vicinity of a vehicle. Since parking slots have a variety of shapes and colors, may be occluded by obstacles, or look different due to surroundings such as lighting, accurately locating them can be a challenging task. In this paper, we propose a context-based parking slot detection method inspired by the process of a human driver finding a parking slot. Our method consists of two deep network modules: a parking context recognizer and parking slot detector. The parking context recognizer identifies the parking environment (type, angle, and availability of a parking slot), whereas the parking slot detector locates the exact position of a parking slot by multiple type-based fine-tuned detectors with rotated anchor boxes and a rotated non-maximal suppression. In addition, we release a realistic parking slot dataset, which comprises 22817 images of parking slots having various attributes and external conditions. We also propose a new evaluation metric for parking slot detection, reflecting whether a vehicle can be parked within the detected parking slot. Through comparison and ablation study in experiments, we demonstrate that our method outperformed the previous deep-learning-based methods, along with having a short operation time. The source codes and the dataset are available at https://github.com/dohoseok/context-based-parking-slot-detect/.

ID ANT COLONY OPTIMIZATION; UAVS
AB Autonomous unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) swarm flights have been investigated widely. In the presence of a high airspace density and increasingly complex flight conditions, collision avoidance between UAV swarms is very important; however, this problem has not been fully addressed, particularly among self-organizing flight clusters. In this paper, we developed a method for avoiding collisions between different types of self-organized UAV clusters in various flight situations. The Reynolds rules were applied to self-organized flights of UAVs and a parameter optimization framework was used to optimize their organization, before developing a collision avoidance solution for UAV swarms. The proposed method can self-organize the flight of each UAV swarm during the overall process and the UAV swarm can continue to fly according to the self-organizing rules in the collision avoidance process. The UAVs in the airspace all make decisions according to their individual type. The UAVs in different UAV swarms can merge in the same space while avoiding collisions, where the UAV's self-organized flight process and collision avoidance process are very closely linked, and the trajectory is smooth to satisfy the actual operational needs. The numerical and experimental tests were conducted to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm. The results confirmed the effectiveness of this approach where self-organized flight cluster collision avoidance was successfully achieved by the UAV swarms.

AB In this paper, we study mixed traffic systems that move along a single-lane ring-road or open-road. The traffic flow firms a platoon, which includes a number of heterogeneous human-driven vehicles (HDVs) together with only one connected and automated vehicle (CAV) that receives information from a subset of neighbors. The dynamics of HDVs are assumed to follow a general continuous-time nonlinear car-following model, which is a function of their velocity, spacing, and the relative velocity. The acceleration of the single CAV is also directly controlled by a dynamical output-feedback controller. The ultimate goal of this work is to present a robust control strategy that can smoothen the traffic flow in the presence of undesired disturbances (e.g. abrupt deceleration) and parametric uncertainties. A prerequisite for synthesizing a dynamical output controller is the stabilizability and detectability of the underlying system. Accordingly, a theoretical analysis is presented first to prove the stabilizability and detectability of the mixed traffic flow system. Then, two H-infinity control strategies, with and without considering uncertainties in the system dynamics, are designed. The efficiency of the two control methods is subsequently illustrated through numerical simulations, and various experimental results are presented to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed controller to mitigate disturbance amplification and achieve platoon stability.

TI Increasing persistence of UAVs and MAVs through thermal soaring
SO AERONAUTICAL JOURNAL
LA English
DT Article
AB This work looks to harness atmospheric energy through thermal soaring to optimise the flight persistence of Micro Air Vehicles (MAVs) and Unmanned Air Vehicles (UAVs). There are two key challenges when considering thermal soaring, the first being the locating of thermals and the second being the extraction of the maximum potential energy from the thermals. Thermal location is by no means an exact science with experienced glider pilots needing to consider many factors to improve the probability of encountering a thermal. As thermals are caused by the uneven heating of the Earth's surface it is, however, possible to predict likely thermal locations. With the application of a suitable guidance algorithm which considers these 'hot spots' it is possible to increase the likelihood of encountering a thermal. Once a thermal is found it is important to attempt to extract the maximum energy from the thermal. To do this the vehicle needs to move quickly to the centre of the thermal. There are many potential techniques for thermal centring, some of which appear to be entirely contradictory to each other, the crucial factor determining the success of such a technique has been found to be the response time of the onboard sensors. This paper considers the many aspects of thermal soaring such as locating thermals, thermal detection and thermal centring. Five different thermal models are presented which are used to demonstrate the thermal centring techniques. Finally a commercial glider simulation package is used to demonstrate the control architecture and simulate a fully autonomous flight.

AB This paper considers a multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) cognitive radio (CR) system with an unmanned aerial vehicle relay (UR). In this system, a secondary transmitter (ST) uses licensed spectrum from the primary network to transmit signals to its secondary receivers (SRs) based on NOMA. The UR is used as a relay to forward the signals from the ST to the SRs. As a result, the system can achieve significant improvements in spectral efficiency and network capacity. However, such a MIMO NOMA CR system faces issues of interference and security, i.e., eavesdropping attacks, due to the shared spectrum use and the UR. Therefore, we aim to minimize the outage probability of the secondary network, subject to constraints on the outage probability of the primary network and the intercept probabilities of eavesdroppers. Then, we attempt to optimize the transmit power of the UR, the coordinates of the UR, and the power allocation factors for NOMA. We further derive closed-form expressions for the outage probabilities of the secondary and primary networks and the intercept probabilities at the eavesdroppers. We propose using a machine learning algorithm based on a constrained continuous genetic algorithm to solve the optimization problem.

AB To strengthen border patrol measures, unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) are gradually used in many countries to detect illegal entries on borders. However, how to efficiently deploy limited UAVs to patrol on borders of large areas remains challenging. In this paper, we first model the problem of deploying UAVs for border patrol as a Stackelberg game. Two players are considered in this game: The border patrol agency is the leader, who optimizes the patrol path of UAVs to detect the illegal immigrant. The illegal immigrant is the follower, who selects a certain area of the border to pass through at a certain time after observing the leader's strategy. Second, a compact linear programming problem is proposed to tackle the exponential growth of the number of leader's strategies. Third, a method is proposed to reduce the size of the strategy space of the follower. Then, we provide some theoretic results to present the effect of parameters of the model on leader's utilities. Experimental results demonstrate the positive effect of limited starting and ending areas of UAV's patrolling conditions and multiple patrolling altitudes on the leader's utility, and show that the proposed solution outperforms two conventional patrol strategies and has strong robustness.

AB Roadside LiDAR (light detection and ranging) is a solution to fill in the gaps for connected vehicles (CV) by detecting the status of global road users at transportation facilities. It relies greatly on the clustering algorithm for accurate and rapid data processing so as to ensure effectiveness and reliability. To contribute to better roadside LiDAR-based transportation facilities, this paper presents a fast-spherical-projection-based clustering algorithm (FSPC) for real-time LiDAR data processing with higher clustering accuracy and noise handling. The FSPC is designed to work on a spherical map which could be directly derived from the instant returns of a LiDAR sensor. A 2D-window searching strategy is specifically designed to accelerate the computation and alleviate the density variation impact in the LiDAR point cloud. The test results show the proposed algorithm can achieve a high processing efficiency with 24.4 ms per frame, satisfying the real-time requirement for most common LiDAR applications (100 ms per frame), and it also ensures a high accuracy in object clustering, with 96%. Additionally, it is observed that the proposed FSPC allows a wider detection range and is more stable, tackling the surge in foreground points that frequently occurs in roadside LiDAR applications. Finally, the generality of the proposed FSPC indicates the proposed algorithm could also be implemented in other areas such as autonomous driving and remote sensing.

AB Sustainable development systems (SDSs) contribute greatly to the global efforts toward climate change mitigation. The strategic planning and prioritization of various SDSs require multi-sectoral integrated assessment to ensure sustainability goals are effectively met. This research establishes a systematic integrated framework to assess selected state-of-the-art SDSs in three carbon-intensive sectors: transportation, waste management, and energy production. Multiple sustainable development scenarios were included based on: (1) electrified/intelligent transportation (EV/ITS), (2) waste-to-energy (WTE), and (3) renewable energy sources (RES). The proposed cost-integrated environmental assessment was applied on the case of Dubai which has some of the world highest per capita records of carbon footprint, energy demand, and waste generation. It was found that WTE systems were the most economically viable with required investments of around 8-20 USD/tCO(2)e-reduced, compared to 50-600 and 600-1500 USD/tCO(2)e-reduced with RES and EV/ITS strategies, respectively. The implementation of the optimum multi-sectoral plan, comprising autonomous vehicles, waste incineration, and concentrated solar towers, would achieve around 38% of the national target for carbon reduction in Dubai. The proposed methodology is applicable to other metropolises, particularly where there is limited local data and previous experiences with such sustainable systems.

AB The design of reliable navigation and control systems for Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) based only on visual cues and inertial data has many unsolved challenging problems, ranging from hardware and software development to pure control-theoretical issues. This paper addresses these issues by developing and implementing an adaptive vision-based autopilot for navigation and control of small and mini rotorcraft UAVs. The proposed autopilot includes a Visual Odometer (VO) for navigation in GPS-denied environments and a nonlinear control system for flight control and target tracking. The VO estimates the rotorcraft ego-motion by identifying and tracking visual features in the environment, using a single camera mounted on-board the vehicle. The VO has been augmented by an adaptive mechanism that fuses optic flow and inertial measurements to determine the range and to recover the 3D position and velocity of the vehicle. The adaptive VO pose estimates are then exploited by a nonlinear hierarchical controller for achieving various navigational tasks such as take-off, landing, hovering, trajectory tracking, target tracking, etc. Furthermore, the asymptotic stability of the entire closed-loop system has been established using systems in cascade and adaptive control theories. Experimental flight test data over various ranges of the flight envelope illustrate that the proposed vision-based autopilot performs well and allows a mini rotorcraft UAV to achieve autonomously advanced flight behaviours by using vision.

AB Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) have been widely employed in wireless communications, and the performance can be enhanced with the assistance of intelligent reflecting surface (IRS). However, the finite energy of UAVs greatly limits the endurance and becomes a bottleneck for IRS-UAV communications. In this paper, an integrated IRS-UAV communication scheme is proposed where the IRS is mounted on the UAV to connect the base station and the ground user. We present two schemes to maximize the spectrum efficiency (SE) and the energy efficiency (EE) of the system by jointly optimizing the active beamforming, passive beamforming and UAV trajectory. First, to tackle the SE maximization problem, we divide it into three subproblems to optimize the variables iteratively. For the active and passive beamforming, the closed-form solutions can be directly derived. The suboptimal trajectory design can be obtained by utilizing the successive convex approximation. Furthermore, considering the limited on- broad energy of UAV, a scheme to maximize the EE is proposed. The optimal active beamforming and the passive beamforming can be similarly obtained. For the non-convex fractional programming of trajectory optimization, it can be solved via the Dinkelbach's method. Numerical results demonstrate that the proposed algorithms are effective for the IRS-UAV networks to maximize the SE and EE, respectively.

AB The traditional seagull optimization algorithm cannot handle multi-objective optimization problems, so a multi-objective quantum-inspired seagull optimization algorithm based on decomposition (MOQSOA/D) is proposed. Multi-objective computing and quantum computing are introduced into MOQSOA/D. MOQSOA/D transforms the multi-objective problem into multiple scalar optimization sub-problems, and establishes a dynamic archive and a leadership archive at the same time. The Pareto solution of each sub-problem is stored in a dynamic archive, and the non-dominated Pareto solution is stored in the leader archive. While processing each sub-problem, each seagull is represented by a string of qubits, which is used to calculate the current seagull direction of flight, and a variable angular-distance rotation (VAR) gate is used to change the probability amplitude of the qubits, thereby updating the direction of flight. Penalty-based boundary intersection approach is introduced to determine whether the generated Pareto solution is retained. The proposed algorithm and six different algorithms were tested on 69 indicators, and the results show that the algorithm achieved better results in 40 indicators. In addition, a Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) path planning model in three-dimensional environment is designed to test the utility of MOQSOA/D, and the algorithm is compared with the other algorithm to demonstrate its effectiveness.

AB No doubt that the measurement is an important matter in the precise and accurate control of automotive subsystems to improve the performance and efficiency. The key tool to achieve high degree of precision and accuracy in control applications is sensor. In recent years, the rapid technological advances have revolutionized the automotive industry and a great variety of new sensors are introduced to the market with the purpose of accelerating the development of autonomous vehicles technology. However, the increasing legal pressures from regulatory authorities have led to strengthened requirements for robust pressure sensors in vehicles. On the other hand, the cost of such devices need to remain low due to the continual competition in the market. In this study, we have proposed a low cost piezoresistive sensing method based smart pressure sensor, which combines the signal conditioning, analog/digital signal processing and communication circuitry directly to the sense element in a single compact housing. The introduced smart pressure sensor achieves the improved reliability and greater accuracy due to its built-in temperature compensation, filtering and self-calibration capabilities. The measurement performance of our prototype design has been tested in dynamic test device, which can control the working status of a typical vehicle compressor. The experimental results validate the robustness of the proposed smart pressure sensor in terms of linearity, repeatability and data transmission.

AB The industrial investment in unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) is soaring due to their multiple autonomous applications, such as aerial photography, rescue operations, surveillance, and scientific data collection. Current sensing is critical for determining battery capacity in charging and discharging process and alerting for system fault during the flight. Shunt resistors and Hall-effect sensors are traditionally used in UAVs. Recently, magnetoresistive (MR) sensors are gaining enormous attention from researchers. MR sensors tend to consume less power, and they are smaller in size than the Hall-effect sensors. In this paper, a number of off-the-shelf MR sensors were investigated to evaluate the possibility of applying them for UAVs. Another type of magnetic sensor (fluxgate) and shunt resistor was also studied and compared as a reference. The relative scoring method is adopted to evaluate the sensor performance under different metrics, and the results disclose that the MR sensors are highly suitable for current sensing of UAVs due to their higher accuracy, lower energy consumption, wider temperature endurance, smaller size, and less weight than other magnetic current sensors. They are also very competitive with traditional shunt resistors through the overall comparison. The remanence, thermal stability, and cross-field sensitivity of MR sensors are further discussed. This finding provides insight into the selection strategy of current sensors for UAVs and can enhance the industrial development of UAV potentially.

AB A pulsed-laser ablation method for non-contact experimental vibration analysis of completely submerged underwater structures is proposed. Although impact testing with an impulse hammer is commonly used for vibration analysis due to its simplicity, impact testing has limited use in underwater conditions. An input-detection-free frequency response function measurement in water will greatly contribute to the development of high-precision and high-speed positioning autonomous underwater vehicles, underwater vehicle-manipulators, underwater robots, submarines, etc., which are used in dangerous conditions (e.g., deep oceans, under ice, and nuclear reactor plants). To achieve these high-performance underwater systems, vibrations due to hydrodynamic parameters (such as added mass, buoyant force, drag force, and damping coefficient) should be suppressed, and vibration tests should be conducted on the actual equipment submerged in water. The proposed method yields the frequency response function by applying a pulsed-laser-ablation excitation force to an underwater structure and measuring the output using a laser Doppler vibrometer. Because the direction, strength, and effective duration of the pulsed-laser-ablation force are essentially constant, this force can be estimated by measuring these properties in advance. Hence, the proposed method realizes input-detection-free frequency response function measurements in underwater conditions.

AB We present a numerical method for minimum time heading control of fixed speed AUVs (autonomous underwater vehicles) such as gliders in known, spatially complex, 2D, time-varying flow fields. This problem is difficult because locally optimal trajectories abound and, worse, currents stronger than the vehicle can push it far off course. Nevertheless, globally optimal trajectories may be obtained (where they exist) by solving a dynamic HJB (Hamilton Jacobi Bellman) partial differential equation for the time-varying optimal time-to-go function and the associated optimal feedback control law; the local optima and strong currents simply make the control law and the time-to-go function, respectively, discontinuous. In prior work, we found solutions via a variant of the "extremal field" method-essentially the method of characteristics, and equivalent to tracking a 2D "controllability front" backward-in-time from the target set, a line in space-time. In the present work, we exploit a special property of minimum time control to obtain the same globally optimal trajectories, albeit in open loop form, by tracking a 1D "reachability front" forward-in-time from the initial position. The method is further improved by a trimming procedure for locally optimal trajectories. It is tested on a numerically defined flow field from a model of the Adriatic Sea. (c) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

AB The effort to automate is present across all industries. It has an economic purpose but potential impacts go far beyond economics. Research has been carried out and a lot of investment has been made in automation in a variety of industries, as well as in agriculture and forestry, which resulted in efficient solutions for diverse applications. In fact, more solutions have emerged in the field of agriculture than in any other. This can be explained in economic terms, but also in light of the complex navigation required because of unstructured environments such as forests. This paper provides a comprehensive review of existing mobile platforms and presents a comparative study for an application in forest clearing. We evaluate the size, automation levels, traction, energy source, locomotion systems, sensors/actuators availability and tools that such an application must have to succeed in its function. Hence, it will be possible to evaluate the feasibility of retrofitting an existing platform into an electric unmanned ground vehicle for forest clearing or if it is easier to start development from scratch. The evaluation results reveal that an electric unmanned ground vehicle for forest clearing is currently unavailable in the market and that a new platform is needed. The performance requirements for such a platform are identified and proposed in the paper.

AB An approach for intelligent monitoring of mobile cyberphysical systems is described, based on consensus among distributed self-organised agents. Its usefulness is experimentally demonstrated over a long-time case study in an example domain: a fleet of city buses. The proposed solution combines several techniques, allowing for life-long learning under computational and communication constraints. The presented work is a step towards autonomous knowledge discovery in a domain where data volumes are increasing, the complexity of systems is growing, and dedicating human experts to build fault detection and diagnostic models for all possible faults is not economically viable. The embedded, self-organised agents operate on-board the cyberphysical systems, modelling their states and communicating them wirelessly to a back-office application. Those models are subsequently compared against each other to find systems which deviate from the consensus. In this way the group (e.g., a fleet of vehicles) is used to provide a standard, or to describe normal behaviour, together with its expected variability under particular operating conditions. The intention is to detect faults without the need for human experts to anticipate them beforehand. This can be used to build up a knowledge base that accumulates over the life-time of the systems. The approach is demonstrated using data collected during regular operation of a city bus fleet over the period of almost 4 years.

AB In recent years, electrified mobility (e-mobility), especially connected and autonomous electric vehicles (CAEVs), has been gaining momentum along with the rapid development of emerging technologies such as artificial intelligence (AI) and Internet of Things. The social benefits of CAEVs are manifested in the form of safer transportation, lower energy consumption, and reduced congestion and emissions. Nevertheless, it is highly difficult to design driving policies that ensure road safety, travel efficiency, and energy conservation for all CAEVs in traffic flows, particularly in a mixed-autonomy scenario where both CAEVs and human-driven vehicles (HDVs) are on the road and interact with each other. Here we present a novel deep multiagent reinforcement learning (DMARL)-enabled energy-aware cooperative driving solution, facilitating CAEVs to learn vehicular platoon management policies for guaranteeing overall traffic flow performance. Specifically, with the aid of information communication technology (ICT), CAEVs can share their vehicle state and learned knowledge, such as their state of charge (SoC), speed, and driving policies. Additionally, a cooperative multiagent actor-critic (CMAAC) technique is developed to optimize vehicular platoon management policies that map perceptual information directly to the group decision-making behaviors for the CAEV platoon. The proposed approach is evaluated in highway on-ramp merging scenarios with two different mixed-autonomy traffic flows. The results demonstrate the benefits of our scheme. Finally, we discuss the challenges and potential research directions for the proposed energy-aware cooperative driving solution.

AB The recent development of unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) and mobile edge computing (MEC) technologies provides flexible and resilient computation services to mobile users out of the terrestrial computing service coverage. In this paper, we consider a UAV-enabled MEC platform that serves multiple mobile ground users with random movements and task arrivals. We aim to minimize the average weighted energy consumption of all users subject to the average UAV energy consumption and data queue stability constraints. We formulate the problem as a multi-stage stochastic optimization, and adopt Lyapunov optimization to convert it into per-slot deterministic problems with fewer optimizing variables. We design two reduced-complexity methods that solve the resource allocation and the UAV movement either in two sequential steps or jointly in one step. Both methods can guarantee to satisfy the average UAV energy and queue stability constraints, meanwhile achieving a tradeoff between the user energy consumption and the length of queue backlog. Simulation results show that the two methods significantly outperform the other benchmark methods including a learning-based method in reducing the energy consumption of ground users. In between, the proposed joint optimization method achieves better performance than the two-stage method at the cost of higher computational complexity.

AB To solve the trajectory tracking problem of insufficient response and the large tracking error of remotely operated vehicles (ROVs) under the interference of large ocean currents, this paper proposes a double-loop sliding mode controller with an ocean current observer. The designed controller consisted of an outer-loop controller (the position controller) and an inner-loop controller (the velocity controller): the outer controller was designed by the position error, and a reference velocity was created for the inner loop to achieve accurate positioning and attitude tracking. The reference control input was treated as a new target to design the inner-loop controller, enabling the ROV to achieve accurate reference velocity tracking. Based on the theoretical idea of active disturbance rejection control, a kinematic equation-based ocean current observer was designed to estimate and compensate for large unknown currents to ensure accurate trajectory tracking performance under large currents. The simulation results proved that the double-loop sliding-mode control scheme with an ocean current observer always showed good tracking performance, demonstrating the excellent control performance and high robustness of the scheme. Compared with the high-complexity control schemes such as neural network-based PID control or fuzzy sliding mode control, it effectively improves the robustness to ocean current disturbances without increasing the computational effort excessively, and is more practical in ROV systems with limited computational power.

AB The vehicular ad hoc network (VANET) is an autonomous system of mobile vehicles where mobile vehicles can transmit or receive data packet over the wireless link. Due to the movable nature and limited communication, range of vehicles causes breaking the link between them very frequently, which in turn causes failure in the data delivery. Therefore, a stable path should be established from the source to the destination node to deliver data packets at the intended destination node. Therefore, for a stable route from source to the destination node selection of the next hop should be appropriate. The proposed work in this paper has been made to discuss how the best next hop node can be selected to deliver data packet successfully at the destination node D. A mathematical model fuzzy logic-based directional location routing (FLDLR) has been proposed to select a remarkable next hop node in the VANET. To select next hop, FLDLR has considered fuzzy logic sets of the routing metrics, i.e., next hop distance, node speed, closeness, the data transmission rate of the node, and node movement direction. To investigate the performance of FLDLR, the simulation work has been done through network simulator-2 and compared with existing LAR and D-LAR protocols. Through simulated results has shown that the FLDLR outperforms existing protocols from the standpoints routing overhead and packet delivery delay.

AB Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) are widely used in wireless communication, either base stations (BSs) or relays. In some occasions of UAV-assisted communication, such as low-altitude communication in an urban environment, the channel conditions can be poor due to obstacles. Thus, they will experience an outage and cannot receive the signal transmitted by the UAVs. In this article, we propose an outage-probability-aware medium access control (MAC) protocol (OPM) based on the study of outage probabilities in different UAV-assisted environments. Specifically, we first analyze different outage scenarios in information transmission. Then, the physical layer outage probability with channel conditions and ground users' mobility taken into consideration is discussed, while an outage detection (OT) method is proposed, and different measures are taken according to the detection results. Third, a 3-D Markov chain model is used to investigate per-user behavior for the proposed OPM. Finally, the simulation results on packet discard probability, average transmission delay, and system throughput are analyzed. The results show the effectiveness of the proposed protocol, which leads to a 30%-50% decrease in both the probability of packet discard and average transmission delay, along with an increase in throughput of more than 40%.

AB An unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) array is composed of multiple UAVs carrying array elements, which can sense signals synchronously through a global positioning system (GPS) trigger. However, gain-phase errors caused by synchronization errors and the inconsistent complex gains of receiving array channels result in array manifold perturbation, which makes the performance of traditional localization methods degrade or even fail. In this article, two efficient algorithms for source direction finding and direct localization using a UAV array are, respectively, presented. First, the array manifold changes with the movement of UAVs, which contributes to multiposition fusion, thus avoiding the infinite solutions of underdetermined equations. Then, the quadratic optimization problem can be constructed by using the orthogonal relation between noise subspaces and contaminated steering vectors obtained from multiple observations. Thereafter, we can construct the cost function and obtain the spectral function, from which the source directions and positions can be all estimated by grid search. Meanwhile, the gain-phase error values can be solved successively. Moreover, in order to avoid the influence of heteroscedasticity of different observation positions in direct localization, we carry out a blind weighting operation. Simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness and superiority of the proposed algorithms.

AB In 2011, the enigma of "mystery circles," small but complex underwater structures first observed by divers from southern Japan in 1995, was solved when a new species of pufferfish, white-spotted pufferfish (Torquigener albomaculosusMatsuura 2014), was identified as the responsible agent. To date these circles have been described only from Japan, where they are formed on a sandy seafloor in water depths less than 30 m. A survey of oil field infrastructure on the North West Shelf of Western Australia in 2018 using a remotely operated vehicle and hybrid autonomous underwater vehicle (HAUV) recorded a high-resolution video and bathymetric data of 21 circular formations with similar features to those described in Japan. The circles display dimensions and morphology like those described from Japan, but were observed in water depths between 129 and 137 m. The HAUV also recorded high-resolution photographs which captured aTorquigenersp. fish in the immediate vicinity of the circles. An additional circle andTorquigenersp. were observed in images collected by baited remote underwater stereo-video in a nearby location in 129 m depth. These circles are the first to be found in Australia. The pufferfish species responsible cannot be identified from images collected.Such a discovery not only generates intrigue and wonder among scientists and the general public but also provides an insight into the reproductive behaviour and evolution of pufferfish globally.

AB The envisaged usage of multiple Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) to perform cooperative tasks is a promising concept for future autonomous military systems. An important aspect to make this usage a reality is the solution of the task allocation problem in these cooperative systems. This paper addresses the problem of tasks allocation among agents representing UAVs, considering that the tasks are created by a central entity, in which the decision of which task will be performed by each agent is not decided by this central entity, but by the agents themselves. The assumption that tasks are created by a central entity is a reasonable one, given the way strategic planning is carried up in military operations. To enable the UAVs to have the ability to decide which tasks to perform, concepts from swarm intelligence and multi-agent system approach are used. Heuristic methods are commonly used to solve this problem, but they present drawbacks. For example, many tasks end up not begin performed even if the UAVs have enough resources to execute them. To cope with this problem, this paper proposes three algorithm variants that complement each other to form a new method aiming to increase the amount of performed tasks, so that a better task allocation is achieved. Through experiments in a simulated environment, the proposed method was evaluated, yielding enhanced results for the addressed problem compared to existing methods reported in the literature.

AB Small robotic systems such as Micro Air Vehicles (MAVs) need to react quickly to their dynamic environments, while having only a limited amount of energy and processing onboard. In this article, sub-sampling of local image samples is investigated as a straightforward and broadly applicable approach to improve the computational efficiency of vision algorithms. In sub-sampling, only a small subset of the total number of samples is processed, leading to a significant reduction of the computational effort at the cost of a slightly lower accuracy. The possibility to change the number of extracted samples is of particular importance to autonomous robots, since it allows the designer to select not only the performance but also the execution frequency of the algorithm. The approach of sub-sampling is illustrated by introducing two novel, computationally efficient algorithms for two tasks relevant to MAVs: WiFi noise detection in camera images and onboard horizon detection for pitch and roll estimation. In the noise detection task, image lines and pixel pairs are sampled, while in the horizon detection task features from local image patches are sampled. For both tasks experiments are performed and the effects of sub-sampling are analyzed. It is demonstrated that even for small images of size 160 x 120 speed-ups of a factor 14 to 21 are reached, while retaining a sufficient performance for the tasks at hand. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

AB In vehicular environments, the cooperation of radar and communications has been recognized as a promising solution to alleviate the shortage of spectrum resources. In this paper, we investigate the joint radar sensing and communication (JSC) system based on the cooperative spectrum sharing strategy. Via the full cooperation be-tween both radar sensing and wireless communication functionalities, we can avoid the under-utilization of spectral resource while improving system efficiency. To implement our JSC control scheme, we focus on coa-litional bargaining solutions according to the cooperative game theory. Especially, the coalitional Nash bargaining solution (CNBS) and coalitional Kalai-Smorodinsky bargaining (CKSBS) are employed to get a mutually desirable solution in the radar-communication coexistence platform. The main ides of CNBS is adopted to distribute the spectrum resource among roadside units, and both radar and communication functions in each individual vehicle. The concept of CKSBS is applied to allocate the spectrum resource for vehicles in order to maximize their payoffs. In the proposed scheme, the CNBS and CKSBS work together to share the surplus of a coalition with the fairness and efficiency properties. The main contribution of our proposed approach is the reciprocal combination of the CNBS and CKSBS to obtain the synergy effect. Finally, numerical results are provided to verify the effectiveness of the proposed scheme for the JSC system operations.

AB Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) are increasingly applied to surveillance tasks, thanks to their excellent mobility and flexibility. Different from existing works using UAVs for video surveillance, this paper employs a UAV team to carry out collaborative radio surveillance on ground moving nodes and disguise the purpose of surveillance. We consider two aspects of disguise. The first is that the UAVs do not communicate with each other (or the ground nodes can notice), and each UAV plans its trajectory in a decentralized way. The other aspect of disguise is that the UAVs avoid being noticed by the nodes for which a metric quantifying the disguising performance is adopted. We present a new decentralized method for the online trajectory planning of the UAVs, which maximizes the disguising metric while maintaining uninterrupted surveillance and avoiding UAV collisions. Based on the model predictive control (MPC) technique, our method allows each UAV to separately estimate the locations of the UAVs and the ground nodes, and decide its trajectory accordingly. The impact of potential estimation errors is mitigated by incorporating the error bounds into the online trajectory planning, hence achieving a robust control of the trajectories. Computer-based simulation results demonstrate that the developed strategy ensures the surveillance requirement without losing disguising performance, and outperforms existing alternatives.

AB This paper, in light of the sliding mode control (SMC) approach, concerns the formation regulation for a network of unmanned surface vehicles (USVs) with environmental disturbances. The formation pattern is configured within the consensus-based leaderless framework. Undirected connected graphs are exploited to portray the network communication in a switching manner. To begin with, thanks to the definition on relative formation error, one mathematically formulates the concerned formation control problem into the leaderless consensus design for resultant formation error systems. Then an integral-type sliding surface is constructed by a collection of neighboring USVs' position and velocity information. Based on a characterized orthogonal transformation, the regulation of the formation performance upon the sliding surface is cast into the asymptotic stability analysis of the reduce-order sliding mode system. By partitioning the state space into agreement and disagreement subspaces, a formation reference function (FRF) with determined initial condition is derived as a disturbance-free autonomous system, whose dynamical behavior explicitly symbolizes the global movement of the leaderless USV formation system. Finally, to ensure the finite-time reachability of the sliding surface, a distributed sliding mode controller is designed by utilizing the tool from finite-time stabilization technique. As a byproduct, the theoretical analysis is extended to the case of fixed topology. The derived results are validated by some numerical examples.

AB A new structure and an improved control method of the three-axis gimbal for hexacopter unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) are presented. By optimising the structure of the three-axis gimbal and establishing the mathematical model with the maximum stability, the improved structure of three-axis gimbal is proposed, which two groups of virtual reality (VR) camera arrays are mounted on the top and bottom of the frame to meet requirements of the 720-degree panoramic shot. The redundant design of five motors in the structure could realise the stabilisation of three-axis linkage of the gimbal that will ensure the optimal performance of the independent stable cameras all the time. At the same time, the attitude of the gimbal could be controlled by the complementary filter and proportional, integral and derivative algorithms. Furthermore, the closed-loop controls of angle, speed and current of Brushless DC motor are realised by the non-contact magnetic encoder, which improves the anti-shake performance of the system. The experiments in the prototype are designed to prove the anti-shake performance of the proposed gimbal and stability of the hexacopter UAV.

AB Due to the advancement of wireless communications, Internet of Things (IoT) becomes a promising technology in today's digital world. For the enhancement of underwater applications such as ocean exploration, deep-sea monitoring, underwater surveillance, diver network monitoring, location and object tracking, etc., Internet of underwater things (IoUT) has been introduced. However, underwater communication suffers from energy con-sumption due to fluctuations of the underwater environment and operational factors according to the distribu-tions of objects or vehicles in shallow and deep water. The IoT quality of service (QoS) in underwater communication networks is critically affected by the different energy factors related to networking and the physical layer. Network topology and routing protocol are two important major factors affecting the power consumption of IoUT nodes and vehicles. The clustering approach is considered the best choice for IoUT, however it may suffer from various influences related to the underwater environment. The optimisation-based AI technologies in clustering approaches enable to achieve of energy efficiency for IoUT applications. This paper provides a systematic review of different energy efficiency methodologies for IoUT, and classified them according to the strategies used, in addition to the research gaps in clustering-based approaches, and future directions.

AB Unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) thermal-imaging has received much attention, but the insufficient image resolution caused by thermal imaging systems is still a crucial problem that limits the understanding of thermal UAV images. However, high-resolution visible images are relatively easy to access, and it is thus valuable for exploring useful information from visible image to assist thermal UAV image super-resolution (SR). In this article, we propose a novel multiconditioned guidance network (MGNet) to effectively mine the information of visible images for thermal UAV image SR. High-resolution visible UAV images usually contain salient appearance, semantic, and edge information, which plays a critical role in boosting the performance of thermal UAV image SR. Therefore, we design an effective multicue guidance module (MGM) to leverage the appearance, edge, and semantic cues from visible images to guide thermal UAV image SR. In addition, we build the first benchmark dataset for the task of thermal UAV image SR guided by visible images. It is collected by a multimodal UAV platform and composes of 1025 pairs of manually aligned visible and thermal images. Extensive experiments on the built dataset show that our MGNet can effectively leverage useful information from visible images to improve the performance of thermal UAV image SR and perform well against several state-of-the-art methods.

AB With the advancements and developments in China's tourism industry, various autonomous forms of tourism have been gaining prominence. As such, to facilitate tourists and provide them with maximum experience while economizing on time and cost is essential. One approach toward achieving this is the optimization of tourism routes. However, so far the studies on this approach have focused primarily on inland tourist sites and have lacked a geographic perspective. Therefore, this study undertook the tourism resource data of Lushunkou District of 2020, used the ArcGIS accessibility evaluation model to analyze tourism resources, and finally used the Vehicle Routing Problem of network analysis technology to optimize the tourism route of Lushunkou District and obtain the general overall intellectual framework and technical methods for tourism route optimization. The results showed that the ArcGIS accessibility evaluation model could be used to integrate resources in the tourism area before using the Vehicle Routing Problem to optimize the analysis of tourism routes, thereby enabling the separation of different types of tourism. These divisions were based on the Vehicle Routing Problem to optimize routes for one-day and two-day tours. A new method and model for optimization for tourism routes was constructed to provide a basis and reference for the optimization of tourism routes in similar cities. The observations and results of the present study can facilitate the government in developing the tourism industry and maximizing the benefits obtained from them. Further, travel agencies and tourists will have the provision of designing optimum tourism routes.

AB The applications of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) in military, intelligent transportation, agriculture, rescue operations, natural environment mapping, and many other allied domains has increased exponentially during the past few years. Some of the use cases of their applications range from aerial surveillance, data retrieval to their use in real-time communicative networks. Though UAVs were traditionally used only outdoors, many of its indoor applications like for rescue operations, inventory tracking in warehouses, etc., have recently emerged and these use cases are being actively explored. One of the major challenges for indoor drone applications is navigation and obstacle avoidance. Due to indoor operations, the global positioning system fails in accurate localization and navigation. To address this issue, we introduce a scheme that facilitates the autonomous navigation of UAVs (which have an onboard camera) in the indoor corridors of a building using deep-neural-networks-based processing of images. For a deep neural network, the selection of a good combination of hyperparameters for a better prediction is a complicated task. In this article, the hyperparameters tuning of a convolutional neural network is achieved by using genetic algorithms. The proposed architecture (DCNN-GA) is compared with state-of-the-art ImageNet models. The experimental results show the minimum loss and high performance of the proposed algorithm.

AB Applications of multiple unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV) involve complex control dynamics for accomplishing any task. This paper employs a multi-UAV system for continuous tracking and end-to-end coverage of a moving convoy of vehicles to provide security and surveillance cover. The coverage is achieved by maintaining the moving convoy within the overlapping Field-of-Views (FoVs) of the UAVs. To learn the controls of the autonomous multi-UAV system, we propose a deep reinforcement learning based multi-agent actor-critic method called GPR-MADDPG. The proposed method makes use of Gaussian Process Regression (GPR) to estimate an unbiased and stable target value of the critic. Further, the kernel function of the GPR model has been adapted to keep the high variance in the convoy trajectory in check. The rewards for training the multi-UAV system are formulated to maximize the end-to-end convoy coverage by optimizing the overlaps between the FoVs along with minimizing the tracking error. Experiments were performed on real-world road trajectories of varying complexities along with varying convoy speeds and the number of UAVs. Further tests were performed using a simulator with a real-world physics engine. The experiments show that the proposed GPR-MADDPG model results in the least amount of overlapping error and accumulates maximum reward as compared to other prevalent approaches in the literature.

AB This paper investigates an event-triggered cooperative control policy of moving-target encirclement and tracking with time-varying radius commands for unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) formation. Different from the existing works, this study takes into account the relative motion model between the UAVs and the target in order to design a guidance law specifically tailored for moving-target encirclement and tracking. Additionally, a time-varying radius command is introduced, allowing the radius of the circular orbit formed by the UAVs around the target to adjust according to the commands. This flexibility and adaptability enhance the UAV formation's performance in complex work scenes and unstructured geometric spaces. To address the concerns of communication and computing costs associated with time-triggered guidance laws, an event-triggered method is proposed for dynamic target encirclement and tracking, eliminating the occurrence of Zeno behaviour. The stability of the proposed guidance laws is mathematically proven using the interconnected systems lemma. Finally, the effectiveness of the controllers is verified by some simulations.
   An event-triggered cooperative control strategy is proposed for encircling and tracking moving targets using a UAV formation. This strategy allows for the adjustment of the circular orbit's radius around the target in response to time-varying commands, enhancing performance in complex and unstructured environments. Additionally, the event-triggered strategy in the guidance law ensures stable formation tracking while minimizing communication and computation costs.image

   automatic emergency braking
AB Emergency Lane Change (ELC) is a strategic maneuver for collision avoidance (CA) at high speeds where there is an accident risk. In this paper, two algorithms are designed for CA at high speeds based on the vehicle's initial speed and the distance of the obstacle. The first algorithm selects the more suitable case between Automatic Emergency Braking (AEB) and ELC systems to prevent an accident. Suppose there was no choice except a rapid Lane Change (LC); the second algorithm does path planning for an ELC. The most critical issue in the ELC is time because this maneuver's duration is less than 2 or 3 s on the dry or wet road. So, designing a fast and safe path planning algorithm is very important. To solve this problem, with a seven-degrees of freedom vehicle dynamic's equations and the skilled driver behavior manner in the ELC maneuver, scrollable and stable paths for initial speeds of 75-125 km/h are extracted. Then, a neural network (NN) is trained based on this simulated data. The main feature of this network is to design stable paths as fast as possible. Also, this network can plan the paths in the various road friction coefficients between 0.5 and 1. The trajectory is selected based on two geometric constraints including, including (1) not colliding with obstacles and (2) not crossing the road boundary.

ID STATES
AB Testing and evaluation is a crucial step in the development and deployment of connected and automated vehicles (CAVs). To comprehensively evaluate the performance of CAVs, it is necessary to test the CAVs in safety-critical scenarios, which rarely happen in a naturalistic driving environment. Therefore, how to purposely and systematically generate these corner cases becomes an important problem. Most existing studies focus on generating adversarial examples for perception systems of CAVs, whereas limited efforts have been put into decision-making systems, which is the highlight of this paper. As the CAVs need to interact with numerous background vehicles (BVs) for a long duration, variables that define the corner cases are usually high-dimensional, which makes the generation a challenging problem. In this paper, a unified framework is proposed to generate corner cases for decision-making systems. To address the challenge brought by high dimensionality, the driving environment is formulated based on the Markov decision process, and the deep reinforcement learning techniques are applied to learn the behavior policy of BVs. With the learned policy, BVs behave and interact with the CAVs more aggressively, resulting in more corner cases. To further analyze the generated corner cases, the techniques of feature extraction and clustering are utilized. By selecting representative cases of each cluster and outliers, the valuable corner cases can be identified from all generated corner cases. Simulation results of a highway driving environment show that the proposed methods can effectively generate and identify the valuable corner cases.

AB For the unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)-aided vehicular multiple-input multiple-output Ricean fading channel, this study proposes a novel three-dimensional geometry-based stochastic model (GBSM). This model is the first GBSM for UAV-aided vehicular communication channels with the ability to investigate channel characteristics in different vehicular traffic density (VTD) scenarios, which is a combination of a single-cylinder model and an elliptic-cylinder model, and the signal is a sum of the line-of-sight component, single-bounced, and double-bounced rays. In addition, some expressions of channel statistical properties are derived, including space-time correlation function, space-Doppler spectral power density, envelope level crossing rate, and average fade duration. Based on the reference model, corresponding deterministic and stochastic simulation models are developed. Finally, the authors further explore the impact of some unique UAV-related parameters and different VTDs on channel statistics, and get some useful conclusions based on numerical results.

TI Older Driver Estimates of Driving Exposure Compared to In-Vehicle Data
   in the Candrive II Study
SO TRAFFIC INJURY PREVENTION
LA English
DT Article
DE automobile driving; naturalistic driving; mobility; aging
AB Objective: Most studies on older adults' driving practices have relied on self-reported information. With technological advances it is now possible to objectively measure the everyday driving of older adults in their own vehicles over time. The purpose of this study was to examine the ability of older drivers to accurately estimate their kilometers driven over one year relative to objectively measured driving exposure.
   Methods: A subsample (n = 159 of 928; 50.9% male) of Candrive II participants (age >= 70years of age) was used in these analyses based on strict criteria for data collected from questionnaires as well as an OttoView-CD Autonomous Data Logging Device installed in their vehicle, over the first year of the prospective cohort study.
   Results: Although there was no significant difference overall between the self-reported and objectively measured distance categories, only moderate agreement was found (weighted kappa = 0.57; 95% confidence interval, 0.47-0.67). Almost half (45.3%) chose the wrong distance category, and some people misestimated their distance driven by up to 20,000km. Those who misjudged in the low mileage group (<= 5000km) consistently underestimated, whereas the reverse was found for those in the high distance categories (>= 20,000); that is, they always overestimated their driving distance.
   Conclusions: Although self-reported driving distance categories may be adequate for studies entailing broad group comparisons, caution should be used in interpreting results. Use of self-reported estimates for individual assessments should be discouraged.

AB Automated livestock monitoring is a promising solution for vast and isolated farmlands or cattle stations. The advancement in sensor technology and the rise of unmanned systems have paved the way for the automated systems. In this work, we propose an Unmanned Ground Vehicle (UGV) based livestock detection-counting system for fusion images using restricted supervised learning technique. For image fusion, we propose Dual-scale image Decomposition based Fusion technique (DDF) that fuses visible and thermal images. To reduce the difficulty of ground truth annotation, we introduce Seed Labels focused Object Detector (SLOD) that carefully propagates the annotation to all the object instances in the training images. Further, we propose a novel Restricted Supervised Learning (RSL) technique that produces competitive results with minimal training data. Experimental results show that the proposed RSL is more efficient and accurate when compared to other learning techniques (fully and weakly supervised). On the test data, with only five training images and five seed labels, the restricted supervised learning has improved the average precision from 4.05% (using fully supervised learning) to 80.58% (using restricted supervised learning). With 50 seed labels, the average precision is further boosted to 91.56%. The proposed model is extensively tested on benchmark animal datasets and has achieved an average accuracy of 98.3%.

ID CLOUD DETECTION
AB Featured Application The approach presented in this paper is implemented in an autonomous UAV to provide the ability to change its path according to ground position and weather conditions, since sustaining an aircraft when flying through a dense cloud is not possible. Environment classification is one of the most critical tasks for Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAV). Since water accumulation may destabilize UAV, clouds must be detected and avoided. In a previous work presented by the authors, Superpixel Segmentation (SPS) descriptors with low computational cost are used to classify ground, sky, and clouds. In this paper, an enhanced approach to classify the environment in those three classes is presented. The proposed scheme consists of a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) trained with a dataset generated by both, an human expert and a Support Vector Machine (SVM) to capture context and precise localization. The advantage of using this approach is that the CNN classifies each pixel, instead of a cluster like in SPS, which improves the resolution of the classification, also, is less tedious for the human expert to generate a few training samples instead of the normal amount that it is required. This proposal is implemented for images obtained from video and photographic cameras mounted on a UAV facing in the same direction of the vehicle flight. Experimental results and comparison with other approaches are shown to demonstrate the effectiveness of the algorithm.

AB The purpose of this research was to demonstrate a road-compatible piezoelectric energy harvester (RPEH) that uses the energy to power self-powered sensors and vehicle indicators. The demonstrated RPEH (20 x 50 x 10 cm(3)) with 80 piezoelectric devices can efficiently convert mechanical energy stemming from the small vertical displacement (1.45 mm) from vehicles into electrical power. The maximum voltage is 113.5 V, the maximum current is 25.71 mA, and the maximum power is 661 mW (6.61 W/m(2)) at an impedance resistance level of 0.9 k Omega under a z-axial load. The high-power RPEH was initially installed at a highway rest area. The measured output performances of the installed module on the actual roadway in the test setup area were a maximum voltage of 196 V and output power of 2080 mW (20.79 W/m(2)) at a vehicle speed of 30 km/h. Tests of the RPEH module demonstrate its ability to measure temperature, strain, and leakage values in real time and the generated energy provides sufficient power to illuminate LED indicators. It was also found that the z-axial loaded piezoelectric devices with a two-end fixed beam provide high output power with low levels of vertical displacement, making it highly efficient and durable for actual highway energy-harvesting applications.

AB People have become busier in the modern world with both work and housework. In addition to the different types of robotic cleaner, it would be quite helpful to have a smart robotic trash collection and dumping system that provides on-call services so that a user does not need to physically get up and put trash into a trash can. As the bin reaches its maximum capacity, it also dumps the trash automatically without the user's instructions. Available smart trash cans are usually focused on determining if the trash is recyclable. Most trash cans also do not have the capability to move autonomously. In this research, we utilize fingerprint mapping for wireless indoor positioning towards the implementation of an autonomous vehicle with a mounted trash can. The user may make an indoor call to the trash-can-mounted vehicle via a mobile application under an IoT and cloud computing environment. The vehicle can position itself in front of the user for trash collection through automatic obstacle avoidance navigation with smart path planning from deep learning. The system can also monitor the amount of accumulated trash and dump trash at a fixed location before returning to the start point. This research on a smart trash-collecting robot can provide significant assistance to people who are busy, those with impaired or limited movements, and the elderly.

AB For real-time transmission of high-bandwidth sensor data from an unmanned aircraft vehicle (UAV) to the ground station (GS) in an unmanned aircraft system, a high-speed payload communication system is essential. While orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing (OFDM) is very effective for terrestrial wideband systems, possible higher speed of UAVs or higher carrier frequencies can increase the Doppler shift, and therefore increase the inter-carrier interference (ICI) in OFDM systems. In these scenarios, the complete frequency-domain channel matrix should be estimated and used for ICI mitigation and data recovery. In this study, a time-domain pilot-based channel estimation scheme is described to estimate the entire frequency-domain channel matrix for moderate-to-high Doppler OFDM systems. Simulation results indicate that the new scheme provides better performance compared with channel estimation schemes designed for low Doppler scenarios that partially estimate the frequency-domain channel matrix. The comparison is also presented with the other full channel estimation scheme, named autoregressive scheme, showing a comparable performance with much lower complexity for the new scheme.

TI Case Study: Skagerrak Wrecks and Measures to Reduce the Environmental
   Risk
SO MARINE TECHNOLOGY SOCIETY JOURNAL
LA English
DT Article
AB The Norwegian Coastal Administration (NCA) is responsible for monitoring the environmental risk created by shipwrecks in Norwegian waters. If the risk is found to be unacceptable, corrective measures will be recommended to the Norwegian 1 Ministry of Fisheries and Coastal Affaires. Approval and funding of such corrective measures will be decided by the Ministry.
   The NCA has been tasked to execute a program to find the shipwrecks that constitute the highest environmental risk from substances other than oil. The NCA's Wreck Data Base (2,300 wrecks) is the basis for the study.
   The emphasis of this article is on activities connected to ships loaded with chemical weapons (CWs) dumped in the Skagerrak. The article gives information on the surveys carried out by the Norwegian Defense Research Establishment (FFI) in 1989 and 2002. A number of the wrecks containing CWs are unaccounted I for. FFI recommended in the 2002 report that an effort should be made to find the remaining CW wrecks. To find and possibly identify the missing CW wrecks in Skagerrak, a search program will be developed. The NCA is testing a new concept this autumn: is it possible to identify a sunken ship by class or name based on information from an underwater vehicle? The test of FFI's HUGIN 1000 HUS autonomous underwater vehicle is expected to provide information on the suitability of the vehicle in providing data for wreck location and identification.

DT Article
AB Using power resources of the outer space and its industrialization have become an urgent task in the development of present day civilization. Solar energy is the most suitable basis for power supply for the majority of projects in the near-Earth space. Passing on to the large-scale space-based systems of power supply requires putting into life demonstration experiments in which power transmission by electromagnetic emission is supposed.
   In the paper the expedience of developing an autonomous power module which provides the possibility of space programs with great power consumption and wireless transmission system running-up is proved. Ukraine can design a solar power satellite of 10-20 kW power on the basis of the research satellite AUOS-SM. Two variants of design solutions for such satellite with solar arrays of great area are presented. Power transmission to the space vehicle-consumer can be conducted by cable as well as in a wireless way. The possibilities of placing microwave and laser energy transmission systems on board the satellite are analysed. It is shown that a power supply system for space vehicles with transmission distance of thousands km can be designed basing on modem lasers.
   Some experiments making use of great electric power generated by the plant of the satellite under consideration are proposed. The running-up of electric thrusters which are necessary for orientation and distancing is of great interest. Wireless power transmission may be carried on to a small satellite equipped with electric thrusters.

AB Mapless navigation for mobile Unmanned Ground Vehicles (UGVs) using Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) has attracted significantly rising attention in robotic and related research communities. Collision avoidance from dynamic obstacles in unstructured environments, such as pedestrians and other vehicles, is one of the key challenges for mapless navigation. This paper proposes a DRL algorithm based on heuristic correction learning for autonomous navigation of a UGV in mapless configuration. We use a 24-dimensional lidar sensor, and merge the target position information and the speed information of the UGV as the input of the reinforcement learning agent. The actions of the UGV are produced as the output of the agent. Our proposed algorithm has been trained and evaluated in both static and dynamic environments. The experimental result shows that our proposed algorithm can reach the target in less time with shorter distances under the premise of ensuring safety than other algorithms. Especially, the success rate of our proposed algorithm is 2.05 times higher than the second effective algorithm and the trajectory efficiency is improved by 24%\documentclass[12pt]{minimal}\usepackage{amsmath}\usepackage{wasysym}\usepackage{amsfonts}\usepackage{amssymb}\usepackage{amsbsy}\usepackage{mathrsfs}\usepackage{upgreek}\setlength{\oddsidemargin}{-69pt}\begin{document}$$24\%$$\end{document} in the dynamic environment. Finally, our proposed algorithm is deployed on a real robot in the real-world environment to validate and evaluate the algorithm performance. Experimental results show that our proposed algorithm can be directly applied to real robots robustly.

AB Pollination is critical for the production of many crops, and both insect- and wind-based pollination systems are increasingly disrupted by bloom asynchrony, weather events, and high demand for available insect pollinators. Artificial pollination systems can provide a security of yield even in poor pollination scenarios, and have been attracting increasing attention over the past decade. Here, we review pollen collection and pollen application technologies that have been employed to date. Major categories of mechanical pollination technology include: hand-pollination, handheld and backpack devices, vehicle-mounted devices, unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), and robotic and autonomous pollinators. The majority of the artificial pollination systems above are used to supplement natural pollination, but for some crops, these systems were found to perform adequately by themselves, including kiwifruit, olive, date palm, walnut, tomato, and hybrid maize seed. These systems often treat pollen as a system input, creating a chicken-and-egg problem in which the system is not economical without pollen and the pollen is not economical to collect without wide uptake of the system. To combat this, there has been success in developing mechanical harvesters for some crop plants (particularly almond and maize), but future work is needed for artificial pollination to be a commercial reality for the increasing number of cropping systems that are experiencing pollination deficits.

AB With the continuous miniaturization of electronic devices and the recent advancements in wireless communication technologies, Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs), in general, and Small Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (SUAVs, a.k.a., drones), in particular, are becoming progressively used by the civilian sector within the context of a variety of applications, bringing great convenience to the public. However, due to their resource-constrained nature, risky environmental application, and wireless way of communication, drones are not immune from cyberthreats. As a consequence, the security of drones (SUAVs) has recently gained significant attention by the research community. In particular, when it comes to inter-drone communication. Although traditional cryptographic techniques may provide a certain level of security, they actually constitute a heavy burden on SUAVs due to their resource-constrained nature. In the light of enforcing the security of inter-drone communications, this paper proposes a lightweight drone-to-drone authentication protocol, called D2D-MAP, that uses PUF (Physical Unclonable Function) technology. We design the protocol and evaluate its resilience against various attacks. We use resource-constrained hardware to implement the authentication protocol and perform an evaluation of its performance. We show that the protocol's security and the obtained performance are prominent compared to state-of-the-art authentication protocols, and that they conform to SUAVs security and performance requirements.

ID TRAJECTORY OPTIMIZATION
AB Providing reliable connectivity to cellular-connected Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) can be very challenging; their performance highly depends on the nature of the surrounding environment, such as density and heights of the ground Base Stations (BSs). On the other hand, tall buildings might block undesired interference signals from ground BSs, thereby improving the connectivity between the UAVs and their serving BSs. To address the connectivity of UAVs in such environments, this paper proposes a Reinforcement Learning (RL) algorithm to dynamically optimise the height of a UAV as it moves through the environment, with the goal of increasing the throughput or spectrum efficiency that it experiences. The proposed solution is evaluated in two settings: using a series of generated environments where we vary the number of BS and building densities, and in a scenario using real-world data obtained from an experiment in Dublin, Ireland. Results show that our proposed RL-based solution improves UAV Quality of Service (QoS) by 6% to 41%, depending on the scenario. We also conclude that, when flying at heights higher than the buildings, building density variation has no impact on UAV QoS. On the other hand, BS density can negatively impact UAV QoS, with higher numbers of BSs generating more interference and deteriorating UAV performance.

AB Due to the uninterrupted flight of the unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV) and the varying phase of the intelligent reflecting surface (IRS) in the IRS-assisted UAV communication system, it is very difficult to estimate the channel information of the system accurately. The traditional solutions try to model the whole communication system as an autoencoder including encoder, channel, and decoder. However, the autoencoder needs to be retrained when the environment changes and the generalization ability is lousy. To solve above problems, a novel C1DAE-ANIL algorithm is proposed to estimate the channel information of the IRS-assisted UAV communication system. On one hand, one-dimensional convolution is introduced to the traditional multi-perceptron autoencoder (MLPAE) for enhancing the encoding and decoding performances of the one-dimensional convolutional autoencoder (C1DAE). On the other hand, the meta-learning is applied to the C1DAE, and the almost no inner loop (ANIL) algorithm is used to find an optimal initial parameter vector of the C1DAE to realize the rapid training in dynamic environments. Compared with the existing contenders, the simulation results show that the end-to-end communication model using the C1DAE-ANIL algorithm not only improves the accuracy of channel estimation but also greatly accelerates the training process in dynamic environments.

ID INTELLIGENT; GPS
AB Over-/underspeeding is one of the leading causes of road accidents. Traditional systems of detecting and reporting speed-limit violations are not suitable for smart cities. Even the sophisticated conventional systems that use cameras or RFIDs for automating speed-limit violations have several drawbacks, including cost, complexity, reliability, and maintenance. In this paper, we present two systems based on the Internet of Vehicles (IoV) to automatically detect speed-limit violations and autonomously report the committed violations to the authorities. Our systems require no extra hardware or equipment: only the On-Board Unit (OBU), the Road Side Unit (RSU), and the Cloud Server software have to be updated to have a fully functioning system as long as the IoV infrastructure is deployed. One of the systems will be installed on the OBU. A second alternative system design is to use Cloud Servers (CSs) and the IoV beacons that are sent from the vehicles. Additionally, unlike the existing systems installed in specific locations, all roads in the smart cities and highways will be fully monitored. Adaptive fine calculation according to new dynamic policies can be easily integrated into the proposed system. Furthermore, the proposed system can accurately operate in all weather conditions. Moreover, it allows the dynamic adjustment of the speed limits according to the current weather conditions. We have validated the proposed system by building a prototype system that effectively and accurately detects and reports over-/underspeed traffic violations alongside any road.

AB In backstepping implementation, the derivatives of virtual control signals are required at each step. This study provides a novel way to solve this problem by combining online optimisation with backstepping design in an outer and inner loop manner. The properties of differential flatness and the B-spline polynomial function are exploited to transform the optimal control problem into a computationally efficient form. The optimisation process generates not only the optimised states, but also their finite order derivatives which can be used to analytically calculate the derivatives of virtual control signal required in backstepping design. In addition, the online optimisation repeatedly performed in a receding horizon fashion can also realise local motion planning for obstacle avoidance. The stability of the receding horizon control scheme is analysed via Lyapunov method which is guaranteed by adding a parameterised terminal condition in the online optimisation. Numerical simulations and flight experiments of a quadrotor unmanned air vehicle are given to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed composite control method.

AB An accurate attitude and heading reference system (AHRS) is a key component to ensuring safe and reliable flight of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs). Recently, much attention has been given to developing AHRS using inertial sensors based on microelectromechanical sytems (MEMS). These MEMS-based AHRS are low-cost, lightweight, and consume little power. However, the advantages of inexpensive MEMS sensors are coupled with the drawback of having greater potential error in reported roll, pitch, and yaw angles due to increased sensor noise and drift. To minimize this error, advanced sensor fusion techniques such as Kalman Filtering are commonly implemented. Testing these techniques, and the AHRS as a whole, is therefore a crucial part of the performance optimization process. This paper outlines the development of an inexpensive 3-axis motion platform for AHRS calibration and testing that replicates aircraft motions from actual UAV flights, or from a flight simulator. To accomplish this, custom LabVIEW control software was developed to process time-stamped aircraft orientation data. Commands were then sent through a microcontroller to the motion platform, which reconstructs the flights with high precision (R-2 = .994). By using this method, AHRS testing can be performed under more realistic conditions, providing an alternative to costly field testing. This technique is especially useful for simulations of autonomous vehicle technologies such as collision avoidance, where an increased risk of damage to the UAV is present.

AB The unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)-aided free-space optical/radio frequency (FSO/RF) technique has recently attracted significant attention, which offers new possibilities thanks to its dynamic deployment capability. However, many researchers have not considered the fading characteristic of both RF and FSO links and the limited UAVs' size, weight, and power (SWAP) simultaneously. This paper focuses on a mixed FSO/RF system that facilitates the communication between a base station and mobile stations via a hovering UAV acting as a decode-and-forward relay. Considering the fading effects and the power amplifier (PA) non-linearity caused by the SWAP constraint, we mathematically analyze the closed-form and asymptotic outage probabilities. Especially in high transmit power regions, we present the destructive impact of nonlinear PAs on the outage probability and investigate modulation schemes to mitigate this degradation. The derived outage expressions match well with numerical results. Moreover, we propose a joint placement and transmit power optimization algorithm that minimizes the end-to-end outage probability with round-robin and absolute signal-to-noise ratio-based scheduling schemes. Finally, simulation results show that the performance of the proposed algorithm is comparable to that of the brute-force method.

AB The rise of surveillance systems has led to exponential growth in collected data, enabling several advances in Deep Learning to exploit them and automate tasks for autonomous systems. Vehicle detection is a crucial task in the fields of Intelligent Vehicle Systems and Intelligent Transport systems, making it possible to control traffic density or detect accidents and potential risks. This paper presents an optimal meta-method that can be applied to any instant segmentation model, such as Mask R-CNN or YOLACT++. Using the initial detections obtained by these models and super-resolution, an optimized re-inference is performed, allowing the detection of elements not identified a priori and improving the quality of the rest of the detections. The direct application of super-resolution is limited because instance segmentation models process images according to a fixed dimension. Therefore, in cases where the super-resolved images exceed this fixed size, the model will rescale them again, thus losing the desired effect. The advantages of this meta-method lie mainly in the fact that it is not required to modify the model architecture or re-train it. Regardless of the size of the images given as input, super-resolved areas that fit the defined dimension of the object segmentation model will be generated. After applying our proposal, experiments show an improvement of up to 8.1% for the YOLACT++ model used in the Jena sequence of the CityScapes dataset.

AB This contribution relates to the activities of the TC-19 on "Imaging Signals and Systems." In a rapidly changing global economy, experiencing an unparalleled integration of science and technology, the development of efficient imaging systems is of extreme significance. The scope of TC-19 is to exchange and disseminate knowledge as well as bridge multidisciplinary areas leading to the creation of new knowledge and establish global collaborative multidisciplinary opportunities by tightening collaborations among government, industry, academia, and healthcare industry. The Committee explores a variety of computer vision and visualization systems spanning from medical imaging to defense, industry, and consumer electronics. These imaging systems use statistical or sophisticated artificial algorithms and require the integration of several technological and computational disciplines, such as detector physics and phenomenology, calibration, metrology, data acquisition, data analysis, image processing, feature extraction, and classification. Often, coexisting competing design requirements and trade-off introduce significant challenges to the design of imaging technologies. For instance, Autonomous Vehicles (AV)s, Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAV)s, Unmanned Underwater Vehicle (UUV)s, microsatellites, nanosatellites, and picosatellites for defense and civilian applications are characteristic examples with trade-off between design requirements for high performance imaging and maintaining low-power consumption, high-data transmission, low storage and memory, and reduced payload. To address these competing design challenges, TC-19 introduced the polarimetric neuromorphic vision principles which blend bioinspired principles such as human cognition with the vision of certain arthropods, and aquatic biological species.

TI Probabilistic Planning for Continuous Dynamic Systems under Bounded Risk
SO JOURNAL OF ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE RESEARCH
LA English
DT Article
ID OPTIMIZATION
AB This paper presents a model-based planner called the Probabilistic Sulu Planner or the p-Sulu Planner, which controls stochastic systems in a goal directed manner within user-specified risk bounds. The objective of the p-Sulu Planner is to allow users to command continuous, stochastic systems, such as unmanned aerial and space vehicles, in a manner that is both intuitive and safe. To this end, we first develop a new plan representation called a chance-constrained qualitative state plan (CCQSP), through which users can specify the desired evolution of the plant state as well as the acceptable level of risk. An example of a CCQSP statement is "go to A through B within 30 minutes, with less than 0.001% probability of failure." We then develop the p-Sulu Planner, which can tractably solve a CCQSP planning problem. In order to enable CCQSP planning, we develop the following two capabilities in this paper: 1) risk-sensitive planning with risk bounds, and 2) goal-directed planning in a continuous domain with temporal constraints. The first capability is to ensures that the probability of failure is bounded. The second capability is essential for the planner to solve problems with a continuous state space such as vehicle path planning. We demonstrate the capabilities of the p-Sulu Planner by simulations on two real-world scenarios: the path planning and scheduling of a personal aerial vehicle as well as the space rendezvous of an autonomous cargo spacecraft.

AB In the process of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV) cluster coordination, communication obstruction may cause situational misjudgement and increase the risk of decision-making errors. Therefore, based on evolutionary game theory, this research aimed to study the behaviour decision-making selection problem in the process of UAV swarm missions in limited communication networks. First, the evolution process of the UAV swarm confrontation game is analyzed and the decision-making risks associated with the communication network of the UAV swarm during coordination, which are caused by the complex confrontation environment are identified. Second, the decision-making risks and mechanisms of UAV swarm communication is discussed and an evolutionary game mathematical model for the cooperative strategy of a UAV swarm under communication constraints is established. Finally, the influence of various key parameters is simulated and analyzed, such as the initial strategy probability of both parties, amount of platform information data, information analysis and utilization ability, and information interaction coefficient, on the evolution of the UAV swarm strategy. This research provides a theoretical basis and feasible reference for the improvement of UAV mission decision response mechanisms and system model construction, which have important theoretical value and practical significance.

AB Recent advances in vehicle technology offer new opportunities for an electric, automated, modular bus (MB) unit with an adjustable capacity to be applied to transit systems, promising to tackle the resource allocation challenges of traditional buses in coping with uneven travel demand. Drawing on the concept of modular vehicles, this paper introduces a novel scheduling system in which MB units can be combined/separated from fulfilling imbalanced trip demands through capacity adjustments. We develop an optimization model for determining the optimal formation and trip sequence of MB units. In particular, given that the vehicles are electrically powered, battery range limits and charging plans are considered in the system scheduling process. A column-generation-based heuristic algorithm is designed to efficiently solve this model, with constraints related to travel demand and charging station capacity incorporated into the master problem and the trip sequence for modular units with limited energy solved by the subproblem. Taking real data from transit operations for numerical examples, the proposed model performs well in terms of both algorithmic performance and practical applications. The generated optimal MB dispatching scheme can significantly reduce the operating cost from $1534.31 to $1144.26, a decrease of approximately 25% compared to conventional electric buses. The sensitivity analysis on the MB dispatch cost and battery capacity provides some insights for both the scenario configuration and the battery selection for MB system implementation.

AB Cyber-physical systems (CPS) for device-to-device (D2D) communications are gaining prominence in today's sophisticated data transmission infrastructures. This research intends to develop a new model for UAV transmissions across distinct network nodes, which is necessary since an automatic monitoring system is required to enhance the current D2D application infrastructure. The real time significance of proposed UAV for D2D communications can be observed during data transmission state where individual data will have huge impact on maximizing the D2D security. Additionally, through the use of simulation, an exploratory persistence tool is offered for CPS networks with fully characterized energy issues. This UAV CPS paradigm is based on mobility nodes, which host concurrent systems and control algorithms. In sixth-generation networks, when there are no barriers and the collision rate is low and the connectivity is fast, the method is also feasible. Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) can now cover great distances, even while encountering hazardous obstacles. When compared to the preexisting models, the simulated values for autonomous, collision, and parametric reliability are much better by an average of 87%. The proposed model, however, is shown to be highly independent and exhibits stable perceptual behaviour. The proposed UAV approach is optimal for real-time applications due to its potential for more secure operation via a variety of different communication modules. & COPY; 2023 Published by Elsevier B.V.

AB The objective of this study was to explore the relevance between Autonomous Emergency Braking (AEB) control strategy and occupant pre-impact kinematics among a typical real-world cut-in impact scenario. First, the accident scenario was built with PreScan software after accident analysis. Second, a MADYMO simulation model with Active Human Model (AHM) was built and validated with the volunteer test carried out by our team. Finally, the AEB module and related control strategies were introduced into the main vehicle, and the effects of different strategies on the occupant kinematic were evaluated. The simulation results indicated that it was efficient to evaluate the occupant kinematics during pre-impact phase through vehicle and occupant integrated simulation method. The main vehicle's velocity could be reduced between 5 km/h and 14 km/h respectively after introducing different AEB control strategies, which was less than the one manoeuvred by driver (22 km/h). Earlier activation of the AEB and heavier braking could result in larger up-body displacement, but less final impact velocity, and the maximum head displacement reached 172.56 mm due to the AEB control. Comparing partial braking with detection angle 9 degrees case with 100% braking with detection angle 18 degrees case, the head, thorax and shoulder displacements were increased by 94.8%, 104.1%, and 48.7%. This research is beneficial for the subsequent integrated safety analysis.

ID LANE-LEVEL; GPS; IDENTIFIABILITY; ENVIRONMENTS; SYSTEMS
AB Accurate localization with high availability is a key requirement for autonomous vehicles. It remains a major challenge when using automotive sensors such as single-frequency Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) receivers, a lane detection camera, and proprioceptive sensors. This paper describes a method that enables the estimation of stand-alone single-frequency GNSS errors by integrating the measurements from a forward-looking camera matched with lane markings stored in a digital map. It includes a parameter identification method for a shaping model, which is evaluated using experimental data. An algebraic observability study is then conducted to prove that the proposed state vector is fully observable in a road-oriented frame. This observability property is the basis to develop a road-centered Extended Kalman filter (EKF) that can maintain the observability of every component of the state vector on any road, whatever its orientation. To accomplish this, the filter needs to handle road changes, which it does using bijective transformations. The filter was implemented and tested intensely on an experimental vehicle for driverless valet parking services. Field results have shown that the performance of the estimation process is better than solutions based on EKF implemented in a fixed working frame. The proposed filter guarantees that the drift along the road direction remains bounded. This is very important when the vehicle navigates autonomously. Furthermore, the road-centered modeling improves the accuracy, consistency, and robustness of the localization solver. (C) 2017 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

AB Designs for an optical sensor detector array for use in autonomous control of unmanned underwater vehicles (UUVs), or between UUVs and docking station, are studied in this paper. Here, various optical detector arrays are designed for the purpose of determining and distinguishing relative 5 degrees-of-freedom (DOF) motion between UUVs: 3-DOF translation and 2-DOF rotation (pitch and yaw). In this paper, a numerically based simulator is developed to evaluate varying detector array designs. The simulator includes a single light source as a guiding beacon for a variety of UUV motion types. The output images of the light field intersecting the detector array are calculated based on detector hardware characteristics, the optical properties of water, and expected noise sources. Using the simulator, the performance of planar and curved detector array designs (of varying size arrays) are analytically compared and evaluated. Output images are validated using empirical in situ measurements conducted in underwater facilities at the University of New Hampshire, Durham, NH, USA. Results of this study show that the optical detector array is able to distinguish relative 5-DOF motion with respect to the simulator light source. Furthermore, tests confirm that the proposed detector array design is able to distinguish positional changes of 0.2 m and rotational changes of 10 degrees within 4-8 m range in x-axis based on given output images.

AB The plug-in electric vehicle (PEV) has attracted more and more attention because of the energy crisis and environmental pollution, which is also the main shiftable load of the residential users' demand side management (DSM) system in the future smart grid (SG). In this paper, we employ game theory to provide an autonomous energy management system among residential users considering selling energy back to the utility company by discharging the PEV's battery. By assuming all users are equipped with smart meters to execute automatic energy consumption scheduling (ECS) and the energy company can adopt adequate pricing tariffs relating to time and level of energy usage, we formulate an energy management game, where the players are the residential users and the strategies are their daily schedules of household appliance use. We will show that the Nash equilibrium of the formulated energy management game can guarantee the global optimization in terms of minimizing the energy costs, where the depreciation cost of PEV's battery because of discharging and selling energy back is also considered. Simulation results verify that the proposed game-theoretic approach can reduce the total energy cost and individual daily electricity payment. Moreover, since plug-in electric bicycles (PEBs) are currently widely used in China, simulation results of residential users owing household appliances and bidirectional energy trading of PEBs are also provided and discussed.

AB With the progression of marine exploration and exploitation, as well as the advancements in mechanical intelligence, the utilization of the unmanned surface vehicle (USV) and the design of their guidance system have become prominent areas of focus. However, the stern ramp recovery of the USV is still in its infancy due to its unique attitude requirements and automation design. Furthermore, few studies have addressed the impact of maritime disturbances, with most research limited to simulations. To enhance the efficiency and accuracy of stern ramp recovery, this paper presents the development and construction of a novel recovery system. By incorporating physical modeling of disturbance forces acting on USVs at sea, the practicality of the system is improved. Additionally, an optimized genetic algorithm is introduced in the navigation module to improve convergence rates and subsequently enhance recovery efficiency. A line-of-sight (LOS) algorithm based on average velocity is proposed in this paper to ensure the attainment of unique attitude requirements and to improve the effectiveness of stern chute recovery. This paper provides a detailed description of the independently designed USV hardware system. Moreover, simulations and practical experiments conducted using this experimental platform are presented, offering a new solution for the USV's stern ramp recovery.

AB The recent pandemic of COVID-19 has proven to be a test case for Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs). UAVs have shown great potential for plenty of applications in the face of this pandemic, but their scope of applications becomes limited due to the dependency on ground pilots. Irrespective of the application, it is imperative to have an autonomous path planning to utilize UAVs to their full potential. Collision-free trajectories are expected from the path planning process to ensure the safety of UAVs and humans on the ground. This work proposes a path planning technique where collision avoidance is mathematically proven under an uncertainty prerequisite, that the UAV follows its requested moving position within some threshold distance. This scheme ensures UAV safety by considering the underlying control's system overshoots. Obstacles play a guiding role in selecting collision-free trajectories. These obstacles are modeled as rectangular shapes with interest points defined around their corners. These points further define collision-free permissible edges, and later we apply the Dijkstra algorithm to these edges before having the desired trajectory. Regardless of the size of deployment area, our proposed scheme incurs low computational load due to the dependency on pre-defined interest points only thereby making it suitable for real-time path planning. Simulation results obtained using MATLAB's UAV Toolbox show that the proposed method succeeds in getting short collision-free trajectories.

AB Unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) has been more and more widely used in military and civilian, with its unique advantages of flexibility, convenience, and wide coverage. As flying stations, UAVs can quickly set up relay communication links for different missions, to enhance the receiving signal power, increase the system capacity, and expand the communication coverage. In this article, we investigate a two-way multihop UAV relaying network, where there are two ground users as sources and multiple UAVs as relays to help the two ground sources exchange information. For the purpose of enhancing the efficiency of the investigated UAV-assisted relaying, we come up with a productive two-way multihop UAV relaying pattern, which can achieve a data rate of (1/2) data packets per time slot with the decode-andforward protocol. Then, we further formulate a joint transmit power and trajectory optimization problem for the UAVs in this two-way multihop relaying scenario. The formulated problem is nonconvex which makes it difficult to solve directly; hence, we propose an iterative algorithm to obtain an approximate optimal solution based on block coordinate descent and successive convex optimization techniques. Numerical results demonstrate that our proposed two-way multihop UAV relaying network achieves significant throughput gains compared with other benchmark schemes.

This reduction in driving demands encourages them to engage with nondriving related tasks, which may impair awareness of the road environment once a takeover request (TOR) is initiated. This article examined the four suggested strategies drivers that take to regain control following a TOR, from the perspective of interruption management principles. Thirty students participated in a simulated study of two drives, where we manipulated TOR alerts, time to regain control, and potential road hazards. We hypothesized that all four interruption management strategies will be observed. Our hypothesis was confirmed. Four strategies were identified. Most drivers chose strategy 2 to accept and initiate the takeover immediately after the TOR started. The second frequent strategy was to reject the TOR but look at the road. Drivers' strategy choices changed following alert type and the chronological drive order. With simulated driving experience (i.e., second drive), drivers postponed taking control, adapting to the time budget. Yet, inaccurate understanding of the situation or over-trust affected the chosen strategy. We conclude that interruption management principles are beneficial for studying how drivers respond to TORs and evaluating options to improve TOR performance.

AB The automotive domain is living an extremely challenging historical moment shocked by many emerging business and technological needs. Electrification, autonomous driving, and connected cars are some of the driving needs in this changing world. Increasingly, vehicles are becoming software-intensive complex systems and most of the innovation within the automotive industry is based on electronics and software. Modern vehicles can have over 100 Electronic Control Units (ECUs), which are small computers, together executing gigabytes of software. ECUs are connected to each other through several networks within the car, and the car is increasingly connected with the outside world. These novelties ask for a change on how the software is engineered and produced and for a disruptive renovation of the electrical and software architecture of the car. In this paper we describe the current investigation of Volvo Cars to create an architecture framework able to cope with the complexity and needs of present and future vehicles. Specifically, we present scenarios that describe demands for the architectural framework and introduce three new viewpoints that need to be taken into account for future architectural decisions: Continuous Integration and Deployment, Ecosystem and Transparency, and car as a constituent of a System of Systems. Our results are based on a series of focus groups with experts in automotive engineering and architecture from different companies and universities. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Objectives The objectives of this study were to compare the adult occupant injury risk on specific body regions in frontal and rear impact and to investigate the effect of those crash conditions and occupant-related factors on the injury risk. Method Data from the NASS-CDS and Crash Investigation Sampling System were studied for crashes during 2000 to 2019 involving model year 2000 to 2020 motor vehicles, including frontal collisions and rear-end collisions. The injury risk by specific body regions were compared by descriptive statistics, and logistic regression models were developed to examine the effects of various factors on injury risk by specific body regions, controlling for crash type (frontal impact and rear impact), vehicle impact speed, vehicle impact location, vehicle model year, and occupant gender, age, belt use, and seating position. Results After controlling for the confounding factors, the occupants in frontal impact had higher overall injury risk than in rear impact (at Maximum Abbreviated Injury Scale [MAIS] 3+; odds ratio [OR] = 6.23; 95% confidence interval [CI] [6.06-6.40]), except for lower neck/spine injury risk at MAIS 1+ (OR = 0.47; 95% CI [0.46-0.47]). The impact speed (at MAIS 3+; OR = 1.10; 95% CI [1.10-1.10]) and aging (at MAIS 3+; OR = 1.05; 95% CI [1.05-1.05]) increase overall injury risk, and the unbelted occupants had higher overall injury risk than belted occupants not only in frontal impact (at MAIS 3+; OR = 4.04; 95% CI [3.98-4.10]), but also in rear impact (at MAIS 3+; OR = 28.4; 95% CI [26.4-30.5]). Females had higher overall injury risk than males in frontal impact (at MAIS 3+; OR = 2.01; 95% CI [1.99-2.04]) but not in rear impact (at MAIS 3+; OR = 0.77; 95% CI [0.73-0.81]). Conclusions Occupants in rear impact had lower injury risk than in frontal impact at MAIS 1+ to MAIS 3+, except for neck/spine at MAIS 1+. The belt restraint was effective not only in frontal impact but also in rear impact. This study provided injury risk references for current vehicles that may provide insight to the potential injury risk of rear-facing occupants in future vehicle configurations.

AB The identification and classification of obstacles in navigable and non-navigable regions, as well as the measurement of distances, are crucial topics of investigation in the field of autonomous navigation for unmanned surface vehicles (USVs). Currently, USVs mostly rely on LiDAR and ultrasound technology for the purpose of detecting impediments that exist on water surfaces. However, it is worth noting that these approaches lack the capability to accurately discern the precise nature or classification of those obstacles. Nevertheless, the limited optical range of unmanned vessels hinders their ability to comprehensively perceive the entirety of the surrounding information. A cooperative USV-UAV system is proposed to ensure the visual perception ability of USVs. The multi-object recognition, semantic segmentation, and obstacle ranging through USV and unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) perspectives are selected to validate the performance of a cooperative USV-UAV system. The you only look once-X (YOLOX) model, the proportional-integral-derivative-NET (PIDNet) model, and distance measurements based on a monocular camera are utilized to realize these problems. The results indicate that by integrating the viewpoints of USVs and UAVs, a collaborative USV-UAV system, employing the aforementioned methods, can successfully detect and classify different objects surrounding the USV. Additionally, it can differentiate between navigable and non-navigable regions for unmanned vessels through visual recognition, while accurately determining the distance between the USV and obstacles.

AB This paper proposes, and evaluates the benefits of, a hybrid central cloud (CC) and mobile edge computing (MEC) platform, especially introduced to balance the network resources for joint communication and computation. The transmission is further empowered by splitting the users' messages into private and common parts, to mitigate the interference within the CC and MEC platforms. While several power-hungry, computationally-limited unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) are deployed at the cell-edge to boost the CC connectivity and relieve part of its computation burden, the CC connects to the base-stations via capacity-limited fronthauls. The paper then considers the problem of maximizing the weighted sum-rate subject to fronthaul and computation capacity, achievable rates, power, delay, and data-split constraints. Thereby determining the beamforming vectors associated with the private and common messages, the computation allocations, and the data-split factors. Such intricate non-convex optimization problem is tackled using an iterative algorithm that relies on well-chosen discrete relaxation, successive convex approximation, and fractional programming, and can be compellingly implemented in a distributed fashion. The simulations illustrate the proposed algorithm's capabilities for empowering joint communication and computation, and highlight the pronounced role of rate-splitting and common message decoding in alleviating large-scale interference in hybrid CC/MEC networks.

AB In order to evaluate the impacts of swarm distribution characteristics of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) and the complexity of millimeter wave (mmWave) propagations on the coverage performance of UAV networks, this paper develops a stochastic geometry-based approach for the modeling and analysis of single- and multi-swarm UAV networks with mmWave communications. We first utilize binomial point processes (BPPs) to model the locations of UAVs in a finite area as a single-swarm UAV network and allow for arbitrary user locations. Then, we define multi-BPPs and extend our model to multi-swarm UAV networks. We consider an open-access strategy, where users access the closest UAV in all swarms, and derive the distance distributions of serving and interfering UAVs. Moreover, a three-dimensional (3D) blockage model and a 3D sectorized antenna model are introduced to completely depict the characteristics of air-to-ground channel in mmWave band. Based on the distance distributions and the Laplace transform of interference, coverage probabilities in considered networks are derived. Our results reveal that, there exists optimal height and density of UAV swarms that maximize the coverage probability. When densely deployed, the interference from inter-swarm cannot be negligible in the multi-swarm UAV network.

AB This paper investigates a dual-unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) aided communication system to improve the security of the communication between ground devices and UAVs. Different from the existing works which ignored ground devices mobility and just considered one-way communication security between ground devices and UAVs, we allow the devices to be mobile and consider bi-directional ground-UAV communication security. Specifically, one UAV server communicates with mobile ground devices, and the other UAV jammer is invoked to confuse eavesdroppers. Our objective is to maximize the worst-case average secrecy rate by the joint optimization of UAV trajectory and sender transmit power. To achieve it, we first formulate the worst-case average secrecy rate maximization problem as a constrained Markov decision process (CMDP) under the constraints of UAV flight space, flight speed, energy capacity, anti-collision, and peak transmit power. Then, we design a Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (DDPG) based algorithm to solve the CMDP. Experiment results demonstrate that our joint optimization scheme can enhance the communication security in terms of the secrecy rate in both UAV-to-ground (U2G) case and ground-to-UAV (G2U) case. Besides, it is observed that UAV trajectory and sender transmit power have different impacts on the communication security in U2G case and G2U case.

AB Driving is a task that puts heavy demands on visual information, thereby the human visual system plays a critical role in making proper decisions for safe driving. Understanding a driver's visual attention and relevant behavior information is a challenging but essential task in advanced driver-assistance systems (ADAS) and efficient autonomous vehicles (AV). Specifically, robust prediction of a driver's attention from images could be a crucial key to assist intelligent vehicle systems where a self-driving car is required to move safely interacting with the surrounding environment. Thus, in this paper, we investigate a human driver's visual behavior in terms of computer vision to estimate the driver's attention locations in images. First, we show that feature representations at high resolution improves visual attention prediction accuracy and localization performance when being fused with features at low-resolution. To demonstrate this, we employ a deep convolutional neural network framework that learns and extracts feature representations at multiple resolutions. In particular, the network maintains the feature representation with the highest resolution at the original image resolution. Second, attention prediction tends to be biased toward centers of images when neural networks are trained using typical visual attention datasets. To avoid overfitting to the center-biased solution, the network is trained using diverse regions of images. Finally, the experimental results verify that our proposed framework improves the prediction accuracy of a driver's attention locations.

AB Drivers involved in intersection collisions are at high risk of serious or fatal injury. Intersection advanced driver assistance systems (I-ADAS) are emerging active safety systems designed to help drivers safely traverse intersections. The effectiveness of I-ADAS is expected to be greatly dependent on pre-crash vehicle acceleration during intersection traversals. The objective of this paper was to develop pre-crash acceleration models for non-turning drivers involved in straight crossing path crashes and left-turning drivers in left turn across path opposite direction and lateral direction crashes. This paper used 348 event data recorder pre-crash records taken from crashes investigated as part of the National Automotive Sampling System/Crashworthiness Data System. The acceleration models generated from this pre-crash data were evaluated using a leave-one-out cross-validation procedure. Previously developed non-crash models from the literature were compared with the pre-crash models. Our hypothesis was that drivers involved in crashes would accelerate more aggressively than the "typical" driving population. This result suggests that drivers in pre-crash scenarios tend to accelerate more aggressively than drivers in normal scenarios (p<0.001). This has important implications for the design of I-ADAS. Specifically, higher acceleration results in less available time for I-ADAS to detect and respond to an imminent collision.

AB The integration of wireless sensors into the automotive industry is making vehicles increasingly safe and autonomous. At present, vehicles are equipped with external sensors that facilitate maneuverability and braking and internal sensors that detect presence, seat belt state, and occupant vital signs. Early detection of dysfunctional breathing patterns can reduce the risk of accidents caused by drowsiness or fatigue. In this regard, this work presents an MIMO FMCW Radar System able to distinguish dysfunctional breathing patterns from human torso motion. The torso has been divided into six regions, and the amplitude of the elongation and the frequency of motion of each region have been measured during breathing. An elongation map is then constructed in order to graphically show the dysfunctional breathing patterns. The signal processing includes a peak search algorithm to detect elongation amplitude and a bandpass frequency filter to minimize dc components, random driver motion, and vehicle vibration. A torso elongation emulator phantom has been assembled with materials of skin-like relative permittivity and dc motors for calibration and validation of basic breathing patterns. Finally, the signal of the system is compared with that of a commercial respiration belt, and then the system is tested by performing measurements on people. The MIMO radar system is able to measure, differentiate, and classify patterns associated with dysfunctional breathing such as hyperventilation syndrome and thoracic dominant breathing.

AB In recent years, interest in autonomous Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) has increased, especially due to their use in different application areas, together with their ability to operate autonomously. The wide-spread use of UAVs also brings serious security threats. The prevention should be taken for early detec-tion of UAVs-based threats, especially in military areas and governmental buildings, where high-level security is required. In this study, a sound processing algorithm with a new Light-Weight Convolutional Neural Network (LWCNN) model is proposed for the detection of UAVs, by distinguishing them from air noises, animal noises, and vehicle noises in environments with high spatial noise density. The most important advantages of the proposed model are its low complexity and a small number of parameters, as well as its high classification performance. The Mel Frequency Spectrum coefficients are applied to extract the sound features required to distinguish the sounds of UAVs. The features obtained from the proposed LWCNN model are used as input to the Support Vector Machines (SVM), where differ-ent objects are classified. With the proposed method, it is possible to detect UAVs and distinguish them from different sounds such as birds, airplanes, helicopters, background noises, and storms. Experimental results show that the proposed methodology obtains better results than other methods proposed in the literature.(c) 2022 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Small-sized unmanned surface vehicles (USV) are coastal water devices with a broad range of applications such as environmental control and surveillance. A crucial capability for autonomous operation is obstacle detection for timely reaction and collision avoidance, which has been recently explored in the context of camera-based visual scene interpretation. Owing to curated datasets, substantial advances in scene interpretation have been made in a related field of unmanned ground vehicles. However, the current maritime datasets do not adequately capture the complexity of real-world USV scenes and the evaluation protocols are not standardised, which makes cross-paper comparison of different methods difficult and hinders the progress. To address these issues, we introduce a new obstacle detection benchmark MODS, which considers two major perception tasks: maritime object detection and the more general maritime obstacle segmentation. We present a new diverse maritime evaluation dataset containing approximately 81k stereo images synchronized with an on-board IMU, with over 60k objects annotated. We propose a new obstacle segmentation performance evaluation protocol that reflects the detection accuracy in a way meaningful for practical USV navigation. Nineteen recent state-of-the-art object detection and obstacle segmentation methods are evaluated using the proposed protocol, creating a benchmark to facilitate development of the field. The proposed dataset, as well as evaluation routines, are made publicly available at vicos.si/resources.

AB In this brief, we propose a new neuro-fuzzy reinforcement learning-based control (NFRLC) structure that allows autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) to follow a desired trajectory in large-scale complex environments precisely. The accurate tracking control problem is solved by a unique online NFRLC method designed based on actor-critic (AC) structure. Integrating the NFRLC framework including an adaptive multilayer neural network (MNN) and interval type-2 fuzzy neural network (IT2FNN) with a high-gain observer (HGO), a robust smart observer-based system is set up to estimate the velocities of the AUVs, unknown dynamic parameters containing unmodeled dynamics, nonlinearities, uncertainties and external disturbances. By employing a saturation function in the design procedure and transforming the input limitations into input saturation nonlinearities, the risk of the actuator saturation is effectively reduced together with nonlinear input saturation compensation by the NFRLC strategy. A predefined funnel-shaped performance function is designed to attain certain prescribed output performance. Finally, stability study reveals that the entire closed-loop system signals are semi-globally uniformly ultimately bounded (SGUUB) and can provide prescribed convergence rate for the tracking errors so that the tracking errors approach to the origin evolving inside the funnel-shaped performance bound at the prescribed time.

AB In recent years, the role of freight transportation and parcel delivery in urban areas has increased, supporting the economic and social development of cities. At the same time, the industry is affected by various issues, inefficiencies, and externalities, particularly in the last-mile segment. As such, there is an emerging awareness of a need to improve urban mobility and transportation, making them more sustainable and competitive by mixing traditional and emerging technologies, such as cargo bikes, autonomous vehicles, and drones. In contrast, the complexity of the overall system, characterized by multiple actors with conflicting goals, requires a strategy that harmonizes these actors' business and operational models. This study contributes in this direction along three axes. First, it defines the main actors involved in urban parcel delivery, and then analyzes their business models and the interactions between them. Second, it investigates the integration of traditional and green logistics (mainly cycle-logistics), from both business and operational perspectives, in order to identify synergies, conflicts, and the operational and economic consequences of adopting green vehicles. Third, it introduces a simulation-optimization decision support system tool capable of assessing mixed-fleet policies for the management of parcel delivery in urban areas. Finally, the decision support system is tested using real data of the city of Turin.

ID MODEL
AB Lane-change decision-making for vehicles is a challenging task for many reasons, including traffic rules, safety, and the stochastic nature of driving. Because of its success in solving complex problems, deep reinforcement learning (DRL) has been suggested for addressing these issues. However, the studies on DRL to date have gone no further than validation in simulation and failed to address what are arguably the most critical issues, namely, the mismatch between simulation and reality, human-likeness, and safety. This paper introduces a real-world DRL framework for decision-making to design safe and human-like agents that can operate in the real world without extra tuning. We propose a new learning paradigm for DRL integrated with Real2Sim transfer, which comprises training, validation, and testing phases. The approach involves two simulator environments with different levels of fidelity, which are parameterized via real-world data. Within the framework, a large amount of randomized experience is generated with a low-fidelity simulator, whereupon the learned skills are validated regularly in a high-fidelity simulator to avoid overfitting. Finally, in the testing phase, the agent is examined concerning safety and human-like decision-making. Extensive simulation and real-world evaluations show the superiority of the proposed approach. To the best of the authors' knowledge, this is the first application of DRL lane-changing policy in the real world.

AB In comparison to conventional human-driven vehicles (HVs), connected and automated vehicles (CAVs) provide benefits (e.g., reducing travel time and improving safety). However, before the period of fully CAVs appears, there will be a situation in which both HVs and CAVs are present, and the traffic flow pattern may differ from that of a single class (e.g., HV or CAV). In this study, we developed a multi-class traffic assignment problem (TAP) for a transportation network that explicitly considered mixed modes (e.g., HV and CAV). As a link's travel time is dependent on the degree of mixed flows, each mode required an asymmetric interaction cost function. For TAP, the multi-class user equilibrium (UE) model was used for the route choice model. A route-based variational inequality (VI) formulation was used to represent the multi-class TAP and solve it using the gradient projection (GP) algorithm. It has been demonstrated that the GP algorithm is an effective route-based solution for solving the single-class user equilibrium (UE) problem. However, it has rarely been applied to solving asymmetric UE problems. In this study, the single-class GP algorithm was extended to solve the multi-class TAP. The numerical results indicated the model's efficacy in capturing the features of the proposed TAP utilizing a set of simple networks and real transportation networks. Additionally, it demonstrated the computational effectiveness of the GP algorithm in solving the multi-class TAP.

AB Human-leading truck platooning systems have been proposed to leverage the benefits of both human supervision and vehicle autonomy. Equipped with human guidance and autonomous technology, human-leading truck platooning systems are more versatile to handle uncertain traffic conditions than fully automated platooning systems. This paper presents a novel distributed stochastic model predictive control (DSMPC) design for a human-leading heavy-duty truck platoon. The proposed DSMPC design integrates the stochastic driver behavior model of the human-driven leader truck with a distributed formation control design for the following automated trucks in the platoon. The driver behavior of the human-driven leader truck is learned by a stochastic inverse reinforcement learning (SIRL) approach. The proposed stochastic driver behavior model aims to learn a distribution of cost function, which represents the richness and uniqueness of human driver behaviors, with a given set of driver-specific demonstrations. The distributed formation control includes a serial DSMPC with guaranteed recursive feasibility, closed-loop chance constraint satisfaction, and string stability. Simulation studies are conducted to investigate the efficacy of the proposed design under several realistic traffic scenarios. Compared to the baseline platoon control strategy (deterministic distributed model predictive control), the proposed DSMPC achieves superior controller performance in constraint violations and spacing errors.

AB Due to the small size, low cost, and autonomous nature, unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) have attracted growing attention in improving traditional networks' performance. This paper considers a multi-UAV enabled large-scale wireless recharge networks, where a group of UAVs is dispatched as mobile wireless power transfer, and information collection systems to serve a set of ground low-power sensor nodes. Specifically, the UAVs employ radio frequency (RF) wireless power transfer (WPT) to supply energy towards the sensor nodes, and the communication services are available via wireless information transfer (WIT) systems. To achieve balanced energy consumption among UAVs, we maximize the energy utilization efficiency of UAVs, and minimize the communication delay by optimizing the trajectory jointly with constraints of the energy capacity, and the area of the target region. The formulated problem is a mixed-integer programming problem that is a variation of multiple traveling salesman problem. Thus we present a heuristic algorithm that combines the evolutionary algorithm, and variable neighborhood search to achieve the optimal visited sequence of the sensor nodes. Finally, extensive numerical results are provided to evaluate the performance of the proposed algorithm. It draws new insights on the estimation of the feasibility of the given UAVs whose energy capacity is limited.

AB Werner von Siemens with his electrically powered carriage (1882) or the electric cars developed by Ludwig Lohner and Ferdinand Porsche for the world exhibition 1900 in Paris can be considered as two famous examples of successful development on electric vehicles during the 19th century. Independent of such developments, passenger cars with combustion engines dominate the 20th century because of their significant expanded range, the quick refuel process as well as availability and price of the fossil fuels. With a view to the social desirability as well as the political and legal framework, but also the increased price and limitedness of fossil fuels, electric vehicles experience a renaissance as one enabler for future mobility (1). This trend is reinforced by simultaneously staged megatrends like autonomous driving, car sharing, or the topic of "last-kilometre" transportation for goods. As a direct result of this development, the demands for application-specific material concepts also changed and are getting more challenging. Lightweight, passenger safety, but also recyclability and the material-specific CO2-footprint (life cycle engineering) can be highlighted as some major requirements for the mentioned application field of transportation (2, 3). A new generation of ultra-high strength stainless steels can fulfil the high expectation on materials for future mobility by offering a fully austenitic microstructure connected with a specific hardening mechanism and 100 % recyclability.

AB Pedestrians are vulnerable road users that need proactive protection. While both autonomous and connected vehicle technologies aim to deliver greater safety benefits, current designs heavily rely on vehicle-based or on-board sensors and lack strategic real-time interactions with pedestrians who do not have any communication means. As pedestrians are passively protected by the system, they might be put into hazardous situations when vehicle-mounted sensors fail to detect their presence. This paper is part of ongoing research that uses roadside light detection and ranging (LiDAR) sensors to develop a human-in-the-loop system that brings pedestrians into the connected environment. To proactively protect pedestrians, accurate prediction of their intention for crossings at locations, such as unsignalized intersections and street mid-blocks is critical, and this paper presents a modified Naive Bayes approach for this purpose. It features a probabilistic approach to overcoming the common deficiencies in deterministic methods and provides valuable comparisons between feature-based data processing methods, such as artificial neural network (ANN) and model-based Naive Bayes approach. A case study was conducted by using a low-cost 16-line LiDAR sensor installed at the roadside. Pedestrians' crossing intention was predicted at a range of 0.5-3 s before actual crossings. The results satisfactorily demonstrated the properties of the modified Naive Bayes model, as well as its higher flexibility, compared with the ANN approaches in practice.

AB Unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) ad hoc networks can be deployed flexibly and rapidly without any infrastructure, so as to play an irreplaceable role in postdisaster relief. However, the dynamic topology and energy constraints of UAVs always bring new challenges to the design of effective network architectures and routing strategies. In this article, a three-layer UAV network architecture is constructed, and the UAV channel models for the different layers are discussed categorically. A greedy perimeter comprehensive evaluation routing (GCER) algorithm is designed on the basis of geographic routing greedy perimeter stateless routing (GPSR). By estimating the energy, link stability, and data throughput of the UAV neighboring nodes, the optimal next-hop UAV node is synthetically evaluated using the analytic hierarchy process (AHP). In particular, the use of nonorthogonal multiple access (NOMA) technology in ad hoc networks is considered, and a nonconvex optimization problem for maximizing the throughput estimation of UAV relay nodes based on NOMA is proposed to solve for the optimal allocation of UAV transmission power in routing. Numerical results show that the proposed GCER routing algorithm has significant advantages over GPSR in improving link stability. The use of NOMA access technology in UAV ad hoc networks has a significant increase in the throughput of the data links.

AB This paper is centered on the guidance systems used to increase the autonomy of unmanned surface vehicles (USVs). The new Robust Reactive Static Obstacle Avoidance System (RRSOAS) has been specifically designed for USVs. This algorithm is easily applicable, since previous knowledge of the USV mathematical model and its controllers is not needed. Instead, a new estimated closed-loop model (ECLM) is proposed and used to estimate possible future trajectories. Furthermore, the prediction errors (due to the uncertainty present in the ECLM) are taken into account by modeling the USV's shape as a time-varying ellipse. Additionally, in order to decrease the computation time, we propose to use a variable prediction horizon and an exponential resolution to discretize the decision space. As environmental model an occupancy probability grid is used, which is updated with the measurements generated by a LIDAR sensor model. Finally, the new RRSOAS is compared with other SOA (static obstacle avoidance) methods. In addition, a robustness study was carried out over a set of random scenarios. The results obtained through numerical simulations indicate that RRSOAS is robust to unknown and congested scenarios in the presence of disturbances, while offering competitive performance with respect to other SOA methods.

AB Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) have multi-domain applications, fixed-wing UAVs being a widely used class. Despite the ongoing research on the topics of guidance and formation control of fixed-wing UAVs, little progress is known on implementation of semi-physical validation platforms (software-in-the-loop or hardware-in-the-loop) for such complex autonomous systems. A semi-physical simulation platform should capture not only the physical aspects of UAV dynamics, but also the cybernetics aspects such as the autopilot and the communication layers connecting the different components. Such a cyber-physical integration would allow validation of guidance and formation control algorithms in the presence of uncertainties, unmodelled dynamics, low-level control loops, communication protocols and unreliable communication: These aspects are often neglected in the design of guidance and formation control laws for fixed-wing UAVs. This paper describes the development of a semi-physical platform for multi-fixed wing UAVs where all the aforementioned points are carefully integrated. The environment adopts Raspberry Pi's programmed in C++, which can be interfaced to standard autopilots (PX4) as a companion computer. Simulations are done in a distributed setting with a server program designed for the purpose of routing data between nodes, handling the user inputs and configurations of the UAVs. Gazebo-ROS is used as a 3D visualization tool.

AB In this paper, we propose a novel approach of designing the velocity function and the trajectory for a UAV to efficiently achieve location-dependent visual coverage. Specifically, the UAV dynamically adjusts its altitude to photograph terrestrial polygons with different image resolution requirements. Unlike prior work that assumes the UAV speed is constant, the proposed approach allows the UAV to change its speed. To minimize the task completion time, we put forward a novel approach that is composed of three algorithmic components. The first component uses an aggressive method for selecting the UAV photographing altitudes, designs the UAV velocity functions, and derives the UAV flying times for all pairs of regions. Based on the UAV flying times rather than the distances, the second component utilizes an auxiliary traveling salesman problem to determine the visited order of terrestrial regions. For each terrestrial region, the third component generates candidate coverage paths and picks up the coverage path based on the UAV flying time. We also derive analytical results on the UAV trajectory length. Large-scale simulation results indicate that the proposed approach outperforms a two-dimensional trajectory planning algorithm and a greedy algorithm for planning a three-dimensional trajectory in terms of the UAV task completion time.

AB With the development of autonomous vehicles, car sickness may affect increasing numbers of car occupants. Car manufacturers have a real need to understand the causes of these symptoms, which occur mainly when car occupants are not engaged in a driving task. This study is the first to evaluate, in real driving conditions, the impact of lateral acceleration level and vehicle path predictability on car sickness incidence and severity, and the potential relationship with physiological changes. 24 healthy volunteers participated as front seat passengers in a slalom session inducing lateral movements at very low frequency (0.2 Hz). They were continuously monitored via physiological recordings and provided subjective car sickness ratings (CSR) after each slalom, using a 5-point likert scale. CSR reveal that (i) the greater the lateral acceleration and (ii) the less predictable the vehicle path, the more severe the car sickness symptoms in real driving conditions. An increase in several physiological parameters is also found simultaneously with higher CSR, demonstrating activation of the sympathetic nervous system. Moreover, the linear regression applied to our data suggests that these physiological parameters can be used to indicate car sickness severity. Moreover, the linear regression applied to our data suggests that the evolution of these physiological parameters may reflect the CSR level indicated by participants.

AB This paper addresses the problem of cooperative trajectory tracking control problem for multiple unmanned surface vehicles (MUSVs) with event-triggered mechanism and safe distance, proposes a novel event-triggered adaptive sliding mode control strategy via nonlinear tracking differentiators (NTD) and periodic relative threshold event-triggered mechanism (PRTETM). Firstly, the formation autonomous navigation system is constructed by multiple leader-follower cooperative structure to establish via the synchronization scheme that guarantee the safe distance each others. Next, a novel adaptive sliding mode control with the square root form of position error is introduced to prevent the oscillation or divergence of the system caused by the larger position error. Then, a concise adaptive control strategy to compensate for dynamic model uncertainties and external environmental disturbances. Meanwhile, the NTD is used to quickly track the differential signal and achieve filter performance. Besides, to obtain smaller update frequency and less energy consumption, the PRTETM without Zero behavior and input saturation are introduced to facilitate the triggering of control inputs and avoid the actuator physical constraints. Theoretical analysis proves that the proposed cooperative control system is uniformly ultimately bounded. Finally, numerical simulations and comparisons consolidate that the effectiveness of the above control scheme and superior in the fixed threshold scheme.

AB Incorporating deep-learning (DL) classification models into unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) can significantly augment search-and-rescue operations and disaster management efforts. In such critical situations, the UAV's ability to promptly comprehend the crisis and optimally utilize its limited power and processing resources to narrow down search areas is crucial. Therefore, developing an efficient and lightweight method for scene classification is of utmost importance. However, current approaches tend to prioritize accuracy on benchmark datasets at the expense of computational efficiency. To address this shortcoming, we introduce the Wider ATTENTION EfficientNet (WATT-EffNet), a novel method that achieves higher accuracy with a more lightweight architecture compared to the baseline EfficientNet. The WATT-EffNet leverages width-wise incremental feature modules and attention mechanisms over width-wise features to ensure the network structure remains lightweight. We evaluate our method on a UAV-based aerial disaster image classification dataset and demonstrate that it outperforms the baseline by up to 10.6% in terms of classification accuracy and 38.3% in terms of computing efficiency as measured by floating-point operations per second (FLOPS). Additionally, we conduct an ablation study to investigate the effect of varying the width of WATT-EffNet on accuracy and computational efficiency. Our code is available at https://github.com/TanmDL/WATT-EffNet.

AB As the main cause of foreign body intrusion, bird's nests pose a significant potential risk to high-voltage transmission towers. Currently, most research uses convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to detect partial images of towers captured by manually operated unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs). However, these methods have difficulties in learning the locations and potential risk information of bird's nests and generating structured data results. To address these challenges, this article presents a quantitative assessment framework for non-structural bird's nest risk information of transmission towers using high-resolution UAV panoramic images. The integrity of the tower's structure information is maintained by using panoramic UAV images. The proposed method involves estimating the tower's pose and determining whether each key point of the tower has a bird's nest, transforming the non-structural bird's nest locations and risk information into structured data. A risk score is used to classify the level of potential risk caused by bird's nests. The experiments demonstrate that the proposed framework can accurately detect the key points of five types of towers, with an $F1$ -score of 83.09% for bird's nest detection and an accuracy of 91.59% for risk assessment.

AB This paper presents biologically inspired control strategies for an autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) propelled by flapping fins that resemble the paddle-like forelimbs of a sea turtle. Our proposed framework exploits limit cycle oscillators and diffusive couplings, thereby constructing coupled nonlinear oscillators, similar to the central pattern generators (CPGs) in animal spinal cords. This paper first presents rigorous stability analyses and experimental results of CPG-based control methods with and without actuator feedback to the CPG. In these methods, the CPG module generates synchronized oscillation patterns, which are sent to position-servoed flapping fin actuators as a reference input. In order to overcome the limitation of the open-loop CPG that the synchronization is occurring only between the reference signals, this paper introduces a new single-layered CPG method, where the CPG and the physical layers are combined as a single layer, to ensure the synchronization of the physical actuators in the presence of external disturbances. The key idea is to replace nonlinear oscillators in the conventional CPG models with physical actuators that oscillate due to nonlinear state feedback of the actuator states. Using contraction theory, a relatively new nonlinear stability tool, we show that coupled nonlinear oscillators globally synchronize to a specific pattern that can be stereotyped by an outer-loop controller. Results of experimentation with a turtle-like AUV show the feasibility of the proposed control laws.

AB Hydrothermal sulfide deposits that form on the seafloor are often located by the detection of hydrothermal plumes in the water column, followed by exploration with deep-towed cameras, side-scan sonar imaging, and finally by visual surveys using remotely-operated vehicle or occupied submersible. Hydrothermal plume detection, however, is ineffective for finding hydrothermally-inactive sulfide deposits, which may represent a significant amount of the total sulfide accumulation on the seafloor, even in hydrothermally active settings. Here, we present results from recent high-resolution, autonomous underwater vehicle-based mapping of the hydrothermally-active Endeavour Segment of the Juan de Fuca Ridge, in the Northeast Pacific Ocean. Analysis of the ridge bathymetry resulted in the location of 581 individual sulfide deposits along 24 km of ridge length. Hydrothermal deposits were distinguished from volcanic and tectonic features based on the characteristics of their surface morphology, such as shape and slope angles. Volume calculations for each deposit results in a total volume of 372,500 m(3) of hydrothermal sulfide-sulfate-silica material, for an equivalent mass of similar to 1.2 Mt of hydrothermal material on the seafloor within the ridge's axial valley, assuming a density of 3.1 g/cm(3.). Much of this total volume is from previously undocumented inactive deposits outside the main active vent fields. Based on minimum ages of sulfide deposition, the deposits accumulated at a maximum rate of similar to 400 t/yr, with a depositional efficiency (proportion of hydrothermal material that accumulates on the seafloor to the total amount hydrothermally mobilized and transported to the seafloor) of similar to 5%. The calculated sulfide tonnage represents a four-fold increase over previous sulfide estimates for the Endeavour Segment that were based largely on accumulations from within the active fields. These results suggest that recent global seafloor sulfide resource estimates, which were based mostly on the sizes and distribution of hydrothermally-active deposits, may be similarly underestimating the amount of sulfide along the global submarine neovolcanic zones.

AB In this paper, an automated driving system (ADS) data acquisition and analytics platform for vehicle trajectory extraction, reconstruction, and evaluation based on connected automated vehicle (CAV) cooperative perception are presented. This platform presents a holistic pipeline from the raw advanced sensory data collection to data processing, which is capable of processing the sensor data from multi-CAVs and extracting the objects' Identity (ID) number, position, speed, and orientation information in the map and Frenet coordinates. First, the ADS data acquisition and analytics platform are presented. Specifically, the experimental CAVs platform and sensor configuration are shown, and the processing software, including a deep-learning -based object detection algorithm using LiDAR information, a late fusion scheme to leverage cooperative perception to fuse the detected objects from multi-CAVs, and a multi-object tracking method is introduced. To further enhance the object detection and tracking results, high -definition maps consisting of point cloud and vector maps are generated and forwarded to a world model to filter out the objects off the road and extract the objects' coordinates in Frenet coordinates and the lane information. In addition, to refine trajectories from the object tracking algorithms, a post-processing method is proposed. Given the objects' information from the object detection and tracking and the world model, a Kalman filter and Chi-square test method are applied to reduce the noise and remove the outlier in the trajectories. Aiming at tackling the ID switch issue of the object tracking algorithm, a fuzzy-logic-based approach is proposed to detect the discontinuous trajectories belonging to the same object. Then, a vehicle-kinematics-based trajectory prediction method is used, and a forward-backward-smoothing technique is applied to reconstruct the trajectory between the discontinuous trajectories. Finally, results, including object detection and tracking and a late fusion scheme, are presented, and the improvements by the post-processing algorithm in terms of noise level and outlier removal are discussed, which confirm the functionality and effectiveness of the proposed holistic data collection and processing platform. In another aspect, the extracted objects' information and generated HD maps can be used for several purposes in the transportation research community and ADS development community: analyzing the interaction between human-driven vehicles and ADS -equipped vehicles, car-following behavior analysis of ADS-equipped vehicles, traffic flow status analysis and modeling, and scenario generation for ADS testing.

AB Objective: Self-driving technology will bring novelty in occupant seating choices and vehicle interior design. Thus, vehicle safety systems may be challenged to protect occupants over a wider range of potential postures and seating choices. This study aims to investigate the effects of occupant size, seat recline, and knee bolster position on submarining risk and injury prediction metrics for reclined occupants in frontal crashes. Methods: Frontal crash finite element (FE) simulations were performed with the 3 simplified Global Human Body Model Consortium (GHBMC) occupant models: small female, midsize male, and large male. Additionally, a detailed GHBMC midsize male model was used to compare with selected simplified cases. For each simulation, parameters including seatback recline angle (0.9 degrees, 10.9 degrees, 20.9 degrees, 30.9 degrees) and knee bolster position relative to the occupant (baseline, close, far, and no knee bolster) were varied. Impacts were simulated with the U.S. New Car Assessment Program 56 km/h frontal crash pulse. Occupant kinematics data were extracted from each simulation in a full-factorial sensitivity study to investigate how changes in anthropometry, seating position, and knee bolster position would affect submarining across all simulated cases. Results: Overall, increasing the occupant-to-knee bolster distance resulted in more submarining cases. The threshold for submarining was also affected by the seat recline angle. The lowest threshold observed occurred with 10.9 degrees of recline with the small female model. Submarining was observed at recline angles at and above 20.9 degrees for the midsize male model and 30 degrees for the large male model. The initial lap belt position, pelvis orientation, and their relationship were good predictors of submarining. Increased lumbar flexion moment was observed with increased seat recline angle as well as occupant-to-knee bolster distance. The detailed GHBMC model was more prone to submarining than the simplified model. Conclusions: Submarining may be a major challenge to overcome for reclined occupants, which may become more prevalent with autonomous driving systems. This study shows that the angle of recline, anthropometric variation, and position of the knee bolster affect the risk of submarining. To our knowledge, this is the first study to computationally evaluate the occupant protection implications of seatback recline for multiple body sizes, postures, and positions relative to the vehicle interior.

AB In many real-time applications such as autonomous driving and robotics, 3D object detection algorithms represented by PointPillars have great potential to design fast and reliable 3D object detection algorithms by using point cloud columns (Pillars) to represent point clouds. However, this kind of algorithm still has some shortcomings, such as poor detection results for some small objects or distant objects and the existence of wrong detection, missing detection and other problems. In order to solve these problems, we design a three-branch extended convolutional network in the 3D object detection algorithm, which can alleviate the insensitivity of the original network to targets of different sizes, especially small targets. Then, we design an improved hybrid attention mechanism network in 3D object detection algorithm to solve the problem of missing detection and error detection in long-distance vehicle detection. From the experimental verification of KITTI dataset, we draw the following conclusion: Our network has great advantages compared with PointPillars, especially the big improvement in the mAP(mean Average Precision) of vehicle detection and pedestrian and rider detection, in the case that the detection speed is basically equal to PointPillars.

AB A flexible topological representation consisting of a two-layer graph structure built on-board an Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) by continuously filling the free space of an occupancy map with intersecting spheres is proposed in this letter. Most state-of-the-art planning methods find the shortest paths while keeping the UAV at a pre-defined distance from obstacles. Planning over the proposed structure reaches this pre-defined distance only when necessary, maintaining a safer distance otherwise, while also being orders of magnitude faster than other state-of-the-art methods. Furthermore, we demonstrate how this graph representation can be converted into a lightweight shareable topological-volumetric map of the environment, which enables decentralized multi-robot cooperation. The proposed approach was successfully validated in several kilometers of real subterranean environments, such as caves, devastated industrial buildings, and in the harsh and complex setting of the final event of the DARPA SubT Challenge, which aims to mimic the conditions of real search and rescue missions as closely as possible, and where our approach achieved the 2nd place in the virtual track.

AB This letter proposes a robust secure and energy efficient beamforming (BF) scheme for a millimeter-wave unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) communication system with imperfect angle-of-departure (AoD) estimation of air-to-ground channel caused by jittering. Specifically, an optimization problem is formulated to maximize the worst-case secrecy energy efficiency (SEE), defined as the ratio of the sum achievable secrecy rate (ASR) to the total power consumption, subject to the UAV transmit power constraint. Due to the difficulty in solving this problem arisen from the AoD uncertainties and the non-convex structures of SEE and ASR, we first adopt the discretization method to simplify AoD uncertainties to a deterministic form and then exploit the successive convex approximation approach with auxiliary variables to convert the original problem into a convex one. Finally, an iterative algorithm is designed to obtain the suboptimal solution. Numerical results are provided to confirm the effectiveness and superiority of the proposed robust BF scheme compared to some benchmark schemes.

AB This paper focuses on recent innovations in the methods used for external remote subsea pipeline inspection. An unmanned method is revealed, in which an Autonomous Underwater Vehicle (AUV), paired with an Unmanned Surface Vessel (USV) was utilised to complete inspections. Results are presented from a recent project, in which existing hardware and software were integrated and combined with automated workflows to form a solution, involving an AUV operated from a USV, with operations remotely controlled from shore. As inspection data was acquired, self-actuating workflows ran onboard the AUV, enabling data processing tasks to commence and QC messages/alerts to be transmitted to the control centre, this allowed execution of in-water mission adjustments. The primary focus of this paper is on the development and implementation of an automated, fully unmanned system for subsea inspection operations. Initially, a brief review is presented of recent developments in this field. Links are drawn between these wider developments and progress made within the project, and areas are highlighted where further work is required for realisation of a comprehensive unmanned pipeline inspection solution.

AB Unmanned Autonomous Vehicles (UAV), while not a recent invention, have recently acquired a prominent position in many industries, and they are increasingly used not only by avid customers, but also in high-demand technical use-cases, and will have a significant societal effect in the coming years. However, the use of UAVs is fraught with significant safety threats, such as collisions with dynamic obstacles (other UAVs, birds, or randomly thrown objects). This research focuses on a safety problem that is often overlooked due to a lack of technology and solutions to address it: collisions with non-stationary objects. A novel approach is described that employs deep learning techniques to solve the computationally intensive problem of real-time collision avoidance with dynamic objects using off-the-shelf commercial vision sensors. The suggested approach's viability was corroborated by multiple experiments, firstly in simulation, and afterward in a concrete real-world case, that consists of dodging a thrown ball. A novel video dataset was created and made available for this purpose, and transfer learning was also tested, with positive results.

TI Understanding the Impact of the PC5 Resource Grid Design on the Capacity
   and Efficiency of LTE-V2X in Vehicular Networks
SO WIRELESS COMMUNICATIONS & MOBILE COMPUTING
LA English
DT Article
AB Vehicular communications will foster mobility services and enable mass adoption of future autonomous vehicles, interchanging huge amount of data acquired from vehicles' sensors. 3GPP Release 14 presents the first standard for supporting V2X in LTE. Several enhancements are introduced, including a new arrangement of the physical resource grid, where subchannels are the minimum resource unit instead of Resource Blocks. The resource grid is defined by several design parameters, some of them with constraints imposed by 3GPP specifications, that affect the maximum message transmission rate and efficiency of the system. Moreover, the optimum choice of these parameters is closely linked to message length, which is another variable parameter. This paper provides an analysis of the relationship between these design parameters (Resource Block per Subchannel, Transport Block Size Index, and coding rate), message size, and the system's maximum capacity and efficiency. In doing so, we do not consider channel reuse or radio transmission characteristics because the focus of this paper is trying to find the resource grid design parameters that optimize system capacity, which is a very important aspect to consider by V2X operators.

ID PIPELINES
AB Despite the increases in freight transportation demand, options for increasing capacity of the overground freight transportation infrastructure system are limited. This paper investigated the design and operation of an underground freight transportation (UFT) system that uses space below highways. Underground freight transportation is a class of automated transportation system in which individual vehicles carry freight through tunnels and pipelines between intermodal terminals. This paper presents attributes for schematic designs and operations for two UFT scenarios: a long-haul system which transports standard shipping containers between the Port of Houston and a terminal near Dallas, and a short-haul system which carries pallet-size freight between the Port of Houston and a satellite terminal near Houston. The appropriate design details were determined by the size of the freight, the types of vehicles and tunnels, and the propulsion system. In addition, operational attributes such as operating speed, headway, line capacity, and associated fleet sizes were addressed. Design sketches and operational equations presented in this paper are generally independent of the freight sizes and route lengths and this case study can be used as guidance for the design and operation of other freight tunnels and pipelines.

AB In this paper, a novel compact, lightweight and high gain array antennae system is demonstrated which is based on substrate integrated dielectric filled waveguide concepts. It is a planar design which can be easily fabricated with a common two-layer substrate. The overall goal was to have a high gain so that this array antenna could be potentially used in autonomous unmanned aerial vehicle systems for collision avoidance. An initial model was designed, simulated and fabricated and, upon evaluation, was further modified to achieve a higher performance specification. Additionally, the design can be easily and inexpensively fabricated using standard substrates with a rapid prototyping platform. A two element array resulted in a simulated gain of 9.6 dB with a radiation pattern which had a maximum lobe between a broadside and an end-fire. This was with a low loss substrate such as Rogers RT duroid 5880. For the design, a low dissipation factor material is preferable as it minimizes losses and also increases compactness of the entire antenna array.

AB Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to provide an overview of the recent research on the interaction between flight mechanics and sensory/control systems in flies. It furthermore, explores the application to biomimetic micro-air vehicles (MAVs).
   Design/methodology/approach - A review of recent literature on flight in flies is given first, whereafter two biomimetic case studies are discussed; the optic flow sensor developed by a French team and the micro-mechanical flying insect project at the University of Berkeley.
   Findings - The paper discusses the many areas where biological knowledge on flight in flies can be used by designers of MAVs.
   Practical implications - Fully autonomous MAVs, inspired by insect flight, could be useful in a wide range of areas including search-and-rescue, surveillance and for military purposes.
   Originality/value - The paper gives an up to date overview of dipteran flight behaviour and points to ways in which this knowledge can be applied to MAVs. The paper should thus be useful for biologists wishing to collaborate with engineers as well as for engineers and sensor designers seeking inspiration from nature.

AB One of the key challenges in application of Autonomous Ground Vehicles (AGVs) is navigation in environments that are densely cluttered with obstacles. The control task becomes more complex when the configuration of obstacles is not known a priori. The most popular control methods for such systems are based on reactive local navigation schemes that tightly couple the robot actions to the sensor information. Because of the environmental uncertainties, fuzzy behavior systems have been proposed. The most difficult problem in applying fuzzy-reactive-behavior-based navigation control systems is that of arbitrating or fusing the reactions of the individual behaviors, which is addressed here by the use of preference logic. This paper presents the design of a preference-based fuzzy behavior system for navigation control of robotic vehicles using the multivalued logic framework. As shown in simulation and experimental results, the proposed method allows the robot to smoothly and effectively navigate through cluttered environments such as dense forests. Experimental comparisons with the vector field histogram method (VFH) show that the proposed method usually produces smoother albeit longer paths to the goal. Published by Elsevier B.V.

ID NETWORK; PROPOSAL
AB Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) have been widely used in various fields. As one of the key technologies in improving the autonomous sensing ability of UAV optical sensors, object detection has become a research focus in recent years. Since UAVs usually navigate at different vertical heights, the object scales and sensor field of view change violently, which brings a great difficulty to the optimization of the model. Moreover, when a UAV is flying at low level rapidly, it may cause the motion blur phenomenon on objects that are highly dense in position, leading to great challenge for distinction of these objects. To address the extremely tough problems discussed above, we propose an accurate and efficient object detection algorithm, namely, VAMYOLOX. Based on YOLOX, we first redesigned the classification and regression loss function of the model to better conduct classification and localization under complex motion blur and dense scenes. Then, we increase another prediction head to detect lots of tiny objects to ultimately improve the detection ability of the model for multiscale objects. Finally, we redesigned the neck of the network by introducing the triplet attention module (TAM) to find attention regions in scenes with dense objects and in images that cover a large area, accordingly enhancing the features extracted by the backbone network. Extensive experiments on the VisDrone dataset widely used in the research of UAV image object detection show that VAMYOLOX has achieved the state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance with good interpretability in UAV optical sensors captured scenes. On the VisDrone-DET-test-dev subset, the average precision (AP) of VAMYOLOX is 25.31%, outperforming the previous SOTA model (CornerNet) by 1.88%. On the VisDrone-DET-val subset, the AP of our method is 29.4%, achieving a highly competitive result with previous SOTA method (AMRNet). Not only that, VAMYOLOX achieves a maximum improvement of 2.72% compared to the AP of the baseline model (YOLOX). In addition, compared with other methods, our method has a significant advantage in speed and can meet the needs of different scenarios. The PyTorch code and trained models are available at https://github.com/yangyahu-1994/VAMYOLOX.

ID MINIMIZE
AB Pulse and glide (PnG) is a driving strategy that controls vehicles in a more fuel-efficient way than driving at a constant speed does. It can be applied by the driver or, which is more likely, by an automated system with autonomy level one or higher. During the pulse phase, the vehicle is accelerated to operate the combustion engine and transmission at higher efficiency. During the following glide phase, the vehicle decelerates and the engine is decoupled from the drive train. The optimal pulse and glide strategy - as addressed in previous studies - implies high acceleration values and abrupt transitions between pulse and glide, which both degrade the ride comfort. A driveability study on PnG conducted recently identified that the acceleration, the jerk during the transitions and the duration of the glide phase have to be limited to reach the desired level of ride comfort. Thresholds have been derived for a level-eight calibration, i.e. a PnG operation that is noticeable only to skeptical customers. We use the results of the study to also provide thresholds for a level-seven calibration, i.e. a PnG operation that is noticeable to all customers without being disturbing. Subsequently, we establish a correlation between ride comfort and fuel consumption by comparing the fuel savings of three different driveability calibrations: level eight, level seven and a calibration without driveability constraints. The simulations are performed for a D-segment vehicle and two different gasoline engines. With reference to constant speed, the fuel savings of the level-seven calibration are larger than 30% below 40 km/h, decreasing gradually with increasing speed. They are around ten percent higher than those of the level-eight calibration and only a few percent lower than those of a PnG operation without driveability constraints. Hence, the level-seven calibration can nearly exploit the maximal fuel-saving potential of PnG, and, as it is not disturbing, should be considered for practical applications of PnG. The PnG strategy can be applied to any vehicle equipped with a combustion engine that features the engine-off functionality, which is the case for mild and full hybrids and for some micro hybrids. However, considering that the benefit of PnG increases with increasing engine size, the fuel saving potential of PnG is highest for micro and mild hybrids as these vehicles are commonly equipped with larger engines than full hybrids.

AB Vehicle automation may improve road safety because most crashes are caused by human error. However, reliable autonomous vehicles in which the 'driver' never has to take over the wheel are still in the distant future. At first, cars will only drive themselves under certain conditions. When these conditions are not met the car will prompt the driver with a take-over request (TOR).
   In this study, a simulator was used to investigate whether drivers could spot latent hazards in the road and traffic scene immediately after manual driving had become obligatory (that is, after a TOR). A latent hazard is a traffic situation in which precursors of a hazard are visible. The number of latent hazards spotted was assumed to be an indicator of the driver's situation awareness. Latent hazards may or may not materialize into acute threatening situations in which a crash is very likely. The simulator drive contained eight latent hazards (that did not materialize). The default mode was automated driving; however, when participants approached a latent hazard a TOR was prompted. Fifty participants were randomly assigned to one of two groups: in the 4 s group the TOR was prompted four seconds before participants had to resume manual driving, and in the 6 S group the time allowed was six seconds. All participants played a computer game on a tablet while the simulator car was in automated mode. Their gaze directions were recorded with an eye tracker during the entire trip of approximately 45 min.
   On average, participants in the 4 s group gazed at 29% (SD = 16.5) of the latent hazards, and participants in the 6 s group gazed at 47% (SD = 17.8). A generalized linear model for binomial data revealed that this difference was significant (chi(2) (1, N = 43) = 11.23, p < .01).
   This result indicates that drivers need time to develop situation awareness when they have to resume driving. It could be that, after having been out of the loop, drivers have to construct a mental representation of the traffic situation before they can recognize latent hazards. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

AB Objective This study aims to evaluate a car passenger's experience and actions in a rotated seat in terms of interaction with an adjacent passenger. Methods A static user study was conducted, using a stationary test vehicle with two front row seats facing rearwards. The seats were mounted on a swivel plate which allowed inboard rotation. Thirty-two participants in 16 test pairs were grouped based on stature; short or tall. The participants within each pair knew each other. Three seating configurations were evaluated; 0 degrees and 10 degrees and 20 degrees inboard rotated position of both seats. The participants were seated in each seating configuration for 10 min; 5 min they engaged in a conversation with each other and 5 min they were watching media on an Ipad mounted in front of them. Subjective data from each participant on their experiences and preferences were collected through questionnaires, and objective data on sitting postures and eye gaze were collected through video recording. Results Ninety-two percent of the short participants preferred to sit in the 20 degrees rotated seating configuration when watching media and 75% preferred the 20 degrees seating configuration when engaged in conversation. Compared to short participants, the tall participants showed a relative larger spread in seating configuration preference; 15% and 30% of them preferred the reference position for media and conversation, respectively. Leg interference was common for tall participants when 20 degrees inboard rotated. They perceived it uncomfortable and used various strategies to avoid contact, including crossing legs or feet. Time spent with mutual eye contact did not vary by seating configuration. Conclusions This static user study shows that rotated seats could be a desired seating configuration in future autonomous vehicles for individuals who know each other. It reveals the reasons behind the preferences and the extent of desired seat rotation, showing differences between tall and short individuals. By understanding how occupant position and posture can be influenced by offering various seating configurations, the occupant can choose a comfortable position that is also safe. The leg and feet positions are raised as the body region with most variations and for which an increased understanding of influence in a crash is encouraged.

AB This paper develops an analytic system to investigate the effects of AV availability on multiple dimensions of activity-travel behavior at once, based on a direct survey-based modeling approach. In particular, the model uses individual socio-demographics, built environment variables, as well as psycho-social variables (in the form of latent psychological constructs) as determinant variables to explain likely AV impacts on five dimensions of short-term activitytravel choices: (1) Additional local area trips (that is, those that would not characterized as long distance trips; a long distance trip was defined in the survey as a trip more than 75 miles oneway), (2) Trip distance to shop or eat-out activities in the local area, (3) Trip distance to leisure activities in the local area, (4) Additional long distance road trips beyond the local area, and (5) Commute travel time. The model system includes a confirmatory factor analysis step, a multivariate linear regression model for the latent constructs, and a multivariate orderedresponse model for the five main outcomes just listed. Data from a 2019 Austin area survey of new mobility service adoption and use forms the basis for our empirical analysis. Our results, when aggregated across all respondents, does suggest that AVs may not after all have a substantial impact on overall trip-making levels, although local area trips are likely to become longer (for all purposes, including the commute). The highest impact of AVs will, it appears, be on the number of long distance trips (with such trips increasing). Our in-depth examination of the variations in AV activity-travel responses across population segments and geographies underscores the importance of modeling multiple activity-travel dimensions all at once. In addition, our results highlight the value of using psycho-social latent constructs in studies related to the adoption/use of current and emerging mobility services, both in terms of improved prediction fit as well as proactive strategies to design equitable, safe, and community-driven AV systems. There is likely to be considerable heterogeneity in how different population groups view and respond to AVs, and it is imperative that AV campaigns and AV design consider such heterogeneity so as to not "leave anyone behind".

AB This letter investigates the secrecy energy efficiency (SEE) fairness of unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)-enabled multi-user communication systems where a UAV disseminates data to multiple ground users (GUs) in the presence of an eavesdropper (EVE). Taking into account the security threats from EVE, the limited on-board energy of UAV and the fairness among GUs, we formulate a user-oriented SEE maximization problem to maximize the minimum GU's SEE by jointly optimizing the UAV trajectory and resource allocation subject to the UAV motion constraints and resource budgets. Due to the difficulty in solving this problem that arises from the fractional structure of SEE and the coupling characteristic of optimization variables, we first exploit the successive convex approximation to transform the original problem to a convex one, which is further converted into a second order cone program to reduce the computational complexity. Then, a convergent iterative algorithm is designed to find the suboptimal solution. Simulation results show that the proposed scheme significantly improves SEE fairness of GUs as compared to some benchmark schemes.

AB Due to their fast deployment and high flexibility, unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) are regarded as vital enablers of various applications that include emergency rescue, telecommunications, delivery of supplies, and more. In order to connect UAVs to a core network anywhere, satellite communications is expected to provide wider backhaul coverage compared to ground wireless communications. Although UAV Communications has been studied in many technical works, high-mobility satellite-UAV communications has not been investigated well. Specifically, physical layer operations of the high-mobility satellite-UAV communication system are affected the most by high-mobility environments. In this article, we focus on the physical layer operation problem in satellite-UAV communications from three perspectives: time-varying channel estimation, the high-mobility transceiver, and high-mobility multiple access. Related key technologies, existing works, open problems, and the next development direction are introduced and surveyed. Furthermore, our proposed scheme is also discussed. Overall, this article aims to help readers understand challenges, solutions, and future research trends regarding physical layer operation issues on high-mobility satellite-UAV aerial communications.

AB In the background of air combat, the situation between multiple unmanned aerial vehicle (multi-UAV) and objectives has a certain impact on the task assignment. In order to improve the efficiency of assignment and obtain the best assignment scheme during the process of performing tasks, this paper proposes a method to evaluate the situation at a certain time. This method is the basis for establishing a multi-UAV objective assignment model. For solving the model, this paper presents the Hungarian fusion Genetic Algorithm. It first uses the feasible solutions solved by the Hungarian algorithm as the elite individuals in the initial population of the genetic algorithm, and then uses the objective function in the assignment model as the fitness function to optimize the results. The algorithm solves the problem that the assignment result of the Hungarian algorithm is not unique, and optimizes the drawback that the traditional Genetic Algorithm is prone to fall into local optimum. The simulation verified the effectiveness of the situational assessment method and the improved algorithm.

AB Autonomous vehicles, such as drones, are gaining great popularity due to their usability and versatility. Nowadays, a significant number of them operate using open source software, such as Robot Operating System (ROS) and the de facto standard MAVLink communication protocol, as they are free and many of them are reusable enough that they can be deployed in various different vehicles. Although these technologies offer a wide variety of resources, using them requires a reasonable background of programming and system engineering. Often, this is not achievable by common drone end-users in the short-term, as they would need to acquire a considerably large amount of know-how before working on specific domains. However, a graphical Domain Specific Modelling Language (DSML) might provide a shortcut to design drone missions using already known concepts to the end-users (or, at least, ones easier to learn). Pursuing this shortcut, RoBMEX is presented as a top-down methodology based on a set of domain specific languages able to enhance the autonomy of ROSbased systems, by allowing the creation of missions graphically, and then generating automatically executable source codes conforming to the designed missions.

ID AUTONOMY
AB Trajectory tracking control based on waypoint behavior is a promising way for unmanned surface vehicle (USV) to achieve autonomous navigation. This study is aimed at the guidance progress in the kinematics; the artificial intelligence method of deep learning is adopted to improve the trajectory tracking level of USV. First, two deep neural network (DNN) models are constructed to evaluate navigation effects and to estimate guidance law parameters in real time, respectively. We then pretrain the DNN using a Gaussian-Bernoulli restricted Boltzmann machine to further improve the accuracy of predicting navigation effect. Finally, two DNNs are connected in parallel with the control loop of USV to provide predictive supervision and auxiliary decision making for traditional control methods. This kind of parallel way conforms to the ship manipulation of habit. Furthermore, we develop a new application on the basis of Mission Oriented Operating Suite Interval Programming named "pDeepLearning." It can predict the navigation effect online by DNN and adjust the guidance law parameters according to the effect level. The experimental results show that, compared with the original waypoint behavior of USV, the prediction model proposed in this study reduces the trajectory tracking error by 19.0% and increases the waypoint behavior effect level.

AB The representation, visualization, and modeling of traffic data is at the heart of intelligent transportation systems. Different types of traffic data exist, and novel ways of their accurate representation and modeling, which are useful for further analyses, simulations, and optimizations, are sought. In this work, location-specific traffic flows are represented by finite mixtures of circular normal (von Mises) statistical distributions. The parameters of the distributions are learned from empirical data by two variants of the expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm and by a nature-inspired method, differential evolution (DE). A proposed statistical model and a fitting strategy are evaluated on real-world data sets describing traffic flows in New York City. The experimental results show that the EM algorithm is able to find model parameters that correspond to input data and that are better than their analytic estimates, while DE evolves even more accurate models. The models based on circular distributions can be represented by circular plots as a novel type of visually appealing and easily interpretable fingerprints of the underlying traffic flow patterns.

AB This paper investigates the principles of a Cooperative Localization Algorithm for a team of at least three Autonomous Underwater Vehicles (AUVs) with respect to a surface support ship, without the use of Ultra-Short Baseline (USBL). It is assumed that each AUV is equipped with a low-cost Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU), a compass and a depth sensor, but only one of them has a high accuracy navigation sensor such as the Doppler Velocity Log (DVL). The surface boat locates itself by means of Global Positioning System (GPS). Range measurements provided by acoustic modems allow to avoid an unbounded error growth in the position estimate of each AUV. A geometric method, based on a tetrahedral configuration to obtain a deterministic fix for position, is proposed. This method allows to extend the advantages of the use of the DVL to the position estimate of other vehicles not equipped with DVL. The paper addresses also some of the problems related to the limitations of acoustic communication. The algorithm has been implemented and tested in simulations for a fleet of three AUVs and a surface support ship. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI Ascent guidance comparisons

DT Article
AB This paper contains results from ascent guidance studies conducted at the NASA Marshall Space Flight Center. The studies include investigation of different guidance schemes for a variety of potential launch vehicles. Criteria of a successful ascent guidance scheme are low operations cost, satisfaction of load indicator constraints, and maximization of performance. Results show that open-loop designs as a function of altitude or velocity are preferable to designs that are functions of time. Optimized open-loop trajectories can increase performance while maintaining load indicators within limits. Closed-loop atmospheric schemes that involve linear tangent steering or feedback of velocity terms for trajectory modification did not yield any improvement. Early release of vacuum closed-loop guidance, including use during solid rocket booster operation, yields some improvements. Evaluation of a closed-loop optimization scheme for flying through the atmosphere shows no advantages over open-loop optimization. Dispersion study results for several potential guidance schemes and launch vehicles are included in the paper and are not a discriminator between guidance schemes. The primary cost driver is mission operations philosophy, not choice of guidance scheme. More autonomous guidance schemes can help in movement towards a philosophy that would reduce operations costs.

AB This article presents an energy-efficient method of controlling unmanned aircraft (fixed-wing UAVs), which consists of three groups of algorithms: aerial vehicle route planning, in-flight control, and algorithms to correct the preplanned flight trajectory. All algorithms shall take into account the existence of obstacles that the UAV must avoid and wind gusts in the UAV's area of operation. Tests were carried out on the basis of the UAV mathematical model, stabilization and navigation algorithms, and Dryden turbulence model, considering the parameters of the UAV's propulsion system. The work includes a detailed description of constructing a network of connection that is used to plan a UAV mission. It presents the algorithm for determining the actual distances between the different points in the field of action, which takes into account the existence of obstacles. The algorithm shall be based on methods for determining the flight trajectory on a hexagonal grid. It presents the developed proprietary UAV path planning algorithm based on a model from a group of algorithms of mixed integer linear problem (MILP) optimization. It presents the manner in which the pre-prepared flight path was used by UAV controllers that supervised the flight along the preset path. It details the architecture of contemporary unmanned aerial vehicles, which have embedded capability to realize autonomous missions, which require the integration of UAV systems into the route planning algorithms set out in the article. Particular attention has been paid to the planning and implementation methods of UAV missions under conditions where wind gusts are present, which support the determination of UAV flight routes to minimize the vehicle's energy consumption. The models developed were tested within a computer architecture based on ARM processors using the hardware-in-the-loop (HIL) technique, which is commonly used to control unmanned vehicles. The presented solution makes use of two computers: FCC (flight control computer) based on a real-time operating system (RTOS) and MC (mission computer) based on Linux and integrated with the Robot Operating System (ROS). A new contribution of this work is the integration of planning and monitoring methods for the implementation of missions aimed at minimizing energy consumption of the vehicle, taking into account wind conditions.

AB Emerging vehicular systems with increasing proportions of automated components present opportunities for optimal control to mitigate congestion and increase efficiency. There has been a recent interest in applying deep reinforcement learning (DRL) to these nonlinear dynamical systems for the automatic design of effective control strategies. Despite conceptual advantages of DRL being model-free, studies typically nonetheless rely on training setups that are painstakingly specialized to specific vehicular systems. This is a key challenge to efficient analysis of diverse vehicular and mobility systems. To this end, this article contributes a streamlined methodology for vehicular microsimulation and discovers high performance control strategies with minimal manual design. A variable-agent, multi-task approach is presented for optimization of vehicular Partially Observed Markov Decision Processes. The methodology is experimentally validated on mixed autonomy traffic systems, where fractions of vehicles are automated; empirical improvement, typically 15-60% over a human driving baseline, is observed in all configurations of six diverse open or closed traffic systems. The study reveals numerous emergent behaviors resembling wave mitigation, traffic signaling, and ramp metering. Finally, the emergent behaviors are analyzed to produce interpretable control strategies, which are validated against the learned control strategies.
   As vehicular systems such as real-world traffic systems and robotic warehouses become increasingly automated, optimizing vehicle movements sees an increasing potential to reduce congestion and increase efficiency. For many vehicular systems, simulations of varying fidelity are commonly used for analysis and optimization without the need to deploy real vehicles. This article describes a unified and practical approach for optimal control of vehicles in arbitrary simulated vehicular systems while permitting partial automation, where the behavior of fractions of vehicles at given times can be modelled but not controlled. As illustrated by the diverse traffic systems considered in this article, the presented methodology emphasizes ease of application within any simulated vehicular system while minimizing manual efforts by the practitioner. The control inputs consist of local information around each automated vehicle, while the control outputs are commands for longitudinal acceleration and lateral lane change. Experimental results are presented for relatively small simulated traffic systems, though the methodology can be adapted to larger vehicular systems with minor modifications. Experimentally optimized behaviors provide insights to the practitioner which may assist in designing simplified and interpretable control strategies. Implementation in real-world systems depends on two requirements: 1) a reliable fallback mechanism for ensuring safety of vehicles, and 2) sufficient fidelity of the simulator for simulated behaviors to transfer. These requirements are under active research for traffic systems and may be practical in some robotic settings. To facilitate robust transfer of policies from simulated to real-world systems, future extensions of this work may inject additional randomization into simulation while reducing the unmodeled stochasticity of targeted real-world systems as much as possible.

AB When acting as dynamic receivers, unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) have several advantages over the conventional static base stations for received signal strength (RSS) based target searching. It is highly likely that the RSS is becoming stronger as the UAV is moving towards the estimated coordinate, and this leads to a higher estimation precision for each localization update. On the other hand, despite its low cost, low energy consumption and simple hardware requirement, RSS can be severely influenced by land layouts, therefore the assumption of a simple free space propagation model may lead to poor estimation precision and even failure, especially for an area where the topography is highly complex. In this paper, we propose multi-UAV target searching with the assistance of radio maps, which contain abundant information of the topography influence on RSS. We generate radio maps from real topographic data, and derive the minimum mean square error estimator for multi-UAV target searching with the radio map knowledge for memoryless observations. Simulations for areas with complex topography, show that the localization precision and searching efficiency can be considerably improved with the assistance of radio maps.

TI An object detection algorithm combining self-attention and YOLOv4 in

SO PLOS ONE
LA English
DT Article
AB Automobile intelligence is the trend for modern automobiles, of which environment perception is the key technology of intelligent automobile research. For autonomous vehicles, the detection of object information, such as vehicles and pedestrians in traffic scenes is crucial to improving driving safety. However, in the actual traffic scene, there are many special conditions such as object occlusion, small objects, and bad weather, which will affect the accuracy of object detection. In this research, the SwinT-YOLOv4 algorithm is proposed for detecting objects in traffic scenes, which is based on the YOLOv4 algorithm. Compared with a Convolutional neural network (CNN), the vision transformer is more powerful at extracting vision features of objects in the image. The CNN-based backbone in YOLOv4 is replaced by the Swin Transformer in the proposed algorithm. The feature-fusing neck and predicting head of YOLOv4 is remained. The proposed model was trained and evaluated in the COCO dataset. Experiments show that our method can significantly improve the accuracy of object detection under special conditions. Equipped with our method, the object detection precision for cars and person is improved by 1.75%, and the detection precision for car and person reach 89.04% and 94.16%, respectively.

AB Lane detection is a useful technique in modern autonomous vehicles systems, which assists vehicle to accurately localize itself according to detected road lines. Traditional methods leveraged edge detection and Hough transform based algorithms to plot lines along the detected lane. Noticeably, they did not take the informative feature road gradient into account. In addition, most previous deep learning-based algorithms consider lane detection as pixel-wise lane segmentation, where only fixed number of lanes can be detected. In order to solve these limitations, we propose a quality guided lane detection algorithm by modeling the sophisticated traffic context, where variable number of lanes can be satisfactorily handled. Specifically, we first leverage chessboard images for camera calibration to calculate correspondence between real world and image coordinate system. Subsequently, we capture image regions of interest that only contains lane information by leveraging the prior knowledge and image quality scores. Afterwards, we design an end-to-end two-stage CNN architecture for lane detection, where binary lane mask is utilized for lane matching. Comprehensive experiments have demonstrated that our proposed method can cope with variable number of lanes effectively.

AB In this paper, a new method for real-time detection, motion estimation, and tracking of generic obstacles using just a 3-D point cloud and odometry information as input is presented. In this approach, a simplification of the world is done using voxels, supported by a particle filter-based 3-D object segmentation and a motion estimation scheme. That combination of techniques leverages a fast and reliable object detection, providing also motion speed and direction information. Four detailed studies have been performed in order to assess the suitability of the method, two of them related to the parameterization of the method and its input point cloud. Another one compares the tracking and detection results with other state-of-the-art methods. Last tests are intended for the characterization of the execution times required. Results are encouraging, with a high detection rate, low error rate, and real-time capable computing performance. In the attached video, it is possible to observe the behavior of the method, both using a stereovision and a light-detection and ranging generated point clouds as an input.

AB In order to enhance the capability of autonomous operation for small unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV), a MEMS-based inertial navigation system (INS)/global navigation satellite system (GNSS) integrated navigation method is proposed. An augmented Cubature Kalman filter is derived to fulfil the data fusion of precise GNSS real-time kinematic (RTK) solution and noisy inertial measurements. In the filter, Cubature Kalman filtering is adopted to handle the strong INS model nonlinearity caused by sudden and large UAV maneuvers, and the technique of state-augmentation is used to capture meaningful odd-order moment information and reduce the adverse impacts of non-additive noise in inertial measurements. It is analyzed that the basic difference between the augmented and non-augmented CKFs generally favors the augmented CKF, which is supported by a representative example and flight test. The results of flight test have also shown that the proposed augmented Cubature Kalman filtering method can complete more accurate navigation compared with the conventional EKF/UKF-based approaches.

TI Safe Autorotation through Wind Shear via Backward Reachable Sets
SO JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN HELICOPTER SOCIETY
LA English
DT Article
AB This paper addresses the problem of safe flare to landing during autorotation, focusing on computing the region in the vehicle's state space from which a safe, feasible path to landing is guaranteed to exist. It (a) presents a method to compute safe, feasible trajectories for autorotation landing through wind shear and (b) uses this method to determine the set of conditions (distance to touchdown point, height above touchdown point, horizontal speed, descent rate, and rotor speed) from which a path to safe landing is guaranteed to exist. This set of safe initial states (denoted the safe landing set) is the backward reachable set from safe on ground to a steady-state autorotation condition. This safe set can be used by autonomous rotorcraft as a target condition for the steady-state phase of autorotation; it can be used in manned rotorcraft as a cue to begin flare. Safe landing sets are computed for two rotorcraft: the Bell OH-58A and a small electric-powered helicopter. The effect of wind and wind shear on the safe set is assessed for both vehicles. Finally, the feasibility of using global positioning system waypoint following control for autorotation landing is examined in simulation for the electric powered helicopter.

ID HYBRID
AB Cognitive architectures, computer programs that define mechanisms that are important for domain-independent intelligent behavior, have the potential for generating intelligent and autonomous behavior in unmanned vehicles. The cognitive robotic system has demonstrated how the Soar cognitive architecture can be integrated with common robotic motor and perceptual systems that complement the strengths of Soar for unmanned vehicle control. The cognitive robotic system has been tested using an indoor search mission, during which the cognitive robotic system searches a building for common intersection types and an object of interest using information from robotic mapping, computer vision, and fuzzy logic algorithms. The Soar agent builds a topological map of the environment, using information about the intersections the cognitive robotic system detects, and it uses this topological model to make intelligent decisions about how to effectively search the building. Once the object of interest has been detected, the Soar agent uses the topological map to make decisions about how to efficiently return to the location where the mission started as well as to generate step-by-step directions using the intersections in the environment as landmarks that describe a direct path from the mission's start location to the object of interest.

ID INJURIES
AB Background: Political violence has not been examined as a risk factor for traumatic injuries from road traffic crashes.
   Objective: To identify trends in road traffic crashes related to war-related military activity and international economic sanctions in the Autonomous Province of Vojvodina, Serbia.
   Methods: Overall road traffic crashes and crashes leading to hospitalization and fatality in Vojvodina, Serbia were examined from 1996 through 2005. Rates were calculated per 100 000 population and per 10 000 registered vehicles. Three time periods were examined: years with international sanctions and military activity (1996-1999); years with international sanctions but no military activity (2000-2001); years with neither sanctions nor military activity (2002-2005).
   Results: Compared with the period with neither sanctions nor military activity, severe injury crashes were 1.23 times more common (95% CI 1.19 to 1.27) during the period with sanctions and military activity and 1.21 times more common ( 95% CI 1.16 to 1.27) during the period with sanctions but no military activity.
   Conclusions: The data suggest that vehicle travel became safer after the end of military action and economic sanctions. Road traffic safety needs to be a priority during both periods of political unrest and its recovery phase.

TI A Smart Bicycle That Protects Itself
SO IEEE CONTROL SYSTEMS MAGAZINE

DT Article
ID TRACKING; EXERCISE; ALZHEIMERS; SEARCH
AB This article presents a smart bicycle with inexpensive sensors, active sensing control systems, and estimation algorithms for the prevention of car-bicycle collisions. The smart bicycle tracks nearby cars, predicts their trajectories, and (in the case of the danger of a possible car-bicycle collision) sounds an audio alarm to alert the motorist to the presence of the bicycle.
   The proposed technology works on today's roads and does not depend on any additional technology being available on cars. The challenges in developing the proposed system stem from the inability to utilize the expensive radar and high-density lidar sensors that are typically used on prototype autonomous cars. The system is also required to address complex traffic scenarios involving rear-approaching, left-turning, and right-turning vehicles.
   To enable the bicycle to reliably track nearby vehicles using novel inexpensive sensors, active sensing control and estimation algorithms for vehicle tracking are developed. Human-factors research is used to create an appropriate auditory alert that attempts to convey both a sense of emergency and the resemblance to a bicycle bell.
   This article describes the developed technology and its implementation on prototype e-bikes. A three-week field operational test was then conducted using the prototype smart bicycles to evaluate the effectiveness of the developed technology on today's roads. The field operational test involved three instrumented bicycles, bicyclist volunteers with significant daily urban commutes, and an analysis of bicycle data recorded during their commutes in real-world traffic conditions. sensor system first tracks a vehicle that has a larger entropy of the position uncertainty. Otherwise, the laser sensor system conducts the search task based on search area uncertainties (the laser sensor first searches an area with larger uncertainty) using (S5).
   If two vehicles are driving in an inside adjacent lane, then only the first vehicle will be tracked by the estimation system. It is possible that there are some unique circumstances (for example, where the car behind a school bus makes a sudden lane change to directly behind the bicycle and poses a danger to the bicycle) that cannot be reliably tracked. In such a case, it is possible that the sensing system might be late in detecting the danger. However, such a danger would exist even if the bicycle rider was directly watching and not using a sensor-based automatic tracking system. The automatic sensing system would still assist the bicycle rider, who would otherwise be personally watching for all vehicles.

AB Traffic participant detection, which locates targets participating in road traffic such as vehicles and humans, is a critical research goal in autonomous driving and intelligent transportation technology, in which targets of various scales are challenging to handle. To address this problem, we propose an accurate and efficient traffic participant detector called FM-RepPoints to increase detection precision of multi-scale targets via optimized features and localization confidence. We first present a parameter-efficient backbone Dilated-ResNeSt to extract complicated urban scene features with less inference time. An adaptive attention module is then added to calibrate the features according to the corresponding targets. Moreover, we set the multi-scale localization confidence for traffic participants of various scales based on the sensitivity analysis. The proposed network outperforms the basic network by 3.3 points mAP; the accuracy of vehicles and humans is improved by 4.5% and 2.1%, respectively. Compared with state-of-the-art algorithms, the proposed method achieves the highest accuracy while maintaining average inference speed, thereby accomplishing the best speed-accuracy trade-off.

AB Sliding mode control (SMC), which is well known to its insensitivity to parameter uncertainties and robustness against various disturbances, has been widely adopted for some types of underactuated systems, including multirotor unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs). This article is absorbed in developing a self-tuning SMC strategy to perform the robust and adaptive tracking control for an uncertain coaxial octorotor UAV (COUAV) with the actuator faults. Such a strategy is composed of manifold coefficients, which are adjusted by employing gradient descent method. It is also composed of continuous controllers that are designed by utilizing the radial basis function neural network (RBFNN) to approximate the total disturbances, where the approximation errors of RBFNN are estimated by using the adaptive control method. Moreover, the developed SMC strategy allows tuning the adaptive coefficients of the constructed manifolds, eliminating the inherent chattering phenomenon, and addressing the robust and adaptive tracking control problems for an uncertain COUAV. Comparative simulation results are carried out to illustrate the effectiveness of the developed SMC strategy.

AB Nuclear emergency evacuation is challenging and dangerous, with time constraints, resource limitations, and radiation exposure risks. The development of the Internet of Things (IoT) and artificial intelligence enables us to build an intelligent evacuation system to help mitigate this problem a great deal. In this article, we design the nuclear emergency parallel evacuation system based on the artificial systems (A), computational experiments (C), and parallel execution (P) approach and intelligent vehicle collaborative systems (IVCs). In this system, the evacuation risks of different regions under various possible scenarios are simulated and evaluated in the artificial systems. With data adversarially generated from the artificial systems and collected from sensors all over the area, an optimization model is proposed to find the optimal evacuation plans for emergent evacuation scenarios in the computational experiments. Eventually, the most suitable running strategy of autonomous buses will be selected and carried out based on the parallel execution in accordance with the real scene. A case study is conducted, and results indicate that the system can serve as an efficient tool for future nuclear emergency evacuation planning.

AB Mobile robots such as unmanned aerial vehicles (drones) can be used for surveillance, monitoring and data collection in buildings, infrastructure and environments. The importance of accurate and multifaceted monitoring is well known to identify problems early and prevent them escalating. This motivates the need for flexible, autonomous and powerful decision-making mobile robots. These systems need to be able to learn through fusing data from multiple sources. Until very recently, they have been task specific. In this paper, we describe a generic navigation algorithm that uses data from sensors on-board the drone to guide the drone to the site of the problem. In hazardous and safety-critical situations, locating problems accurately and rapidly is vital. We use the proximal policy optimisation deep reinforcement learning algorithm coupled with incremental curriculum learning and long short-term memory neural networks to implement our generic and adaptable navigation algorithm. We evaluate different configurations against a heuristic technique to demonstrate its accuracy and efficiency. Finally, we consider how safety of the drone could be assured by assessing how safely the drone would perform using our navigation algorithm in real-world scenarios.

AB Automatic generation of optimized flyable path is a key technology and challenge for autonomous unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) formation system. Aiming to improve the rapidity and optimality of automatic path planner, this paper presents a three dimensional path planning algorithm for UAV formation based on comprehensively improved particle swarm optimization (PSO). In the proposed method, a chaos-based Logistic map is firstly adopted to improve the particle initial distribution. Then, the common used constant acceleration coefficients and maximum velocity are designed to adaptive linear-varying ones, which adjusts to the optimization process and meanwhile improves solution optimality. Besides, a mutation strategy that undesired particles are replaced by those desired ones is also proposed and the algorithm convergence speed is accelerated. Theoretically, the comprehensively improved PSO not only speeds up the convergence but also improves the solution optimality. Finally, Monte-Carlo simulation for UAV formation under terrain and threat constraints are carried out and the results illustrate the rapidity and optimality of the proposed method. (C) 2019 ISA.

AB This paper presents a generalized multistage bayesian framework to enable an autonomous robot to complete high-precision operations on a static target in a large field. The proposed framework consists of two multistage approaches, capable of dealing with the complexity of high-precision operation in a large field to detect and localize the target. In the multistage localization, locations of the robot and the target are estimated sequentially when the target is far away from the robot, whereas these locations are estimated simultaneously when the target is close. A level of confidence (LOC) for each detection criterion of a sensor and the associated probability of detection (POD) of the sensor are defined to make the target detectable with different LOCs at varying distances. Differential entropies of the robot and target are used as a precision metric for evaluating the performance of the proposed approach. The proposed multistage observation and localization approaches were applied to scenarios using an unmanned ground vehicle (UGV) and an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV). Results with the UGV in simulated environments and then real environments show the effectiveness of the proposed approaches to real-world problems. A successful demonstration using the UAV is also presented.

AB Currently, advanced driver assistance systems (ADAS) and automated vehicles (AV) are designed for use in the existing road infrastructure. These partially and fully automated vehicles will be operated in a shared space not only with other vehicles but also with vulnerable road users (VRU). Even though crashes between ADAS equipped vehicles or AV and VRU seem inevitable in such a scenario, functional safety, i.e., the assessment of the quality and safety level of the automation system, plays a crucial role in minimizing the crash frequency and the injury severity. We develop a data-driven approach to injury severity estimation for functional safety, i.e., ISO 26262 S-parameters, for four types of VRU: pedestrians, bicyclists, scooterists, and motorcycle riders. To estimate the S-parameter, the 90th-percentile of the injury severity distribution in the S-scale, a population-based data set (Germany's national data set DESTATIS) is used. Since the description of the injury severity in DESTATIS is not detailed enough for a direct one-to-one mapping to the S-scale, we enhance the level of detail in the population based data set by using additional information from the German in-depth accident study (GIDAS), an in-depth, size-limited survey of part of the same population. Thus, we are able to transform the 4-level injury scale (uninjured, slightly injures, severely injured, and fatal) of the police reports found in DESTATIS into the three breakpoints of the injury severity scale (ISS) (ISS >{4, 9, 16}) which in turn directly translate to the four levels of the S-scale. Furthermore, the ISS >9 breakpoint more or less equates to MAIS 3+, the definition of 'severe injury' in nearly all international road safety goals that look beyond fatalities. The derived injury scale transformation can be utilized to translate the injury severities of the police-reported cases to the politically needed MAIS 3+ distribution. Thus, population-based data can be directly used to estimate the proportion of these 'severely injured.' The crashes are analyzed from the perspective of the VRU as well as from the vehicle type involved. We stratified the opposing vehicles by injury mechanism: wrap projection for bonnet type passenger vehicles (BTV), forward projection for box type vehicles like light trucks (LTV), as well as single-vehicle crashes. We cluster the crash data into traffic domains based on the speed limit: shared zone, residential streets, city roads, arterial thoroughfares, rural roads, and autobahn. For each VRU type, injury mechanism, and traffic domain, the S parameters, i.e., the 90th-percentile of the injury severity measured in S-scale, are calculated with a one-sided 95% confidence level. Exemplary applications of the results are given in the discussion: an evaluation of an AV hitting a crossing pedestrian, an in-lane swerving ADAS system for VRU avoidance, and the rating of the nominal performance of an inflatable helmet for pedestrians.

AB The autonomy of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) - self-governing in the aerospace discipline has been a remarkable research area with the development of the advanced bespoke microcontrollers embedded with advanced AI techniques for the last several decades. The road forward about the operational environment is certain about the swarms of fully automated UAVs (FAUAVs), that is, urban areas. FAUAVs with self-learning and self-decision-making abilities by executing non-trivial sequences of events with decimetre-level accuracy based on a set of rules, control loops and constraints using dynamic flight plans and trajectories are taking their indispensable parts within smart cities (SCs). Therefore, their integration with the SC components using real-time data analytics is urgent. This is mainly required to establish a better swarm intelligence along with a safer and optimised harmonious smart ecosystem that enables cooperative FAUAV-SC automation systems with collaborative automated intelligence engaging in the concepts of Internet of Everything (IoE) and Automation of Everything (AoE). Planning the future of cities with swarms of FAUAVs is explored in this paper to optimise the use of FAUAVs with a diverse range of applications and a contemporary methodology is proposed using a holistic framework - FAUAVinSCF equipped with various effective and efficient techniques along with a novel FAUAV routing technique customisable to the constraints of FAUAVs and urban areas. With the methodology, the components of SC and FAUAVs involving recent and impending technological advancements are moulded together to make this inevitable transformation a harmonious part of the inhabitants contributing to the cities' liveability and sustainability. The framework consists of a decentralized agent-based control architecture that monitors and controls the swarms of resource-constraint FAUAVs for their real-time requirements in optimising their urban uses. The outcomes of the methodology suggest that the constraints of FAUAVs can be mitigated significantly in urban areas and consequently, their efficacy can be increased in realising their diverse range of missions.

AB This article focuses on the coordination and communication aspects of multi-robot systems (MRS) and explores what, how and when robots should coordinate and communicate in marine environment. It includes a comparative analysis of MRS coordination under communication constraints in aerial, terrestrial, and marine environments. In the light of the gaps identified in the current MRS literature, we focus on how to tackle the inherent communication constraints presents in marine environments. Thus, a review of Marine Multi-Robot systems (MMRS) is presented, proposing a taxonomy that classifies them according to how they communicate and coordinate. In this line, the classification of different communication strategies found in the literature has received significant attention. Additionally, a MMRS coordination approach is proposed where a heterogeneous group of marine vehicles must explore an unknown area maximizing communication. The proposed approach uses a real characterization of the acoustic communication signal quality as input to the decision making process. To validate its effectiveness, our approach has been subjected to a series of highly realistic experiments.

AB The existing segmentation techniques require high-fidelity images as input to perform semantic segmentation. Since the segmentation results contain most of edge information that is much less than the acquired images, the throughput gap leads to both hardware and software waste. In this paper, we report an image-free single-pixel segmentation technique. The technique combines structured illumination and single-pixel detection together, to efficiently sample and multiplex scene's segmentation information into compressed one-dimensional measure-ments. The illumination patterns are optimized together with the subsequent reconstruction neural network, which directly infers segmentation maps from the single-pixel measurements. The end-to-end encoding-and -decoding learning framework enables optimized illumination with corresponding network, which provides both high acquisition and segmentation efficiency. Both simulation and experimental results validate that accurate segmentation can be achieved using two-order-of-magnitude less input data. When the sampling ratio is 1%, the Dice coefficient reaches above 80% and the pixel accuracy reaches above 96%. We envision that this image-free segmentation technique can be widely applied in various resource-limited platforms such as Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) and autonomous vehicle that require real-time sensing.

AB Recently, unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) task allocation is a hot topic both in the civilian and military, while the research of considering uncertainty and multi-objective is still in its infancy. Firstly, based on the uncertainty theory, a mathematical model of the uncertain multi-objective UAV task allocation problem with uncertain variables in both objective function and constraint conditions is established. The expected value criterion and opportunity constraint are introduced to transform the model into a deterministic optimization model. Furthermore, because traditional fireworks algorithm (FWA) has the shortcomings of low solution accuracy and slow convergence speed in solving the UAV task allocation problem, a novel Tent-Levy FWA (TLFWA) based on discrete update process is designed by introducing integer coding, Tent chaotic mapping and Levy variation. Experimental results show that the mean cost calculated by TLFWA is 8.17% and 13.73% lower than that of FWA and particle swarm optimization algorithm respectively, which proves the effectiveness of TLFWA. This study provides a new way to solve multi-objective and uncertain decision-making problems.

AB During highly automated driving, drivers no longer physically control the vehicle but they might need to monitor the driving scene. This is true for SAE level 2, where monitoring the external environment is required; it is also true for level 3, where drivers must react quickly and safely to a take-over request. Without such monitoring, even if only partial, drivers are considered out-of-the-loop (OOTL) and safety may be compromised. The OOTL phenomenon may be particularly important for long automated driving periods during which mind wandering can occur. This study scrutinized drivers' visual behaviour for 18 min of highly automated driving. Intersections between gaze and 13 areas of interest (AOIs) were analysed, considering both static and dynamic indicators. An estimation of self-reported mind wandering based on gaze behaviour was performed using partial least squares (PLS) regression models. The outputs of the PLS regressions allowed defining visual strategies associated with good monitoring of the driving scene. This information may enable online estimation of the OOTL phenomenon based on a driver's spontaneous visual behaviour.

AB Vehicular communication is one of the critical technologies in intelligent transportation system to provide connectivity between vehicles, road side units, and pedestrians. Multiple wireless accessing technologies designed to provide connectivity in vehicular networks such as conventional Wi-Fi, IEEE 802.11p, and cellular communications. Recently, cellular V2X (C-V2X) is standardized and designed by the third generation partnership project (3GPP) for automotive services. C-V2X supports two communication modes through a single platform to provide both Wi-Fi and cellular communication. LTE-V2X is the current 3GPPRelease 14 standard that has many enhancements to provide the new 3GPPRelease 16 for the new 5G radio generation. 5G-new radio (NR) is expected to address the automotive capabilities, improvement, and services for 2020 and beyond. 5G-NR becomes a competitive technology compared with other wireless technologies because of extensive coverage, high capacity, high reliability, and low delay support. In this paper, we propose the Optimizing of 5G with V2X, and analyzing the current V2X standards, introducing the development of 5G, challenges, features, requirements, design, and technologies.

AB With the emergence of automated driving technology, wireless demand for secure information exchange among automated vehicles has increased dramatically. To this end, we design a security-aware dynamic device-to-device (D2D) spectrum resource sharing mechanism to enhance the security of vehicular D2D communications with the improved spectrum efficiency. Considering both resource block (RB) sharing and power control, we model this joint D2D spectrum resource sharing process as a weighted bipartite graph matching problem whose weights are obtained through deriving the closed-form solutions of power control in an algebraic method. Then, the global optimal solutions of the matching problem are obtained by using the Hungarian algorithm. Furthermore, a security-aware RB and power allocation (SA-RBPA) mechanism compatible with existing cellular networks is proposed for the small cell base station applications. Extensive simulation results have shown that, compared with existing approaches that consider RB reusing strategy or power control scheme optimization alone, the SA-RBPA scheme is able to realize a better spectrum efficiency and security performance.

DT Article
AB This paper presents a sampling-based receding-horizon inspection algorithm that allows observation of a tumbling target vehicle while guaranteeing an arbitrary low risk of collision between the chaser performing the inspection and the target. The proposed algorithm relies on a simple heuristic search of the best inspection trajectory, and it can be suited to both onboard implementation as an autonomous guidance module and offline trajectory design. The main strength of the algorithm resides in its ability to quickly solve black-box optimal control problems, exploiting an input sampling approach that is commonly used in robotic motion planning. A new and computationally simple method to verify the safety of the two vehicles is also presented and implemented into the algorithm. The proposed method allows taking into account relative navigation and maneuver execution errors, as well as the effects of unmodeled perturbations. The results obtained with the algorithm are compared to the ones obtained with a classic inspection strategy making use of inclined football orbits. It is shown that the proposed guidance algorithm consistently ensures the completion of the inspection mission, and it takes advantage of the characteristics of the natural dynamics of the relative motion to outperform the classic approach.

AB Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) have been applied for both civilian and military applications; scientific research involving UAVs has encompassed a wide range of scientific study. However, communication with unmanned vehicles are subject to attack and compromise. Such attacks have been reported as early as 2009, when a Predator UAV's video stream was compromised. Since UAVs extensively utilize autonomous behavior, it is important to develop an autopilot system that is robust to potential cyber-attack. In this paper, we present a biometric system to encrypt communication between a UAV and a computerized base station. This is accomplished by generating a key derived from a user's EEG Beta component. We first extract coefficients from Beta data using Legendre's polynomials. We perform encoding of the coefficients using Bose-Chaudhuri-Hocquenghem encoding and then generate a key from a hash function. The key is used to encrypt the communication between XBees. Also we have introduced scenarios where the communication is attacked. When communication with a UAV is attacked, a safety mechanism directs the UAV to a safe home location. This system has been validated on a commercial UAV under malicious attack conditions.

AB The paper presents advanced mission management system (MMS) for unmanned aerial vehicles, based on integrated modular avionics (IMA) architecture. IMA architecture enables the MMS to host high end functions for autonomous navigation and attack. MMS is a collection of systems to execute the mission objectives. The system constitutes mission computer (MC), sensors and other sub-systems. The MMS-MC needs to execute advanced algorithms like terrain referenced navigation, vision-aided navigation, automatic target recognition, sensor fusion, online path planning, and tactical planning for autonomy and safety. This demands high-end architecture in terms of hardware, software, and communication. The MMS-MC is designed to exploit the benefits of IMA concepts such as open system architecture, hardware and software architecture catering for portability, technology transparency, scalability, system reconfigurability and fault tolerance. This paper investigates on advanced navigation methods for augmenting INS with terrain-referenced navigation and vision-aided navigation during GPS non-availability. This paper also includes approach to implement these methods and simulation results are provided accordingly, and also discusses in a limited way, the approach for implementing online path planning.

AB Rapid advancements in vehicle automation and a shift towards collaborative consumption trends will disrupt future urban mobility systems. We present a joint model of consumers' affinity to-wards shared automated vehicles (SAVs) with two distinct yet related configurations: automated vehicle (AV) carsharing and AV ride sourcing. Compact and walkable built environment is known to support active travel and shared mobility but the potential impacts of built environment on adoption of automated shared mobility are largely unknown. Besides sociodemographic, sus-tainable travel, and technology-related factors, we examine the role of neighborhood-level walkability (composite measure of land-use, pedestrian-oriented urban design, and transit accessibility) in shaping public's opinion about AV carsharing and AV ride sourcing technologies. Detailed travel behavior and stated preference/taste data for over 2700 individuals from the most recent 2019 Puget Sound Travel Survey are complemented with neighborhood-level high -reso-lution data on built environment fabric. Two dependent variables of interest include individual's level of interest in AV carsharing and AV ride sourcing programs. A novel and comprehensive geo-additive heterogeneous copula-based joint behavioral model is developed -revealing complex stochastic dependence patterns between users' interest in AV ride sourcing and carsharing pro-grams and different layers of systematic and random taste heterogeneity. Results show that improving neighborhood walkability can be an effective way to increase public's interest in using automated ride sourcing and carsharing services. Findings also highlight the opportunity to enable SAV adoption by harnessing the synergies between green (transit) travel, technology use for work/non-work purposes, use of existing mobility-on-demand (MOD) services, and affinity towards automated MOD services. Results are translated to potential policies for designing pro-active behavioral and built environment interventions for accelerating SAV adoption with an enhanced sensitivity towards the needs of distinct and more vulnerable population groups (e.g., older, unemployed, and/or less educated individuals).

AB In recent years, unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) autonomous flight technology has been applied in many fields. However, in the process of autonomous operation, the UAV may deviate from the set flight path due to various disturbance factors, which results in mission failure. In order to find the abnormal situation in time and take corresponding measures, it is necessary to monitor the operation state of the UAV. Predicting the UAV flight path is the main monitoring method at present; however, the accuracy and real-time of the existing prediction methods are limited. Therefore, this paper proposes an error compensation Bessel bidirectional long short-term memory real-time path prediction model deployed in ground stations. First, because of inconsistency of the units in all directions of the original positioning information provided by global positioning system, the Bessel geodetic coordinate transformation is introduced to unify the units of three-dimensional coordinate data, so as to improve the prediction accuracy. Second, considering the problems of poor data quality and data missing in the operation process, the least square fitting method is used to supplement and correct the positioning coordinate data to obtain more reliable and accurate path observation values as the model input. Finally, a deep learning path prediction model based on bi-directional long short-term memory (BiLSTM) network is constructed, and the appropriate network parameters are determined with the prediction accuracy and time as evaluation indicators. In order to further improve the prediction accuracy, a compensator based on proportional integral differential error control theory is designed according to the output characteristics of the BiLSTM network, which is used for providing compensation values for the prediction results of the model. The training and testing results using the actual flight data of UAV operation show that, under the experimental environment built, the model proposed in this paper can complete the UAV flight path prediction with root mean square error < 1 meter within 0.1 second, and has better performance and higher prediction accuracy than other neural network models.

AB In order to relieve the traffic burden of the ground base station (BS) and improve system operation efficiency, we study the energy-efficient optimization problem in a non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA)-based unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)-assisted data collection system, where a UAV assists a ground BS for traffic offloading. Particularly, the joint optimization problem of the placement of the UAV and transmit power of the sensor nodes is formulated to maximize the energy efficiency of all sensor nodes under the quality-of-service constraints and the probabilistic ground-to-air channel model. To balance the optimized performance and online operation time, we propose an alternating-based offline optimization algorithm for obtaining the optimal online UAV trajectory policy. Under the given UAV placement, the formulated problem is first transformed into a convex power allocation subproblem. Based on the power-allocation solutions, the deep deterministic policy gradient algorithm is then leveraged to approach the optimal UAV placement. Simulations show that the proposed algorithm can obtain an efficient performance while consuming an average online operation time of fewer than 0.2 seconds.

AB Surround-view cameras are a primary sensor for automated driving, used for near-field perception. It is one of the most commonly used sensors in commercial vehicles primarily used for parking visualization and automated parking. Four fisheye cameras with a 190 degrees field of view cover the 360 degrees around the vehicle. Due to its high radial distortion, the standard algorithms do not extend easily. Previously, we released the first public fisheye surround-view dataset named WoodScape. In this work, we release a synthetic version of the surround-view dataset, covering many of its weaknesses and extending it. Firstly, it is not possible to obtain ground truth for pixel-wise optical flow and depth. Secondly, WoodScape did not have all four cameras annotated simultaneously in order to sample diverse frames. However, this means that multi-camera algorithms cannot be designed to obtain a unified output in birds-eye space, which is enabled in the new dataset. We implemented surround-view fisheye geometric projections in CARLA Simulator matching WoodScape's configuration and created SynWoodScape. We release 80 k images from the synthetic dataset with annotations for 10+ tasks. We also release the baseline code and supporting scripts.

AB In this article, we study the problem of trajectory planning for a class of nonlinear systems with convex state/control constraints and nonconvex state constraints with concave constraint functions. This corresponds to a challenging nonconvex optimal control problem. We present how to convexify the nonlinear dynamics without any approximation via a combination of variable redefinition and relaxation. We then prove that the relaxation is exact by designing an appropriate objective function. This exact relaxation result enables us to further convexify the nonconvex state constraints simply by linearization. As a result, an algorithm is designed to iteratively solve the obtained convex optimization problems until convergence to get a solution of the original problem. A unique feature of the proposed approach is that the algorithm is proved to converge and it does not rely on any trust-region constraint. High performance of the algorithm is demonstrated by its application to trajectory planning of UAVs and autonomous cars with obstacle avoidance requirements.

TI Harbor-border inspection for unmanned aerial vehicle based on visible

SO APPLIED OPTICS

DT Article
ID TRANSMISSION; TIME
AB The unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) offers unique advantages of autonomous flight capability and small coefficient of risk, and is increasingly being used in harbor-border inspection to ensure security and orderly operation of harbors. In response to the influence of external factors such as electromagnetic interference in harbor-border inspection, this paper utilizes UAV and visible light communication (VLC) to build an efficient system to track maritime targets near the harbor reliably. In a VLC scenario, a geometrical equation for transmitter positioning is first proposed based on the received signal strength of the optical signal emitted by the target. On this basis, linear iterative positioning (LIP) using first-order Taylor expansion is proposed to realize online beam tracking. Furthermore, quadratic approximative iterative positioning (QAIP), a more precise approximation of the geometrical equation, is proposed based on second-order Taylor expansion. Simulation results show that the proposed algorithms can track targets effectively, andQAIP can achieve higher accuracy with no noise or high signal-to-noise ratio. In addition, compared with the geometrical solution, LIP andQAIP have faster computing speeds and fixed overheads. (C) 2021 Optical Society of America

AB Squared planar markers have become a popular method for pose estimation in applications such as autonomous robots, unmanned vehicles and virtual trainers. The markers allow estimating the position of a monocular camera with minimal cost, high robustness, and speed. One only needs to create markers with a regular printer, place them in the desired environment so as to cover the working area, and then registering their location from a set of images.
   Nevertheless, marker detection is a time-consuming process, especially as the image dimensions grows. Modern cameras are able to acquire high resolutions images, but fiducial marker systems are not adapted in terms of computing speed. This paper proposes a multi-scale strategy for speeding up marker detection in video sequences by wisely selecting the most appropriate scale for detection, identification and corner estimation. The experiments conducted show that the proposed approach outperforms the state-of-the-art methods without sacrificing accuracy or robustness. Our method is up to 40 times faster than the state-of-the-art method, achieving over 1000 fps in 4 K images without any parallelization. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Accurate benthic habitat maps are critical for resource management in coastal waters with competing uses. We used a 500 kHz phase-measuring bathymetric sonar (PMBS) and 900 kHz side-scan sonar to acquire seafloor data in estuarine and shelf environments. Grab samples and remotely operated vehicle video created geological and biological classifications for segmented maps produced by a backscatter clustering program. PMBS improves regional map resolution (< 1 m), reduces the need for direct sampling, extends information on sediment-biological relationships to larger areas, and allows measurements of bedforms. Auto-segmentation was successful in environments with highly contrasting acoustic signatures and meters-scale homogeneity. Patchier communities are identifiable in PMBS data. Species preferences for sediment (i.e., tubeworm preference for sediment without shell hash) allowed us to determine potential habitat without identifying individual organisms in acoustic data. PMBS with sufficient ground-truthing offers an efficient way to map seafloor characteristics, which is critical in marine spatial planning efforts.

AB Potholes are one of the most important issues in African road-networks. They pose a major threat to mobility and, with time, cause accelerated degradation of the underlying road infrastructure as well as extensive vehicle damage. To address the need for improved infrastructure management, an advanced data gathering solution is required. This paper presents one such solution. The pothole detection, classification and logging (PDCL) system is under active development by Sensorit (Pty) Ltd in collaboration with the University of Cape Town (UCT) Radar Remote Sensing Group (RRSG). This system represents the initial step in Sensorit's modular approach to producing fully autonomous vehicles for African markets. In this paper, an overview of the PDCL system is presented and early results are shown. The efficacy of the system's unique combination of active infrared stereo vision and mmWave frequency-modulated continuous-wave (FMCW) radar sensors is explored. Under various experimental conditions, range-Doppler maps (RDMs) produced by the radar were unable to provide meaningful pothole detections. In contrast, processed depth maps produced by the stereo vision system are demonstrated to successfully detect even shallow potholes.

AB With the increase in electrification, the demand for the functionality and features of electric vehicles (EVs) is increasing, and accordingly, the required weight of copper (Cu) is increasing. Additionally, Cu usage increase as the wiring/functions of autonomous vehicles (AVs) increase. Therefore, limited energy efficiency due to the high mass density of Cu electrical cables has become a challenging issue to be overcome. With this trend, carbon-metal core-shell wire is an attractive lightweight material. It remains a challenge to further improve the properties of previously reported carbon-metal core-shell wire. Here, we report CNTF-Cu-Gr wires obtained by introducing graphene into Cu electroplated on CNTFs. Electroplated Cu was coated with graphene via chemical vapor deposition, which also provided synergetic effects, enabling better thermal and electrical properties. These CNTF-Cu-Gr wires exhibit excellent overall performance in terms of mechanical, electrical, and thermal properties and are lightweight. We expect that these dual core-shell wires will be used in practical applications in the near future. (C) 2021 The Author(s). Published by Elsevier Ltd.

ID TERRAIN CLASSIFICATION
AB Expanding the performance and autonomous-decision capability of driver-assistance systems is critical in today's automotive engineering industry to help drivers and reduce accident incidence. It is essential to provide vehicles with the necessary perception systems, but without creating a prohibitively expensive product. In this area, the continuous and precise estimation of a road surface on which a vehicle moves is vital for many systems. This paper proposes a low-cost approach to solve this issue. The developed algorithm resorts to analysis of vibrations generated by the tyre-rolling movement to classify road surfaces, which allows for optimizing vehicular-safety-system performance. The signal is analyzed by means of machine-learning techniques, and the classification and estimation of the surface are carried out with the use of a self-organizing-map (SOM) algorithm. Real recordings of the vibration produced by tyre rolling on six different types of surface were used to generate the model. The efficiency of the proposed model (88.54%) and its speed of execution were compared with those of other classifiers in order to evaluate its performance.

AB The use of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) is growing significantly for many and varied purposes. During the mission, an outdoor UAV is guided by following the planned path using GPS signals. However, the GPS capability may become defective or the environment may be GPS-denied, and an additional safety aid is therefore required for the automatic landing phase that is independent of GPS data. Most UAVs are equipped with machine vision systems which, together with onboard analysis, can be used for safe, automatic landing. This contributes greatly to the overall success of autonomous flight.
   This paper proposes an automatic expert system, based on image segmentation procedures, that assists safe landing through recognition and relative orientation of the UAV and platform. The proposed expert system exploits the human experience that has been incorporated into the machine vision system, which is mapped into the proposed image processing modules. The result is an improved reliability capability that could be incorporated into any UAV, and is especially robust for rotary wing UAVs. This is clearly a desirable fail-safe capability.

AB In this paper, an integrated navigation system based on H-infinity filter is proposed for improving the performance of underwater navigation system. The proposed navigation system consists of a package with a triad of accelerometers and an Attitude and Heading Reference System (AHRS) as the main system and a Doppler Velocity Log (DVL) as an auxiliary system. In this system, the dynamic and measurement models are defined in such a way by which a H-infinity based integrated navigation system is derived. In addition, according to the specific dynamic of discussed vehicle, a scheme is proposed for estimating the performance bound parameter of H-infiriity filter. The proposed system becomes robust versus the system modeling errors and noise uncertainty in comparison with the conventional Kalman Filter (KF). Furthermore, it can be effectively decrease the effect of the DVL's outlier data. The performance of the proposed system is evaluated through several sea tests using an Autonomous Underwater Vehicle (AUV). Furthermore, the conventional Dead Reckoning (DR) and KF algorithms are utilized for comparison. The experimental results demonstrate the superior performance of the proposed system compared with the conventional algorithms.

AB Lane boundary detection technology has progressed rapidly over the past few decades. However, many challenges that often lead to lane detection unavailability remain to be solved. In this paper, we propose a spatial-temporal knowledge filtering model to detect lane boundaries in videos. To address the challenges of structure variation, large noise and complex illumination, this model incorporates prior spatial-temporal knowledge with lane appearance features to jointly identify lane boundaries. The model first extracts line segments in video frames. Two novel filters the Crossing Point Filter (CPF) and the Structure Triangle Filter (STF)-are proposed to filter out the noisy line segments. The two filters introduce spatial structure constraints and temporal location constraints into lane detection, which represent the spatial-temporal knowledge about lanes. A straight line or curve model determined by a state machine is used to fit the line segments to finally output the lane boundaries. We collected a challenging realistic traffic scene dataset. The experimental results on this dataset and other standard dataset demonstrate the strength of our method. The proposed method has been successfully applied to our autonomous experimental vehicle.

AB Capturing drivers' affective responses given driving context and driver-pedestrian interactions remains a challenge for designing in-vehicle, empathic interfaces. To address this, we conducted two lab-based studies using camera and physiological sensors. Our first study collected participants' (N = 21) emotion self-reports and physiological signals (including facial temperatures) toward non-verbal, pedestrian crossing videos from the Joint Attention for Autonomous Driving dataset. Our second study increased realism by employing a hybrid driving simulator setup to capture participants' affective responses (N = 24) toward enacted, non-verbal pedestrian crossing actions. Key findings showed: (a) non-positive actions in videos elicited higher arousal ratings, whereas different in-video pedestrian crossing actions significantly influenced participants' physiological signals. (b) Non-verbal pedestrian interactions in the hybrid simulator setup significantly influenced participants' facial expressions, but not their physiological signals. We contribute to the development of in-vehicle empathic interfaces that draw on behavioral and physiological sensing to in-situ infer driver affective responses during non-verbal pedestrian interactions.

AB An observation-driven method for coordinated standoff target tracking based on Model Predictive Control (MPC) is proposed to improve observation of multiple Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) while approaching or loitering over a target. After acquiring a fusion estimate of the target state, each UAV locally measures the observation capability of the entire UAV system with the Fisher Information Matrix (FIM) determinant in the decentralized architecture. To facilitate observation optimization, only the FIM determinant is adopted to derive the performance function and control constraints for coordinated standoff tracking. Additionally, a modified iterative scheme is introduced to improve the iterative efficiency, and a consistent circular direction control is established to maintain long-term observation performance when the UAV approaches its target. Sufficient experiments with simulated and real trajectories validate that the proposed method can improve observation of the UAV system for target tracking and adaptively optimize UAV trajectories according to sensor performance and UAV-target geometry.

ID PLACEMENT
AB In this letter, an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) three-dimensional (3D) deployment problem for millimeter wave (mmWave) communications is examined. Due to the sensitivity of mmWave signals to blockages, the existence of line-of-sight (LoS) links plays a vital role in guaranteeing high quality communication. To deploy UAVs effectively and ensure LoS communications, we propose a two-stage anti-block UAV deployment method based on building geometric analysis. First, by employing the established signal blockage aware mmWave channel model, a blockage testing K-means (BT-K-means) algorithm is proposed to implement user clustering and preliminary deployment of UAVs. Then, to overcome the difficulty of finding the optimal location of a UAV due to frequent local oscillation of the path loss (PL) function, a PL oscillation-aware UAV 3D coordinate search algorithm is proposed, which can avoid signal blockages and effectively reduce the total PL. Finally, we verify the effectiveness of the proposed method through our simulation results.

AB This article establishes a three-tier mobile edge computing (MEC) network, which takes into account the cooperation between unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs). In this MEC network, we aim to minimize the processing delay of tasks by jointly optimizing the deployment of UAVs and offloading decisions, while meeting the computing capacity constraint of UAVs. However, the resulting optimization problem is nonconvex, which cannot be solved by general optimization tools in an effective and efficient way. To this end, we propose a two-layer optimization algorithm to tackle the non-convexity of the problem by capitalizing on alternating optimization. In the upper level algorithm, we rely on differential evolution (DE) learning algorithm to solve the deployment of the UAVs. In the lower level algorithm, we exploit distributed deep neural network (DDNN) to generate offloading decisions. Numerical results demonstrate that the two-layer optimization algorithm can effectively obtain the near-optimal deployment of UAVs and offloading strategy with low complexity.

AB The Ocean Bottom Flying Node (OBFN) is a kind of small Autonomous Underwater Vehicle (AUV) used in detection of seabed resources. Based on directed commination topology, this paper investigates the problem of distributed finite-time fault-tolerant containment control for multiple OBFN systems in presence of model uncertainties, external disturbances, and thruster faults. By choosing the nonsingular fast terminal sliding surface and defining the containment error variables, a distributed finite-time containment control method is designed, so as to make the states of the multiple OBFN systems converge to the sliding surface in finite time. The thruster faults, model uncertainties, and external disturbances are considered together and estimated by utilizing Neural Networks (NNs). An adaptive law is designed to compensate the upper bounds of estimation error. Based on the graph theory and matrix theory, it is demonstrated that the follower OBFNs could enter the convex hull formed by the leader OBFNs in finite time through using the Lyapunov approach. Numerical simulation is presented to show the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm. (C) 2019 The Franklin Institute. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Unmanned aerial systems (UASs) have become of considerable private and commercial interest for a variety of jobs and entertainment in the past 10 years. This paper is a literature review of the state of practice for the United States bridge inspection programs and outlines how automated and unmanned bridge inspections can be made suitable for present and future needs. At its best, current technology limits UAS use to an assistive tool for the inspector to perform a bridge inspection faster, safer, and without traffic closure. The major challenges for UASs are satisfying restrictive Federal Aviation Administration regulations, control issues in a GPS-denied environment, pilot expenses and availability, time and cost allocated to tuning, maintenance, post-processing time, and acceptance of the collected data by bridge owners. Using UASs with self-navigation abilities and improving image-processing algorithms to provide results near real-time could revolutionize the bridge inspection industry by providing accurate, multi-use, autonomous three-dimensional models and damage identification.

SO NAVAL ENGINEERS JOURNAL
LA English
DT Article
AB This paper explores the feasibility of using morphing rudders in autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) to enhance their performance in energetic environments Morphing control surfaces are introduced based on the concept of shape memory alloy to deflect the trailing edge of the airfoil and enhance lift. Experimental data suggest that a morphing rudder has better lift coefficient characteristics than a conventional rudder. A general nonlinear dynamic model for an AUV operating in energetic shallow waters is developed. The model is limited to the horizontal plane and includes the effect of ocean current. Using Simulin (R), a numerical simulation is performed to improve the path and station-keeping characteristics of an AUV with two sets of active rudders at the stern and bow. A feedback control law and a control allocation algorithm were included in the Simulink (R) model to determine the distribution of commanded forces to the actuators. For station-keeping in head and beam seas, a proportional-integral-derivative (PID) controller is used to estimate the required control forces and moments to counteract the effect of the current. The results of the study suggest that active rudders, when suitably applied, can enhance performance of underwater vehicles in energetic shallow waters.

AB Long-endurance, unmanned air vehicles (UAVs) usually employ high-aspect-ratio, flexible wings to reduce weight and power required to achieve extended flight operation. There are currently several advanced concept designs and prototypes that will sustain autonomous operations for months or even years. The increased wing flexibility can lead to large structural deflections for trimmed flight states. These large elastic deformations within the static equilibrium state of the vehicle can induce aeroelastic instabilities quite different from their rigid counterparts. Therefore, it is imperative to perform flutter analysis, which considers the trimmed, large amplitude deformed state as a reference condition. Considering the complexity of the system under investigation, the aeroelastic flutter analysis process usually includes an experimental test phase for verification purposes. In this respect, wind tunnel test models provide the opportunity to modify and calibrate theoretical models, through a process of model updating. This paper proposes the development of an experimental, aeroelastic, slender-wing model that can be designed using a scaling procedure. The model is based on a consistent, aeroelastic, beam-wise scheme, capable of simulating the unconventional aeroelastic behavior of flexible wings.

AB Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) will be an integral part of future smart cities to provide applications such as traffic management, environment monitoring, and data collection. UAVs offer flexible deployment, dynamic mobility, and Ultra-Reliable and Low Latency Communications (URLLC). However, UAVs are power-hungry devices, and their limited battery capacity cannot support their flight and communication operations for a long time. Additionally, multi-carrier (MC) techniques will be vital for supporting futuristic multi-user communication systems. To overcome these issues, we propose a solar-powered UAV MC system to support URLLC services for multi-users. In this regard, we aim to maximize the system sum throughput and we jointly optimize UAV positioning and sub-carrier allocation. To solve the optimization problem, we propose the low-complexity coordinate descent approximation algorithm (CDAA). Lastly, we show the proposed algorithm converges quickly and simultaneously yields superior performance compared to fixed benchmark schemes for two simulated environments.

SO SCIENTIFIC REPORTS

DT Article
AB Recent advances in deep learning realized accurate, robust detection of various types of objects including pedestrians on the road, defect regions in the manufacturing process, human organs in medical images, and dangerous materials passing through the airport checkpoint. Specifically, small object detection implemented as an embedded system is gaining increasing attention for autonomous vehicles, drone reconnaissance, and microscopic imagery. In this paper, we present a light-weight small object detection model using two plug-in modules: (1) high-resolution processing module (HRPM ) and (2) sigmoid fusion module (SFM). The HRPM efficiently learns multi-scale features of small objects using a significantly reduced computational cost, and the SFM alleviates mis-classification errors due to spatial noise by adjusting weights on the lost small object information. Combination of HRPM and SFM significantly improved the detection accuracy with a low amount of computation. Compared with the original YOLOX-s model, the proposed model takes a two-times higher-resolution input image for higher mean average precision (mAP) using 57% model parameters and 71% computation in Gflops. The proposed model was tested using real drone reconnaissance images, and provided significant improvement in detecting small vehicles.

Since Doppler shift induces intercarrier interference, the parameters of the channel paths have been decomposed into the Doppler shift and the channel information. In order to obtain the Doppler shift, a new estimation algorithm based on a combination of discrete Fourier transform and phase rotation has been proposed, which can determine the appropriate number of antennas. In addition to estimating the channel information, a low-complexity joint Doppler shift and channel estimation method has been designed that can quickly obtain accurate estimates. Furthermore, the achievable sum rate, the theoretical bounds of the mean squared errors, and the Cramer-Rao lower bounds of the estimation method have been derived. The analysis and simulation results prove that the performance of the proposed approach is close to the theoretical inference.

AB Increasing number of devices connected to the networks, applications and demands of new generation wireless communications cause very high energy consumption resulting in large amount of carbon emission. Thus, energy harvesting solutions together with accomplishing information transmission are required for energy efficient communications of new wireless communications generations such as 5G and 6G (i.e., 5G+). As such, due to the promise of energy efficient green communications, simultaneous wireless information and power transfer (SWIPT) techniques are expected to be indispensable component of 5G+. In this survey, the literature of multiuser SWIPT communications is reviewed for 5G+. Different multiuser SWIPT scenarios including multi-antenna communications, cooperative communications, network coding, communications security, and unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)-enabled communication systems based on multiuser diversity and multiple access methods are thoroughly reviewed. The experimental studies are also discussed.

AB This article presents a method for guiding a remotely operated vehicle (ROV) to autonomously traverse an aquaculture net pen. The method is based on measurements from a Doppler velocity log (DVL) and uses the measured length of the DVL beam vectors to approximate the geometry of a local region of the net pen in front of the ROV. The ROV position and orientation relative to this net pen approximation are used as inputs to a nonlinear guidance law. The guidance law is based upon the line-of-sight (LOS) guidance law. By utilizing that an ROV is fully actuated in the horizontal plane, the crosstrack error is minimized independently of the ROV heading. A Lyapunov analysis of the closed-loop system with this guidance law shows that the ROV is able to follow a continuous path in the presence of a constant irrotational ocean current. Finally, results from simulations and experiments demonstrating the performance of the net pen approximation and control system are presented.

AB The connections between transportation and subjective well-being have received increasing attention in the transportation literature. Yet there are few studies on the relationship between objective well-being and transportation. Objective well-being is the achievement of a persons' potential in knowledge, health, friendship, and other life domains, through the development of their embodied capacities to know, create and be sociable. The value of these achievements is objective, in the sense that it is not derived from a person's attitudes or mental state. Thus, objective well-being adds an important dimension to the study of well-being and transportation, as it can explain why active, embodied mobility modes-such as walking and cycling-offer more opportunities for human capacity development, compared to sedentary modes such as driving and riding in a driverless car. Embodied mobility modes activate a well-rounded combination of human capacities thus contributing to better understanding of one's environment, creative flow and sociability, in turn enhancing one's overall well-being. This may add important information for transportation planners and urban designers in design and evaluation of mobility environments.

AB This paper investigates the effect of waves and ocean currents on the dynamics and motion control of underwater gliders. Waves and ocean currents affect a glider's performance by deviating from its desired path and reducing its operational range. The influence of wave disturbances and ocean currents is estimated using mathematical models for sea state, potential flow theory and linear wave theory. The effect of waves at various heights, frequency and period were studied for a nonlinear dynamic model of the underwater glider. The wave characteristics have been simulated to investigate their effect on the depth, velocity and range of the glider. Subsequently, a line of sight algorithm in conjunction with controller was designed for the newly designed prototype of the Universiti Teknologi PETRONAS autonomous underwater glider to investigate the action of internal actuators in performing a saw tooth trajectory in the presence of waves and current disturbances. The glider was slightly perturbed due to the shallow and deep waves, with the more pronounced effect at increasing wave amplitude. However, the range of the vehicle remains relatively unchanged.

AB The Code Activated Transponder (FAT) ingestible fish tag capable of operating at depths of 6 000 m is described. The CAT is acoustically interrogated by a scanning sonar mounted on the AUDOS free-fall camera lander vehicle. The GAT, 12.5 mm diameter and 65 mm long works at ultrasonic frequencies (77 kHz) and can be tracked to a range of 500 m. The AUDOS lander incorporates the new TRATEX (Transponding Acoustic Tracking Experiment) system that logs direction and range of individually tagged fish together with current and compass information. Typical results are shown from a track of 3 Coryphaenoides(Nematonurus) armatus (Macrouridae) taken at the Porcupine Seabight in the North Atlantic (49 degrees 35' N-13 degrees 43' W), 3 500 m deep. The mean fish swimming speed was 0.087 m.s(-1). Despite their low speed, fish moved independently of the bottom current, either cross-current or against the current, optimising the chance of encountering odour plumes from new food falls.

AB Path planning in complex environments remains a challenging task for unmanned vehicles. In this paper, we propose a decoupled path-planning algorithm with the help of a deep reinforcement learning algorithm that separates the evaluation of paths from the planning algorithm to facilitate unmanned vehicles in real-time consideration of environmental factors. We use a 3D surface map to represent the path cost, where the elevation information represents the integrated cost. The peaks function simulates the path cost, which is processed and used as the algorithm's input. Furthermore, we improved the double deep Q-learning algorithm (DDQL), called retrospective-double DDQL (R-DDQL), to improve the algorithm's performance. R-DDQL utilizes global information and incorporates a retrospective mechanism that employs fuzzy logic to evaluate the quality of selected actions and identify better states for inclusion in the memory. Our simulation studies show that the proposed R-DDQL algorithm has better training speed and stability compared to the deep Q-learning algorithm and double deep Q-learning algorithm. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the R-DDQL algorithm under both static and dynamic tasks.

AB In an era of complexity, rapid technological advance and need for climate change action, urban roads may need to transform. The aim of this research is to identify the concepts underpinning the fundamental dimensions of the future urban road and open up an interdisciplinary dialogue about its delivery. We used a combinatorial approach incorporating a Systematic Literature Review to a Q-method. The Systematic Literature Review identifies 28 transforming concepts and organises them into five categories, namely: efficiency, safety, liveability, accessibility, and smart technology. Through a Q-method study, 50 transport experts "described" the urban road of the future. Four main factors emerged classifying the experts into: People-First Techno-Centrists (smart technology used as an enabler of human-centric transport futures), Autonomous Vehicles Sceptics, (AVs should not be the key paradigm-changer) Unconventionalists (shared road space and mixed uses should prevail) and Infrastructurists (safety-first multimodal infrastructure interventions should lead any change). The main dilemmas that arise are: a) prioritisation of modes: human first or not? b) share or segregate? and c) design systems or roads?

AB Over the last few years, several researchers have been developing protocols and applications in order to autonomously land unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs). However, most of the proposed protocols rely on expensive equipment or do not satisfy the high precision needs of some UAV applications such as package retrieval and delivery or the compact landing of UAV swarms. Therefore, in this work, a solution for high precision landing based on the use of ArUco markers is presented. In the proposed solution, a UAV equipped with a low-cost camera is able to detect ArUco markers sized 56 x 56 cm from an altitude of up to 30 m. Once the marker is detected, the UAV changes its flight behavior in order to land on the exact position where the marker is located. The proposal was evaluated and validated using both the ArduSim simulation platform and real UAV flights. The results show an average offset of only 11 cm from the target position, which vastly improves the landing accuracy compared to the traditional GPS-based landing, which typically deviates from the intended target by 1 to 3 m.

AB The vector propulsion systems have been equipped in numerous autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) nowadays. In most cases, the vector propulsion is achieved by changing the direction of the entire vector propulsion system, which requires a spacious room for complex mechanical structures at the tail of the AUV. The deflectable duct propeller, however, as a new way to achieve vector propulsion, can generate lateral force and moment enabling the AUV to perform various motions. In this work, the 6-DOF notion model of the novel AUV with a deflectable duct propeller is developed based on the Newton's and Euler's equation, considering the forces and moments generated by the deflectable duct propeller. And a CFD model is proposed to estimate performance of a deflectable duct propeller. The motion simulations including 2D longitudinal motions, 2D lateral motions and 3D space motions, are conducted to analyze the maneuvering performance of the novel AUV with a deflectable duct propeller, and simulation results illustrate that the novel AUV with a deflectable duct propeller has a better maneuverability than traditional propeller-rudder system.

AB We study the multiagent unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) routing problem where a set of UAVs needs to collect information via surveillance of an area of operation. Each UAV is autonomous and does not rely on a reliable communication medium to coordinate with other UAVs. We formulate the problem as a game where UAVs are players and their strategies are the different routes they can take. Our model also incorporates the useful concept of information fusion. This results in a new variant of weighted congestion-type games. We show that the price of anarchy (PoA) of the game is at most 2, irrespective of the number of UAVs and their sensor capabilities. This also validates the empirical results of earlier works. Furthermore, we identify classes of games for the existence of a pure Nash equilibrium. To the best of our knowledge, these are the first such theoretical results in the related literature. Finally, we conduct experimental studies using randomly generated instances with several multiagent UAV routing policies. Our insights are that PoA increases with the congestion level when the same number of UAVs search a smaller area or more UAVs search the same area, and on an average, our proposed policies are less than 10 worse than the centralized optimal for the problem scenarios attempted. Note to Practitioners-UAVs are becoming increasingly popular for information collection tasks in defense and civilian applications alike. When the collection area is large, it is not unusual that a fleet of UAVs is deployed. Routing of a fleet can be performed in a centralized or decentralized manner. Decentralized routing might be the only possibility when centralized situational awareness is not possible due to bandwidth limitations and centralized optimal routes for each UAV in the fleet are too complex to compute. Autonomous solutions have several other advantages, let alone simplicity. For managers of UAV systems, our work provides the first theoretical characterization of how bad could decentralized routing be. Under various scenarios of information fusion, specifically weak and strong, and the attribution of information collected to each UAV of a team, we prove that the fleet will collect at least 50 of the best-centralized solution. Empirically, we show that, in fact, the performance of the fleet is much better and generally not worse than 10 of the best-centralized solution. Hopefully, our routing strategies provide valuable guidance to the practicing engineer or manager of a UAV fleet.

AB High-resolution mapping with an autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) of a section of the San Clemente fault, offshore Southern California, reveals the largest documented cold-seep-associated barite deposits discovered to date. Although barite deposits along this fault, north of the mapped area, have been observed and sampled before in submersible dives, this study reveals massive newly found outcrops. The high-resolution surveys resolve their small-scale morphology, their large geographical extent and the structural controls on their emplacement. Detailed bathymetry (1 m x 1 m x 0.25 m grid resolution) of a similar to 12 km(2) area, ranging in water depths between 962 and 1,300 m and intersected by the fault, exhibits quasi-circular mounds of 10-30 m planar dimensions rising up to 11 m above the surrounding seafloor on a 30-45 m high and at least 1,100 m long ridge, and along truncated strata, but not along the main fault strand. Observations from a remotely operated vehicle (ROV) show that the mounds consist of steep sided dark-varnished blocks of barite. Active barite precipitation occurs as white friable spires emerging from the older deposits and as white porous precipitates filling fissures. Upward thinning spires and microbial mat occurrences atop the spires are consistent with aggradational growth due to precipitation from upward flowing solutions. Live Lamellibrachia tubeworms are found in association with the fissure-filling barite precipitates. Mapping surveys were also conducted along a short section of the San Clemente fault south of the Navy Fan. In addition, a 9 km(2) area along the San Diego Trough Fault south of the United States-Mexico border was mapped and visited in an ROV dive. In the three mapped regions sub-bottom chirp profiles indicate that often barite precipitation occurs where strata, truncated and uplifted by the fault, has thin or no sediment drape, allowing for Ba-rich solutions, that may have ascended through the main fault zone, to flow along bedding planes and mix with seawater sulfate at the seafloor interface. Despite the massive scale of the barite mounds, they are not resolvable in surface ship multibeam-generated bathymetry (25 m grid resolution). As only a few areas have been mapped at the high-resolution employed in this study, the full extent of these deposits along the San Clemente Fault and other faults remains unknown.

ID AUTONOMOUS UNDERWATER VEHICLES; ROUTING PROBLEM
AB Unmanned underwater vehicle (UUV) is commonly utilized for ocean resource exploration. To effectively plan long-term tasks, it is crucial to consider energy usage and task quality. This paper proposes a multi-objective bilevel task planning strategy (MOBTPS) for solving an UUV dispatched to visit a set of targets. On the one hand, rapid initialization screening method based on task quality is adopted. On the other hand, to address the challenge of black-box optimization for UUV task time, a nested optimization approach is employed. The upper level of optimization focuses on determining the shortest access order for the tasks, while the lower level optimizes the route between the task points. The Simulated Annealing (SA) and Genetic Algorithm (GA) are selected for simultaneous optimization of task assignment and path planning. In order to adapt to varying ocean currents, an UUV control strategy is incorporated into the path planning process. The optimal solution is obtained by using the criteria importance through intercriteria correlation (CRITIC) method. The effectiveness of MOBTPS is demonstrated through extensive numerical simulations.

AB Recent studies on the network of multi-vehicle systems have shown that the system performance can be improved comprehensively by actively using historical information without changing the network connectivity. Motivated by this observation, we aim to improve the performance of affine formation maneuver control using historical velocity command (HVC) and fill the gap between theoretical studies and practical implementations. The main contributions include the three aspects: 1) We explore the potential value of HVC in affine formation control and discover that HVC effectively enhances the system performance; 2) We thoroughly assess the impact of HVC on the system, and prove an easy-to-test stability condition. Additionally, we provide an explicit inequality on the relationship between the delay parameter and ultimate bounds of tracking errors to guide performance tuning; 3) A systematic control solution is provided for the coordinated formation maneuver of a swarm of two-wheel differential robots (TWDRs), and simulation and experimental case studies are performed on 9 TWDRs to verify the results of a stability condition and comprehensive performance improvement.

AB The ability to predict future structure features of environments based on past perception information is extremely needed by autonomous vehicles, which helps to make the following decision-making and path planning more reasonable. Recently, point cloud prediction (PCP) is utilized to predict and describe future environmental structures by the point cloud form. In this letter, we propose a novel efficient Transformer-based network to predict the future LiDAR point clouds exploiting the past point cloud sequences. We also design a semantic auxiliary training strategy to make the predicted LiDAR point cloud sequence semantically similar to the ground truth and thus improves the significance of the deployment for more tasks in real-vehicle applications. Our approach is completely self-supervised, which means it does not require any manual labeling and has a solid generalization ability toward different environments. The experimental results show that our method outperforms the state-of-the-art PCP methods on the prediction results and semantic similarity, and has a good real-time performance.

AB AI-based lane detection algorithms were actively studied over the last few years. Many have demonstrated superior performance compared with traditional feature-based methods. However, most methods remain riddled with assumptions and limitations, still not good enough for safe and reliable driving in the real world. In this paper, we propose a novel lane detection system, called Scene Understanding Physics-Enhanced Real-time (SUPER) algorithm. The proposed method consists of two main modules: 1) a hierarchical semantic segmentation network as the scene feature extractor and 2) a physics enhanced multi-lane parameter optimization module for lane inference. We train the proposed system using heterogeneous data from Cityscapes, Vistas and Apollo, and evaluate the performance on four completely separate datasets (that were never seen before), including Tusimple, Caltech, URBAN KITTI-ROAD, and Mcity-3000. The proposed approach performs the same or better than lane detection models already trained on the same dataset, and performs well even on datasets that was never trained on. Real-world vehicle tests were also conducted. Preliminary test results show promising real-time lane-detection performance compared with the Mobileye.

AB We introduce an online video-based virtual sensor allowing to automatically estimate and forecast the number of vehicles passing through a road section over a continuous time interval. The strategy consists, in the first place, in defining a Motion Intensity Index (MII) whose role is to quantify the visual activity in a traffic video. A wavelet-based cause-and-effect statistical model is then used to match the actual number of vehicles to their respective motion scores. This leads to an efficient estimator of the urban traffic flow. The implementation is well optimized in such a way that the local sampling rate is directly proportional to the amount of visual activity in localized sub-shot units of the video. The procedure allows designing an autonomous sensor giving every moment a measure of the flow on a road section and an expectation of its future levels. The device can be very useful for optimizing transportation management, facilitating strategic decision-making, and analyzing networks with the purpose of optimizing transportation equipment efficiency.

TI Self-Supervised Sensor Learning and Its Application: Building 3D
   Semantic Maps Using Terrain Classification
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF DISTRIBUTED SENSOR NETWORKS
LA English
DT Article
AB An autonomous robot in an outdoor environment needs to recognize the surrounding environment to move to a desired location safely; that is, amap is needed to classify/perceive the terrain. This paper proposes a method that enables a robot to classify a terrain in various outdoor environments using terrain information that it recognizes without the assistance of a user; then, it creates a three-dimensional (3D) semantic map. The proposed self-supervised learning system stores data on the appearance of the ground data using image features extracted by observing the movement of humans and vehicles while the robot is stopped. It learns about the surrounding environment using a support vector machine with the stored data, which is divided into terrains where people or vehicles have moved and other regions. This makes it possible to learn which terrain an object can travel on using a self-supervised learning and image-processing methods. Then the robot can recognize the current environment and simultaneously build a 3D map using the RGB-D iterative closest point algorithm with a RGB-D sensor (Kinect). To complete the 3D semantic map, it adds semantic terrain information to the map.

AB In this paper, we consider the safety control problem for hidden mode hybrid systems (HMHSs), which are a special class of hybrid automata in which the mode is not available for control. For these systems, safety control is a problem with imperfect state information. We tackle this problem by introducing the notion of nondeterministic discrete information state and by translating the problem to one with perfect state information. The perfect state information control problem is obtained by constructing a new hybrid automaton, whose discrete state is an estimate of the HMHS mode and is, as such, available for control. This problem is solved by computing the capture set and the least restrictive control map for the new hybrid automaton. Sufficient conditions for the termination of the algorithm that computes the capture set are provided. Finally, we show that the solved perfect state information control problem is equivalent to the original problem with imperfect state information under suitable assumptions. We illustrate the application of the proposed technique to a collision avoidance problem between an autonomous vehicle and a human driven vehicle at a traffic intersection.

AB The growing need for deep-sea biological research and environmental monitoring has expanded the demand for benthic landers. Compared with remotely operated vehicles (ROVs) and autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs), benthic landers can reduce overall operation cost and also possess longer endurance. Configuring a suitable descent velocity is important for benthic lander designs, helping them avoid retrieval failure and improve sea trial efficiencies. In this study, an effective scheme for the configuration and optimization of a self-developed benthic lander was outlined. First, the structural characteristics of the benthic lander were analyzed, and then a dynamic model was established. Second, the hydrodynamic coefficients of the benthic lander during its descent process were calculated using computational fluid dynamics (CFD) methods. Third, the MATLAB Simulink simulation environment was used to solve the dynamic model, and then the multi-objective optimization algorithm was introduced for the optimization design. Finally, the model was validated based on sea trial data, which demonstrated that the designed configuration and optimization scheme were correct and efficient. Collectively, this work provides a useful reference for the rational configuration and practical application of benthic landers.

AB Tire noise has received enormous attention for its importance in vehicle noise, vibration, and harshness (NVH) along with noise regulation. This study demonstrates a numerical prediction of the rolling tire noises considering tread composite material models in the coupled acoustic-structural finite element analysis. The viscoelastic master curves were developed for the frequency-dependent damping in the structural vibrations of the tire. It was numerically found that the tread composites with 230.4% and 1,428% larger storage (E') and loss moduli (E"), respectively, resulted in 1.16-9.79% louder structure-borne noises. Moreover, the elastic modulus (E) of the tread composites was proportionally related to the tire noises, suggesting that reduced elastic and viscoelastic moduli are desired for low-noise tires. This study can contribute to thoroughly understanding how the composite material properties, particularly viscoelasticity, can be designed to control structural noise and vibration in next-generation structures such as autonomous electric vehicles and urban air mobility.

AB Intelligent transportation systems, or ITS for short, includes a variety of services and applications such as road traffic management, traveler information systems, public transit system management, and autonomous vehicles, to name a few. ITS are expected to be an integral part of urban planning and future smart cities, contributing to improved road and traffic safety, transportation and transit efficiency, as well as to increased energy efficiency and reduced environmental pollution. On the other hand, ITS pose a variety of challenges due to its scalability and diverse quality-of-service needs, as well as the massive amounts of data it will generate. In this survey, we explore the use of machine learning (ML), which has recently gained significant traction, to enable ITS. We provide a thorough survey of the current state-of-the-art of how ML technology has been applied to a broad range of ITS applications and services, such as cooperative driving and road hazard warning, and identify future directions for how ITS can further use and benefit from ML technology.

AB As a part of the AMADEE-18 analog Mars mission, designed to study challenges associated with human-based exploration of the Red Planet, we focused our team efforts on testing means to localize an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) on Mars. Robot helicopters, such as the one selected for a technology demonstration as a part of NASA's Mars 2020 mission, are small and their performance is computationally limited. An essential aspect of navigation and path planning of an autonomous helicopter is accurate localization of the robot. In the absence of a global positioning system, a computationally efficient localization technology that can be applied on Mars is visual-inertial odometry (VIO). The AMADEE-18 mission provided an opportunity to test the feasibility of a state-of-the-art VIO algorithm and the camera in a Mars-like analog environment. The flight datasets included different terrain structures that challenged the functionality of VIO algorithms. The experiment has yielded valuable insights into the desired surface structure, texture, and mission times for surface relative navigation of UAV on Mars.

AB This paper presents an autonomous landing control approach for a quadrotor unmanned aerial vehicle subject to wind disturbance and three-dimensional movements of the landing platform. To achieve an accurate relative position estimation of the quadrotor to the landing platform, a camera, a distance sensor, and a single-board computer are integrated to the quadrotor. The coordinate transformation is introduced to deal with the constraint that only the relative position information is available. The impacts of unknown ship motions are treated as part of the lumped uncertainty terms. Then, the uncertainty and disturbance estimator-based controllers are developed to achieve the accurate relative position control of the quadrotor while dealing with unknown ship motions, ground effect, state couplings, and external disturbances. The uncertainty and disturbance estimator filter is designed based on the internal model principle to enhance the performance of the developed controller. The reference model of the relative altitude controller is modified to ensure the accurate tracking of descending commands. To maximize the capability of the developed controller, a parameter selection guideline based on the derived ship heave acceleration spectrum is provided. Both numerical simulations and flight experiments are carried out to demonstrate the effectiveness of the developed approach.

AB This paper contributes an extensive review of the history from the former robotics to the present providing a particular emphasis on innovative technical contents of robotic exploration vehicles. To this end, a comprehensive study with a representative collection of 100 mobile robots along the history was performed for which a robot's statistical profile was obtained considering aspects such as weight, size, number of wheels, and speed of movement. In addition, an exhaustive bibliometric analysis has been conducted over 8120 contributions between 1963 and 2015. The study on the scientific literature found that, thought mobile robotics is a research field being displaced by other disciplines of higher scientific return (e.g., humanoid robots, unmanned aircraft systems or intelligent autonomous vehicles), it is nevertheless confirmed the continuity of mobile robotics with the aim of developing advanced science at the expense of forthcoming space exploration missions. Therefore, this paper attempts to address what is the current state-of-the-art and what are the future challenges set in mobile robotics. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB During their task accomplishment, autonomous unmanned aerial vehicles are facing more and more threats coming from both ground and air. In such adversarial environments, with no a priori information about the threats, a flying robot in charge with surveilling a specified 3D sector must perform its tasks by evolving on misleading and unpredictable trajectories to cope with enemy entities. In our view, the chaotic dynamics can be the cornerstone in designing unpredictable paths for such missions, even though this solution was not exploited until now by researchers in the 3D context. This paper addresses the flight path-planning issue for surveilling a given volume in adversarial conditions by proposing a proficient approach that uses the chaotic behaviour exhibited by the 3D Arnold's cat map. By knowing the exact location of the volume under surveillance before take-off, the flying robot will generate the successive chaotic waypoints only with onboard resources, in an efficient manner. The method is validated by simulation in a realistic scenario using a detailed Simulink model for the X-4 Flyer quadcopter.

ID OPTICAL-FLOW; PERCEPTION
AB Autonomous vehicles could benefit greatly from visual-motion sensors of sufficiently low cost that 10 or 20 of them could be distributed around the vehicle's periphery. Conventional arrangements with CCD cameras, framestores and computers are too expensive. A design is outlined here that builds on well-known schemes using gratings. The grating principle is illustrated by the fact that a man with a torch, walking at night behind a railing, seems to flash. The frequency of flashing is proportional to his velocity. A major drawback is that backward and forward motion are not distinguished.
   The key development here is the use of commutation as a means of modulating the grating output signal. This is equivalent, in the illustration above, to simulating stroboscopic motion of the railing. Thus, when the man is stationary, there is flashing at a resting frequency. When he moves one way the frequency increases, and for motion the opposite way, frequency decreases.
   Results from an analogue implementation of the visual motion transducer are presented. The current transducer measures translational motion across the grating. The design is also shown to be capable of extension to direct measurement of the divergence and curl of the flow field.

AB This letter proposes an analytical framework to evaluate the coverage performance of a cellular-connected unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) network in which UAV user equipments (UAV-UEs) are equipped with directional antennas and move according to a three-dimensional (3D) mobility model. The ground base stations (GBSs) equipped with practical down-tilted antennas are distributed according to a Poisson point process (PPP). With tools from stochastic geometry, we derive the handover probability and coverage probability of a random UAV-UE under the strongest average received signal strength (RSS) association strategy. The proposed analytical framework allows to investigate the effect of UAV-UE antenna beamwidth, mobility speed, cell association, and vertical motions on both the handover probability and coverage probability. We conclude that the optimal UAV-UE antenna beamwidth decreases with the GBS density, and the omnidirectional antenna model is preferred in the sparse network scenario. What's more, the superiority of the strongest average RSS association over the nearest association diminishes with the increment of GBS density.

ID COMMUNICATION
AB An unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) is employed to sequentially visit the specific waypoints and provide offloading services for nearby devices. Most of the current works optimized the UAV-enabled offloading according to a single criterion while neglecting necessary optimizations and constraints for flight safety of the UAV. This motivates us to study the optimization problem of the UAV from a multi-objective viewpoint by considering the UAV's flight safety. A constrained multi-objective optimization problem (CMOP) involving two objective functions about the energy-efficient offloading and safe path planning is formulated for the UAV. To solve the formulated CMOP, we present a constrained decomposition-based multi-objective evolution algorithm. To further improve the algorithm, we particularly utilize the infeasible individuals with great objective values, which provide useful information for improving the optimized objective values during the evolution process. Finally, experimental results demonstrate that compared with the existing works, our scheme is beneficial to simultaneously reduce energy consumption and ensure safe flight for the UAV.

AB Due to their ubiquity and long-term stability, pole-like objects are well suited to serve as landmarks for vehicle localization in urban environments. In this work, we present a complete mapping and long-term localization system based on pole landmarks extracted from 3-D lidar data. Our approach features a novel pole detector, a mapping module, and an online localization module, each of which are described in detail, and for which we provide an open-source implementation (Schaefer and Buscher, 0000). In extensive experiments, we demonstrate that our method improves on the state of the art with respect to long-term reliability and accuracy: First, we prove reliability by tasking the system with localizing a mobile robot over the course of 15 months in an urban area based on an initial map, confronting it with constantly varying routes, differing weather conditions, seasonal changes, and construction sites. Second, we show that the proposed approach clearly outperforms a recently published method in terms of accuracy. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Vehicular ad hoc networks (VANETs) have recently gained a lot of interest. This is due to their capacity to improve driving safety and traffic management. VANET is designed to provide emerging applications and services to drivers in vehicular environments. On the one hand, the rapid advancement of automobile industry enables the development of vehicles with various forms of onboard computation facilities, storage, communication and sensing resources. On the other hand, the application of cloud computing (CC) affects several domains, including the transportation domain, therefore the emergence of vehicular cloud computing (VCC). VCC is an efficient technology to move VANET toward autonomous driving, vehicle control, and intelligent systems. Security and privacy issues are among the major concerns that should be addressed in the context of VCC. However, the special characteristics of VCC have made the security used in classical VANET and CC to be revised. To the best of our knowledge, there is a lack of security surveys for VCC. This paper is an attempt to discuss the challenges faced by security for VCC and future guide to handling these challenges.

AB Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV) are able to achieve autonomous flight without drivers, and UAV has been a key tool to extract space data. Therefore, how to detect the trajectories of targets from UAV aerial image sequences is of great importance. Because local features are suitable to detect target tracking, we exploit scale-invariant feature transform (SIFT) features to describe the interesting keypoints of targets. The main innovation of this paper is to utilize Multiple hypothesis tracking (MHT) algorithm to track an object (target) in a series of image sequences. Particularly, we develop a MHT framework based on a multidimensional assignment formulation and a sliding time window policy. To obtain target tracking from UAV aerial image sequences, three steps should be done, that is, 1) Breaking each track set into tracklet at a specific time, 2) Estimating the association cost of each track set, 3) Merging trajectory fragments to a longer one iteratively. Finally, we collect several UAV aerial image sequences with different target density to construct a dataset, and experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm.

AB This paper presents a novel methodology for modeling human lane keeping control by characterizing a unique concept of elementary steering pulses, which are motor primitives in man-vehicle systems. The novelty of the paper is the introduction of elementary steering pulses that have been evidently extracted from naturalistic driving data through machine learning techniques (data-driven modeling), and are incorporated into an alternative steering control scheme. This newly proposed hybrid-open-closed-loop control scheme starts an elementary steering pulse with an open-loop steering actuation, representing real human's reflex responses triggered by human lane keeping errors, and adjusts it back with the traditional closed-loop control. This shows a significant improvement on both the stability and the matching performance to real driving events. Online measurement of the key metrics in the steering process provides a new tool for monitoring driver states, and the biofidelic steering model may provide human-like qualities for future automated lane keeping systems. Both will add to the array of tools available for achieving autonomous and semiautonomous driving systems, which greatly benefits the current vehicle industry.

ID COVER; ABUNDANCE
AB Image-based surveys of the marine benthos are being increasingly adopted as a monitoring tool for habitats and biota, particularly in mesophotic depths (-30-150 m) which are technically difficult to survey. Many modern tools for these surveys, such as remotely operated vehicles and autonomous underwater vehicles, can capture thousands of images in a single deployment. Turning this into quantitative data typically involves human annotation which is often time-consuming and costly. Percent cover of organisms is one of the most common metrics for monitoring changes in abundance, which may be attained through visual estimation, digitization, or point-count approaches. However, alternative metrics of abundance such as density (direct counts) or presence absence, as well as metrics that quantify condition (e.g., bleaching) and size-structure can also provide quantitative information for tracking change. Understanding the statistical power of different approaches is critical to designing effective image-based monitoring programs. Given the differing statistical power and time taken using different approaches, program managers need to decide where to allocate resources. Here we use benthic imagery from two long-term monitoring sites in south-eastern Australia to annotate three example morphospecies (morphologically distinct organisms) using three approaches: point-count (percent cover), full count and presence-absence within imagery. Also, we compare the performance of the point count and full count approaches for monitoring bleaching in one of our morphospecies. We use spatio-temporal models to quantify trends in the empirical data and simulations to quantify the power of these approaches to detect different levels of temporal change using different sampling efforts (either 100 or 200 images). Additionally, we examine the additional insights that size-structure information can provide for two morphospecies. We find that the full count approach provides a higher statistical power to detect change than the other approaches for our example morphospecies, including tracking bleaching status. Size-structure information can provide additional insights such as the occurrence of recruitment or mortality events or growth of individuals. We recommend that monitoring programs using benthic imagery should consider the choice of annotation approach as this is likely to impact observed temporal patterns, particularly when the focus is specific indicator species rather than total biodiversity.

ID PREDICTION
AB This study aims to address the challenge of developing accurate and efficient parking occupancy forecasting models at the city level for autonomous vehicles. Although deep learning techniques have been successfully employed to develop such models for individual parking lots, it is a resource-intensive process that requires significant amounts of time and data for each parking lot. To overcome this challenge, we propose a novel two-step clustering technique that groups parking lots based on their spatiotemporal patterns. By identifying the relevant spatial and temporal characteristics of each parking lot (parking profile) and grouping them accordingly, our approach allows for the development of accurate occupancy forecasting models for a set of parking lots, thereby reducing computational costs and improving model transferability. Our models were built and evaluated using real-time parking data. The obtained correlation rates of 86% for the spatial dimension, 96% for the temporal one, and 92% for both demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed strategy in reducing model deployment costs while improving model applicability and transfer learning across parking lots.

AB Regulating self-driving cars poses a dilemma for policy-makers. Early testing of self-driving cars on public roads is necessary to accumulate data and driving experience. While approval procedures with high safety standards could harm manufacturers' ability to innovate by delaying tests, low safety standards could put human lives at risk. This study presents an issue framing experiment that directly addresses how citizens evaluate the alleged trade-off between safety and economic competitiveness. The experiment was conducted on representative online samples of citizens in the USA, Japan, and Germany. Results show that citizens' agreement to pilot self-driving cars on public roads is significantly higher in a safety frame, even if safety is explicitly associated with a loss in competitiveness. Socio-demographic characteristics and technology attitudes affect citizens' agreement to pilot self-driving cars primarily in a competitiveness frame, while political attitudes have no impact. Finally, the results show few country differences, indicating room to harmonize self-driving cars' safety regulations internationally.

AB Leading edge tubercles (LET) is an attractive passive flow control solution that has been proved to enhance the hydrodynamic performance and efficiency of lifting surfaces adopted in many engineering areas. Nonetheless, their industrial application in control and propulsion devices of marine vehicles is still at the beginning. To move further steps ahead, a preliminary experimental campaign for a five bladed Wageningen B-screw propeller modified with three different configurations of leading edge tubercles was carried out in cavitation free conditions. In particular, the propellers were tested in open water conditions in straight and oblique flow at incidences of 10 degrees and 20 degrees, with the aim to study the effects of LET during steady and moderate unsteady conditions. The propellers are tested at two different chord Reynolds numbers in order to investigate their applicability also to small autonomous marine vehicles. The analysis proved that suitable layout of tubercles can enhance the hydrodynamic efficiency in axial symmetric flow while reducing undesired effects caused by operation in off-design.

AB In recent years, Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) technology has been widely used in power transmission line inspection. UAV operating parameters determine the quality of the acquired insulator image, which directly affects the efficiency of transmission line inspection. Regarding the inspection of ceramic insulators, this work establishes a three-dimensional (3D) model of ceramic insulators, and simulates the changes in shooting distance, angle, and height of the UAV through three geometric transformations: rotation, translation, and scaling. The influence of those three UAV operating parameters (the shooting distance, angle, and height) on the integrity of the ce-ramic insulator steel cap is studied. In the infrared zero value detection of 110kV ceramic insulators, It is found that the best setting for obtaining the maximum steel cap area is: shooting distance of 3-7 meters, shooting height of 1 meter below the center of the insulator string, and a shooting depression angle of 0 degrees. The UAV operating parameters setting method proposed in this paper will provide theoretical and practical basis for the in-depth intelligent inspection of transmission line insulators.

AB This paper presents the control modelling and synthesis using a coupled multivariable under-actuated nonlinear adaptive U-model approach for an unmanned marine robotic platform. A nonlinear marine robotics model based on the dynamic equation using the Newtonian method and derivation with respect to the kinematics equations and rigid-body mass matrixes are explained. This nonlinear marine robotics model represents the underwater thruster dynamics, marine robotics dynamics and kinematics related to the earth-fixed frame. Coupled multivariable nonlinear adaptive control synthesis using a U-model approach for the Remotely Operated Vehicle (ROV) and Unmanned Surface Vessel (USV) represent an unmanned marine robotics application. A comparison is presented for the proposed nonlinear control approach between the U-model control approach with nonlinear Fuzzy Logic Control and Sliding Mode Control for the ROV and USV platforms. The results show minimum mean square error values and tracking performance between the plant or system model with the proposed method. Lastly, robustness and stability analysis for the proposed U-Model nonlinear control approach are presented by implementing an adaptive learning rate value.

AB Localization systems play an important role in assisted navigation. Precise localization renders visually impaired people aware of ambient environments and prevents them from coming across potential hazards. The majority of visual localization algorithms, which are applied to autonomous vehicles, are not adaptable completely to the scenarios of assisted navigation. Those vehicle-based approaches are vulnerable to viewpoint, appearance and route changes (between database and query images) caused by wearable cameras of assistive devices. Facing these practical challenges, we propose Visual Localizer, which is composed of ConvNet descriptor and global optimization, to achieve robust visual localization for assisted navigation. The performance of five prevailing ConvNets are comprehensively compared, and GoogLeNet is found to feature the best performance on environmental invariance. By concatenating two compressed convolutional layers of GoogLeNet, we use only thousands of bytes to represent image efficiently. To further improve the robustness of image matching, we utilize the network flow model as a global optimization of image matching. The extensive experiments using images captured by visually impaired volunteers illustrate that the system performs well in the context of assisted navigation.

ID COUPLED OSCILLATORS; SYNCHRONIZATION; STABILIZATION; KURAMOTO; LAWS
AB Decentralized collective motion coordination is fundamental in systems as diverse as mobile sensor networks, swarm robotics, autonomous vehicles, and animal groups. In motion coordination, to conform to the discontinuous message exchange that can only be conducted at discrete-time instants, existing approaches addressing motion coordination usually perform continuous control design followed by discretization-based implementation. This two-stage strategy, however, can be problematic since discretization can harm or even destabilize the controller designed in the continuous-time domain. Inspired by pulse-based interaction in flashing fireflies and firing neurons, we propose an integrated communication and control approach for the motion coordination. The approach circumvents discretization and can guarantee the original control design performance in final implementation. Its communication only employs simple and identical pulses, which significantly reduces processing latency and communication delay compared with conventional packet-based communications. Not only can heading control be achieved in the proposed approach to coordinate the headings (orientations) of motions in a network, but also spacing control for circular motion is achievable to design the spacing between neighboring nodes (e.g., vehicles or robots).

TI Integrating Global Navigation Satellite System and Road-Marking

DT Article
AB This paper presents an accurate vehicle self-localization system for autonomous driving. The developed system integrates multiple onboard sensors, a Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) receiver, an inertial sensor, a speedometer, and an onboard monocular camera to achieve lane-level performance in an urban environment. GNSS positioning suffers from the effects of multipath and non-line-of-sight (NLOS) propagation in urban canyons. To reduce the effects of multipath and NLOS propagation, this paper proposes using an innovative differential GNSS positioning technique with the aid of a three-dimensional building map. The road marking on the road surface provides visual information for driving. Recognition of road markings could be a way for localization when the position of the road marking is available. This research used the recognition of lane markings and stop-line markings to reduce further the positioning error. The multiple-lane detection was developed for improving the positioning error along the lateral direction. Stop-line recognition was used for optimizing the longitudinal position around intersections. The developed system was tested in an urban environment. Results demonstrate that the proposed method can provide submeter accuracy with respect to the positioning error mean and a 95% correct lane rate.

AB Predicting the future actions of multiple pedestrians is an essential feature for autonomous robots co-working in human crowded-environments. Estimating the unknown future path is a challenging problem due to the complex interactions occurring among pedestrians. Although recent developments in Graph Convolutional Network (GCN) allow for efficient encoding of such complex interactions, the encoded representations still lack the informative factors necessary to accurately predict their future behavior. To solve this, we introduce Disentangled GCN (DGCN) which aims to better capture the crowd interactions by decoupling the spatial and temporal factors. More specifically, we propose to encode the crowd interactions with two low-dimensional latent spaces: spatial latent and temporal latent. We propose a novel regularizer function to train these latents in an unsupervised manner and condition the trajectory prediction on the learned latents using a spatially aware graph decoder. The proposed method is evaluated extensively on publicly available datasets consisting of pedestrians and vehicles. Our method improves mADE on ETH/UCY pedestrians dataset and achieves new state-of-the-art mFDE results on nuScenes vehicle datasets.

AB In this paper, the fixed-time event-triggered obstacle avoidance consensus control for a multi-AUV time-varying formation system in a 3D environment is presented by using an improved artificial potential field and leader-follower strategy (IAPF-LF). Firstly, the proposed fixed-time control can achieve the desired multi-AUV formation within a fixed settling time in any initial system state. Secondly, an event-triggered communication strategy is developed to govern the communication among AUVs, and the communication energy consumption can be decremented. The time-varying formation obstacle avoidance control algorithm based on IAPF-LF is designed to avoid static and dynamic obstacles, the desired formation is maintained in the presence of external disturbances, and there is no Zeno behavior under the fixed-time event-triggered consensus control strategy. The stability of the system is proved by the Lyapunov function and inequality scaling. Finally, simulation examples and water pool experiments are reported to verify the performance of the proposed theoretical algorithms.

AB UAVs can be used as aerial relays to provide communication services in remote uncovered areas or dense environments with occasional high capacity demands. However, due to the low power of Internet-of-Things (IoT) devices, UAV-based IoT applications, such as precision agriculture and environment monitoring, may experience high shadowing or equipment failure, which degrades the communications' quality between IoT devices and their gateways. To tackle this issue, we consider the long range (LoRa) communication technology. Specifically, we investigate the performance of LoRA-enabled aerial communications, where a LoRa gateway communicates with a distant IoT device through the assistance of an amplify-and-forward (AF) aerial relay. Under the assumption of shadowed Rician fading channels, we characterize at first the end-to-end LoRa communication link. Then, we derive an exact symbol error rate expression for the underlying system model. Finally, numerical results are presented to corroborate the efficacy of our derived expressions and provide valuable insights into the error performance of LoRa-enabled aerial networks.

AB This paper addresses the path-tracking performance improvement of unmanned surface vessels (USVs) through a novel adaptive immersion and invariance (I&I) based robust adaptive control algorithm. The substantial drawback related to the control of USVs is the uncertain dynamics of the vessel, and unexpected environmental disturbances due to surges or crosswinds that promote the instability. The asymptotic stability of the closed-loop USV system is guaranteed based on the I&I stability theory, and the adaptation laws for the uncertain parameters are derived accordingly. The design variables of I&I algorithm are varied in a convex optimization problem with constraints on the control inputs. The robustness of the proposed algorithm is further assessed for the target USV subject to uncertain hydrodynamic damping in surge, sway and yaw. The performance of the proposed control algorithm is tested against benchmark schemes of disturbance observer-based composite nonlinear feedback (DO-CNF) and robust LQR (RLQR). The results are suggestive of the improved performance of the USV to follow the intended trajectory while guaranteeing optimality in the sense of actuation constraints.

AB The concept, design, and testing of an electric thruster for underwater propulsion based on the electro-osmotic principle are presented. A unique feature of the proposed electro-osmotic thruster (EOT) is the absence of dynamic components, enabling robust, stealthy operation, and the potential for application in extreme underwater conditions. Furthermore, the EOT is unaffected by magnetic fields as it does not require metallic components. In a particularly extreme environment test, a small EOT was immersed in an ultrasonic bath and demonstrated normal operation. In another test, multiple EOTs were aligned to work in parallel to increase packing efficiency. In a large-scale test the EOT successfully propelled a small 5 kg unmanned underwater vehicle (UUV) at 2.2 cm/s. This experiment was performed using a fraction of the EOT's maximum potential thrust that could be available if it were to be mounted to a large-scale autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) platform, such as a REMUS 100. The EOT described in this paper is the first underwater thruster to continue the abandoned work of magneto-hydrodynamics in finding low-wake steady-state propulsion.

AB This paper presents the mathematical modeling of flapping flight inch-size micro aerial vehicles (MAVs), namely micromechanical flying insects (MFIs). The target robotic insects are electromechanical devices propelled by a pair of independent flapping wings to achieve sustained autonomous flight, thereby mimicking real insects. In this paper, we describe the system dynamic models which include several elements that are substantially different from those present in fixed or rotary wing MAVs. These models include the wing-thorax dynamics, the flapping flight aerodynamics at a low Reynolds number regime, the body dynamics, and the biomimetic sensory system consisting of ocelli, halteres, magnetic compass, and optical flow sensors. The mathematical models are developed based on biological principles, analytical models, and experimental data. They are presented in the Virtual Insect Flight Simulator (VIFS) and are integrated together to give a realistic simulation for MFI and insect flight. VIFS is a software tool intended for modeling flapping flight mechanisms and for testing and evaluating the performance of different flight control algorithms.

ID UNMANNED AERIAL VEHICLES; CONTROLLER
AB In the last decade, the collision avoidance of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) has become increasingly important for the safe operation of UAVs. In this article, an effective conflict detection and alerting principle is firstly proposed based on mixed collision cone and alerting criterion for the collision avoidance of UAV. Second, a reactive collision avoidance and trajectory recovery strategy (RCATRS) is presented based on the model of relative kinematics. In this strategy, by acting an acceleration vector with different magnitude and direction on UAV, a horizontal collision avoidance maneuver is realized in situations of different relative position and velocity vector. When UAV has bypassed the obstacle, the horizontal trajectory recovery maneuver is initiated to make UAV to return to original flight paths. Thus, different recovery trajectories corresponding with different relative velocity vector are planned. Finally, the safety controller is designed to apply RCATRS to autonomous quadrotor. Since a few of computation is off-line, RCATRS is simple in implement and can satisfy the request of running in real time. The results of simulation show the validity of the proposed RCATRS.

AB The emergence of 5th-generation networks and the introduction of the ultra-low latency Internet, namely, tactile Internet, by the International Telecommunication Union (ITU), has opened up a wide range of applications. Extended Reality (XR), holoportation, and remote control of machines are among the ones that would revolutionize the future of factories, smart cities, and digital healthcare. Virtual Reality (VR) technology provides users with highly realistic visual and auditory experiences, enabling a high sense of immersion and embodiment in virtual environments. In the real world, however, we use more senses than only vision and hearing to perceive our surroundings. Particularly, tactile sensation is the only bidirectional modality that enables us to perceive and interact with the objects and surfaces around us. This brief introduces a real-life testbed Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV)-based system that leverages different technologies, including VR, 360(?) video streaming over 4G/5G, and edge computing to enable 6 Degrees of Freedom (6DoF) view with haptic feedback for a maximized immersion. The demonstration videos of the testbed are made publicly available on the following links: Link1 and Link2.

AB Determining the reachable set for a given nonlinear control system is crucial for system control and planning. However, computing such a set is impossible if the system's dynamics are not fully known. This article is motivated by a scenario where a system suffers an adverse event mid-operation, resulting in a substantial change to the system's dynamics, rendering them largely unknown. Our objective is to conservatively approximate the system's reachable set solely from its local dynamics at a single point and the bounds on the rate of change of its dynamics. We translate this knowledge about the system dynamics into an ordinary differential inclusion. We then derive an underapproximation of the velocities available to the system at every system state. An inclusion using this approximation can be interpreted as a control system; the trajectories of the derived control system are guaranteed to be the trajectories of the unknown system. To illustrate the practical implementation and consequences of our work, we apply our algorithm to a simplified model of an unmanned aerial vehicle.

AB Cable-suspended load carried by multiple unman-ned aerial vehicles (UAVs) has applications in many areas. However, most existing aerial load transportation works are tailored to a specific type of load transportation tasks, or assume simplified system models or transportation scenarios. Furthermore, no existing works on this topic can provide a unified framework to address multiple performance and safety constraints during the cooperative transportation operation. In this paper, we propose and investigate a new constrained cooperative control architecture for an UAV team, which are collaboratively carrying a three-dimensional load, subject to multiple user-defined time-varying performance and safety constraint requirements. A unified framework using universal barrier functions has been proposed to deal with different types of constraint requirements. Moreover, control saturation and uncertainties in UAV inertia matrices are dealt with by employing adaptive estimators. Exponential convergence on the distance and attitude tracking errors can be guaranteed by the algorithm. Lastly, we discuss a simulation example that further shows the efficacy of the proposed cooperative control framework.

AB This paper investigates a multiple unmanned aerial vehicle (multi-UAV) assisted backscatter communication network (BCN), where multiple UAVs are employed to transmit RF carriers to as well as collect data from multiple backscatter sensor nodes (BSNs) deployed on the ground. We formulate an optimization problem to maximize the max-min rate of the BCN by jointly optimizing three blocks of variables, i.e., the UAVs' trajectories, the UAVs' transmission power and the BSNs' scheduling. The BSNs' sequential energy constraints are innovatively considered in our work. However, the formulated optimization problem is difficult to be solved due to its non-convexity and combinatorial nature. To this end, we use the block coordinate descent (BCD) method and successive convex approximation (SCA) technique. Numerical results show the impact of the BSNs' sequential energy constraint on the designed UAV trajectories and verify the gain of the proposed design in the max-min rate as compared to a benchmark scheme with UAV trajectory not optimized.

AB In this work, we present the design, implementation, and testing of a guidance system for the UX-1 robot, a novel spherical underwater vehicle designed to explore and map flooded underground mines. For this purpose, it needs to navigate completely autonomously, as no communications are possible, in the 3D networks of tunnels of semistructured but unknown environments and gather various geoscientific data. First, the overall design concepts of the robot are presented. Then, the guidance system and its subsystems are explained. Finally, the system's validation and integration with the rest of the UX-1 robot systems are presented. A series of experimental tests following the software-in-the-loop and the hardware-in-the-loop paradigms have been carried out, designed to simulate as closely as possible navigation in mine tunnel environments. The results obtained in these tests demonstrate the effectiveness of the guidance system and its proper integration with the rest of the systems of the robot, and validate the abilities of the UX-1 platform to perform complex missions in flooded mine environments.

AB Underwater area exploration has always been a very important mission raised initially by military applications (e.g. mine detection) but more and more often by civil applications. To successfully conduct this exploration on large scale area, autonomous vehicle are envisaged in a near future. Existing approaches rely on a single large drone that covers mission area with a lawnmower trajectory, but a swarm of small robots may be more efficient, using a comb of paths. Unfortunately, existing swarm approaches are not well suited for an underwater environment, where communication and positioning are not efficient. This led us to propose a new algorithm that can arrange a swarm of robots in a line shape. The algorithm does not require a good communication channel and the line formation emerge from local behavior depending on an imprecise global positioning and a precise local positioning. We perform realistic simulations to test and characterize our line formation algorithm. Our work shows that the line formation algorithm is robust to perturbations and permits to envisage swarm approaches for underwater exploration as a low-cost alternative to single-drones systems.

AB This paper presents an approach where differential evolution is applied to underwater glider path planning. The objective of a glider is to reach a target location and gather research data along its path by propelling itself underwater and returning periodically to the surface. The main hypothesis of this work is that gliders operational capabilities will benefit from improved path planning, especially when dealing with opportunistic short-term missions focused on the sampling of dynamic structures. To model a glider trajectory, we evolve a global underwater glider path based on the local kinematic simulation of an underwater glider, considering the daily and hourly sea currents predictions. The global path is represented by control points where the glider is expected to resurface for communication with a satellite and to receive further navigation instructions. Some well known differential evolution instance algorithms are then assessed and compared on 12 test scenarios using the proposed approach. Finally, a real case glider vessel mission was commanded using this approach. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) can be combined with virtual reality (VR) to collect the rapidly changing physical environment by leveraging its high flexibility, so as to provide an immersive experience for metaverse users. In this letter, we study the UAV placement problem in UAV-assisted VR systems where UAVs are deployed to capture images of ground targets and then transmit them to ground users for virtual environment reconstruction. The goal is to minimize the transmission delay while satisfying the image resolution requirement. Firstly, the UAV placement problem is formulated into a non-convex optimization problem. Then, an efficient algorithm is proposed to obtain a high-quality solution by adopting the block coordinate descent and successive convex approximation techniques with low complexity. Finally, the numerical results are provided and show that considerable benefits can be obtained with a suboptimal UAV placement. Specifically, the proposed scheme can reduce the transmission delay by over 15 ms compared to the conventional scheme when the received signal-to-noise ratio at the reference distance is 10(6) and the resolution requirement is 0.5.

AB The integration of weigh-in-motion (WIM) sensors within highways or bridge structural health monitoring systems is becoming increasingly popular to ensure structural integrity and users safety. Compared to standard technologies, smart self-sensing materials and systems present a simpler sensing setup, a longer service life, and increased durability against environmental effects. Field deployment of such technologies requires characterization and design optimization for realistic scales. This paper presents a field investigation of the vehicle load-sensing capabilities of a newly developed low-cost, eco-friendly and high durability smart composite paving material. The novel contributions of the work include the design and installation of a full-scale sensing pavement section and of the sensing hardware and software using tailored low-cost electronics and a learning algorithm for vehicle load estimation. The outcomes of the research demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed system for traffic monitoring of infrastructures and WIM sensing by estimating the gross weight of passing trucks within a 20% error during an autonomous sensing period of two months.

Research in this area is getting more application oriented, expansive in scope with loci of research and innovation dispersed across academia, research institutions and industry. It is thus becoming a challenging as well as a useful exercise to know the structure and dynamics of this field. The paper is centered on this issue; it tries to capture the intellectual structure of this field and research trends from quantitative and statistical analysis of research publications. Conceptual connections are constructed from linkages among keywords using tools and techniques of Social Network Analysis which is also used in constructing the conceptual framework for the study.

AB Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) can be a powerful tool for live (interactive) remote inspection of large-scale structures or areas of interest. Instead of manual, local, and labor-intensive inspections, we envision human operators working together with networks of semi-autonomous UAVs. The current state-of-the-art for low-delay high-throughput inter-vehicle networking relies on Time-Division Multiple Access (TDMA) techniques that require accurate synchronization among all network nodes. In this paper, we propose a delay-tolerant synchronization approach that converges to the correct order of the TDMA slots implemented over COTS WiFi in a fully-distributed way and without resorting to a global clock. This highly flexible solution allows building an ad-hoc aerial network based on a backbone of relaying UAVs. We show several alternatives to achieve this synchronization in a concrete aerial network and compare them in terms of slots' overlap, throughput, and packet delivery. The results show that these alternatives lead to trade-offs in the referenced metrics. The results also provide insight into the delays caused by buffering in the protocol stack and especially in the WiFi interface.

AB We develop a technique to automatically generate a control policy for a robot moving in an environment that includes elements with unknown, randomly changing behavior. The robot is required to achieve a surveillance mission, in which a certain request needs to be serviced repeatedly, while the expected time inbetween consecutive services is minimized and additional temporal logic constraints are satisfied. We define a fragment of linear temporal logic to describe such a mission and formulate the problem as a temporal logic game. Our approach is based on two main ideas. First, we extend results in automata learning to detect patterns of the unknown behavior of the elements in the environment. Second, we employ an automata-theoretic method to generate the control policy. We show that the obtained control policy converges to an optimal one when the partially unknown behavior patterns are fully learned. In addition, we illustrate the method in an experimental setup, in which an unmanned ground vehicle, with the help of a cooperating unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV), satisfies a temporal logic requirement in a partitioned environment whose regions are controlled by barriers with unknown behavior.

AB Traffic monitoring technologies have become crucial for modern manned and autonomous vehicles. They aim to ensure the maximum level of safety and dependability. The commonly used monitoring technologies based on conventional LIDAR (laser imaging, detection, and ranging), vision and ultrasound sensors are effective if there is a clear line of sight for the surrounding traffic field. However, some potential accidents and traffic hazards beyond the line of sight cannot be detected by the aforementioned sensors. Thus, dedicated sensors require means to detect other traffic participants even if they are not visible due to obstacles. In this paper, a new traffic monitoring concept for detecting nearby traffic activities occurring beyond the line of sight is introduced. The principle is based on a portable laser Doppler vibrometer (LDV), which is mounted on the vehicle to measure the roadway's vibration noise induced by nearby traffic activities. First proof-of-concept field tests were conducted using a commercial LDV and realistic public traffic conditions. A statistical classification method based on the frequency features of pavement vibration measurements showed quite good performance for identifying traffic conditions.

AB Satellite-aerial communication (SAC) is the most necessary and reliable way to bridge the aerial terminals with their remote command and control center when terrestrial relay infrastructure is unavailable. However, as an inescapable obstacle, adjacent space interference from neighboring satellites unavoidably leads to the loss of the performance of SACs. To uncover the impacts of space interference, in this paper, a SAC system including a satellite (S), an aerial platform (D), and a space interference (I) is considered. Specifically, S operates in a circular orbit and I, which is randomly distributed in the neighboring space around S, produces a jamming signal to interfere with the information delivery between S and D. Considering the randomness of S and I and employing geometric probability theory, an approximate and asymptotic outage probabilities of the considered SAC system are studied. Moreover, the multi-interference scenario is investigated accordingly. Finally, numerical results are presented to validate our proposed analysis and some insightful conclusions are achieved to reveal the effects of spatially random space interference on SAC.

AB In a vehicular fog computing paradigm, connected autonomous vehicles are envisioned as processing nodes (i.e. fog nodes) so that end-devices may offload processing tasks to them. As such, both local and distributed processing on fog nodes will depend heavily on wireless network conditions and the current traffic demand. In this work, we investigate the trade-offs on the operation of fog nodes under different vehicle densities and network conditions and formalize a Time Constrained One-Shot Open First Price Auction for resource allocation in vehicular fog computing. Through a large-scale simulation study, we assess important aspects of the performance of fog nodes in Vehicular Fog Computing. We show that current wireless network standards may dictate the limits of processing despite the availability of processing power of fog nodes. Our results indicate the existence of trade-offs on the operation of fog nodes regarding message overhead and processing redundancy to achieve high task completion ratio. Finally, we evaluate the social welfare distribution of the task allocation achieved using the auction where higher message rates lead to higher costs.

AB Currently, car manufacturers, suppliers, and IT companies are surpassing each other with ambitious plans regarding their driving automation technology. However, even the most optimistic announcements grant that, for a certain time, a human driver cannot be replaced in all driving situations. Hence, human drivers will still be a part of future traffic by working together with automation systems. Analyzing the joint decision-making process of such a human-machine system in automated driving provides a better understanding of the resulting traffic system. In this paper, a driving simulator study with 33 participants focusing on the utility of cooperative driver-vehicle systems with the use case of highway driving is presented. Based on the study's results, a model that explains the linkage between subjective measures such as the perceived utility and objective driving data is derived. Moreover, on an individual level, models are parameterized by using driving states as predictors and the individual utility perceived in a driving situation as response. This individual utility can be used for predicting driving actions such as the initiation of overtaking maneuvers.

AB The G(2) Hermite Interpolation Problem with clothoid curves requires to find the interpolating clothoid that matches initial and final positions, tangents and curvatures, also known as G(2) Hermite data. In the paper we prove that this problem does not always admit solution with only one clothoid segment, nor with two, as some counterexamples show. The general fitting scheme herein proposed requires three arcs determined via the solution of a nonlinear system of 8 equations in 10 unknowns. We discuss how it is possible to recast this system to 2 equations and how to efficiently solve it by means of the Newton method. The choice of the clothoid is crucial because it exhibits the curvature which is linear with the arc length, an important property in many applications ranging from path planning for autonomous vehicles, road design, manufacturing and graphics. The algorithm is tested on a fine hypercube of all possible configurations of angles and curvatures. It always converges and in the worst case it requires 5 standard Newton iterations.

AB The unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV), which is prominent in its flexibility and low cost, is considered to be fully utilized in the future wireless communication system to provide flexible services and improve connectivities. In this paper, we investigate the resource allocation problem in a wireless powered UAV communication system. In this considered system, The UAV acts as hybrid access point (HAP), which can first perform wireless power transfer in the downlink and charge the Internet of Thing (IoT) user devices (UDs). The UDs can use the harvested energy to deliver the data to the UAV. In the uplink, we explicitly consider short packet communication (SPC) as the transmission feature, which adopts finite block-length codewords and suffers from rate degradation. With the objective to maximize system energy efficiency, we jointly optimize the position and transmit power of the UAV, and transmission time of each UD. To address the formulated non-convex problem, we develop efficient algorithms to find sub-optimal solutions. Extensive simulations are conducted to verify the effectiveness of the proposed scheme.

TI Vision-Based Branch Road Detection for Intersection Navigation in
   Unstructured Environment Using Multi-Task Network
SO JOURNAL OF ADVANCED TRANSPORTATION
LA English
DT Article
AB Autonomous vehicles need a driving method to be less dependent on localization data to navigate intersections in unstructured environments because these data may not be accurate in such environments. Methods of distinguishing branch roads existing at intersections using vision and applying them to intersection navigation have been studied. Model-based detection methods recognize patterns of the branch roads, but are sensitive to sensor noise and difficult to apply to various complex situations. Therefore, this study proposes a method for detecting the branch roads at the intersection using deep learning. The proposed multi-task deep neural network distinguishes the branch road into a shape of rotated bounding boxes and also recognizes the drivable area to consider obstacles inside the box. Through the output of the network, an occupancy grid map consisting of one branch road at an intersection is obtained, which can be used as an input to the existing motion-planning algorithms that do not consider intersections. Experiments in real environments show that the proposed method detected the branch roads more accurately than the model-based detection method, and the vehicle drove safely at the intersection.

AB Flying ad-hoc networks (FANET) are one of the most important branches of wireless ad-hoc networks, consisting of multiple unmanned air vehicles (UAVs) performing assigned tasks and communicating with each other. Nowadays FANETs are being used for commercial and civilian applications such as handling traffic congestion, remote data collection, remote sensing, network relaying, and delivering products. However, there are some major challenges, such as adaptive routing protocols, flight trajectory selection, energy limitations, charging, and autonomous deployment that need to be addressed in FANETs. Several researchers have been working for the last few years to resolve these problems. The main obstacles are the high mobility and unpredictable changes in the topology of FANETs. Hence, many researchers have introduced reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms in FANETs to overcome these shortcomings. In this study, we comprehensively surveyed and qualitatively compared the applications of RL in different scenarios of FANETs such as routing protocol, flight trajectory selection, relaying, and charging. We also discuss open research issues that can provide researchers with clear and direct insights for further research.

   multi-tasking strategy
AB Aerial transportation and manipulation have attracted increasing attention in the unmanned aerial vehicle field, and visual servoing methodology is widely used to achieve the autonomous aerial grasping of a target object. However, the existing marker-based solutions pose a challenge to the practical application of target grasping owing to the difficulty in attaching markers on targets. To address this problem, this study proposes a novel image-based visual servoing controller based on natural features instead of artificial markers. The natural features are extracted from the target images and further processed to provide servoing feature points. A six degree-of-freedom (6-DoF) aerial manipulator system is proposed with differential kinematics deduced to achieve aerial grasping. Furthermore, a controller is designed when the target object is outside a manipulator's workspace by utilizing both the degrees-of-freedom of unmanned aerial vehicle and manipulator joints. Thereafter, a weight matrix is used as basis to develop a multi-tasking visual servoing framework to integrate the controllers inside and outside the manipulator's workspace. Lastly, experimental results are provided to verify the effectiveness of the proposed approach.

AB Over the past decade, major progress in diagnosis of battery degradation has had a substantial effect on the development of electric vehicles. However, despite recent advances, most studies suffer from fatal flaws in how the data are processed caused by discrete sampling levels and associated noise, requiring smoothing algorithms that are not reliable or reproducible. We report the realization of an accurate and reproducible approach, as "Level Evaluation ANalysis" or LEAN method, to diagnose the battery degradation based on counting the number of points at each sampling level, of which the accuracy and reproducibility is proven by mathematical arguments. Its reliability is verified to be consistent with previously published data from four laboratories around the world. The simple code, exact fitting, consistent outcome, computational availability and reliability make the LEAN method promising for vehicular application in both the big data analysis on the cloud and the online battery monitoring, supporting the intelligent management of power sources for autonomous vehicles.

AB Underwater glider platform represents the maturing technology with a large cost saving over current underwater sampling process. It can survey and monitor the sea environment cost-effective manner combining survey capabilities, simultaneous water sampling and environmental data gathering capacities. It can perform a wide range of fully automated monitoring data measurement over an extended period of time. This paper will focus on the design of multivariable underactuated nonlinear adaptive control using U-model methodologies. Underwater glider control, modelling and identification approach was reviewed in order to formulate the design, development and control approach of underwater glider development using multivariable adaptive U-model nonlinear control approach. U-model methodology simplifies the control synthesis with the influence of the uncertainties and external disturbances by selecting appropriate control structures. Most of the autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) neglected the coupling effect of the dynamics during process modelling while U-model enables to include the coupling effect using the inverse Jacobian matrix. U-model incorporated with RBFNN enhance the adaptive nonlinear control synthesis. Thus contributes towards the underactuated nonlinear adaptive control development and process modelling.

AB How do we self-localize large teams of underwater nodes using only noisy range measurements? How do we do it in a distributed way, and incorporating dynamics into the problem? How do we reject outliers and produce trustworthy position estimates? And what if some of the vehicles can measure angular information? The stringent acoustic communication constraints and accuracy needs of our geophysical survey application demand fast and very accurate localization methods. We address dynamic localization as a MAP estimation problem where the prior encodes kinematic information, and we apply a convex relaxation method that takes advantage of previous estimates at each measurement acquisition step. The resulting LocDyn algorithm is fast: It converges at an optimal rate for first order methods. LocDyn is distributed: There is no fusion center responsible for processing acquired data and the same simple computations are performed at each node. LocDyn is accurate: Numerical experiments attest to about 30% smaller positioning error than a comparable Kalman filter. LocDyn is robust: It rejects outlier noise, while benchmarking methods succumb in terms of positioning error.

Both data sets are automatically merged using the time stamp data as an index. Using geographical information software (GIS), conductivity maps of increased data density are produced on-site. The mobile surveying system increased total conductivity sampling rate by a factor of >100, and increased data density by a factor of >10 over a conventional manual survey method when operating over a 1-ha open test site. For open fields that can be easily traversed with a utility vehicle, the mobile surveying system was found to greatly enhance data quality by increasing data density, and to dramatically increase both data acquisition efficiency and data post-processing speeds.

TI Moving Object Segmentation in 3D LiDAR Data: A Learning-Based Approach
   Exploiting Sequential Data
SO IEEE ROBOTICS AND AUTOMATION LETTERS

DT Article
DE SLAM; deep learning methods
AB The ability to detect and segment moving objects in a scene is essential for building consistent maps, making future state predictions, avoiding collisions, and planning. In this letter, we address the problem of moving object segmentation from 3D LiDAR scans. We propose a novel approach that pushes the current state of the art in LiDAR-only moving object segmentation forward to provide relevant information for autonomous robots and other vehicles. Instead of segmenting the point cloud semantically, i.e., predicting the semantic classes such as vehicles, pedestrians, roads, etc., our approach accurately segments the scene into moving and static objects, i.e., also distinguishing between moving cars vs. parked cars. Our proposed approach exploits sequential range images from a rotating 3D LiDAR sensor as an intermediate representation combined with a convolutional neural network and runs faster than the frame rate of the sensor. We compare our approach to several other state-of-the-art methods showing superior segmentation quality in urban environments. Additionally, we created a new benchmark for LiDAR-based moving object segmentation based on SemanticKITTI. We published it to allow other researchers to compare their approaches transparently and we furthermore published our code.

AB This paper presents a method to simultaneously compute optimal simulator motions and simulator parameters for a predefined set of vehicle motions. The optimization can be performed with a model of human motion perception or sensory dynamics taken into account. The simulator dynamics, sensory dynamics, and optimality criterion are provided by the user. The dynamical models are defined by implicit index-1 differential-algebraic equations (DAE). The direct collocation method is used to find the numerical solution of the optimization problem. The possible applications of the method include calculating optimal simulator motion for scenarios when the future motion is perfectly known (e.g., comfort studies with autonomous vehicles), optimizing simulafordesiin, and evaluating the maximum possible cueing fidelity for a given simulator. To demonstrate the method, we calculated optimal trajectories for a set of typical car maneuvers for the CyberMotion Simulator at the Max-Planck Institute for Biological Cybernetics. We also optimize the configurable cabin position of the simulator and assess the corresponding motion fidelity improvement. The software implementation of the method is publicly available.

ID STEERING MODEL
AB Learning-based methods have gained increasing attention in the intelligent vehicle community for developing highly autonomous vehicles and advanced driving assistance systems (ADAS). However, traditional offline learning methods lack the ability to adapt to individual driving behavior. To overcome this limitation, a combined learning framework (CLF) based on the Natural Actor Critic (NAC) learning and general regression neural network (GRNN) is developed in this paper. GRNN can be trained offline based on the historical data, while NAC is carried out online. In this way, the general behavior learned by the offline module can be reused and adjusted by the online module to capture the driver-specific behavior. Driving data collected from human drivers through a driving simulator are used to test the proposed learning framework. The complex overtaking behavior is selected to formulate the learning problem and test scenarios. Experimental results show that the proposed system performs well on learning driver-specific behavior for overtaking, and compared with the Gaussian mixture model-maximum-a-posterior method, CLF shows a more flexible performance when newly-involved drivers are considered.

DE Entry; Guidance; Predictor-corrector; Fuzzy logic; Drag acceleration
AB With the development of aerospace industry, the guidance system of an entry vehicle becomes more robust, reliable and autonomous. Based on fuzzy logic, a predictor corrector guidance law is proposed in this paper, where the trajectory prediction is realized by numerical integration. The correction system consists of two fuzzy controllers, which correct longitudinal motion and lateral motion synergistically. A drag acceleration profile is designed through interpolating between upper drag boundary and lower drag boundary, which is corrected continually to eliminate the range error. Attack angle, a secondary control variable in the paper, is used to eliminate the altitude error. In addition, the lateral error is removed by regulating the reversal time of bank angle. Compared with the traditional guidance laws, the method in this paper not only can correct synergistically the longitudinal motion and lateral motion of the vehicle, but also can easily cope with the flight constraints using interpolated drag acceleration profile. Moreover, in a correction cycle, the method designed in this paper only needs a single trajectory prediction, which reduces the on-board computation. The guidance law demonstrates a high precision and robustness in the simulation scenario. (C) 2017 Elsevier Masson SAS. All rights reserved.

AB By taking a hypersonic vehicle as the research object, the simulation method of starlight transmission in hypersonic conditions is established to qualitatively and quantitatively research the platform aero-optical effects on starlight navigation, and to provide a theoretical basis for the extended application of the starlight autonomous navigation. At first, based on Reynolds average, the k-omega/SST two-equation turbulence model is used to calculate the density distribution of external flow field when the star sensor is installed at different locations in the vehicle (head, middle and tail), and then the spatial refractive index distribution of the flow field is obtained. On this basis, we use the geometrical optics method and physical optics method to calculate the optical path difference, the point spread function, the image offset and such optical transmission effects caused by the laminar flow field, and then obtain a laminar flow diagram to lower clarity. At the mean time, we calculate wavefront distortion, density, standard deviation, variance and other optical phase-transfer effects of turbulent flow field by using statistical theory optical, and obtain a turbulent flow diagram to lower clarity.

Presents the results of the investigations carried out for the Brite Euram Thematic Network on climbing and walking robots where most of the countries in the European Community have been considered in the studies. Reports a major finding that mobile robots have an enormous potential for commercial exploitation but same fundamental problems need to be solved first; these concern improvements in sensors, actuators and powering technologies. Argues that the robots of the future also need to have strong autonomous capabilities, must be able to self-learn as well as be reliable for continuous operation. Identifies modularity as a key feature requiring careful attention so that the future machines can be easily and rapidly prototyped for new applications.

AB Human-machine shared control of intelligent vehicles is considered an important technology during the industrial application of autonomous driving systems. Among the engineering practices in driver assistance systems, shared steering control is one of the important applications for the human-machine interaction. However, how to deal with human-machine conflicts during emergency scenarios is the main challenge for the controller's design. Most shared control approaches usually generate machine-oriented results without enough attention to the driver's reaction. By taking the human driver and machine system as two intelligent agents, this paper proposes a game based control scheme to achieve a dynamic authority allocation during the lane changing maneuver. Based on the modeling of predicted trajectories of the human driver, a human-intention-based shared steering control is designed to achieve dynamic Nash game equilibrium. Moreover, a human-oriented shared steering mechanism is employed to not only benefit from automated machine assistance, but also make full play of human contributions. Using quantitative comparative analysis in lane changing scenarios with different human-machine conflicts, a better performance by considering both driving comfort and safety is achieved.

ID COLLISION-AVOIDANCE; ROBOT; NAVIGATION; SUBJECT
AB We consider the problem of multi-robot path planning in a complex, cluttered environment with the aim of reducing overall congestion in the environment, while avoiding any inter-robot communication or coordination. Such limitations may exist due to lack of communication or due to privacy restrictions (for example, autonomous vehicles may not want to share their locations or intents with other vehicles or even to a central server). The key insight that allows us to solve this problem is to stochastically distribute the robots across different routes in the environment by assigning them paths in different topologically distinct classes, so as to lower congestion and the overall travel time for all robots in the environment. We outline the computation of topologically distinct paths in a spatio-temporal configuration space and propose methods for the stochastic assignment of paths to the robots. A fast replanning algorithm and a potential field based controller allow robots to avoid collision with nearby agents while following the assigned path. Our simulation and experiment results show a significant advantage over shortest path following under such a coordination-free setup.

AB This paper studies battery of battery charging station (BSS) orderly swapping, efficient battery management and reasonable battery allocation. Firstly, based on a user-centered perspective, this paper first establishes the user adaptive response model according to the battery state of health (SOH) and state of charge (SOC) after battery allocation to realize the user autonomous decision-making. Secondly, the battery exchange priority function is established for the ordered exchange of BSS and EV batteries during the battery exchange process. Thirdly, the batteries in the BSS are divided into three battery libraries to be managed according to the difference of battery SOH so that the batteries are accurately and efficiently allocated to the power system and EV services. Finally, BSS transfers excess electricity to the power system through battery to grid (B2G) technology as regulating energy, increasing the flexibility of the power system. Through the analysis of the optimization model, the results show that compared with the random distribution of batteries, the model not only increases the benefits of BSS, but also ensures the distribution of each battery is rapid, accurate and reasonable, realizing the rational use of batteries.

ID ALGORITHM
AB Pollination using Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) has emerged as a promising solution to the current pollination crisis. The dwindling number of natural pollinators forces the production of cutting-edge pollination technologies. This work proposes a module to optimize path planning for UAVs to travel in a minimum time. This study suggests a novel approach to maximize cross-pollination and minimize travel time with a highly efficient meta-heuristic optimization algorithm. This paper briefly describes a process we previously developed for flower insights that includes flower gender and gene identification and classification. With an insight into flowers, the proposed algorithm aims to achieve efficient and accurate pollination while minimizing energy consumption and convergence time. The Versatile Flower Pollination Algorithm's (VFPA) approach is superior because it significantly reduces the amount of computing required while maintaining almost optimal performance. The proposed algorithm was successfully implemented to compute the distance between the male and female flowers and transfer nectar with a difference in the nectar value. The proposed approach shows promise for addressing the pollination crisis and reducing the reliance on traditional methods.

ID BEHAVIOR; VALIDATION
AB Discretionary lane change (DLC) is a basic but complex maneuver in driving, which aims at reaching a faster speed or better driving conditions, e.g., further line of sight or better ride quality. Although modeling DLC decision-making has been studied for years, the impact of human factors, which is crucial in accurately modelling human DLC decision-making strategies, is largely ignored in the existing literature. In this paper, we integrate the human factors that are represented by driving styles to design a new DLC decision-making model. Specifically, our proposed model takes not only the contextual traffic information but also the driving styles of surrounding vehicles into consideration and makes lane-change/keep decisions. Moreover, the model can imitate human drivers' decision-making maneuvers by learning the driving style of the ego vehicle. Our evaluation results show that the proposed model captures the human decision-making strategies and imitates human drivers' lane-change maneuvers, which can achieve 98.66% prediction accuracy. Moreover, we also analyze the lane-change impact of our model compared with human drivers in terms of improving the safety and speed of traffic.

AB In these years, Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) is widely employed as a flying server into the Mobile Edge Computing (MEC) network to carry stochastic computation task offloaded from mobile users. However, currently, much efforts are made on the individual computation capability of each UAV during the offloading task, while neglecting the coordination advantage of multiple UAVs in a fleeted way, leading to low efficiency on computing massive bursty data. In this work, therefore, we propose a twofold computation offloading mechanism in a collaborative way for a multi-UAV assisted MEC network using the Connected Dominating Set (CDS). In particular, we solve a system energy efficiency-maximizing optimization problem by using a well-tailored Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers (ADMM) algorithm and Lyapunov optimization. In the proposed mechanism, we develop a two-stage computation task partitioning strategy and a user scheduling scheme with optimized UAV trajectory via designing a CDS virtual backbone network. The numerical results indicate that the superiority of our proposed mechanism compared with the benchmark algorithm.

AB Integrating unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) as the base station is a recent progress and a promising solution to assist cellular networks to improve coverage. In this paper, an analytical framework is proposed to analyze coverage probability and capacity, using stochastic geometry. We incorporate the air-to-ground (A2G), and two-piece path loss model that undergoes millimeter wave (mmWave) channel fading in both line-of-site (LOS) and non-line-of-site (NLOS). Furthermore, we assume that all users' equipment's (UEs) are clustered around Terrestrial Base Stations (TBS) and UAVs, according to Poisson Cluster Process (PCP), i.e., Matern cluster process. We also propose Multiple-Input-Multiple-Output (MIMO) transmission where multiple single-antenna UAVs simultaneously communicate with TBS. Initially, we obtain expressions for association probability with each tier. After that, we derive downlink coverage expression based on signal-to-interference-plus-noise-ratio (SINR), by assuming 3D directional beamforming with UAV height being not fixed. Numerical results demonstrate the efficiency and accuracy of the proposed approach.

AB This article proposes a novel technique for trailer angle detection (TAD) for use in an advanced trailer backup assistance system (TBAS) to accomplish a semiautonomous or full-autonomous backup maneuver. TBAS incorporates a combined trailer-tow vehicle kinematic model that requires an accurate estimate of the hitch angle. The proposed computer vision (CV) and machine learning (ML) TAD model process the image frames, acquired from the rear-facing camera, to detect and track the trailer and estimate its orientation in relation to the tow vehicle. The technique is based on a deep learning object detection and CV tracking model to detect and track one or more identifiable objects on the trailer (the marker-lights on the front edges of the trailer in this work). The estimated positions of the detected marker-lights are used to perform the hitch angle estimation. The model detects the hitch angle within the specified limit with an acceptance rate of 98%. The model is implemented in real time with a processing rate of more than 30 frames/s.

ID ADVANCED DRIVER-ASSISTANCE; SYSTEMS
AB Advanced Driver Assistance Systems (ADAS) are a collection of intelligent solutions integrated into next-generation vehicles to assist in safe driving. When building ADAS systems, the main goals are that they are stable, flexible, easy to maintain, and allow for error tracing. If a driving assistance algorithm is designed to be implemented on one machine or in one model, there is a potential disadvantage that if one component fails, then the entire system would stop. We work on modularizing the ADAS system to be flexible to accommodate any changes or improvements based on up-to-date requirements. Using advanced current edge (or network) devices, we propose a Detection-based Driving Assistance algorithm, which can collaborate or integrate with an existing system in a vehicle. The core of any process is to ensure that the system has a predictable level of functionality and that any misbehavior can be easily traced to the root cause. The proposed system shows fast, real-time performance on edge devices with limited computing power.

ID INFORMATION
AB This paper studies the spectrum allocation problem between spectrum service providers (SSPs) and terminals equipped with orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) integrated radar and communication (IRC) systems. In particular, IRC-equipped terminals such as autonomous vehicles need to buy spectrum for their radar functions, e.g., sensing and detecting distant vehicles, and communication functions, e.g., transmitting sensing data to road-side units. The terminals determine their spectrum demands from the SSPs subject to their IRC performance requirements, while the SSPs compete with each other on the service prices to attract terminals. Taking into account the complicated interactions, a hierarchical Stackelberg game is proposed to reconcile the spectrum demand and service price, where the SSPs are the leaders and the terminals are the followers. Due to the spectrum constraints of the SSPs, we model the lower-layer subgame among the terminals as a generalized Nash equilibrium problem. An iterative searching algorithm is then developed that guarantees the convergence to the Stackelberg equilibrium. Numerical results demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed scheme in terms of social welfare compared to baseline schemes.

AB Due to recent technological advancements, flying cars are expected to be introduced in the near future, and to offer flexible mobility patterns, as well as shorter and more reliable travel times. This paper aims to analyse whether a residence relocation trend (from urban to rural areas, or vice versa) is imminent if flying cars are introduced. In this respect, responses of 584 individuals from the United States were collected through an online survey. The resulting data are statistically analysed through correlated grouped random parameters bivariate and univariate probit models, while accounting for unobserved heterogeneity. The analysis reveals that various socio-demographic characteristics and opinions of the individuals towards the perceived benefits and challenges of flying cars influence residence relocation consideration. The findings from this study offer early insights into the travel demand, land use, and urban and regional planning related challenges that may emerge from the future introduction of flying cars.

AB This paper proposes a novel coordinated multi-agent deep reinforcement learning (MADRL) algorithm for energy sharing among multiple unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) in order to conduct big-data processing in a distributed manner. For realizing UAV-assisted aerial surveillance or flexible mobile cellular services, robust wireless charging mechanisms are essential for delivering energy sources from charging towers (i.e., charging infrastructure) to their associated UAVs for seamless operations of autonomous UAVs in the sky. In order to actively and intelligently manage the energy resources in charging towers, a MADRL-based coordinated energy management system is desired and proposed for energy resource sharing among charging towers. When the required energy for charging UAVs is not enough in charging towers, the energy purchase from utility company (i.e., energy source provider in local energy market) is desired, which takes high costs. Therefore, the main objective of our proposed coordinated MADRL-based energy sharing learning algorithm is minimizing energy purchase from external utility companies to minimize system-operational costs. Finally, our performance evaluation results verify that the proposed coordinated MADRL-based algorithm achieves desired performance improvements.

AB A cooperative lane-changing (CLC) motion planning algorithm for partially connected and automated environment is proposed in this study. Unlike conventional motion planner whose goal is merely enabling driving maneuver, this proposed algorithm takes one step further in terms of reducing oscillation and shockwave caused by lane change, hence improves transport mobility. The proposed motion planner is designed as a model predictive control which is solved by a dynamic programming-based numerical solution method. Since longitudinal automation is much more accessible than lateral automation, the motion planner requires only longitudinal automation in order to keep the design practical. The proposed motion planner is evaluated against the human driver. Sensitivity analysis is conducted in terms of the initial headway of the receiving gap. The results demonstrate that the motion planner reduces oscillation by 0.1%-9.4%. The variation is due to the changes in initial headway of receiving gap. The computation time is around 17-21 milliseconds showing great potential to be applied in real time.

AB The Al-Robotics team was selected as one of the 25 finalist teams out of 143 applications received to participate in the first edition of the Mohamed Bin Zayed International Robotic Challenge (MBZIRC), held in 2017. In particular, one of the competition Challenges offered us the opportunity to develop a cooperative approach with multiple unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) searching, picking up, and dropping static and moving objects. This paper presents the approach that our team Al-Robotics followed to address that Challenge 3 of the MBZIRC. First, we overview the overall architecture of the system, with the different modules involved. Second, we describe the procedure that we followed to design the aerial platforms, as well as all their onboard components. Then, we explain the techniques that we used to develop the software functionalities of the system. Finally, we discuss our experimental results and the lessons that we learned before and during the competition. The cooperative approach was validated with fully autonomous missions in experiments previous to the actual competition. We also analyze the results that we obtained during the competition trials.

DE Autonomous vehicle; adaptive cruise control; fuel economy; model
   predictive control
AB For road transportation, adaptive cruise control (ACC) is a widely used driver assistance technique with partially longitudinal automation. The existing ACC systems usually ignore the road elevation information, which often ends up with large tracking error and poor fuel economy on the roads with up and down slopes. This paper presents a model-based predictive controller (MPC) for fuel-saving ACC to improve the performances on tracking accuracy and fuel consumption by simultaneously considering the road elevation information, nonlinear powertrain dynamics, and spatiotemporal constraint from preceding vehicle. The feasibility of MPC is enhanced by softening nonsafety related hard constraints, and its asymptotical stability is proved by considering the monotonicity property of a properly chosen Lyapunov function. To efficiently compute the optimal control sequence, a pseudospectral discretization technique, instead of evenly spaced discretization, is adopted to transform the continuous-time optimal control problem into a nonlinear programming. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed method could reduce fuel consumption by 2.65% in a typical driving scenario and significantly improve the tracking accuracy compared to the one without road slope consideration.

AB Internal combustion engines inherently demand startup assistance to perform its autonomous functioning. Nevertheless, the common solution over more than one century has been the electric starter motor, for both Otto and diesel cycles. The dynamic coupling system defined herein as the mechanical connection between the internal combustion engine and the starter motor has not evolved considerably since the intermittent pinion-ring gear interface has been adopted. This paper reviews the conceptual design behind the starting systems developed so far, focusing on their functional analysis, and proposes an innovative concept. Preliminary study on dynamic simulation using lumped parameters model, implemented in AMESim, is also discussed as potential aid for the proposed design. Based on decision matrix method, it is possible to evaluate the proposed design against state-of-the-art and promising alternatives to find a real cost-effective alternative to the existing concepts to couple the electric motor and the internal combustion engine. The patented dynamic coupling system proposed herein demonstrates potential to evolve as a cost-effective solution to implement start-stop systems worldwide, contributing to reduction of pollution caused by automotive vehicle emissions.

AB The Korea Ocean Research and Development Institute (KORDI) has developed a small AUV named ISiMI. The mission of ISiMI is to work as a test-bed AUV for the development and validation of various algorithms and instruments required to enhance the AUV's functions. The design concept of ISiMI is that of a vehicle small enough to cruise the Ocean Engineering Basin (OEB) of KORDI and to be handled by one or two people. The downsized design and the cruising ability in its tank enable fast experimental feedback on AUV technologies and a shorter development period for new technologies. This paper presents a review of our research work on the development of ISiMI, with a performance evaluation by simulation and an experimental test. After the design and implementation of ISiMI, including its positioning system in the OEB, are presented, a series of test results in the OEB and discussions of the results are presented, with comparisons of the simulation and experimental outputs.

AB Accurate pose estimation is a fundamental ability that all mobile robots must posses in order to navigate a given environment. Much like a human, this ability is dependent on the robot's understanding of a given scene. For autonomous vehicles (AVs), detailed 3D maps created beforehand are widely used to augment the perceptive abilities and estimate pose based on current sensor measurements. This approach, however, is less suited for rural communities that are sparsely connected and cover large areas. Topological maps such as OpenStreetMap have proven to be a useful alternative in these situations. However, vehicle localization using these maps is non-trivial, particularly for the global localization task, where the map spans large areas. To deal with this challenge, we propose road descriptors along with an initialization technique for localization that allows for fast global pose estimation. We test our algorithms on (real world) maps and benchmark them against other map-based localization as well as SLAM algorithms. Our results show that the proposed method can narrow down the pose to within 50 cm of the ground truth significantly faster than the state-of-the-art methods.

AB The emergence of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) has spurred research on radio air-to-ground (AG) channels. The research shows the AG channel can exhibit higher rates of change and more 3D effects than a terrestrial channel. A received-power model predicts the power that makes it from the transmitter (Tx) to the receiver (Rx) through the intervening environment. Received-power models are key to many RF localization schemes. However, many of the received-power models used for UAV localization are 1D or 2D; 3D effects such as ground reflection and polarization are oversimplified or ignored entirely. In this paper, we perform a comparative experimental analysis of various received-power models. The more sophisticated models account for range, Tx directionality, Rx directionality, polarization, and ground reflection. The models are applied to an AG link realized by a fixed-wing UAV in an open-field environment. Our results show that, on average, a 50% reduction in localization error can be achieved by including the polarization factor in the received-power model.

AB Resource allocation for mobile edge computing (MEC) in unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) networks has been a popular research issue. Different from existing works, this paper considers a multi-UAV-aided uplink communication scenario and investigates a resource allocation problem of minimizing the total system latency and the energy consumption, subject to constraints on transmit power of mobile users (MUs), system latency caused by transmission and computation. The problem is confirmed to be a challenging time-series mixed-integer non-convex programming problem, and we propose a joint UAV Movement control, MU Association and MU Power control (UMAP) algorithm to solve it effectively, where three sub-problems are optimized iteratively. Specifically, UAV movement and MU association are optimized utilizing deep reinforcement learning (DRL) to decrease the energy consumption and system latency. Next, a closed-form solution of the MU transmit power is derived. Finally, simulation results show that the UMAP algorithm can significantly decrease the system latency and energy consumption and increase the coverage rate compared with benchmark algorithms.

ID DYNAMICS
AB Autonomous spacecraft rendezvous is very challenging in increasingly complex space missions. In this article, we present our approach model-based reinforcement learning for spacecraft rendezvous guidance (MBRL4SRG). We build a Markov decision process model based on the Clohessy-Wiltshire equation of spacecraft dynamics and use dynamic programming to solve it and generate the decision table as the optimal agent policy. Since the onboard computing system of spacecraft is resource constrained in terms of both memory size and processing speed, we train a neural network (NN) as a compact and efficient function approximation to the tabular representation of the decision table. The NN outputs are formally verified using the verification tool ReluVal, and the verification results show that the robustness of the NN is maintained. Experimental results indicate that MBRL4SRG achieves lower computational overhead than the conventional proportional-integral-derivative algorithm and has higher trustworthiness and better computational efficiency during training than the model-free reinforcement learning algorithms.

AB Mobile Edge Computing (MEC) is a promising technology in the next generation network, which provides computing services for user equipments (UEs) to reduce the task delay and prolong the usage time of UEs. To address the deficiency of poor channel quality caused by multipath and blockages in traditional MEC networks, a multiple input single output (MISO) UAV-assisted MEC network is studied. A system energy consumption minimization problem is formulated by jointly optimizing the the UAV's beamforming vectors, the UAV's central processing unit (CPU) frequency, the UAV's trajectory, the UEs' transmission power and the UEs' CPU frequency subject to the constraints on the task, the UAV's trajectory, and the UEs' computation tasks. A three-stage iterative algorithm is proposed to solve the challenging non-convex problem. The closed-form expressions for the optimal UAV CPU frequency and the transmission power of UEs are derived. Simulation results show that the proposed algorithm is superior to the benchmark schemes in terms of energy consumption, and the convergence performance is guaranteed.

AB The transportation industry is in the midst of a revolution with technologies, such as shared vehicles, drones, and autonomous vehicles, that are poised to reshape the way we move. Yet, the multitude of technologies present a difficulty in prioritizing which technologies should be invested in. While focusing on Klang Valley's transportation system, this research proposes the REsilience Brittleness and Emerging Technologies (REBET) framework, which aims to identify the transportation technologies with the highest potential of strengthening the system's resilience. We used a Dephi technique to identify the Sources of Brittleness (SBs) in the system and technologies with the highest relevance to the Malaysian setting. Using multiple linear regression, we then derived a relationship between the two aspects. The framework defines the relative resilience of the technologies according to their forecasted ability to eliminate system brittleness. The results ranked 23 technologies, with the topmost recommendations being ITS, Big Data, and Smart Buses. We highlight REBET's robustness as a global decision-making tool for infrastructure managers, researchers, and policymakers to identify ideal technologies for their transportation systems.

AB With the increasing growth of internet-of-things (IoT) devices, effective computation performance has become a critical issue. Many services provided by IoT devices (e.g., augmented reality, location-tracking, traffic systems, and autonomous driving) require intensive real-time data processing, which demands powerful computational resources. Mobile edge computing (MEC) has been introduced to effectively handle this problem reliably over the internet. The inclusion of a MEC server allows computationally intensive tasks to be offloaded from IoT devices. However, communication overhead and delays are major drawbacks. With the advantages of high mobility and low cost, unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) can mitigate this issue by acting as MEC servers. The offloading decisions for such scenarios involve service latency, energy/power consumption, and execution delays. For this reason, this study reviews UAV-enabled MEC solutions in which offloading was the focus of research. We compare the algorithms qualitatively to assess features and performance. Finally, we discuss open issues and research challenges in terms of design and implementation.

AB The performance of LiDAR sensors deteriorates under adverse weather conditions such as rainfall. However, few studies have empirically analyzed this phenomenon. Hence, we investigated differences in sensor data due to environmental changes (distance from objects (road signs), object material, vehicle (sensor) speed, and amount of rainfall) during LiDAR sensing of road facilities. The indicators used to verify the performance of LiDAR were numbers of point cloud (NPC) and intensity. Differences in the indicators were tested through a two-way ANOVA. First, both NPC and intensity increased with decreasing distance. Second, despite some exceptions, changes in speed did not affect the indicators. Third, the values of NPC do not differ depending on the materials and the intensity of each material followed the order aluminum > steel > plastic > wood, although exceptions were found. Fourth, with an increase in rainfall, both indicators decreased for all materials; specifically, under rainfall of 40 mm/h or more, a substantial reduction was observed. These results demonstrate that LiDAR must overcome the challenges posed by inclement weather to be applicable in the production of road facilities that improve the effectiveness of autonomous driving sensors.

AB With the steady progress of China's agricultural modernization, the demand for agricultural machinery for production is widely growing. Agricultural unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) are becoming a new force in the field of precision agricultural aviation in China. In those agricultural areas where ground-based machinery have difficulties in executing farming operations, agricultural UAVs have shown obvious advantages. With the development of precision agricultural aviation technology, one of the inevitable trends is to realize autonomous identification of obstacles and real-time obstacle avoidance (OA) for agricultural UAVs. However, the complex farmland environment and changing obstacles both increase the complexity of OA research. The objective of this paper is to introduce the development of agricultural UAV OA technology in China. It classifies the farmland obstacles in two ways and puts forward the OA zones and related avoidance tactics, which helps to improve the safety of aviation operations. This paper presents a comparative analysis of domestic applications of agricultural UAV OA technology, features, hotspot and future research directions. The agricultural UAV OA technology of China is still at an early development stage and many barriers still need to be overcome.

AB Partially automated vehicles (PAVs) have been used in real-world environments for several years since the emergence of autonomous driving. It is important to understand the effects of partial automation systems (PAS) on the understanding of drivers and their behaviour during the first months of use. In order to adapt to new vehicle technology, drivers usually exhibit specific behaviours in this stage that are not intended by the developers, namely behavioural adaptation. The present study investigated the behavioural adaptations by early PAV adopters after short-term usage. A semi-structured interview was conducted among 20 Tesla drivers who had relatively high experience (one to five months) with Autopilot, and the interviews were synthesized to understand their behavioural adaptation, mental models, and trust during the period of use. The results showed that PAV drivers had a very positive attitude towards the PAS and drivers universally engaged in secondary tasks during automated driving. They also learned from their experiences to identify relatively safe usage conditions and they employed a safety margin to avoid exposure to excessively risky situations.

AB With current space exploration roadmaps indicating the Moon as a proving ground on the way to human exploration of Mars, it is clear that human-robotic partnerships will play a key role for successful future human space missions. This paper details a conceptual end-to-end architecture for an exploration mission in cis-lunar space with a focus on human-robot interactions, called Human Assisted Robotic Vehicle Studies (HARVeSt). HARVeSt will build on knowledge of plant growth in space gained from experiments on-board the ISS and test the first growth of plants on the Moon. A planned deep space habitat will be utilised as the base of operations for human-robotic elements of the mission. The mission will serve as a technology demonstrator not only for autonomous tele-operations in cis-lunar space but also for key enabling technologies for future human surface missions. The successful approach of the ISS will be built on in this mission with international cooperation. Mission assets such as a modular rover will allow for an extendable mission and to scout and prepare the area for the start of an international Moon Village.

AB This paper proposes a new adaptive sliding mode control scheme for achieving coordinated motion control of a group of autonomous underwater vehicles with variable added mass. The control law considers the communication constraints in the acoustic medium. A common reference frame for velocity is assigned to a virtual leader dynamically. The performances of the proposed adaptive SMC were compared with that of a passivity based controller. To save the time and traveling distance for reaching the FRP by the follower AUVs, a sliding mode controller is proposed in this paper that drives the state trajectory of the AUV into a switching surface in the state space. It is observed from the obtained results that the proposed SMC provides improved performance in terms of accurately tracking the desired trajectory within less time compared to the passivity based controller. A communication consensus is designed ensuring the transfer of information among the AUVs so that they move collectively as a group. The stability of the overall closed-loop systems are analysed using Lyapunov theory and simulation results confirmed the robustness and efficiency of proposed controller.

AB Mobile applications have rapidly grown over the past few decades to offer futuristic applications, such as autonomous vehicles, smart farming, and smart city. Such applications require ubiquitous, real-time, and secure communications to deliver services quickly. Toward this aim, sixth-generation (6G) wireless technology offers superior performance with high reliability, enhanced transmission rate, and low latency. However, managing the resources of the aforementioned applications is highly complex in the precarious network. An adversary can perform various network-related attacks (i.e., data injection or modification) to jeopardize the regular operation of the smart applications. Therefore, incorporating blockchain technology in the smart application can be a prominent solution to tackle security, reliability, and data-sharing privacy concerns. Motivated by the same, we presented a case study on public safety applications that utilizes the essential characteristics of artificial intelligence (AI), blockchain, and a 6G network to handle data integrity attacks on the crime data. The case study is assessed using various performance parameters by considering blockchain scalability, packet drop ratio, and training accuracy. Lastly, we explored different research challenges of adopting blockchain in the 6G wireless network.

AB This paper proposes an object collision point estimation scheme by developing a new data fusion method in a multi-radar network environment. In order to reduce radars estimation error due to measurement uncertainty, we first design radar accuracy models determined by the position of each object. Then, an interacting multiple model (IMM) filter based on occupancy zones is designed for accurate object estimation. For a multi-radar networks object estimation, we also design a radar data fusion method using the estimated object information through the IMM instead of the object estimation information given by the radars. A collision point identification problem, where multiple sensors calculate the different vehicle surface points of the same object, is solved by developing the data fusion method to estimate the object surfaces collision point closest to the ego vehicle center. The utility of the proposed scheme was validated through a scenario-based object estimation experiment. We confirmed that the proposed data fusion method produced substantially improved error distributions over conventional methods.

AB The optimal integration of electrical units, such as distributed generation units, power electronic devices, and electric vehicles, is a significant development of smart grids. This development has effectively transformed the traditional grid system, promising numerous advantages for economic values and autonomous energy source control. In smart grids development, metaheuristic algorithms are one of the optimization algorithms that have been applied extensively to mitigate the accompanying problems such as voltage instability, power loss, and high installation cost. This paper presents a comprehensive review of metaheuristic techniques for the optimal integration of electrical units in distribution networks, considering different phases of the optimization process. These include the approaches for handling of crucial objective functions and the optimal integration methods for different electrical units. This review shows a need for more research on developing efficient metaheuristic algorithms and the effective handling of multiple objective functions.

AB Risk assessment is a central element for the development and validation of autonomous vehicles. It comprises a combination of occurrence probability and severity of future critical events. Time headway (TH) as well as time-to-contact (TTC) are commonly used riskmetrics and have qualitative relations to occurrence probability. However, they lack theoretical derivations and additionally they are designed to only cover special types of traffic scenarios (e.g., longitudinal following between single car pairs). In this paper, we present a probabilistic situation risk model based on survival analysis considerations and extend it to naturally incorporate sensory, temporal, and behavioral uncertainties as they arise in real-world scenarios. The resulting risk spot detector (RSD) is applied and tested on naturalistic driving data of a multilane boulevard with several intersections, enabling the visualization of road criticality maps. Compared to TH and TTC, our approach is more selective and specific in predicting risk. RSD concentrates on driving sections of high vehicle density where large accelerations and decelerations or approaches with high velocity occur.

AB This research presents a new semi-automatic model for converting raw AggieAir (TM) footprints in visible and near-infrared (NIR) bands into reflectance images. AggieAir, a new unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) platform, is flown autonomously using pre-programmed flight plans at low altitudes to limit atmospheric effects. The UAV acquires high-resolution, multispectral images and has a flight duration of about 30 minutes. The sensors on board are twin cameras with duplicate settings and automatic mode disabled. A white Barium Sulfate (BaSO4) panel is used for reflectance calibration and in situ irradiance measurements. The spatial resolution of the imagery is 25 cm; the radiometric resolution is 8-bit. The raw images are mosaicked and orthorectified and the model converts their digital numbers (DN) to reflectance values. Imagery, acquired around local solar noon over wetlands on the Great Salt Lake, Utah, is used to illustrate the results. The model generates high quality images and the results are good. The reflectance values of vegetation in the NIR, Green and Red bands extracted at the test locations are consistent. The image processing, reflectance calculations, accuracy issues, with the proposed method are discussed.

AB The use of a truck and multitrailer system is advantageous because of its ability to transport heavy and large parts with a single powered vehicle. On the other hand, when the system is deployed in an autonomous and unmanned scenario, it remains a challenging task to design a drive controller. Since the drive is only applied to the truck and motivated by successful cases of human expert drivers, a fuzzy controller is developed to generate speed and turn rate commands in order to steer the multi-trailer system to reach the target position with minimum position error. Furthermore, in order to make the controller design efficient and effective, the parameters in the fuzzy controller including the membership functions and rules are automatically tuned using the implementation of efficient particle swarm optimization algorithm instead of relying solely on human expert knowledge. Near-optimal parameters are then derived and adopted in the controller, and drive commands are then generated. The performance of the truck-and-multi-trailer system under fuzzy control is verified through simulation studies, and satisfactory results are obtained.

AB Long-term monitoring of deep-ocean processes is essential for understanding the potential impacts of climate variation on the deep sea. A suite of autonomous and cabled instrumentation has been developed to allow continuous measurements of food supply availability, species composition and abundance, and organism activity. A sedimentation sensor combines a traditional sediment trap configuration with a digital-imaging system and fluorometer to monitor food supply. A digital time-lapse camera system captures high-resolution images of the sea floor to monitor benthic fauna and sediment processes. A bottom-transiting vehicle conducts photographic transects across the sea floor and measures sediment community oxygen consumption at multiple sites. An upward-looking acoustic array measures backscatter targets, pelagic fauna, passing through an insonified field above the sea floor. Although these instruments can be deployed autonomously, cabled observatories can now provide continuous power and real-time communications for sustained monitoring of deep-sea benthic boundary layer communities.

AB While emerging technology for self-driving automation in vehicles progresses rapidly, the transition to an era of roads full of fully connected and automated vehicles (CAVs) may take longer than expected. Until then, it is inevitable that CAVs should coexist and interact with drivers of non-autonomous vehicles (NAVs) in urban roads. During this period of transition, it is critical to provide road safety with the mixed vehicular traffic and uncertainty caused by human drivers. To investigate the issues caused by the coexistence and interaction with humans, we propose to build a component-based and interactive intelligent transportation cyber-physical systems (ITCPS) framework. Our design of the interactive ITCPS framework aims to provide a standardized structure for users by defining core components. The framework is specified by behavior models and interfaces for the desired ITCPS components and is implemented as a form of human and hardware-in-the-loop system. We developed an intersection crossing assistance service and an automatic emergency braking service as an example of practical applications using the framework. To evaluate the framework, we tested its performance to show how effectively it operates while supporting real-time processing. The results indicate that it satisfies the timing requirements of vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) communication and the limited processing time required for performing the functions of behavior models, even though the traffic volume reaches the road capacity. A case study using statistical analysis is conducted to assess the practical value of the developed experimental environment. The results of the case study validate the reliability among the specified variables for the experiments involving human drivers. It has shown that V2V communication support has positive effects on road safety, including intersection safety, braking events, and perception-reaction time (PRT) of the drivers. Furthermore, V2V communication support and PRT are identified as the important indicators affecting road safety at an un-signalized intersection. The proposed interactive framework is expected to contribute in constructing a comprehensive environment for the urban ITCPS and providing experimental support for the analysis of human behavior in the coexistence environment.

AB Autonomous vehicles are expected to operate safely in real-life road conditions in the next years. Nevertheless, unanticipated events such as the existence of unexpected objects in the range of the road, can put safety at risk. The advancement of sensing and communication technologies and Internet of Things may facilitate the recognition of hazardous situations and information exchange in a cooperative driving scheme, providing new opportunities for the increase of collaborative situational awareness. Safe and unobtrusive visualization of the obtained information may nowadays be enabled through the adoption of novel Augmented Reality (AR) interfaces in the form of windshields. Motivated by these technological opportunities, we propose a saliency-based distributed, cooperative and rendering scheme for increasing the driver's situational awareness through (i) automated negative obstacle (potholes) detection, (ii) AR visualization and (iii) information sharing (upcoming potential dangers) with other connected vehicles or road infrastructure. An extensive evaluation study using a variety of real datasets for pothole detection showed that the proposed method provides favorable results and features compared to other recent and relevant approaches.

AB In this letter, we investigate an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) communication system, where an intelligent reflecting surface (IRS) is deployed to assist in the transmission from a ground node (GN) to the UAV in the presence of a jammer. We aim to maximize the average rate of the UAV commnunication by jointly optimizing the GN's transmit power, the IRS's passive beamforming and the UAV's trajectory. However, the formulated problem is difficult to solve due to the non-convex objective function and the coupled optimization variables. Thus, to tackle it, we propose an alternating optimization (AO) based algorithm by exploiting the successive convex approximation (SCA) and semidefinite relaxation (SDR) techniques. Simulation results show that the proposed algorithm can significantly improve the average rate compared with the benchmark algorithms. Moreover, it also shows that when the jamming power is large and the number of IRS elements is relatively small, deploying the IRS near the jammer outperforms deploying it near the GN, and vice versa.

AB Underwater 3-D laser scanners are an essential type of sensors used by unmanned underwater vehicle (UUVs) for operations such as inspection, navigation, and object recognition and manipulation. This article presents a novel 3-D laser scanner, which uses a 2-axis mirror to project straight lines into the water by compensating for refraction-related distortions. This is achieved by projecting optimally curved lines, so that the refraction when they enter the water transforms them into straight lines. The relevance of this approach lies in the fact that 3-D triangulation using planes is noticeably faster than using elliptic cones. The goal of this work is twofold: first, to prove that refraction-related distortions can in practice be compensated for by using a 2-axis mirror, and second, to present a simple calibration algorithm that only needs to compute the coefficients of polynomial functions. To the best of the authors' knowledge, the prototype presented in this article is the first laser line scanner that actively counteracts the refraction of the projected light in the context of underwater robotics.

AB While designing control for a class of underactuated mechanical systems (UMSs), the uncertainty and the prescribed nonholonomic tracking trajectories should be taken into consideration. Uncertainty considered in this article is time varying and bounded, and the bound of uncertainty is described using the fuzzy set theory, namely, fuzzy UMSs. An analytical dynamics-based view is taken in which the prescribed tracking trajectories are viewed as servo constraints which can be linear, nonlinear, holonomic, and nonholonomic. Using this view, a novel closed form solution of adaptive robust control is found with leakage type adaptive law to guarantee deterministic system performance, including uniform boundedness and uniform ultimate boundedness. In order to find the optimal dual gain parameters of the designed control, a two-player cooperative game is proposed for which the Pareto optimality can always be guaranteed. The effectiveness of the proposed control is shown through numerical simulation of a two-wheeled inverted pendulum vehicle.

TI Deep imitation reinforcement learning for self-driving by vision
SO CAAI TRANSACTIONS ON INTELLIGENCE TECHNOLOGY
LA English
DT Article
AB Deep reinforcement learning has achieved some remarkable results in self-driving. There is quite a lot of work to do in the area of autonomous driving with high real-time requirements because of the inefficiency of reinforcement learning in exploring large continuous motion spaces. A deep imitation reinforcement learning (DIRL) framework is presented to learn control policies of self-driving vehicles, which is based on a deep deterministic policy gradient algorithm (DDPG) by vision. The DIRL framework comprises two components, the perception module and the control module, using imitation learning (IL) and DDPG, respectively. The perception module employs the IL network as an encoder which processes an image into a low-dimensional feature vector. This vector is then delivered to the control module which outputs control commands. Meanwhile, the actor network of the DDPG is initialized with the trained IL network to improve exploration efficiency. In addition, a reward function for reinforcement learning is defined to improve the stability of self-driving vehicles, especially on curves. DIRL is verified by the open racing car simulator (TORCS), and the results show that the correct control strategy is learned successfully and has less training time.

ID MOBILE ROBOTS
AB Precision maps are useful in agricultural farm management for providing farmers (and field researchers) with locational information. Having an environmental model that includes geo-referenced data would facilitate the deployment of multi-robot systems, that has emerged in precision agriculture. It further allows developing automated techniques and tools for map reconstruction and field coverage for farming purposes. In this study, a reinforcement learning-based method (and in particular dyna-Q+) is presented for a team of unmanned ground vehicles (UGVs) to cooperatively learn an unknown dynamic field (and in particular, an agricultural field). The problem we address here is to deploy UGVs to map plant rows, find obstacles, whose locations are not known a priori, and define regions of interest in the field (e.g., areas with high water stress). Once an environment model is built, the UGVs are then distributed to provide full coverage of plants and update the reconstructed map simultaneously. Simulation results are finally presented to demonstrate that the proposed method for simultaneous learning and planning can successfully learn a model of the field and monitor the coverage area.

AB The flight agility of an unmanned combat aerial vehicle (UCAV) determines its ability to rapidly transition from one state to another. In this paper, the influence of flight agility on short-range aerial combat effectiveness is quantitatively investigated. This research is based on one-on-one three-dimensional aerial combat engagements. First, a 6-DOF mathematical model of the UCAV is established, and a nonlinear dynamic inverse controller is designed. The flight agility is calculated based on the 180 degrees flight heading reverse maneuver, and the influence of the control law parameters is studied. To implement autonomous intelligent aerial combat engagements, a three-dimensional approximate dynamic programming method is proposed. The performance of the designed algorithm is validated through both Monte Carlo simulations with various initial conditions and engagements with another algorithm for comparison. After training, the aerial combat simulation framework is constructed by combining the point-mass-based guidance law and a nonlinear UCAV model. Combat engagements are conducted between UCAVs with different configurations. The quantitative results are evaluated through Monte Carlo simulations and correlation analysis.

AB This paper shows that Gaussian Process Regression (GPR) with a periodic kernel has better mean prediction accuracy and uncertainty bounds than time series or Fourier series when forecasting motion data of underwater vehicles subject to wave excitation. Many robotic systems, such as autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs), are required to operate in environments with disturbances and relative motion that make task performance difficult. This motion often exhibits periodic, near-sinusoidal behaviour. By predicting this motion, control strategies can be developed to improve accuracy. Moreover, factoring in uncertainty can aid the robustness of these predictive control methods. Time series and Fourier series have been applied to several predictive control problems in a variety of fields. However, there are contradictory results in performance based on parameters, assessment criteria, and application. This paper seeks to clarify these discrepancies using AUV motion as a case study. GPR is also introduced as a third candidate for prediction based on previous applications to time series forecasting in other fields of science. In addition to assessing mean prediction accuracy, the ability of each model to adequately bound prediction error is also considered as a key performance indicator.

AB Recent advancements in the field of Artificial Intelligence (AI) have provided an opportunity to create autonomous devices, robots, and machines characterized particularly with the ability to make decisions and perform tasks without human mediation. One of these devices, Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) or drones are widely used to perform tasks like surveillance, search and rescue, object detection and target tracking, parcel delivery (recently started by Amazon), and many more. The sensitivity in performing said tasks demands that drones must be efficient and reliable. For this, in this paper, an approach to detect and track the target object, moving or still, for a drone is presented. The Parrot AR Drone 2 is used for this application. Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) is used for object detection and target tracking. The object detection results show that CNN detects and classifies object with a high level of accuracy (98%). For real-time tracking, the tracking algorithm responds faster than conventionally used approaches, efficiently tracking the detected object without losing it from sight. The calculations based on several iterations exhibit that the efficiency achieved for target tracking is 96.5%.

AB Vehicular ad hoc networks (VANETs) have been studied intensively due to their wide variety of applications and services, such as passenger safety, enhanced traffic efficiency, and infotainment. With the evolution of technology and sudden growth in the number of smart vehicles, traditional VANETs face several technical challenges in deployment and management due to less flexibility, scalability, poor connectivity, and inadequate intelligence. Cloud computing is considered a way to satisfy these requirements in VANETs. However, next-generation VANETs will have special requirements of autonomous vehicles with high mobility, low latency, real-time applications, and connectivity, which may not be resolved by conventional cloud computing. Hence, merging of fog computing with the conventional cloud for VANETs is discussed as a potential solution for several issues in current and future VANETs. In addition, fog computing can be enhanced by integrating Software-Defined Network (SDN), which provides flexibility, programmability, and global knowledge of the network. We present two example scenarios for timely dissemination of safety messages in future VANETs based on fog and a combination of fog and SDN. We also explained the issues that need to be resolved for the deployment of three different cloud-based approaches.

SO JOURNAL OF FIELD ROBOTICS
LA English
DT Article
ID LEVEL SET; PATH
AB Operating autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) near shore is challengingheavy shipping traffic and other hazards threaten AUV safety at the surface, and strong ocean currents impede navigation when underwater. Predictive models of ocean currents have been shown to improve navigation accuracy, but these forecasts are typically noisy, making it challenging to use them effectively. Prior work has explored the use of probabilistic planners, such as Markov decision processes (MDPs), for planning in these scenarios, but prior methods have lacked a principled way of modeling the uncertainty in ocean model predictions, which limits applicability to cases in which high fidelity models are available. To overcome this limitation, we propose using Gaussian processes (GPs) augmented with interpolation variance to provide confidence measures on predictions. This paper describes two novel planners that incorporate these confidence measures: (1) a stationary risk-aware GPMDP (for low-variability currents), and (2) a nonstationary risk-aware NS-GPMDP (for faster and high-variability currents). Extensive simulations indicate that the learned confidence measures allow for safe and reliable operation with uncertain ocean current models. Field tests of the planners on Slocum gliders over several weeks in the ocean demonstrate the practical efficacy of our approach.

DT Article
AB Range estimation is crucial for maintaining a safe distance, in particular for vision navigation and localization. Monocular autonomous vehicles are appropriate for outdoor environment due to their mobility and operability. However, accurate range estimation using vision system is challenging because of the nonholonomic dynamics and susceptibility of vehicles. In this paper, a measuring rectification algorithm for range estimation under shaking conditions is designed. The proposed method focuses on how to estimate range using monocular vision when a shake occurs and the algorithm only requires the pose variations of the camera to be acquired. Simultaneously, it solves the problem of how to assimilate results from different kinds of sensors. To eliminate measuring errors by shakes, we establish a pose-range variation model. Afterwards, the algebraic relation between distance increment and a camera's poses variation is formulated. The pose variations are presented in the form of roll, pitch, and yaw angle changes to evaluate the pixel coordinate incensement. To demonstrate the superiority of our proposed algorithm, the approach is validated in a laboratory environment using Pioneer 3-DX robots. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed approach improves in the range accuracy significantly.

AB This paper is focused on an attitude estimation method for Autonomous Underwater Vehicles (AUVs). Data acquired by a commercial Micro-Electro-Mechanical Systems (MEMS) Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU), equipped with magnetometers, and a Fibre Optic Gyroscope (FOG) are fused to estimate the attitude of the vehicle. One of the most used attitude estimation filter, a Nonlinear Complementary Filter (NCF), is proposed as the basis of this work; then, some adaptations to the original formulation of the filter are illustrated to better suit it to the field of underwater robotics. The proposed improvements include the online tuning of the gains of the filter to cope with sensor disturbances and the employment of the data acquired by a FOG. In addition, a fast procedure for the calibration of a magnetometer is introduced to increase the reliability of its readings. The resulting filter is used to estimate the attitude of an AUV; the performance of the proposed solution is tested and evaluated, in particular when unpredictable magnetic disturbances are present, highlighting the improvements that the applied changes allow to achieve in the specific field of application.

AB This article proposes a frontier-guided informative planner for unmanned aerial vehicle volumetric exploration and 3-D reconstruction, which can explore a complex unknown environment and provide the accurate truncated signed distance function reconstruction simultaneously. Different from the existing methods, the key insight of the proposed method is that the hybrid surface frontier is proposed to guide both the tree expansion of dynamic rapidly exploring random tree star and the informative trajectory generation. As a result, the proposed planner can achieve more efficient volumetric exploration with higher reconstruction quality. Specifically, hybrid global-local surface frontiers are designed to guide the potential viewpoints sampling and tree expansion, which results in directional exploration. Then, the hybrid surface frontiers are further leveraged to guide the candidate paths generation. On the basis, the path maximizing the new comprehensive gain is selected for the following B-spline trajectory optimization, which can further improve the reconstruction quality. Comparative simulation and real-world experiments are conducted to demonstrate the superior performance of the proposed method including the exploration efficiency and reconstruction quality.

AB This article addresses the event-triggered output feedback control problem of steer-by-wire (SbW) systems subject to uncertain nonlinearity and time-varying disturbance. First, to solve the uncertainty and remove unnecessary sensors, an interval 2 fuzzy logic system and an adaptive state observer are proposed to estimate the uncertain nonlinearity and unavailable states of SbW systems. Then, an event-triggered output feedback control method is constructed for SbW systems to achieve the prespecified tracking performance. Much significantly, the jumping phenomenon of the control input caused by event-triggering communication can be eliminated by the proposed event-triggered control systems. Furthermore, theoretical analysis shows that the tracking error can converge to the preset neighborhood of origin within finite time, while the Zeno behavior can be avoided. Finally, simulations and vehicle experiments are presented to verify the validity of the proposed methods.

ID TRAJECTORY GENERATION; GEOMETRIC CONTROL; FLATNESS; UAVS
AB This paper discusses the development of a generalized framework for collaborative control and transportation of a suspended load using multiple quadrotors. For this, first, a flight dynamics model ofnquadrotors with suspended load system is derived using Newton's approach. Next, a cooperative control law is developed to control the motion of the quadrotor(s) and the suspended load. The vehicle formation ensures that the load distribution among vehicles remains equal throughout the transportation task. The proposed control approach uses the combination of a proportional-integral derivative (PID) and a proportional derivative (PD) controller for position control and transportation. The PID controller controls the motion of quadrotor, whereas the PD controller controls the swing, maintains the formation of quadrotors, and simultaneously damps the oscillation of the load. The combination facilitates the waypoint transition and trajectory tracking of the load. A minimum snap trajectory generation approach for the suspended load is also presented. The performance is demonstrated in a simulation as well as experimentally on a single and multiple quadrotors inthree-dimensional environment using the motion capture system. The experimental result for a single-lift system is also presented for the outdoor environment.

   memories (LSTM); deep neural network; visual-inertial odometry
AB Inertial measurement units (IMUs) suffer from bias and measurement noise, which makes it much more complicated to tackle the problem of inertial odometry (IO). Due to the error propagation over time, while estimating robot position, an inaccurate estimation or a small error will cause the odometry and a localization system unreliable and unusable in a split of seconds. This paper presents a novel triple-channel deep IO network architecture based on the physical and mathematical models of IMUs. The proposed method simulates the noise model in the training phase and becomes robust to noise during testing. Besides, the proposed network architecture also considers the time interval between two consecutive IMU readings (sampling time) so that it is robust to the change of IMU frequency and the missing of IMU information. To the best of our knowledge, this paper is the first work reviewing and analyzing the existing IO methods used by the deep-learning-based visual-IO approaches. The proposed network architecture outperforms all the existing solutions on the IMU readings of the challenging Micro Aerial Vehicle dataset and improves the accuracy by approximately 25%.

AB The present study investigated the role of working memory capacity (WMC) in predicting distracted driving performance using a working memory distractor. Forty-nine participants (including one with missing data) completed four working memory complex spans prior to completing a distracted and non-distracted simulated driving trial. During the distracted driving trial, participants drove while simultaneously completing the grocery list task (GLT), a semi-naturalistic working memory task developed by the authors. Results showed that participants were significantly slower at braking when a yellow traffic light appeared and during sudden braking events when distracted. Furthermore, the impairing effect of distraction on braking response time was partially mediated by WMC. There was also a trend towards a moderating effect of WMC, where the impairing effect of distraction was more pronounced for individuals with low WMC than high WMC. Theoretical and practical implications for the role of individual differences in cognition and driving, in-vehicle devices use and traffic safety, as well as semi-autonomous vehicle design are also discussed.

ID ENTRY GUIDANCE
AB A numerical multi-constrained predictor-corrector guidance algorithm is proposed in this study, focusing on real-time longitudinal trajectory generation, constraint management, and lateral guidance improvement. First, a new compound bank corridor is designed to help convert the complicated trajectory planning problem into a root-finding problem, which is identified by a recursive least squares estimation algorithm and solved by a newly proposed period-crossing steepest descent method within a fraction of a second in Matlab. Second, three constraint enforcement operators are designed based on state prediction and feedback theory, and the long-standing constraint violation problem of predictor-corrector algorithms is addressed by on-board bank angle compensation. Additionally, a new predictive lateral guidance algorithm is proposed based on a cross-range proportional decrement strategy, and the resulting new bank reversal logic with only one user-defined parameter has better performance on reversal controllability and guidance robustness than the traditional algorithms. Finally, extensive numerical simulations are carried out for different mission scenarios with significant dispersions, and the new methodology is proved to be capable of autonomous and robust guidance flight for reentry vehicles.

AB This study proposes a practical trial-and-error method to solve the optimal toll design problem of cordon-based pricing, where only the traffic counts autonomously collected on the entry links of the pricing cordon are needed. With the fast development and adoption of vehicle-to-infrastructure (V2I) facilities, it is very convenient to autonomously collect these data. Two practical properties of the cordon-based pricing are further considered in this article: the toll charge on each entry of one pricing cordon is identical; the total inbound flow to one cordon should be restricted in order to maintain the traffic conditions within the cordon area. Then, the stochastic user equilibrium (SUE) with asymmetric link travel time functions is used to assess each feasible toll pattern. Based on a variational inequality (VI) model for the optimal toll pattern, this study proposes a theoretically convergent trial-and-error method for the addressed problem, where only traffic counts data are needed. Finally, the proposed method is verified based on a numerical network example.

AB Ocean currents impose a negative effect on Autonomous Underwater Vehicle (AUV) underwater target searches, which lengthens the search paths and consumes more energy and team effort. To solve this problem, an integrated algorithm is proposed to realise multi-AUV cooperative search in dynamic underwater environments with ocean currents. The proposed integrated algorithm combines the Biological Inspired Neurodynamics Model (BINM) and Velocity Synthesis (VS) method. Firstly, the BINM guides a team of AUVs to achieve target search in underwater environments; BINM search requires no specimen learning information and is thus easier to apply to practice, but the search path is longer because of the influence of ocean current. Next the VS algorithm offsets the effect of ocean current, and it is applied to optimise the search path for each AUV. Lastly, to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed integrated approach, simulation results are given in this paper. It is proved that this integrated algorithm can plan shorter search paths and thus the energy consumption is lower compared with BINM.

AB The widespread deployment of sensors, computers, and communications in vehicles and roadways is creating new challenges and opportunities to effectively exploit the wealth of real-time data and information that is now becoming increasingly available. In this paper the authors capitalize on these rapid technological advancements using a technique termed on-line ad hoc distributed simulation. This approach utilizes a dynamic collection of autonomous simulations interacting with each other and with real-time data in a continuously running, distributed, real-time simulation environment. Within the ad hoc distributed simulation approach a rollback-based time synchronization method is used to allow the simulations to adapt to unanticipated changes in traffic and to changes in predictions produced by other simulations. The proposed approach is tested on a transportation network with different geographical distributions of client locations and randomized network partitioning under different traffic demand scenarios. The results demonstrate that the proposed approach has the ability to share complex traffic data among participating vehicles and process the data in an effective way to provide drivers/system monitoring with near-term traffic predictions.

ID PROGRAMMING ENVIRONMENT
AB This paper is a general overview of the SKIPPER project, run at Blaise Pascal University between 1996 and 2002. The main goal of the SKIPPER project was to demonstrate the applicability of skeleton-based parallel programming techniques to the fast prototyping of reactive vision applications. This project has produced several versions of a full-fledged integrated parallel programming environment (PPE). These PPEs have been used to implement realistic vision applications, such as road following or vehicle tracking for assisted driving, on embedded parallel platforms embarked on semi-autonomous vehicles. All versions Of SKIPPER share a common front-end and repertoire of skeletons-presented in previous papers-but differ in the techniques used for implementing skeletons. This paper focuses on these implementation issues, by making a comparative survey, according to a set of four criteria (efficiency, expressivity, portability, predictability), of these implementation techniques. It also gives an account of the lessons we have learned, both when dealing with these implementation issues and when using the resulting tools for prototyping vision applications.

AB More than 1.2 million people die in road crashes each year, and more than 20 million are severely injured, making it the 9th leading cause of death in the world (2.2% of all deaths globally). Pedestrian deaths comprise more than 35% of road accident deaths, mostly as a result of pedestrian-vehicle crashes. This paper proposes a new model for formulating the dynamics of the interaction between drivers and pedestrians at congested conflict spots where drivers and/or pedestrians do not closely follow the traffic laws and regulations. In this type of spots, characterized by heavy traffic, pedestrians and vehicles interact in close proximity, often requiring sharp and aggressive maneuvers to avoid crashes. The model is based on the Probabilistic Navigation Function (PNF), originally developed for robotics motion planning, that constructs a trajectory according to the probabilistic collision risks. According to this model, pedestrians construct a virtual risk map that assigns the entire crossing area with probabilities for a collision with vehicles, and then select their actions based on their perceived probability for collision. Many accidents can be interpreted in terms of the proposed model, either as a result of incorrect perception of risks, or, despite proper estimation of risks, by a wrong choice of collision maneuvers. The development of the model follows a theoretical and experimental investigation of pedestrian/vehicle interactions at crosswalks. The model is implemented in an agent-based simulation system for pedestrian/driver interaction, and is validated using video clips taken at several congested road spots. It can be used for analyzing the effect of changes in location architecture and traffic regulations for each spot. The model can also serve as a standard tool in simulations for assessing accident risks in urban environments. Finally, it can be utilized in control systems of autonomous vehicles and in drivers' on-board alert systems.

AB Underwater high precision positioning and navigation is a key technical support for underwater accurate operation of autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV). Traditional AUV localization adopts acoustic positioning system (APS) mostly, and long baseline (LBL) is one of the most widely used. LBL can achieve a high positioning accuracy, but multiple acoustic beacons need to be deployed. The deployment, calibrating, and recycling of those beacons are time-consuming and labor-intensive. This article focuses on range-only single-beacon (ROSB) technology to realize AUV localization. Compared to LBL, ROSB can reduce the time and labor of deploying beacons greatly with only one beacon adopted. Aiming at the weakness of initial observation capacity in ROSB, a virtual beacon and adjustment theory-based initial location calculating algorithm is proposed. Furthermore, a ROSB-based underwater multisensor fusion positioning (UMFP) method using factor graph is presented, in which ROSB is fused with other sensors equipped on AUV. Experiments and simulations show that the ROSB based UMFP scheme can not only save time and labor greatly compared to LBL, but also achieve a high positioning accuracy.

AB The lighting quality of the unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) images is the key factor that affects the intelligent operation and maintenance efficiency in power system. When captured in low-light condition, the UAV images suffer from loss of details, leading to a decrease in object detection accuracy. However, the research is lacking with respect to low-light image enhancement for UAV-based overhead power transmission system images. In this letter, we propose a low-light image enhancement method based on Contrast Limited Adaptive Histogram Equalization (CLAHE) to robustify object detection against low-light condition. We first separate the luminance and chrominance channels of the UAV image via color space conversion so that CLAHE is used to enhance luminance contrast without introducing chrominance shift. Moreover, we optimize the contrast limit parameter in CLAHE to balance contrast enhancement and noise suppression, which further boosts object detection accuracy. Experimental results validate the effectiveness of the proposed scheme in detail enhancement without noise over-amplification, leading to a magnificent increase of insulator detection accuracy from 58.0% to 82.0%.

AB Plant protection unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) play a crucial role in agricultural aviation services. In recent years, plant protection UAVs, which improve the accuracy and eco-friendliness of agricultural techniques, have been used to overcome the shortcomings of traditional agricultural operations. First, this paper introduces the development scale, main types, and operation scenarios of China's plant protection UAVs. Subsequently, the key technologies of plant protection UAVs, such as precision autonomous flight control, pesticide spraying, drift control, and spraying quality measurement technologies, are reviewed. Next, the emergent technologies of plant protection UAVs are studied and analyzed with a focus on better spray effects, calculation models of droplet drift, controllable droplet size atomization technology, droplet drift detection technology, and droplet deposition quality detection technology in the application of plant protection UAVs. Moreover, the technologies of plant protection UAV application are summarized and future research prospects are presented, offering ideas for follow-up research on the key technologies of plant protection UAVs and encouraging agricultural production management to move toward better efficiency, eco-friendliness, and accuracy.

AB Automated driving systems (ADSs) allow vehicles to engage in self-driving under specific conditions. Along with the potential safety benefits, the increase in productivity through non-driving related tasks (NDRTs) is often cited as a motivation behind the adoption of ADSs. Although advances have been made in understanding both the promotion of ADS trust and its impact on NDRT performance, the influence of risk remains largely understudied. To fill this gap, we conducted a within-subjects experiment with 37 licensed drivers using a simulator. Internal risk was manipulated by ADS reliability and external risk by visibility, producing a 2 (ADS reliability) x 2 (visibility) design. The results indicate that high reliability increases ADS trust and further enhances the positive impact of ADS trust on NDRT performance, while low visibility reduces the negative impact of ADS trust on driver monitoring. Results also suggest that trust increases over time if the system is reliable and that visibility did not have a significant impact on ADS trust. These findings are important for the design of intelligent ADSs that can respond to drivers' trusting behaviors.

AB The long-term evolution multimedia broadcast multicast service (MBMS) infrastructure has been shown to efficiently fulfill the requirements of classical vehicle-to-vehicle services, such as cooperative awareness message and decentralized environmental notification message delivery, which involve the transmission of the same message to a set of destination receivers in close proximity. When targeting autonomous driving applications, related SG V2X services, such as cooperative collision avoidance (CCA), impose challenging latency and reliability requirements that cannot be generally guaranteed using the current MBMS architecture. In this paper, we propose a low-latency multicast scheme aimed at decreasing the end-to-end (E2E) communication latency. The proposed approach concentrates the multicast network functionalities into the layer-2 of the base stations (BSs) protocol stack, including a message passing between neighboring BSs, to achieve a fast management of multicast groups and a reduction of the communication path through the network infrastructure. The results show that the proposed technique can substantially decrease the E2E latency of conventional MBMS and ensure the correct operation of demanding services, such as CCA moving toward SG communication systems.

AB Two highly active mud volcanoes located in 990-1,265 m water depths were mapped on the northern Egyptian continental slope during the BIONIL expedition of R/V Meteor in October 2006. High-resolution swath bathymetry and backscatter imagery were acquired with an autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV)-mounted multibeam echosounder, operating at a frequency of 200 kHz. Data allowed for the construction of similar to 1 m pixel bathymetry and backscatter maps. The newly produced maps provide details of the seabed morphology and texture, and insights into the formation of the two mud volcanoes. They also contain key indicators on the distribution of seepage and its tectonic control. The acquisition of high-resolution seafloor bathymetry and acoustic imagery maps with an AUV-mounted multibeam echosounder fills the gap in spatial scale between conventional multibeam data collected from a surface vessel and in situ video observations made from a manned submersible or a remotely operating vehicle.

AB This paper presents an attempt to devise and develop a domain-independent reasoning system (DIRS) scheme for handling dynamic threats, and uses the scheme for automated route planning of military vehicles in an unstructured environment.
   Automated route planning is a very important branch in applications of artificial intelligence. In a dynamic unstructured environment, instead of simply using static cost from a mobility model, a dynamic cost surface is constructed in which the total cost is a linear combination of the static cost and the dynamic cost.
   The principal contributions of this paper are as follows: (i) A reasoning model called ''DIRS'' is proposed to quantitatively embed dynamic information, coordinate use of static and dynamic information, and handle real time events that happen outside the system. (ii) A temporal relation is applied in the route planning process for handling dynamic threats. (iii) Dempster-Shafer evidential theory is used to evaluate propagation of a dynamic threat, (iv) A detailed experimental analysis on automated route planning of military vehicles was conducted to study the performance of the DIRS model.

AB The truck platoon is one of the most promising connected and autonomous vehicle (CAV) technologies that can reduce fuel consumption and emission, enhance traffic safety, and increase roadway capacity. It is predicted to become mainstream in the next decade. Therefore, it is imperative to fully investigate the safety issues of the truck platoon before its large-scale deployment. However, studies on the lateral safety of the truck platoon under extreme weather, especially crosswinds are still lacking. To fill such a research gap, the current study contributes to the literature by proposing a reliability-based framework to evaluate the safety of the truck platoon regarding incursion into neighboring lanes due to extreme weather, especially crosswinds. The proposed approach involved three main steps: (1) the computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulation of the aerodynamics of the truck platoon; (2) the truck platoon driving simulation under crosswind; and (3) the advanced response surface model development and the reliability analysis. Four main factors regarding lateral safety of the platoon were considered: wind speed, road friction coefficients, driving speed, and inter-vehicle spacing. The maximum lateral displacement (MLD) was chosen as a measure of lateral safety. The results showed that there was a significant difference between the aerodynamics of a single truck and that of the truck platoon vehicles and the inter-vehicle spacing between trucks within the truck platoon barely influenced the MLD. The MLD was largest for the leading truck as compared to those of the following trucks. The inter-vehicle spacing didn't have a significant influence on MLD when the inter-vehicle spacing is shorter than 1.5 times of the truck length, while the other factors impacted the MLD significantly. In addition, the support vector regression with the radial basis function outperformed the other response surface functions. Based on reliability analysis, the risk level of the truck platoon was quantified using the safety index, and the impact of contributing factors towards the safety index of the truck platoon was also evaluated. This study confirmed that the proposed framework could be applied to evaluate the lateral safety of the truck platoon. The findings provide important practical implications for the decision-making of transportation management agencies and tailored countermeasures in the CAV) environment.

AB To minimize the human-machine conflict in the shared steering control system and protect the driving intention of the driver, a human-centered shared steering control system is proposed in obstacle avoidance scenarios. First, a framework is proposed based on the parallel shared steering control system framework, which includes the trajectory reconstruction, driver model, authority allocation model, autonomous controller, and vehicle. And mathematical model of the sub-modules in the shared steering control system is constructed. Then, the trajectory reconstruction method considering the driving intention of the driver is designed. A trigger mechanism with human-machine conflict as input is designed for trajectory reconstruction. More specifically, to protect the driving intention of the driver, the steering input of the driver is used as the constraint to reconstruct the trajectory. Finally, the effectiveness of the proposed method is verified by simulation. The simulation results show that the proposed method can effectively reduce human-machine conflict while the driving intention of the driver is protected. However, the trajectory tracking performance and lateral stability of the vehicle may be may sacrificed within a limited extent.

AB In this paper, we propose reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS)-assisted unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) networks that can utilise both advantages of UAV's agility and RIS's reflection for enhancing the network's performance. To aim at maximising the energy efficiency (EE) of the considered networks, we jointly optimise the power allocation of the UAVs and the phase-shift matrix of the RIS. A deep reinforcement learning (DRL) approach is proposed for solving the continuous optimisation problem with time-varying channels in a centralised fashion. Moreover, parallel learning approach is also proposed for reducing the latency of information transmission requirement of the centralised approach. Numerical results show a significant improvement of our proposed schemes compared with the conventional approaches in terms of EE, flexibility, and processing time. Our proposed DRL methods for RIS-assisted UAV networks can be used for real-time applications due to their capability of instant decision-making and handling the time-varying channel with the dynamic environmental setting.

AB Freeway traffic control is a broad research area, not only interesting for its applicative perspective, but also highly motivating for theoretical investigations. This research topic has been developed in the last decades by different research groups worldwide and still offers open problems and issues to tackle which may be a source of inspiration for the community of control engineers and scientists. Since the recent technological advances towards autonomous and connected vehicles suggest that a new era for road traffic is around the corner, a survey on well-established control methods for freeway traffic networks seems particularly useful now, to fix a milestone for all the researchers in the area, in order to be ready to face the challenges of the future traffic scenarios. In this survey paper, the control approaches developed in the last decades for freeway traffic control are reviewed and a bibliometric analysis on recent scientific works addressing this topic is reported.

AB In the wake of e-commerce and its successful diffusion in most commercial activities, last-mile distribution causes more and more trouble in urban areas all around the globe. Growing parcel volumes to be delivered toward customer homes increase the number of delivery vans entering the city centers and thus add to congestion, pollution, and negative health impact. Therefore, it is anything but surprising that in recent years many novel delivery concepts on the last mile have been innovated. Among the most prominent are unmanned aerial vehicles (drones) and autonomous delivery robots taking over parcel delivery. This paper surveys established and novel last-mile concepts and puts special emphasis on the decision problems to be solved when setting up and operating each concept. To do so, we systematically record the alternative delivery concepts in a compact notation scheme, discuss the most important decision problems, and survey existing research on operations research methods solving these problems. Furthermore, we elaborate promising future research avenues.

AB The emergence of collective motion in nature is ubiquitous and can be observed from colonies of bacteria to flocks of birds. The scientific community is interested in understanding how the local interactions drive the crowd toward global behaviors. This paper presents an agent-based reactive model for groups of vehicles that aims to make the formation to follow a moving reference, represented as a virtual agent. The model is called reactive because the agents do not keep previous information but only respond to the current system state. Moreover, they only communicate with their close neighbors, limited by their sensory radius, except with the virtual agent that can be seen by everyone at the whole time. The aim of the model is to group the agents around the virtual agent while it moves to desirable directions. We solve the inverse problem of parameter estimation in order to drive the model toward specific objectives. This task is performed with the Generalized Extremal Optimization (GEO) algorithm, and the results are tested with path planning scenarios. (C) 2018 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Setting a path is essential for reaching a target point and avoiding obstacles in the autonomous navigation system for an unmanned surface vehicle (USV). Accordingly, a decision algorithm for determining an optimized path, considering ocean environmental loads, is necessary. In this study, a genetic algorithm was used to determine the optimized path with the minimum travel time for a USV under environmental loads. The optimized paths were determined using numerical simulations. First, the path of the vessel under environmental loads was expressed using chromosomes consisting of the turning angle of the vessel per unit time. In the configuration of the decision algorithm, the following three objective functions were derived: avoiding obstacles, reaching a target point, and minimizing travel time. By integrating the three objective functions, a new fitness function was proposed. In addition, to determine the optimized path, the fitness evaluation of each chromosome was repeated for all generations using the fitness function. Using the proposed algorithm, the optimized paths were determined considering environmental loads and the allowed minimum distance of approach to an obstacle, and validated using numerical simulations.

AB The main contribution of this paper is the development of a rapid, dynamic path-planning system for 3-DOF marine surface vessels navigating in environments where other marine vehicles might be operating too. The method is based on the Voronoi diagram and generates the initial path while ensuring that clearance constraints are satisfied with respect to both land and shallow waters. Fermat's Spiral (FS) segments are used to connect successive straight lines, hence, resulting in curvature-continuous paths that are rapidly computed. When a ship is detected, the range of its position during a given time frame is estimated, and the path-planning system produces in real time a new safe and smooth path. The International Regulations for Preventing Collisions at Sea (COLREG) are taken into account in the replanning procedure. An indirect adaptive Line-Of-Sight (LOS) guidance algorithm from the existing literature is implemented to ensure the underactuated vessel will counteract the effects of unknown environmental forces, such as ocean currents, while converging to the safe path. Simulations show the effectiveness of the proposed approach.

AB This paper deals with the problem of determining the position and orientation of an autonomous guided vehicle (AGV) by fusing odometry with the information provided by a vision system, The main idea is to exploit the ability of pointing a camera in different directions, to fixate on a point of the environment while the AGV is moving. By fixating on a landmark, one can improve the navigation accuracy even if the scene coordinates of the landmark are unknown, This is a major improvement over previous methods which assume that the coordinates of the landmark are known, since any point of the observed scene can be selected as a landmark, and not just pre-measured points. This work argues that fixation is basically a simpler procedure than previously mentioned methods. The simplification comes from the fact that only one point needs to be tracked as opposed to multiple points in other methods. This disposes of the need to be able to identify which of the landmarks is currently being tracked, through a matching algorithm or by other means. We support our findings with both experimental and simulation results.

AB In order to enhance the performance of disturbance rejection in AUV's path tracking, this paper proposes a novel tube-based event-triggered path-tracking strategy. The proposed tracking strategy consists of a speed control law and an event-triggered tube model predictive control (tube MPC) scheme. Firstly, the speed control law using linear model predictive control (LMPC) technology is obtained to converge the nominal path-tracking deviation. Secondly, the event-triggered tube MPC scheme is used to calculate the optimal control input, which can enhance the performance of disturbance rejection. Considering the nonlinear hydrodynamic characteristics of AUV, a linear matrix inequality (LMI) is formulated to obtain tight constraints on the AUV and the feedback matrix. Moreover, to enhance real-time performance, tight constraints and the feedback matrix are all calculated offline. An event-triggering mechanism is used. When the surge speed change command does not exceed the upper bound, adaptive tight constraints are obtained. Finally, numerical simulation results show that the proposed tube-based event-triggered path-tracking strategy can enhance the performance of disturbance rejection and ensure good real-time performance.

AB Autonomous vehicles rely on LiDAR sensors to perceive the environment. Adverse weather conditions like rain, snow, and fog negatively affect these sensors, reducing their reliability by introducing unwanted noise in the measurements. In this work, we tackle this problem by proposing a novel approach for detecting adverse weather effects in LiDAR data. We reformulate this problem as an outlier detection task and use an energy-based framework to detect outliers in point clouds. More specifically, our method learns to associate low energy scores with inlier points and high energy scores with outliers allowing for robust detection of adverse weather effects. In extensive experiments, we show that our method performs better in adverse weather detection and has higher robustness to unseen weather effects than previous state-of-the-art methods. Furthermore, we show how our method can be used to perform simultaneous outlier detection and semantic segmentation. Finally, to help expand the research field of LiDAR perception in adverse weather, we release the SemanticSpray dataset, which contains labeled vehicle spray data in highway-like scenarios.

AB This research produced a model that detects abnormal phenomena on the road, based on deep learning, and proposes a service that can prevent accidents because of other cars and traffic congestion. After extracting accident images based on traffic accident video data by using FFmpeg for model production, car collision types are classified, and only the head-on collision types are processed by using the deep learning object-detection algorithm YOLO (You Only Look Once). Using the car accident detection model that we built and the provided road obstacle-detection model, we programmed, for when the model detects abnormalities on the road, warning notification and photos that captures the accidents or obstacles, which are then transferred to the application. The proposed service was verified through application notification simulations and virtual experiments using CCTVs in Daegu, Busan, and Gwangju. By providing services, the goal is to improve traffic safety and achieve the development of a self-driving vehicle sector. As a future research direction, it is suggested that an efficient CCTV control system be introduced for the transportation environment.

AB This letter is concerned with real-time background flow field estimation using distributed pressure sensor measurements for autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs). The goal of this study is to enhance environmental perception of AUVs especially in dynamic environments with changing flow patterns. Dynamic mode decomposition (DMD), a data-driven model reduction approach, is adopted to model the dynamic flow field using spatial basis modes and their corresponding temporal coefficients. This letter computes the DMD modes offline and applies a Bayesian filter to assimilate distributed pressure sensor measurements to estimate the DMD coefficients in real time. Further, fast Fourier transform (FFT) analysis is used to determine the flow pattern/model represented by DMD modes. Aiming to address the flow sensing problem in flow pattern changing environments, the proposed approach is expected to greatly improve environmental perception of AUVs in dynamic and complex flows. Both simulation and experimental results of flow sensing using three testing prototypes are presented to validate the proposed method.

AB Recent advancements in sensor technology have allowed unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) to function as sensing devices in cooperative aerial communication networks, offering novel solutions in applications of environment inspection, disaster detection and search and rescue operations. Towards this trend, the efficient deployment and coordination of UAV networks is of vital importance. Generating controlled experimental conditions to implement and evaluate different approaches in this context can be impractical and costly and thus the solution of modelling is often preferred. This paper introduces a tracking model in which multimtor UAVs, equipped with received signal strength indicator (RSSI) sensors, are organized in a swarm and cooperate to approximate and trail a moving target. The proposed algorithm is able to offer autonomous tracking in large scale environments, by utilising just the strength of the communication signal emitted by a radio frequency transmitter carried by the target. A model of the proposed algorithm is created, and its performance is thoroughly evaluated in a specialized simulator developed in the Processing IDE. Results demonstrate the increased tracking efficiency of the proposed solution compared to a trilateration method.

   interpolation; underwater mobile platforms
ID SPATIAL INTERPOLATION; OCEAN; COHERENCE
AB This article presents a kriged compressive sensing (KCS) approach to reconstruct acoustic fields using measurements collected by underwater mobile sensing platforms. The KCS approach has two steps. First, initial estimates are obtained from a kriging method by leveraging spatial statistical correlation properties of the acoustic fields. Second, selected initial estimates, treated as virtual samples, are combined with the measurements to perform field reconstruction through compressive sensing. To differentiate the fidelity between real measurements and virtual samples, we use the kriging variance to determine weight coefficients for the virtual samples estimated from kriging. Simulation results show that the proposed KCS approach can improve the reconstruction performance, in terms of the peak signal-to-noise ratio and structural similarity metrics. The KCS performance has been validated based on the acoustic intensity measurements collected by an autonomous underwater vehicle in a lake. The KCS methods have also been applied to process the ambient sound level measurements collected by an underwater glider in the South China Sea. The proposed KCS method leads to better performance than either the compressive sensing or the kriging method alone.

AB This paper proposes RUR53: an Unmanned Ground Vehicle able to navigate through, identify, and reach areas of interest. There, it can recognize, localize, and manipulate work tools to perform both indoor and outdoor complex tasks. Indeed, a wide range of sensors composes the robot and enables it to perceive vast workspaces, reach distant targets, and face the uncertainties of the real world. Precise object detection is also guaranteed, essential to manipulate objects of different shapes and materials. Moreover, a customized 3-finger gripper makes the gripping mode suitable for any lightweight object. Two modalities are proposed: autonomous and teleoperated, letting both unskilled and skilled human operators easily adapt the system to complete personalized tasks. The paper exhaustively describes RUR53 architecture and demonstrates its good performance while executing both indoor and outdoor navigation and manipulation tasks. A specific case study is described where the proposed modular architecture allows to easily switch to a semi-teleoperated mode: the 2017 Mohamed Bin Zayed International Robotics Challenge, where our team ranked third in the Grand Challenge in collaboration with the Czech Technical University in Prague, the University of Pennsylvania, and the University of Lincoln (UK).

AB As the demand for electric vehicles (EVs) and autonomous vehicles (AVs) rapidly grows, lower-cost, lighter, and stronger carbon fibers (CFs) are urgently needed to respond to consumers' call for greater EV traveling range and stronger safety structures for AVs. Converting polymeric precursors to CFs requires a complex set of thermochemical processes; a systematic understanding of each parameter in fiber conversion is still, to a large extent, lacking. Here, we demonstrate the effect of carbonization temperature on carbon ring structure formation by combining atomistic/microscale simulations and experimental validation. Experimental testing, as predicted by simulations, exhibited that the strength and ductility of PAN CFs decreased, whereas the Young's modulus increased with increasing carbonization temperature. Our simulations unveiled that high carbonization temperature accelerated the kinetics of graphitic phase nucleation and growth, leading to the decrease in strength and ductility but increase in modulus. The methodology presented herein using combined atomistic/microscale simulations and experimental validation lays a firm foundation for further innovation in CF manufacturing and low-cost alternative precursor development.

AB Autonomous robotic systems operating in the vicinity of other agents, such as humans, manually driven vehicles and other robots, can model the behaviour and estimate intentions of the other agents to enhance efficiency of their operation, while preserving safety. We propose a data-driven approach to model the behaviour of other agents, which is based on a set of trajectories navigated by other agents. Then, to evaluate the proposed behaviour modelling approach, we propose and compare two methods for agent intention estimation based on: (i) particle filtering; and (ii) decision trees. The proposed methods were validated using three datasets that consist of real-world bicycle and car trajectories in two different scenarios, at a roundabout and at a t-junction with a pedestrian crossing. The results validate the utility of the data-driven behaviour model, and show that decision-tree based intention estimation works better on a binary-class problem, whereas the particle-filter based technique performs better on a multi-class problem, such as the roundabout, where the method yielded an average gain of 14.88 m for correct intention estimation locations compared to the decision-tree based method.

AB This paper presents a predefined performance design approach for distributed containment control of networked heterogeneous underactuated surface vessels (USVs) under a directed graph topology. It is assumed that the position information of multiple dynamic leaders is informed to only a subset of the followers consisting of USVs and all nonlinearities and external forces in each USV follower are unknown. The local control law for each USV follower is recursively designed using the predefined performance design technique where auxiliary variables are presented to deal with underactuated constraints in the predefined performance design framework and the approach angles capable of the tracking of both straight and curved line are employed. Compared with the existing literature on the control of multiple ocean vehicles with uncertainties, the proposed distributed control methodology is simply designed without using any function approximators and adaptive techniques to estimate uncertainties or their bounds. It is shown that the distributed containment errors are preserved within the predefined bounds of transient and steady-state performance in the Lyapunov sense. (C) 2016 The Franklin Institute.

AB This paper addresses the source-seeking problem in which a group of autonomous vehicles must locate and follow the source of some signal based on measurements of the signal strength at different positions. Based on the observation that the gradient of the signal strength can be approximated by a circular formation of agents via a simple weighted average of the signal measured by each agent, we propose a combination of a cooperative control law to stabilize the agents to a circular formation and a distributed consensus-based source-seeking algorithm, which is guaranteed to steer the circular formation toward the vicinity of the source location. In particular, the proposed algorithm is provided with two tunable parameters that allow for a tradeoff between speed of convergence, noise filtering, and formation stability. The benefit of using consensus-based algorithms resides in a more realist discrete time control of the agents and in asynchronous communication resilient to delays, which is particularly relevant for underwater applications. The analytic results are complemented with numerical simulations.

ID DOCKING
AB The underwater recovery of autonomous underwater vehicles (AUV) is a process of 6-DOF motion control, which is related to characteristics with strong nonlinearity and coupling. In the recovery mission, the vehicle requires high level control accuracy. Considering an AUV called BSAV, this paper established a kinetic model to describe the motion of AUV in the horizontal plane, which consisted of nonlinear equations. On the basis of this model, the main coupling variables were analyzed during recovery. Aiming at the strong coupling problem between the heading control and sway motion, we designed a decoupling compensator based on the fuzzy theory and the decoupling theory. We analyzed to the rules of fuzzy compensation, the input and output membership functions of fuzzy compensator, through compose operation and clear operation of fuzzy reasoning, and obtained decoupling compensation quantity. Simulation results show that the fuzzy decoupling controller effectively reduces the overshoot of the system, and improves the control precision. Through the water tank experiments and analysis of experimental data, the effectiveness and feasibility of AUV recovery movement coordinated control based on fuzzy decoupling method are validated successful, and show that the fuzzy decoupling control method has a high practical value in the recovery mission.

AB Work towards making automated driving systems a reality is well underway. In this study, we look at what is likely to be one of the first widespread implementations of a form of automated driving on public roads, i.e., truck platooning, where virtually connected trucks drive at short headways to save fuel and associated emissions. With progressing technology, we may see platoons with drivers resting while being in the truck, or even platoons in which not all trucks require drivers. Hence, platooning technology has a significant impact on the jobs of truck drivers especially when driver involvement reduces. Driver acceptance of this emerging technology is therefore an important factor in the implementation of platooning and, consequently, automated driving in general. In this study, we explore the range of perspectives that exist among drivers by conducting focus groups in The Netherlands. These discussions indicate that drivers foresee that platooning will eventually become a reality but believe it will have a negative impact on the quality of their work and their job satisfaction.

AB This paper analyzes the impact of C-ITS service on driving behavior, focusing on a pilot project in Daejeon-Sejong, South Korea. C-ITS, an advanced technology, enables bidirectional wireless communication between vehicles or infrastructure, allowing for real-time traffic data collection and dissemination. The study uses a unique analytical method, employing parallel processing techniques for variable extraction and a paired t-test to examine the short-term effects of C-ITS on driving behavior. Findings indicate a significant change in drivers' behavior, particularly in average speed, hard braking rate, severe deceleration rate, speeding rate, and excessive speeding rate, towards safer trends after receiving C-ITS warning services. Reductions in hard braking and severe deceleration were immediate after C-ITS service initiation, while a decrease in excessive speeding was observed after four months. Further research is needed to identify other potential influencing variables and provide an unbiased evaluation of C-ITS effectiveness. The study's implications highlight its role in promoting public acceptance of C-ITS-service-based cooperative autonomous driving strategies.

AB This letter proposes a generalised propulsion energy consumption model (PECM) for rotary-wing unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) under the consideration of the practical thrust-to-weight ratio (TWR) with respect to the velocity, acceleration and direction change of the UAVs. To verify the effectiveness of the proposed PECM, we consider a UAV-enabled communication system, where a rotary-wing UAV serves multiple ground users as an aerial base station. We aim to maximize the energy efficiency (EE) of the UAV by jointly optimizing the user scheduling and UAV trajectory variables. However, the formulated problem is a non-convex fractional integer programming problem, which is challenging to obtain its optimal solution. To tackle this problem, we propose an efficient iterative algorithm by decomposing the original problem into two sub-problems to obtain a suboptimal solution based on the successive convex approximation technique. Simulation results show that the optimized UAV trajectory by applying the proposed PECM are smoother and the corresponding EE has significant improvement as compared to other benchmark schemes.

AB Aiming at the control problem of autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) pilot-following formation with communication delay and communication interruption, a controller based on feedback linearization and the PD control method is designed in this paper. Firstly, the nonlinear, strongly coupled vehicle model is transformed into a second-order model via the feedback linearization method, and then the formation coordination controller is designed based on consistency theory and the PD control method. The Markov random jump process is used to simulate the formation topology in the event of communication interruption. The condition of stable convergence of the AUV pilot-following formation is analyzed in the presence of time-varying delay and Markov transformation topology. A Lyapunov-Krasovskii equation is established, and linear matrix inequality (LMI) is used to solve the problem of communication interruption and communication delay. The boundary conditions of error convergence of the control system are obtained. Finally, the effectiveness of the formation coordination controller based on the second-order integral model under the unstable conditions of underwater acoustic communication is verified by simulation.

AB Safety on roads is of uttermost importance, especially in the context of autonomous vehicles. A critical need is to detect and communicate disruptive incidents early and effectively. In this paper we propose a system based on an off-the-shelf deep neural network architecture that is able to detect and recognize types of unsigned (non-placarded, such as traffic signs), physical (visible in images) road incidents. We develop a taxonomy for unsigned physical incidents to provide a means of organizing and grouping related incidents. After selecting eight target types of incidents, we collect a dataset of twelve thousand images gathered from publicly-available web sources. We subsequently fine-tune a convolutional neural network to recognize the eight types of road incidents. The proposed model is able to recognize incidents with a high level of accuracy (higher than 90%). We further show that while our system generalizes well across spatial context by training a classifier on geostratified data in the United Kingdom (with an accuracy of over 90%), the translation to visually less similar environments requires spatially distributed data collection.

AB This paper proposes an offline path planning method based on the Improved Quantum Particle Swarm Optimization (IQPSO) algorithm for Autonomous Underwater Vehicles (AUVs) in the underwater environment. The spherical modelling method is adopted to represent irregular underwater obstacles as spheres with a specified radius. Then, the IQPSO algorithm is developed to solve the problem of the limitations of the convergence and optimization ability of the traditional Quantum Particle Swarm Optimization (QPSO) algorithm and to identify the best path for AUVs. In this algorithm, to satisfy the three factors of path safety, path length and angle change of the path point, the fitness function is constructed to achieve multi-objective optimization. A smooth path is designed using the cubic spline interpolation algorithm. Different scenes or the same scene with different obstacles are designed to verify the effectiveness of the algorithm. The simulation results show that compared with PSO algorithm, QPSO algorithm, EGA algorithm and DENPSO algorithm, the path generated by IQPSO algorithm in various scenes is shorter, smoother and more stable.

DE Differential Evolution algorithm; Electric vehicle charging stations;
   Renewable energy sources; Autonomous microgrid
AB Electric Vehicles (EVs) are seen to have some negative impacts on microgrid performance, such as diminishing power quality and efficiency and increasing power losses, voltage variations and even customer energy prices. This paper proposes a new method for evaluating the effect of integrating a large number of EVs on a power system and their impact on the network voltage profile via injecting reactive power into highly-loaded buses. A multi-objective optimization problem is developed to obtain the optimal siting and sizing of charging stations and renewable energy sources (RES). The optimization problem focuses on reducing power losses, improving voltage stability of the system and reducing charging costs of EVs. In order to increase the network load factor some coefficients are introduced. Such coefficients, which depend on wind speed, solar irradiance and hourly peak demand ratio in the load characteristic of day-ahead, help aggregators to charge their EVs in off-peak hours. Differential Evolution (DE) algorithm is used for solving the optimization problem. The performance of the proposed method is evaluated for 69-bus and 94-bus microgrids. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

AB Planning cooperative trajectories in real time is of great importance for multiple unmanned combat aerial vehicles (multi-UCAV) in performing autonomous time-critical cooperative air-to-ground target attack missions. The models of the vehicle, constraints, and a multi-criteria objective function are set up, and then the problem is formulated as a decentralized cooperative receding horizon optimal control problem. An elaborate framework for provable effective decentralized cooperative trajectory planning in two-degree-of-freedom decentralized receding horizon control is presented to provide the robustness and adaptivity for trajectory planning in dynamic and uncertain environments. Furthermore, a two-stage iterative optimization algorithm is developed to solve the problem. The novel algorithm integrates the differential flatness theory to generate trajectories, and the coordination variable-based strategy to coordinate the arrival time of multi-UCAV online, which can improve the computational efficiency and achieve the cooperative objective. The results of numerical simulations show that the proposed approach is feasible and well suited for the real-time implementation in dynamic and uncertain environment.

ID MULTIPLE DEPOT; TRANSFORMATION; PATHS
AB This paper addresses a multirobot scheduling problem in which autonomous unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) must be recharged during a long-term mission. The proposal is to introduce a separate team of dedicated charging robots that the UAVs can dock with in order to recharge. The goal is to schedule and plan minimum cost paths for charging robots such that they rendezvous with and replenish the UAVs, as needed, during the mission. The approach is to discretize the 3-D UAV flight trajectories into sets of projected charging points on the ground, thus allowing the problem to be abstracted onto a partitioned graph. Solutions consist of charging robot paths that collectively charge each of the UAVs. The problem is solved by first formulating the rendezvous planning problem to recharge each UAV once using both an integer linear program and a transformation to the Travelling Salesman Problem. The methods are then leveraged to plan recurring rendezvous' over longer horizons using fixed horizon and receding horizon strategies. Simulation results using realistic vehicle and battery models demonstrate the feasibility and robustness of the proposed approach.

DE Bottom-following; AUVs; Nonlinear output regulation
AB In this note we propose a solution for the automatic bottom-following problem for a low cost autonomous underwater vehicle. We consider the case that the seabed profile is not known in advance, and we show that it is possible to solve the bottom-following using only one echo sounder and without the need to measure the vertical velocity component (heave velocity). To this effect, we propose an output feedback controller that is obtained by first re-formulating the bottom-following into a trajectory tracking problem, then constructing a reference signal generator (the exo-system) using Fourier series theory, and finally solving the control design problem in the framework of nonlinear output regulation theory. An interesting feature of this approach is that the combination of the Fourier series with output regulation problem allows to bypass the need to compute explicitly the Fourier coefficients. To obtain an approximate solution of the resulting regulator equations we resort to pseudo-spectral methods. Stability analysis that takes explicitly into account the effects of the inner-loop autopilots, disturbances, and measurement noise is presented. Simulation results with real seabed data show the effectiveness of the proposed controller. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

DE MAV navigation; 3D map generation; Mesh map; Terrain exploration;

AB Recent development showed that Micro Aerial Vehicles (MAVs) are nowadays capable of autonomously take off at one point and land at another using only one single camera as exteroceptive sensor. During the flight and landing phase the MAV and user have, however, little knowledge about the whole terrain and potential obstacles. In this paper we show a new solution for a real-time dense 3D terrain reconstruction. This can be used for efficient unmanned MAV terrain exploration and yields a solid base for standard autonomous obstacle avoidance algorithms and path planners. Our approach is based on a textured 3D mesh on sparse 3D point features of the scene. We use the same feature points to localize and control the vehicle in the 3D space as we do for building the 3D terrain reconstruction mesh. This enables us to reconstruct the terrain without significant additional cost and thus in real-time. Experiments show that the MAV is easily guided through an unknown, GPS denied environment. Obstacles are recognized in the iteratively built 3D terrain reconstruction and are thus well avoided.

ID AD HOC NETWORKS; MECHANISM; PROTOCOL
AB In the autonomous environment of Vehicular Ad hoc NETwork (VANET), vehicles randomly move with high speed and rely on each other for successful data transmission process. The routing can be difficult or impossible to predict in such intermittent vehicles connectivity and highly dynamic topology. The existing routing solutions do not consider the knowledge that behaviour patterns exist in real-time urban vehicular networks. In this article, we propose a fuzzy-assisted social-based routing (FAST) protocol that takes the advantage of social behaviour of humans on the road to make optimal and secure routing decisions. FAST uses prior global knowledge of real-time vehicular traffic for packet routing from the source to the destination. In FAST, fuzzy inference system leverages friendship mechanism to make critical decisions at intersections which is based on prior global knowledge of real-time vehicular traffic information. The simulation results in urban vehicular environment for with and without obstacles scenario show that the FAST performs best in terms of packet delivery ratio with upto 32% increase, average delay 80% decrease, and hops count 50% decrease compared to the state of the art VANET routing solutions.

AB This article presents the development of an autonomous flight control system for a small-scale unmanned helicopter based on an online adaptive learning-based observer and model predictive control (MPC). The adaptive learning-based observer provides an approximate dynamic inversion for solving the coupled dynamic problem. The discrete-time MPC (DMPC) uses a prediction process to obtain a stable model. The Laguerre function, a state observer, and a recursive learning algorithm were integrated into DMPC, the core of the flight control system. Exponential data weighting was adopted to increase the stability of the designed flight control system. By integrating these approaches, an adaptive learning-based flight control system, which consists of the pitch, roll, yaw, and heave controllers, is presented to evaluate the stability and performance of the proposed autonomous flight control system of an unmanned helicopter. Moreover, an adaptive controller based on neural approximation for yaw motion is used to improve the performance of yawing control of the helicopter. In order to validate the feasibility of the proposed method, a hardware-in-the-loop simulation was performed in real time. The system included an embedded system, a self-developed users interface, and the X-plane flight simulator. The simulation results showed that the flight control system was able to maintain the position and the attitude of the helicopter in hover mode under the influence of wind gust and disturbance. The proposed method had better performance than a robust control system, in both ideal and disturbed environments.

AB Traffic waves, known also as stop-and-go waves or phantom jams, appear naturally as traffic instabilities, also in confined environments as a ring-road. A multi-population traffic is studied on a ring-road, comprised of drivers with stable and unstable behavior. There exists a critical penetration rate of stable vehicles above which the system is stable, and under which the system is unstable. In the latter case, stop-and-go waves appear, provided enough cars are on the road. The critical penetration rate is explicitly computable, and, in reasonable situations, a small minority of aggressive drivers is enough to destabilize an otherwise very stable flow. This is a source of instability that a single population model would not be able to explain. Also, the multi-population system can be stable below the critical penetration rate if the number of cars is sufficiently small. Instability emerges as the number of cars increases, even if the traffic density remains the same (i.e., number of cars and road size increase similarly). This shows that small experiments could lead to deducing imprecise stability conditions.

AB This article presents a precise landing system that allows rotary-wing UAVs to approach and land safely on moving platforms, without using GNSS at any stage of the landing maneuver, and with a centimeter level accuracy and high level of robustness. This system implements a novel concept where the relative position and velocity between the aerial vehicle and the landing platform are calculated from the angles of a cable that physically connects the UAV and the landing platform. The use of a cable also incorporates a number of extra benefits, such as increasing the precision in the control of the UAV altitude. It also facilitates centering the UAV right on top of the expected landing position, and increases the stability of the UAV just after contacting the landing platform. The system was implemented in an unmanned helicopter and many tests were carried out under different conditions for measuring the accuracy and the robustness of the proposed solution. Results show that the developed system allowed landing with centimeter accuracy by using only local sensors and that the helicopter could follow the landing platform in multiple trajectories at different velocities.

TI Vision-only control and guidance for aircraft
SO JOURNAL OF FIELD ROBOTICS

DT Article
AB An unmanned aerial vehicle usually carries an array of sensors whose output is used to estimate vehicle attitude, velocity, and position. This paper details the development of guidance, navigation, and control strategies for a glider, which is capable of flying a terminal trajectory to a known fixed object using only a single vision sensor. Controlling an aircraft using only vision presents two unique challenges: First, absolute state measurements are not available from a single image; and second, the images must be collected and processed at a high rate to achieve the desired controller performance. The image processor utilizes an integral image representation and a rejective cascade filter to find and classify simple features in the images, reducing the image to the most probable pixel location of the destination object. Then, an extended Kalman filter uses measurements obtained from a single image to estimate the states that would otherwise be unobservable in a single image. In this research, the flights are constrained to keep the destination object in view. The approach is validated through simulation. Finally, experimental data from autonomous flights of a glider, instrumented only with a single nose-mounted camera, intercepting a target window during short low-level flights, are presented.

AB Self-driving vehicles are gradually becoming a reality. But the consequences of introducing such automated vehicles (AVs) into current road traffic cannot be clearly foreseen yet, especially for pedestrian safety. The present study used virtual reality to examine the pedestrians' crossing behavior in front of AVs as compared to conventional cars (CVs). Thirty young (ages 21-39) and 30 older (ages 68-81) adults participated in a simulated street-crossing experiment allowing for a real walk across an experimental two-way street. Participants had to cross (or not cross) in mixed traffic conditions where highly perceptible AVs always stopped to let them cross, while CVs did not brake to give them the right of way. Available time gap (from 1 to 5 s), approach speed (30 or 50 km/h), and the lane in which the cars were approaching (near and/or far lane of the two-way street) were varied. The results revealed a significantly higher propensity to cross the street, at shorter gaps, when AVs gave way to participants in the near lane while CVs were approaching in the far lane, leading to more collisions in this condition than in the others. These risky decisions were observed for both young and older participants, but much more so for the older ones. The results also indicated hesitation to cross in front of an AV in both lanes of the two-way street, with later initiations and longer crossing times, especially for the young participants and when the AVs were approaching at a short distance and braked suddenly. This study highlights the potential risks for pedestrians of introducing AVs into current road traffic, complicating the street-crossing task for young and older people alike. Future studies should look further into the role of repeated practice and trust in AVs. The design of these vehicles must also be addressed. Some practical recommendations are provided.

AB With the rapid development of autonomous driving technology, a variety of high-performance end-to-end driving models (E2EDMs) are being proposed. In order to understand the computational methods of E2EDMs, pixel-level explanations methods are used to obtain the explanations of the E2EDMs. However, little attention has been paid to the excellence of the explanations of E2EDMs. Therefore, in order to build trustworthy E2EDMs, we focus on improving the persuasibility of the explanations of E2EDMs. We propose an object-level explanation method (main approach) for E2EDMs, which masks the objects in the image and then treats the change in the prediction result as the importance of the objects, then we explain the E2EDM by the importance of each object. To further validate the effectiveness of object-level explanations, we propose another approach (validation approach), which trains E2EDMs with object information as input and generates the importance of objects using general explanation methods. Both approaches generate object-level explanations, in order to compare these object-level explanations with traditional pixel-level explanations, we propose experimental methods to measure the persuasibility of explanations of E2EDMs through a subjective and objective method. The subjective method evaluates persuasibility based on the extent to which participants think the importance of features indicated by the explanations is correct. The objective method evaluates the persuasibility based on the human annotation similarity between provided with only the important part of images and provided with the complete images. The experimental results show that the object-level explanations are more persuasive than the traditional pixel-level explanations.

AB The last decade has witnessed a growing demand for precise positioning in many applications, including autonomous car navigation. The safety features in autonomous driving and Advanced Driver Assistance Systems (ADAS) require lane-level positioning accuracy. Such accuracy can be obtained from the Global Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSS) through either differential techniques or Precise Point Positioning (PPP). PPP is currently favored over differential GNSS because it provides a global solution without the need for local reference stations. Nevertheless, employing PPP for land vehicles would be challenging due to frequent signal degradation and blockage. Integrating PPP with an Inertial Navigation System (INS) can solve the solution continuity problem; however, the INS solution drifts over time, resulting in losing the desired accuracy. Implementing a reliable PPP/INS system that can preserve the required accuracy is not trivial, especially with financial and computational cost constraints. This article proposes the integration of PPP with the Reduced Inertial Sensor System (RISS) for lane-level car navigation. The high-precision needed in lane-level positioning can be achieved by integrating PPP with high-end INS. Since high-end INS are expensive, this work proposes the use of RISS instead of the traditional INS. RISS uses only one gyroscope and two accelerometers, which can save more than half the high-end INS cost. The proposed PPP/RISS system was tested through three road tests that included highway driving under several overpasses. The system was able to maintain horizontal position errors of less than 50 cm.

AB Target tracking using an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) is a challenging robotic problem. It requires handling a high level of nonlinearity and dynamics. Model-free control effectively handles the uncertain nature of the problem, and reinforcement learning (RL)-based approaches are a good candidate for solving this problem. In this article, the Twin Delayed Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient Algorithm (TD3), as recent and composite architecture of RL, was explored as a tracking agent for the UAV-based target tracking problem. Several improvements on the original TD3 were also performed. First, the proportional-differential controller was used to boost the exploration of the TD3 in training. Second, a novel reward formulation for the UAV-based target tracking enabled a careful combination of the various dynamic variables in the reward functions. This was accomplished by incorporating two exponential functions to limit the effect of velocity and acceleration to prevent the deformation in the policy function approximation. In addition, the concept of multistage training based on the dynamic variables was proposed as an opposing concept to one-stage combinatory training. Third, an enhancement of the rewarding function by including piecewise decomposition was used to enable more stable learning behaviour of the policy and move out from the linear reward to the achievement formula. The training was conducted based on fixed target tracking followed by moving target tracking. The flight testing was conducted based on three types of target trajectories: fixed, square, and blinking. The multistage training achieved the best performance with both exponential and achievement rewarding for the fixed trained agent with the fixed and square moving target and for the combined agent with both exponential and achievement rewarding for a fixed trained agent in the case of a blinking target. With respect to the traditional proportional differential controller, the maximum error reduction rate is 86%. The developed achievement rewarding and the multistage training opens the door to various applications of RL in target tracking.

AB This paper presents a Variable Speed Limit (VSL) control algorithm for simultaneously maximizing the mobility, safety and environmental benefit in a Connected Vehicle environment. Development of Connected Vehicle (CV)/Autonomous Vehicle (AV) technology has the potential to provide essential data at the microscopic level to provide a better understanding of real-time driver behavior. This paper investigated a VSL control algorithm using a microscopic approach by focusing on individual driver's behavior (e.g., acceleration and deceleration) through the use of Model Predictive Control (MPC) approach. A multi-objective optimization function was formulated with the aim of finding a balanced trade-off among mobility, safety and sustainability. A microscopic traffic flow prediction model was used to calculate Total Travel Time (TIT); a surrogate safety measure Time To Collision (TTC) was used to measure instantaneous safety; and, a microscopic fuel consumption model (VT-Micro) was used to measure the environmental impact. Real-time driver's compliance to the posted speed limit was used to adjust the optimal speed limit values. A sensitivity analysis was conducted to compare the performance of the developed approach for different weights in the objective function and for two different percentages of CV. The results showed that with 100% penetration rate, the developed VSL approach outperformed the uncontrolled scenario consistently, resulting in up to 20% of total travel time reductions, 6-11% of safety improvements and 5-16% reduction in fuel consumptions. Our findings revealed that the scenario which optimized for safety alone, resulted in more optimum improvements as compared to the multi-criteria optimization. Thus, one can argue that in case of 100% penetration rates of CVs, optimizing for safety alone is enough to achieve simultaneous and optimum improvements in all measures. However, mixed results were obtained in case of lower % penetration rate which showed higher collision risk when optimizing for only mobility or fuel consumption. This indicates that with such % penetration rate, multi-criteria optimization is crucial to realize optimum and balanced benefits for the examined measures. (C) 2015 The Authors.

AB The identification of "industrial soot" or "vehicle exhaust" pollution facilitates developing proper measures for the mitigation of regional air pollution. In order to identify the pollution types at a regional level, this paper applies the Luenberger productivity indicator to decompose air pollutant emissions performance. Furthermore, we simultaneously consider pollution rates and the productivity change. Thus, we propose a new modeling framework allowing for the variable-specific decomposition of the environmental performance along time and quantity dimensions to identify the underlying patterns. The panel data for 30 provinces and autonomous regions are then applied to identify regional atmospheric pollution type. The results show that SO2 emission from industrial soot and NOx emissions from vehicle exhaust constitute an important source of regional atmospheric environmental inefficiency, though the former seems to be more decisive. The southeast coastal provinces showed generally lower levels of inefficiency, compared to the northwest inland area. During the period of the 11th Five-Year Plan of China, industrial SO2 emission performance contributed to the increase in the atmospheric environmental productivity, while traffic NOx emissions acted as a negative factor in this regard. Therefore, the government should seek to increase the intensity of environmental regulation in transportation sector. At the country level, technical progress associated with both types of pollutions was positive and thus exceed the negative efficiency change for the same variables. In particular, in Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei region, the productivity changes in industrial SO2 emissions and traffic NOx emissions indicate a "stably advancing" type. The results further indicate that there are 18 provinces of China which have experienced mixed-type pollution. Jilin and Hainan were classified as provinces experiencing vehicle exhaust gas pollution, whereas Guizhou was defined as that subject to industrial soot pollution. The government should formulate and implement diversified support and regulation policies to govern SO2 and NOx pollution at the regional level. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB LiDAR is an indispensable sensor for autonomous driving that can provide precise 3D information about the environment. Among various types of LiDARs, mechanical LiDARs are the most commonly used on vehicles that uniformly perceive the scene utilizing rotating motors. However, accurate perception of foreground objects is considered as the most important task in automotive LiDARs, therefore the current operating mode of mechanical LiDARs wastes a significant amount of sensing resources on the useless background. Besides, the development of LiDAR hardware and software systems is currently split into two independent segments, lacking real-time interaction between physical entities and digital models in cyberspace. To address these issues, we propose software-defined active LiDARs for autonomous driving based on parallel intelligence. Active LiDARs redefine LiDAR's hardware operation through software systems to achieve adaptive sensing resource allocation, constituting a closed loop between physical space and cyberspace. During the working process, it calculates scenario heatmaps with the constructed high-definition maps (HD maps) in cyberspace at first. Then it takes prescriptive control of physical LiDARs based on heatmaps to improve sensing resource utilization. We build two adaptive LiDAR models in CARLA and construct a hardware prototype in the parallel sensing platform, DAWN. Active Point Cloud (APC), a new dataset collected in CARLA, is proposed and a 3D object detection task is selected to demonstrate the effectiveness of active LiDARs. Our experimental results show that active LiDARs can both improve raw data quality and model performance compared with mechanical LiDARs, especially for the perception of distant objects.

AB Aerobraking is used to insert a spacecraft into a low orbit around a planet through many orbital passages into its complex atmosphere. The aerobraking atmospheric passages are challenging because of the high variability of the atmospheric environment. This paper develops a parallel domain randomized deep reinforcement learning architecture for autonomous decision-making in a stochastic environment, such as aerobraking atmospheric passages. In this context, the architecture is used for planning aerobraking maneuvers to avoid the occurrence of thermal violations during the atmospheric aerobraking passages and target a final low-altitude orbit. The parallel domain randomized deep reinforcement learning architecture is designed to account for large variability of the physical model, as well as uncertain conditions. Also, the parallel approach speeds up the training process for simulation-based applications, and domain randomization improves resultant policy generalization. This framework is applied to the 2001 Mars Odyssey aerobraking campaign; with respect to the 2001 Mars Odyssey mission flight data and a Numerical Predictor Corrector (NPC)-based state-of-the-art heuristic for autonomous aerobraking, the proposed architecture outperforms the state-of-the-art heuristic algorithm with a decrease of 97.5% in the number of thermal violations. Furthermore, it yields a reduction of 98.7% in the number of thermal violations with respect to the Mars Odyssey mission flight data and requires 13.9% fewer orbits. Results also show that the proposed architecture can also learn a generalized policy in the presence of strong uncertainties, such as aggressive atmospheric density perturbations, different atmospheric density models, and a different simulator maximum step size and error accuracy.

AB Maritime autonomous surface ships (MASS) need to be sufficiently safe to gain commercial acceptance. Collision avoidance strategies in such MASS should comply with the International Regulations for Preventing Collision at the Sea (COLREGs). According to the COLREGs, collision risk assessment, which determines the optimal positioning and timing via all available means appropriate to the prevailing circumstances and conditions, is crucial for preventing collisions. However, existing collision risk assessment methods do not consider all vital factors for the COLREGs rules compliant collision avoidance. We propose a collision risk inference system for MASS that complies with COLREGs vital rules for collision avoidance as follows: 1) actions to avoid collision are defined according to the degree of danger, and a suitable response distance is determined; 2) a collision risk index according to the enlarged ship domain based on the designated response distance by each level is set; 3) all vital factors of the COLREGs rules compliant collision avoidance are extracted as the data when the ship domain enlarged by each level is overlapped; 4) the collision risk inference system is developed by learning extracted data via the adaptive neuro fuzzy inference system. In contrast to existing research, the proposed system considers all vital variables in the COLREGs rules compliant collision avoidance guidelines, thereby improving the timings and positionings of the potential collision warning. Consequently, it could secure more time for decision making to take necessary collision prevention action.

AB Car passengers are frequently sitting in non-nominal postures and are able to perform a wide range of activities since they are not limited by tasks related to vehicle control, contrary to drivers. The anticipated introduction of Autonomous Driven vehicles could allow "drivers" to adopt similar postures and being involved in the same activities as passengers, allowing them a similar set of non-nominal postures. Therefore, the need to investigate the effects of non-nominal occupant sitting postures during relevant car crash events is becoming increasingly important.
   This study aims to investigate the effect of different postures of passengers in the front seat of a car on kinematic and kinetic responses during intersection crashes. A Human Body Model (HBM) was positioned in a numerical model of the front passenger seat of a midsize Sports Utility Vehicle (SUV) in a total of 35 postures, including variations to the lower and upper extremities, torso, and head postures. Three crash configurations, representative of predicted urban intersection crashes, were assessed in a simulation study; two side impacts, a near-side and a far-side, respectively, and a frontal impact. The occupant kinematics and internal loads were analyzed, and any deviation between the nominal and altered posture responses were quantified using cross-correlation of signals to highlight the most notable variations.
   Posture changes to the lower extremities had the largest overall influence on the lower extremities, pelvis, and whole-body responses for all crash configurations. In the frontal impact, crossing the legs allowed for the highest pelvis excursions and rotations, which affected the whole-body response the most. In the two side-impacts, leaning the torso in the coronal plane affected the torso and head kinematics by changing the interaction with the vehicle's interior. Additionally, in far-side impacts supporting the upper extremity on the center console resulted in increased torso excursions. Moreover, the response of the upper extremities was consistently sensitive to posture variations of all body regions.

AB This study uses a unique dataset on the cost of motoring in Germany to analyse cost competitiveness of emerging mobility-on-demand (MOD) services. Previous studies have focused on comparing current and projected MOD prices with the average cost of private motoring. This study quantifies which proportion of private car travel would actually turn out to be costlier than MOD given that MOD costs drop below certain levels relative to the cost of private motoring. In this context, not the average but the distribution of the costs of motoring are the key issue. These costs are strongly skewed across the cars in private households when including new and old vehicles: a large proportion of private car kilometres are driven at relatively low cost. The study uses simplified scenario settings with MOD price levels ranging from 0.1 euro/km to 1.5 euro/km to make predictions of hypothetical modal shifts under the assumption that car user switch to the most economic mode of travel. These modal shifts serve as an indicator of MOD cost competitiveness. The results indicate that MOD prices would have to drop to 0.5 euro/km or lower to have a notable impact on use of the private car if cost was the key mode choice criterion. Only if MOD prices drop down to a level of about 0.3 euro/km-quite possibly a lower boundary for automated MOD-MOD-enabled mobility packages would be the less costly alternative to the private car for a substantial proportion of mileage. However, even at that MOD price level, the private car would still be the most economic option for the majority of today's car user kilometres. Our findings illustrate that the skewed distribution of the cost of owning and running private cars-where many of those who drive much drive inexpensively-substantially dampens the disruptive potential of MOD. While we use data from Germany to illustrate this, many of our findings are more widely applicable.

AB Radio tagging and tracking are fundamental to understanding the movements and habitats of wildlife in their natural environments. Today, the most widespread, widely applicable technology for gathering data relies on experienced scientists armed with handheld radio-telemetry equipment to locate low-power radio transmitters attached to wildlife from the ground. Although aerial robots can transform labor-intensive conservation tasks, the realization of autonomous systems for tackling task complexities under real-world conditions remains a challenge. We developed ConservationBots-small aerial robots for tracking multiple, dynamic, radio-tagged wildlife. The aerial robot achieves robust localization performance and fast task completion times-significant for energy-limited aerial systems while avoiding close encounters with potential, counterproductive disturbances to wildlife. Our approach overcomes the technical and practical problems posed by combining a lightweight sensor with new concepts: (i) planning to determine both trajectory and measurement actions guided by an information-theoretic objective, which allows the robot to strategically select near-instantaneous range-only measurements to achieve faster localization, and time-consuming sensor rotation actions to acquire bearing measurements and achieve robust tracking performance; (ii) a bearing detector more robust to noise; and (iii) a tracking algorithm formulation robust to missed and false detections experienced in real-world conditions. We conducted extensive studies: simulations built upon complex signal propagation over high-resolution elevation data on diverse geographical terrains; field testing; studies with wombats (Lasiorhinus latifrons; nocturnal, vulnerable species dwelling in underground warrens) and tracking comparisons with a highly experienced biologist to validate the effectiveness of our aerial robot and demonstrate the significant advantages over the manual method.

AB The rapid development of the aerospace industry puts forward the urgent need for the evolution of autonomous spacecraft rendezvous technology, which has gained significant attention recently due to increased applications in various space missions. This article studies the relative position tracking problem of the autonomous spacecraft rendezvous under the requirement of collision avoidance. An exploration-adaptive deep deterministic policy gradient (DDPG) algorithm is proposed to train a definite control strategy for this mission. Similar to the DDPG algorithm, four neural networks are used in this method, where two of them are used to generate the deterministic policy, whereas the other two are used to score the obtained policy. Differently, adaptive noise is introduced to reduce the possibility of oscillations and divergences and to cut down the unnecessary computation by weakening the exploration of stabilization problems. In addition, in order to effectively and quickly adapt to some other similar scenarios, a metalearning-based idea is introduced by fine-tuning the prior strategy. Finally, two numerical simulations show that the trained control strategy can effectively avoid the oscillation phenomenon caused by the artificial potential function. Benefiting from this, the trained control strategy based on deep reinforcement learning technology can decrease the energy consumption by 16.44% during the close proximity phase, compared with the traditional artificial potential function method. Besides, after introducing the metalearning-based idea, a strategy available for some other perturbed scenarios can be trained in a relatively short period of time, which illustrates its adaptability.

AB Imbalanced training is a challenge in the field of autonomous driving. For the steering estimation task, imbalanced training is the core reason that an end-to-end model cannot estimate sharp steering value well. Inspired by researches on the steering estimation, this paper proposes a novel loss function to train a high-performance end-to-end model for handling the imbalanced training problem, which is named SteeringLoss. Firstly, the imbalanced distribution of the steering value for driving datasets is analyzed, which is similar to the double long-tailed distribution. Secondly, with the feature of distribution, this paper designs a cost-sensitive loss function step by step, the new loss function can improve the impact of the sharp steering value while maintaining the impact of the small steering value. Thirdly, three typical steering estimation models are established with SteeringLoss for demonstration, including the CNN model, the CNN-LSTM model and the 3DCNN-LSTM model. Finally, three experiments are designed for SteeringLoss: Experiment I demonstrates SteeringLoss can avoid imbalanced training problem; Experiment II discusses the finetuning principle of SteeringLoss and gives the basic guideline for using SteeringLoss; Experiment III shows the results on different typical end-to-end steering estimation models, which shows effectiveness of SteeringLoss for all the models and gives different solutions for the steering estimation. Moreover, the SteeringLoss is suitable for the imbalanced training with similar distributions of datasets besides end-to-end steering estimation, which indicates the potential value of the research on SteeringLoss in the future.

AB Background: Driving under the influence of alcohol severely increases crash risk. Impairment detection during driving is therefore key to improve traffic safety. However, future detection systems need to capture impairment for more reasons than alcohol intoxication and must also function in all driving modes (manual, assisted, autonomous). Driver Monitoring Systems (DMS) are promising candidates for such broader impairment detection. Method: A test track study investigated the effects of alcohol intoxication on drivers' visual behavior both when just driving and when engaged in a non-driving related task. Twenty-six participants performed two drives: 1) sober baseline, 2) with a target blood alcohol concentration of 0.1%. The participants drove in either manual, assisted, or autonomous drive (AD) mode. Results: Intoxication influenced glance behavior in all driving modes. It was most evident during visually demanding non-driving related tasks where it resulted in longer single and total off-path glance durations. Additionally, when just driving in manual mode, almost one third of the drivers displayed gaze concentration to the forward roadway when intoxicated. For sober driving, the difference in visual behavior between manual and assisted mode were moderate. In contrast, there was a huge shift towards longer off-path glances, lower percent road center, and lower offpath glance frequency in AD mode. Conclusions: Intoxication clearly affects drivers' on/off road glance behavior. However, it is necessary to account for both driving mode and engagement in non-driving related tasks to reliably distinguish sober from drunk driving. Glance metrics has the potential to serve as a subset of indicators for a broader DMS-based detection of impaired driving, which can inform the decisions on when to activate in-vehicle countermeasures.

ID STRATEGY
AB Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) play a vital role in military warfare. In a variety of battlefield mission scenarios, UAVs are required to safely fly to designated locations without human intervention. Therefore, finding a suitable method to solve the UAV Autonomous Motion Planning (AMP) problem can improve the success rate of UAV missions to a certain extent. In recent years, many studies have used Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) methods to address the AMP problem and have achieved good results. From the perspective of sampling, this paper designs a sampling method with double-screening, combines it with the Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (DDPG) algorithm, and proposes the Relevant Experience Learning-DDPG (REL-DDPG) algorithm. The REL-DDPG algorithm uses a Prioritized Experience Replay (PER) mechanism to break the correlation of continuous experiences in the experience pool, finds the experiences most similar to the current state to learn according to the theory in human education, and expands the influence of the learning process on action selection at the current state. All experiments are applied in a complex unknown simulation environment constructed based on the parameters of a real UAV. The training experiments show that REL-DDPG improves the convergence speed and the convergence result compared to the state-of-the-art DDPG algorithm, while the testing experiments show the applicability of the algorithm and investigate the performance under different parameter conditions.

AB Future freeway traffic flow will include both Human-driven Vehicles (HV) and various sizes of Connected Automated Vehicles (CAV) platoons. When following CAV platoons, HV drivers may change the car-following distance for psychological reasons, which could further affect the road capacity under mixed traffic flow. In this paper, we constructed a capacity model that considered the spatial distribution characteristics of mixed traffic flow and the behavioral traits of HV drivers when they follow CAV platoons. We surveyed 331 HV drivers using a questionnaire. 51.1% of drivers opted to increase the car-following distance when following a CAV platoon, and the amount of change in distance increased in direct proportion to the size of the platoon. A Structural Equation Model (SEM) based on survey data was developed to examine the connection between psychological variables and HV drivers' driving behaviors. These results of the questionnaire were introduced into the capacity model construction, and the trends of capacity with CAV penetration, maximum platoon size, platoon intensity, and time headways were revealed. The results show that previous studies overestimated the capacity under mixed traffic flow, especially when the maximum platoon size is equal to or greater than 6 or the CAV penetration is between [0.6, 0.8], the overestimation of the capacity is higher. CAV penetration, maximum platoon size, and platoon intensity are positively correlated with capacity, while time headway is negatively correlated with capacity. The capacity growth is not significant when CAV penetration is between (0, 0.4]. Six is the ideal size of CAV platoons under mixed traffic flow when considering the impact of CAV platoons on HV drivers' driving behaviors. By taking measures to promote CAV aggregation and making platoon intensity greater than 0, the capacity will be improved more significantly. For a specific car-following type, a different value of time headway will lead to a different capacity, but the impact trends will be similar. & COPY; 2023 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB This work presents an uncertainty-aware path-planning strategy to achieve autonomous aerial robotic exploration of unknown environments while ensuring mapping consistency on-the-go. The planner follows a paradigm of hierarchically optimized objectives, which are executed in receding horizon fashion. Initially, a random tree over the known feasible configurations is used to derive a maximal-exploration path, and its first viewpoint is selected as the next waypoint. Subsequently, an uncertainty-optimization step takes place, constructing within a local volume region a second tree of admissible alternative trajectories that all arrive at the reference viewpoint. Belief propagation of the robot state and the tracked landmarks in the environment takes place over the branches of this tree, and the path that minimizes the expected localization and mapping uncertainty is selected. This path is followed by the robot, and the entire process is iteratively repeated. The algorithm's computational complexity is analyzed and experimental results are used to evaluate its realtime execution efficiency onboard a micro aerial vehicle. The architecture of the complete pipeline is detailed, and an open-source implementation is provided. A complete aerial robot synthesis that enables high-fidelity autonomous reconstruction supported by the proposed planner is also elaborated. Comprehensive experimental evaluation studies that include mockup environments in ambient illumination and in challenging conditions such as clutter and darkness, as well as a field deployment in a railroad tunnel degraded visual environment are presented, with all data provided as openly available.

AB This paper addresses the problem of object recognition from colorless 3D point clouds in underwater environments. It presents a performance comparison of state-of-the-art global descriptors, which are readily available as open source code. The studied methods are intended to assist Autonomous Underwater Vehicles (AUVs) in performing autonomous interventions in underwater Inspection, Maintenance and Repair (IMR) applications. A set of test objects were chosen as being representative of IMR applications whose shape is typically known a priori. As such, CAD models were used to create virtual views of the objects under realistic conditions of added noise and varying resolution. Extensive experiments were conducted from both virtual scans and from real data collected with an AUV equipped with a fast laser sensor developed in our research centre. The underwater testing was conducted from a moving platform, which can create deformations in the perceived shape of the objects. These effects are considerably more difficult to correct than in above-water counterparts, and therefore may affect the performance of the descriptor. Among other conclusions, the testing we conducted illustrated the importance of matching the resolution of the database scans and test scans, as this significantly impacted the performance of all descriptors except one. This paper contributes to the state-of-the-art as being the first work on the comparison and performance evaluation of methods for underwater object recognition. It is also the first effort using comparison of methods for data acquired with a free floating underwater platform.

ID DYNAMICS; DESIGN
AB Large-scale flapping-wing flying robotic birds have huge application potential in outdoor tasks, such as military reconnaissance, environment exploring, disaster rescue and so on. In this paper, a multiple modes flight control method and system are proposed for a large-scale robotic bird which has 2.3 m wingspan and 650 g mass. Different from small flapping wing aerial vehicle, the mass of its wings cannot be neglected and the flapping frequency are much lower. Therefore, the influence of transient aerodynamics instead of only mean value are considered in attitude estimation and controller design. Moreover, flight attitude and trajectory are highly coupled, and the robot has only three actuators----one for wings flapping and two for tail adjustment, it is very difficult to simultaneously control the attitude and position. Hence, a fuzzy control strategy is addressed to determine the command of each actuator by considering the priority of attitude stabilization, tra-jectory tracking and the flight safety. Then, the on-board controller is designed based on Free-RTOS. It not only satisfies the strict restrictions on mass, size, power and space but also meets the autonomous, semi-autonomous and manual flight control requirements. Finally, the developed control system was integrated to the robotic prototype, HIT-phoenix. Flight experiments under dif-ferent environment conditions such as sunny and windy weather were completed to verify the con-trol method and system.

AB We introduce for the first time a new product line able to make high accuracy measurements of a number of water chemistry parameters in situ: i.e., submerged in the environment including in the deep sea (to 6,000 m). This product is based on the developments of in situ lab on chip technology at the National Oceanography Centre (NOC), and the University of Southampton and is produced under license by Clearwater Sensors Ltd., a start-up and industrial partner in bringing this technology to global availability and further developing its potential. The technology has already been deployed by the NOC, and with their partners worldwide over 200 times including to depths of similar to 4,800 m, in turbid estuaries and rivers, and for up to a year in seasonally ice-covered regions of the arctic. The technology is capable of making accurate determinations of chemical and biological parameters that require reagents and which produce an electrical, absorbance, fluorescence, or luminescence signal. As such it is suitable for a wide range of environmental measurements. Whilst further parameters are in development across this partnership, Nitrate, Nitrite, Phosphate, Silicate, Iron, and pH sensors are currently available commercially. Theses sensors use microfluidics and optics combined in an optofluidic chip with electromechanical valves and pumps mounted upon it to mix water samples with reagents and measure the optical response. An overview of the sensors and the underlying components and technologies is given together with examples of deployments and integrations with observing platforms such as gliders, autonomous underwater vehicles and moorings.</p>

ID MODEL; SYSTEM
AB In this research, we address the problem of accurately predicting lane-change maneuvers on highways. Lane-change maneuvers are a critical aspect of highway safety and traffic flow, and the accurate prediction of these maneuvers can have significant implications for both. However, current methods for lane-change prediction are limited in their ability to handle naturalistic driving scenarios and often require large amounts of labeled data. Our proposed model uses a bidirectional long short-term memory (BiLSTM) network to analyze naturalistic vehicle trajectories recorded from multiple sensors on German highways. To handle the temporal aspect of vehicle behavior, we utilized a sliding window approach, considering both the preceding and following vehicles' trajectories. To tackle class imbalances in the data, we introduced rolling mean computed weights. Our extensive feature engineering process resulted in a comprehensive feature set to train the model. The proposed model fills the gap in the state-of-the-art lane change prediction methods and can be applied in advanced driver assistance systems (ADAS) and autonomous driving systems. Our results show that the BiLSTM-based approach with the sliding window technique effectively predicts lane changes with 86% test accuracy and a test loss of 0.325 by considering the context of the input data in both the past and future. The F1 score of 0.52, precision of 0.41, recall of 0.75, accuracy of 0.86, and AUC of 0.81 also demonstrate the model's high ability to distinguish between the two target classes. Furthermore, the model achieved an accuracy of 83.65% with a loss value of 0.3306 on the other half of the data samples, and the validation accuracy was observed to improve over these epochs, reaching the highest validation accuracy of 92.53%. The F1 score of 0.51, precision of 0.36, recall of 0.89, accuracy of 0.82, and AUC of 0.85 on this data sample also demonstrate the model's strong ability to identify both positive and negative classes. Overall, our proposed approach outperforms existing methods and can significantly contribute to improving highway safety and traffic flow.

AB Long flight durations are highly desirable to expand mission capabilities for unmanned air systems and autonomous applications in particular. Flapping wing aerial vehicles are unmanned air system platforms offering several performance advantages over fixed wing and rotorcraft platforms, but are unable to reach comparable flight times when powered by batteries. One solution to this problem has been to integrate energy harvesting technologies in components, such as wings. To this end, a framework for designing flapping wing aerial vehicle using multifunctional wings using solar cells is described. This framework consists of: (1) modeling solar energy harvesting while flying, (2) determining the number of solar cells that meet flight power requirements, and (3) determining appropriate locations to accommodate the desired number of solar cells. A system model for flapping flight was also developed to predict payload capacity for carrying batteries to provide energy only for power spikes and to enable time-to-land safely in an area where batteries can recharge when the sun sets. The design framework was applied to a case study using flexible high-efficiency (>24%) solar cells on a flapping wing aerial vehicle platform, known as Robo Raven IIIv5, with the caveat that a powertrain with 81% efficiency is used in place of the current servos. A key finding was the fraction of solar flux incident on the wings during flapping was 0.63 at the lowest solar altitude. Using a 1.25 safety factor, the lowest value for the purposes of design will be 0.51. Wind tunnel measurements and aerodynamic modeling of the platform determined integrating solar cells in the wings resulted in a loss of thrust and greater drag, but the resulting payload capacity was unaffected because of a higher lift coefficient. A time-to-land of 2500 s was predicted, and the flight capability of the platform was validated in a netted test facility.

TI Towards Autonomous Driving Model Resistant to Adversarial Attack
SO APPLIED ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE

DT Article
AB Connected and Autonomous Vehicles (CAVs) offer improved efficiency and convenience through innovative embedded devices. However, the development of these technologies has often neglected security measures, leading to vulnerabilities that can be exploited by hackers. Conceding that a CAV system is compromised, it can result in unsafe driving conditions and pose a threat to human safety. Prioritizing both security measures and functional enhancements on development of CAVs is essential to ensure their safety and reliability and enhance consumer trust in the technology. CAVs use artificial intelligence to control their driving behavior, which can be easily influenced by small changes in the model that can significantly impact and potentially mislead the system. To address this issue, this study proposed a defense mechanism that uses an autoencoder and a compressive memory module to store normal image features and prevent unexpected generalization on adversarial inputs. The proposed solution was studied against Hijacking, Vanishing, Fabrication, and Mislabeling attacks using FGSM and AdvGAN against the Nvidia Dave-2 driving model, and was found to be effective, with success rates of 93.8 % and 91.2 % in a Whitebox setup, and 74.1 % and 64.4 % in a Blackbox setup for FGSM and AdvGAN, respectively. That improves the results by 24.7 % in Whitebox setup 21.5 % in Blackbox setup.

TI Understanding Pedestrians' Car-Hailing Intention in Traffic Scenes
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF AUTOMOTIVE TECHNOLOGY

DE Car-hailing intention; GCN; Random forest; Autonomous taxi
AB This study alms at the automatic understanding of pedestrians' car-hailing intention in traffic scenes. Traffic scenes are highly complex, with a completely random spatial distribution of pedestrians. Different pedestrians use different behavior to express car-hailing intention, making it difficult to accurately understand the intention of pedestrians for autonomous taxis in complex scenes. A novel intention recognition algorithm with interpretability is proposed in this paper to solve the above problems. Firstly, we employ OpenPose to obtain skeleton data and the facial region. Then, we input the facial region into a facial attention network to extract the facial attention features and infer whether the pedestrian is paying attention to the ego-vehicle. In addition, the skeleton data are also input into a random forest classifier and GCN to extract both explicit and implicit pose features. Finally, an interpretable fusion rule is proposed to fuse the facial and pose features. The fusion algorithm can accurately and stably infer the pedestrians' intention and identify pedestrians with car-hailing intentions. In order to evaluate the performance of the proposed method, we collected road videos using experimental cars to obtain suitable datasets, and established the corresponding evaluation benchmarks. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm has high accuracy and robustness.

AB Autonomous navigation of microaerial vehicles in environments that are simultaneously GPS-denied and visually degraded, and especially in the dark, texture-less and dust- or smoke-filled settings, is rendered particularly hard. However, a potential solution arises if such aerial robots are equipped with long wave infrared thermal vision systems that are unaffected by darkness and can penetrate many types of obscurants. In response to this fact, this study proposes a keyframe-based thermal-inertial odometry estimation framework tailored to the exact data and concepts of operation of thermal cameras. The front-end component of the proposed solution utilizes full radiometric data to establish reliable correspondences between thermal images, as opposed to operating on rescaled data as previous efforts have presented. In parallel, taking advantage of a keyframe-based optimization back-end the proposed method is suitable for handling periods of data interruption which are commonly present in thermal cameras, while it also ensures the joint optimization of reprojection errors of 3D landmarks and inertial measurement errors. The developed framework was verified with respect to its resilience, performance, and ability to enable autonomous navigation in an extensive set of experimental studies including multiple field deployments in severely degraded, dark, and obscurants-filled underground mines.

ID EXPLORATION ROVERS; VISUAL ODOMETRY
AB Mobile robot used for planetary exploration performs several scientific missions over long distance travel and needs to have a high degree of autonomous mobility system because the communication delay from the Earth impedes its direct teleoperation. Localization of a mobile robot is of particular importance on the autonomous mobility. Classical localization methods such as wheel/visual odometry have been widely investigated and demonstrated, but they possess a well-known trade-off between computational cost and localization accuracy. This paper proposes an accurate gyro-based odometry method for a wheeled mobile robot in rough terrain. The robot in rough terrain is often subject to large wheel slip or vehicle sideslip related with its steering maneuver, and those slips degrade the localization accuracy. The basic approach of the proposed method is to exploit odometry data for the robot distance traveled as well as gyroscope data for the robot heading calculation; however each data-set is weighted in accordance with steering characteristics of a robot in rough terrain. The usefulness of the proposed method is examined through field experiments using a wheeled mobile robot testbed in Martian analog site. The experimental result confirms that the proposed method accurately estimates the robot trajectory.

TI Enhancing Lane-Tracking Performance in Challenging Driving Environments

DE lane detection; multiscale retinex (MSR); restriction system; lane

AB The autonomous driving market has experienced rapid growth in recent times. From systems that assist drivers in keeping within their lanes to systems that recognize obstacles using sensors and then handle those obstacles, there are various types of systems in autonomous driving. The sensors used in autonomous driving systems include infrared detection devices, lidar, ultrasonic sensors, and cameras. Among these sensors, cameras are widely used. This paper proposes a method for stable lane detection from images captured by camera sensors in diverse environments. First, the system utilizes a bilateral filter and multiscale retinex (MSR) with experimentally optimized set parameters to suppress image noise while increasing contrast. Subsequently, the Canny edge detector is employed to detect the edges of the lane candidates, followed by utilizing the Hough transform to make straight lines from the land candidate images. Then, using a proposed restriction system, only the two lines that the current vehicle is actively driving within are detected from the candidate lines. Furthermore, the lane position information from the previous frame is combined with the lane information from the current frame to correct the current lane position. The Kalman filter is then used to predict the lane position in the next frame. The proposed lane-detection method was evaluated in various scenarios, including rainy conditions, low-light nighttime environments with minimal street lighting, scenarios with interfering guidelines within the lane area, and scenarios with significant noise caused by water droplets on the camera. Both qualitative and quantitative experimental results demonstrate that the lane-detection method presented in this paper effectively suppresses noise and accurately detects the two active lanes during driving.

AB Radars with mmWave frequency modulated continuous wave (FMCW) technology accurately estimate the range and velocity of targets in their field of view (FoV). The targeted angle of arrival (AoA) estimation can be improved by increasing receiving antennas or by using multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO). However, obtaining target features such as target type remains challenging. In this paper, we present a novel target classification method based on machine learning and features extracted from a range fast Fourier transform (FFT) profile by using mmWave FMCW radars operating in the frequency range of 77-81 GHz. The measurements are carried out in a variety of realistic situations, including pedestrian, automotive, and unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) (also known as drone). Peak, width, area, variance, and range are collected from range FFT profile peaks and fed into a machine learning model. In order to evaluate the performance, various light weight classification machine learning models such as logistic regression, Naive Bayes, support vector machine (SVM), and lightweight gradient boosting machine (GBM) are used. We demonstrate our findings by using outdoor measurements and achieve a classification accuracy of 95.6% by using LightGBM. The proposed method will be extremely useful in a wide range of applications, including cost-effective and dependable ground station traffic management and control systems for autonomous operations, and advanced driver-assistance systems (ADAS). The presented classification technique extends the potential of mmWave FMCW radar beyond the detection of range, velocity, and AoA to classification. mmWave FMCW radars will be more robust in computer vision, visual perception, and fully autonomous ground control and traffic management cyber-physical systems as a result of the added new feature.

AB Affective social multimedia computing provides us the opportunity to improve our daily lives. Various things, such as devices in ubiquitous computing environments and autonomous vehicles in real environments considering human beings, can be controlled by analyzing and learning affective social big data. Deep learning is a core learning algorithm for autonomous control; however, it requires huge amounts of learning data, and the process of collecting various types of learning data is expensive. The collection limit of affective social videos for deep learning is resolved by analyzing affective social videos, such as YouTube and Closed Circuit Television (CCTV) videos collected in advance, and generating new affective social videos more as learning data without human beings autonomously controlling other cameras. The control signals of the cameras are generated by Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)-based end-to-end controls. However, images captured consecutively need to be analyzed to improve the quality of the generated control signals. This paper proposes a system that generates affective social videos for deep learning by Convolutional Recurrent Neural Network (CRNN)-based end-to-end controls. The extracted images in affective social videos are utilized for calculating the control signals based on the CRNN. Additional affective social videos are then generated by the extracted consecutive images and camera control signals. The effectiveness of the proposed method was verified in the experiments by comparing the results obtained using the proposed method with those obtained using the traditional CNN. The results showed that the accuracy of the control signals obtained using the proposed method was 56.30% higher than that of the control signals obtained using the traditional CNN.

DT Article
ID ARCHITECTURE; SPACE
AB Self-driving vehicles must reliably detect the drivable area in front of them in any weather condition. An actively developed sensor approach is camera-based road segmentation, but it is limited by the visible spectrum. Radar-based approaches are a promising alternative and a new method extracts the drivable area from raw radar data by training a deep neural network using paired camera data, which can be labelled automatically using pretrained computer vision models.
   Autonomous driving has recently gained lots of attention due to its disruptive potential and impact on the global economy; however, these high expectations are hindered by strict safety requirements for redundant sensing modalities that are each able to independently perform complex tasks to ensure reliable operation. At the core of an autonomous driving algorithmic stack is road segmentation, which is the basis for numerous planning and decision-making algorithms. Radar-based methods fail in many driving scenarios, mainly as various common road delimiters barely reflect radar signals, coupled with a lack of analytical models for road delimiters and the inherit limitations in radar angular resolution. Our approach is based on radar data in the form of a two-dimensional complex range-Doppler array as input into a deep neural network (DNN) that is trained to semantically segment the drivable area using weak supervision from a camera. Furthermore, guided back propagation was utilized to analyse radar data and design a novel perception filter. Our approach creates the ability to perform road segmentation in common driving scenarios based solely on radar data and we propose to utilize this method as an enabler for redundant sensing modalities for autonomous driving.

AB It is a fundamental and important task to determine the minimum fleet size required for a public transit (PT) system because the fleet cost is a major operating expense experienced by PT agencies. More importantly, the fleet size information has been incorporated into various PT operations planning activities. Therefore, effective, efficient, and practical methods as well as tools are required to calculate the minimum fleet size required for a PT system. This work first presents the limitations of a traditional fleet size model that is widely used in the literature. Second, the traditional deficit function (DF)-based fleet size model, which can overcome these limitations, is introduced. However, one restriction of the traditional DF-based fleet size model is that a DF has been proven to be not differentiable at its significant points. To overcome this restriction, this work proposes the idea of using continuous approximation (CA) instead of the step-function feature of the DF model. A numerical example is provided to illustrate the CA of the DFs technique followed by some theoretical results. The effectiveness of the CA of the DFs technique in calculating the fleet size required is demonstrated in a case study of an autonomous modular PT system that is currently being developed in Singapore. Finally, some further extensions and potential applications of the CA of the DFs technique are discussed in connection with a possible design of future urban mobility systems, such as on-demand transit systems, autonomous modular transit systems, and shared autonomous vehicle systems.

AB Recently, with the development of semiconductors and VLSI (Very Large Scale Integrated Circuit), the technology required for autonomous driving is rapidly developing. One of the technologies that cannot be left out is the lane detection function. Lane recognition requires a lot of data from the camera sensor. As a result, the data size increases, making it difficult to process on a lightweight embedded board. This paper proposes a sliding-based parallel segment image processing method to solve this problem. Most boards in autonomous vehicles are lightweight, so the technique has been designed to reduce computation and power consumption. After fetching the image's pixel data, grayscale conversion, Gaussian smoothing, Sobel operator, non-maximum suppression, and hysteresis are performed in parallel. Lanes were detected by performing a Hough transform operation on an image for which edge detection was completed in parallel. Due to the nature of parallel processing, it is more effective when image input is continuous and numerous than single image processing. This algorithm is written in C language and VHDL (VHSIC Hardware Description Language) for two parts in the board, DE1-SoC, FPGA (Field Programmable Gate Array) and HPS (Hard Processor System. Due to the use of the C language and VHDL, parallel programming uses 3.1 times less time, twice as much memory and slightly more power than sequential programming. For hardware languages such as Verilog, the computation algorithms have been converted to a fixed point. When comparing HPS and FPGA, the FPGA consumed significantly fewer resources, with 18 times shorter run time, 50 times fewer clock cycles, 3 times less power, and 183 times less energy. This provides a substantial benefit.

AB This paper describes state estimation and tracking control algorithms for use in an autonomous truck using a single-wheel driving module and simulation-based performance evaluation with actual data from a one-layer laser scanner. In order to construct the tracking control algorithm, the one-layer laser scanner has been used to detect the object as two-dimensional point cloud data. The tracking control algorithm consists of three routines-perception, decision, and control. In the perception routine, the coordinate transformation, downsizing, clustering, and state estimation have been conducted for calculation of the object states, such as position and velocity, using point data from the one-layer laser scanner. The velocity components of the object have been estimated based on the extended Kalman filter, and the desired straight path has been derived using the estimated velocity of the object. To track the object reasonably, lateral error and yaw angle error have been defined with respect to the desired straight path. The error dynamics has been derived using a single-wheel driving module, equipped with a planar truck model based on the vehicle dynamics. Using the derived planar truck model, the optimal steering input for tracking the object has been computed based on the linear quadratic regulator. The actual point cloud data from the one-layer laser scanner has been used to conduct reasonable performance evaluation of the tracking control algorithm proposed in this study. The actual data-based performance evaluation of the algorithm has been conducted in the MATLAB/SIMULINK environment with various scenarios. The performance evaluation results show that the tracking control algorithm proposed in this study can manipulate the single-wheel driving module of the autonomous truck to track the object soundly, based on the state estimation algorithm.

AB Many evidences prove that the development of autonomous cars increases the probability of motion sickness when passengers perform non-driving related tasks. Making the autonomous cars know what the passenger is doing is necessary to adjustment optimal strategy of vehicle motion style and alleviate motion sickness used the human-machine interaction method automatically. For autonomous cars, passengers' non-drive related task detecting is a non-main task, and it is necessary to reduce the occupation of computing resources, the current study did not address this issue. Therefore, we have choose several types of behaviors based on current motion sickness research literature to improve motion sickness from a human-computer interaction perspective and build a dataset, then, a lightweight model for the detection of passenger non-driving related tasks is proposed. In order to reduce computational load, feature redundancies and improve the accuracy, the soft-hard features constraints method is proposed based on the human prior knowledge. We annotated the key features regions of the images and make the network learn the labeled regions used a two-layer feature constraint structure, which allow the model to learn labeled features earlier, and the label smooth regularization method is used to improve the robustness. The proposed model used the windowed attention mechanism to calculate the importance of each neuron in the feature map and reduce the number of parameters. Finally, we used a visualization method visualize features related to passenger tasks. The results show that the proposed model has an accuracy of 0.9710 with 2.5 M Params, and 1.15G FLOPs, compared with other models, the proposed lightweight model has the highest accuracy.

AB To adequately utilize flexible resources on demand side, Virtual Power Plant (VPP) is an effective solution through the aggregation and application of distributed energy resources (DER). While centralized control approaches are easy to achieve global optimum for the scheduling of every DER, they have limitations when dealing with massive number of complex and heterogeneous DERs with time-varying states. Existing decentralized control approaches are mainly based on the assumption that all DERs are completely rational, which is quite far from the reality. In this paper, using a bottom-up approach, we propose a stimulus-response control strategy to realize exploitation of flexibility by VPP. In such a strategy, DERs are dynamically aggregated through autonomous decentralized system, and interact with each other via subscription and publication of topics, regardless of the source and recipient of the messages, thus removing the direct coupling relationship between VPP Operator and DERs. Furthermore, each DER makes an independent decision through edge computing at an agent that has a general End-to-End structure and is driven by the stimulus message received from VPP Operator. We develop a simple yet efficient double deep q-network (DDQN) algorithm to optimize the state sequence of DER agents. A simulation study is conducted with over 1000 DERs including photovoltaics, electric vehicles and air conditioners. Results indicate that the proposed approach can dynamically aggregate DERs and exploit their flexibility with each DER agent dynamically adapting to the change of stimulus signals, thus achieving dynamic, automatic and adaptive exploitation of flexibility by VPP.

AB One of the key challenges to the safe operation of UAVs at sea is the relative motion that exists between the UAV and ship during landing. The scope of this work is the development and evaluation of methodologies for improving UAV landing performance. The new methodologies are known as the Signal Prediction Algorithm (SPA), Active Heave Compensation (AHC) and the Landing Period Indicator (LPI). To promote interoperability, the methodologies do not require any specific ship equipment.
   To evaluate the methodologies on an existing comprehensive UAV model, ShipMo3D was used to generate 105 sets of ship motion in sea states 2-6, headings 0-180 degrees and speeds 6-10 knots. Within the simulation the UAV, equipped with a Light Detection and Ranging (LIDAR) system, measures the ship motion in situ. Using the Signal Prediction Algorithm (SPA), the UAV forecasts the ship motion and potential landing opportunities. The UAV can also use the SPA and the AHC system to maintain a safe hover position above the ship deck and determine landing trajectories with a specific touchdown velocity. The UAV can also employ the novel Landing Period Indicator (LPI) system which calculates an estimate of the ship's energy and determines opportune times for safe landings.
   The results indicate that the methodologies can improve the landing performance of autonomous helicopters. For the 105 sets of ship motion, using the combination of the SPA, AHC, and LPI improved landing success by up to 34% when compared to a common landing controller. (C) 2020 Elsevier Masson SAS.

AB In the last decade, research studies on parking planning mainly focused on path planning rather than trajectory planning. The results of trajectory planning are more instructive for a practical parking process. Therefore, this paper proposes a trajectory planning method in which the optimal autonomous valet parking (AVP) trajectory is obtained by solving an optimal control problem. Additionally, a vehicle kinematics model is established with the consideration of dynamic obstacle avoidance and terminal constraints. Then the parking trajectory planning problem is modeled as an optimal control problem, while the parking time and driving distance are set as the cost function. The homotopic method is used for the expansion of obstacle boundaries, and the Gauss pseudospectral method (GPM) is utilized to discretize this optimal control problem into a nonlinear programming (NLP) problem. In order to solve this NLP problem, sequential quadratic programming is applied. Considering that the GPM is insensitive to the initial guess, an online calculation method of vertical parking trajectory is proposed. In this approach, the offline vertical parking trajectory, which is calculated and stored in advance, is taken as the initial guess of the online calculation. The selection of an appropriate initial guess is based on the actual starting position of parking. A small parking lot is selected as the verification scenario of the AVP. In the validation of the algorithm, the parking trajectory planning is divided into two phases, which are simulated and analyzed. Simulation results show that the proposed algorithm is efficient in solving a parking trajectory planning problem. The online calculation time of the vertical parking trajectory is less than 2 s, which meets the real-time requirement.

AB The quantification of soil surface cracks is important, as it is useful in analyzing water infiltration and overall water balance in any green infrastructure, such as slopes, agricultural fields, green roofs, etc. In previously reported studies, the approaches for quantifying cracks mainly used manual processing of images through the public domain image analysis tool ImageJ. Such software is not customized for quantifying cracks in an unsaturated soil surface, as this results in relatively higher noise (i.e., lower resolution) in the processed image. Furthermore, manual processing makes processing of images in large quantities (usually captured through unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) surveying) cumbersome. This technical note introduces an autonomous novel image analysismethod for characterizing surface crack patterns that develop in unsaturated soils. A simple experimental setup was developed using a 1-D column containing red soil. The soil was compacted by hand to the desired state of compaction and placed in an environment-controlled chamber where it was allowed to dry. A series of images of the soil sample was captured using a commercially available camera model (Canon EOS 700D) to have photographic representation of the cracking process. A step-by-step strategy using a script coded in Python was developed to analyze the images captured during the laboratory tests. It outlines how image analysis can be automated to remove observer-dependent subjectivity (involved inmanual processing of images) and introduces reproducibility of results. In addition, it effectively quantifies cracks in unsaturated soils with a much lower processing time and higher accuracy (less noise).

AB Pedestrian Detection is the most critical module of an Autonomous Driving system. Although a camera is commonly used for this purpose, its quality degrades severely in low-light night time driving scenarios. On the other hand, the quality of a thermal camera image remains unaffected in similar conditions. This paper proposes an end-to-end multimodal fusion model for pedestrian detection using RGB and thermal images. Its novel spatio-contextual deep network architecture is capable of exploiting the multimodal input efficiently. It consists of two distinct deformable ResNeXt-50 encoders for feature extraction from the two modalities. Fusion of these two encoded features takes place inside a multimodal feature embedding module (MuFEm) consisting of several groups of a pair of Graph Attention Network and a feature fusion unit. The output of the last feature fusion unit of MuFEm is subsequently passed to two CRFs for their spatial refinement. Further enhancement of the features is achieved by applying channel-wise attention and extraction of contextual information with the help of four RNNs traversing in four different directions. Finally, these feature maps are used by a single-stage decoder to generate the bounding box of each pedestrian and the score map. We have performed extensive experiments of the proposed framework on three publicly available multimodal pedestrian detection benchmark datasets, namely KAIST, CVC-14, and UTokyo. The results on each of them improved the respective state-of-the-art performance.

ID TIME OBSTACLE AVOIDANCE
AB Recently, with the active development of automated driving systems (ADSs) corresponding to SAE automated driving level 2, the comfort of ADSs has gained significant attention. In our previous research, it was proposed that the comfort of ADSs is affected by their maneuvers and the degree of information sharing between ADS and drivers. However, even if the drivers are well-informed of the recognized traffic environment and ADS-controlled trajectory, the comfort and trust of drivers in ADSs could be insufficient. This is because each driver has distinct preferred trajectories. Although some researchers have proposed ADSs that learn driver preferences, the maneuvers presented by these systems are not easily modified, because of off-line learning. In addition, a few quantitative investigations on the subjective evaluation of comfort have been conducted. This study proposes an on-demand learning collision avoidance ADS that learns the preferred maneuvers of drivers through driver intervention. In our system, the drivers teach their preferred trajectory to the system only if they are unsatisfied with the maneuver presented by the system. The system updates the parameters and shows the learned maneuver at the next avoidance. To realize the proposed system, we applied modified risk potential functions and gain-tuning method, as well as a cost function and learning method for gradual and stable maneuver learning. Driving simulator experiments demonstrated stable trajectory learning and smooth intervention. Furthermore, the drivers were satisfied with the learned maneuvers of the ADS, and their comfort and trust in the ADS improved when using the proposed ADS.

ID EXTRACTION
AB The knowledge about the placement and appearance of lane markings is a prerequisite for the creation of maps with high precision, necessary for autonomous driving, infrastructure monitoring, lanewise traffic management, and urban planning. Lane markings are one of the important components of such maps. Lane markings convey the rules of roads to drivers. While these rules are learned by humans, an autonomous driving vehicle should be taught to learn them to localize itself. Therefore, accurate and reliable lane-marking semantic segmentation in the imagery of roads and highways is needed to achieve such goals. We use airborne imagery that can capture a large area in a short period of time by introducing an aerial lane marking data set. In this paper, we propose a symmetric fully convolutional neural network enhanced by wavelet transform in order to automatically carry out lane-marking segmentation in aerial imagery. Due to a heavily unbalanced problem in terms of a number of lane-marking pixels compared with background pixels, we use a customized loss function as well as a new type of data augmentation step. We achieve a high accuracy in pixelwise localization of lane markings compared with the state-of-the-art methods without using the third-party information. In this paper, we introduce the first high-quality data set used within our experiments, which contains a broad range of situations and classes of lane markings representative of today's transportation systems. This data set will be publicly available, and hence, it can be used as the benchmark data set for future algorithms within this domain.

AB This paper describes a method that precisely estimates the position of images of traffic surveillance camera objects. We suggest a projection method with multiple traffic surveillance cameras through a local coordinate system into a global coordinate system. The transformation of coordinates uses detected objects, parameters of the camera and the geometric information of high- definition (HD) maps. Traffic surveillance cameras that pursue traffic safety and convenience use various sensors to generate traffic information. We suggest a transformation method with images of the camera and HD maps and an evaluation method. Therefore, it is necessary to improve the sensor-related technology to increase the efficiency and reliability of the traffic information. Recently, the role of the camera in collecting video information has become more important due to advances in artificial intelligence (AI) technology. The objects projected from the traffic surveillance camera domain to the HD domain are helpful to identify imperceptible zones, such as blind spots, on roads for autonomous driving assistance. In this study, we proposed to identify and track dynamic objects (vehicles, pedestrian, etc.) with traffic surveillance cameras, and to analyze and provide information about them in various environments. To this end, we conducted the identification of dynamic objects using the Yolov4 and DeepSort algorithms, established real-time multi-user support servers based on Kafka, defined transformation matrices between images and spatial coordinate systems, and implemented map-based dynamic object visualization. In addition, a positional consistency evaluation was performed to confirm its usefulness. Through the proposed scheme, we confirmed that multiple traffic surveillance cameras can serve as important sensors to provide relevant information by analyzing road conditions in real-time in terms of road infrastructure beyond a simple monitoring role.

DE mines; automation; navigation; tunnelling
AB Purpose - Recently there has been a strong trend towards automation in the mine industry. This paper seeks to describe and analyse an algorithm that can be used as a pan of an infrastructure-free reactive navigation system for autonomous vehicles in underground mines.
   Design/methodology/approach - The idea presented here to enable infrastructure-free autonomous navigation is to combine reactive behaviours for tunnel following, with topological localization. To assess the reliability and precision of the corridor detection algorithm real data recorded in both indoor and mine environments have been used.
   Findings - In the research it was found that the algorithm is able to reliably detect corridors even in difficult environments such as office corridors where a large part of the walls are made of glass or in mine tunnels with a high intensity of intersections. It was also concluded that the algorithm provides good enough precision and robustness to noise in the data to enable reactive tunnel following.
   Research limitations/implications - This paper presents an algorithm for corridor detection, intended to be used in combination with reactive behaviours for tunnel following in underground mines. To enable fully autonomous navigation, functionality to detect and turn at intersections also needs to be developed.
   Practical implications - This research shows that corridor detection can be used for reactive tunnel following in certain underground mine types, and that the concept of using reactive tunnel following in combination with topological localization is worthy of continued development.
   Originality/value - This paper has presented a new algorithm for corridor detection based on the Hough transform. The algorithm is robust to noise in the data and can reliably detect corridors even where the surfaces of the walls are uneven and slightly curved.

AB Introduction: To assist drivers in avoiding rear-end collisions, many early warning systems have been developed up to date. Autonomous braking technology is also used as the last defense to ensure driver's safety. Method: By taking the accuracy and timeliness of automatic system control into account, this paper proposes a rear-end Real-Time Autonomous Emergency Braking (RTAEB) system. The system inserts brake intervention based on drivers' real-time conflict identification and collision avoidance performance. A driving simulator-based experiment under different traffic conditions and deceleration scenarios were conducted to test the different thresholds to trigger intervention and the intervention outcomes. The system effectiveness is verified by four evaluation indexes, including collision avoidance rate, accuracy rate, sensitivity rate, and precision rate. Results: The results showed that the system could help avoid all collision events successfully and enlarge the final headway distance, and a TTC threshold of 1.5 s and a maximum deceleration threshold of -7.5 m/s2 could achieve the best collision avoidance effect. The paper demonstrates the situations that are more inclined to trigger the RTAEB (i.e., a sudden brake of the leading vehicle and a small car-following distance). Moreover, the study shows that driver characteristics (i.e., gender and profession) have no significant association with system trigger. Practical Applications: The study suggests that development of collision avoidance systems design should pay attention to both the real-time traffic situation and drivers' collision avoidance capability under the present situation.

AB The roadside network system for ITS services uses micro-cells in its access infrastructure. For the roadside network that provides the uninterrupted communication using microcells such as DSRC, an effective communication control scheme must be established so as to manage the communication passes to vehicles in the network. One of the fundamental requirements for the communication control scheme for the roadside network is to assure fault-tolerance, which means in this system that the communication control mechanism needs to be managed even in part of the base stations in the network might be in fault. On the other hand, for the communication control in the roadside network using microcells, issues to be solved are the handover mechanism for taking over connection information to provide uninterrupted communication environment, which causes the degradation of the end-to-end throughput. In order to solve those problems, the authors developed a communication control scheme. We implemented the scheme as the specific 'ADS algorism' to control the communication zone dynamically, which works effectively on the Autonomous Decentralized System (ADS) communication platform. Furthermore, we also developed the specific ADS algorism to assure fault-tolerance for the communication zone control, which can reconfigure the communication zone in case the BSs in the roadside network are in fault and can keep the operations by the reconfigured communication zone. We evaluated the ADS algorism for the communication zone control by computer simulation. The results show the effectiveness of the ADS algorism for the dynamic communication zone control mechanism and for the fault-tolerant mechanism for communication zone reconfiguration on fault.

AB The positioning systems' high accuracy and reliability are crucial enablers for various future applications, including autonomous shipping worldwide. It is especially challenging for the Arctic region due to the lower number of visible satellites, severe ionospheric disturbances, scintillation effects, and higher delays than in the non-Arctic and non-Antarctic regions. In regions up North, conventional satellite positioning systems are generally proposed to be utilized, together with other situational awareness systems, to achieve the necessary level of accuracy. This paper provides a detailed review of the current state-of-the-art, satellite-based positioning systems' availability and performance and reports high-level positioning requirements for the oncoming applications. In particular, the comparative study between three Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) constellations is executed to determine whether they are suitable for autonomous vessel navigation in the Arctics' complex environment as the two most significant drivers for a reevaluation of the related satellite constellations. This work analyzes the ongoing research executed in different (inter-) national projects focused on Galileo, Global Positioning System (GPS), and GLObal NAvigation Satellite System (GLONASS). Based on the literature review and the simulation campaign, we conclude that all the convectional constellations achieve an accuracy of fewer than three meters in the analyzed Arctic scenarios. It is postulated that other complementary positioning methods should be utilized to improve accuracy beyond this limit. Finally, the study emphasizes existing challenges in the Arctic region regarding the localization and telecommunication capabilities and provides future research directions.

ID TRAJECTORY GENERATION
AB In this article, we propose a complete and robust system for the aggressive flight of autonomous quadrotors. The proposed system is built upon on the classical teach-and-repeat framework, which is widely adopted in infrastructure inspection, aerial transportation, and search-and-rescue. For these applications, a human's intention is essential for deciding the topological structure of the flight trajectory of the drone. However, poor teaching trajectories and changing environments prevent a simple teach-and-repeat system from being applied flexibly and robustly. In this article, instead of commanding the drone to precisely follow a teaching trajectory, we propose a method to automatically convert a human-piloted trajectory, which can be arbitrarily jerky, to a topologically equivalent one. The generated trajectory is guaranteed to be smooth, safe, and dynamically feasible, with a human preferable aggressiveness. Also, to avoid unmapped or moving obstacles during flights, a fast local perception method and a sliding-windowed replanning method are integrated into our system, to generate safe and dynamically feasible local trajectories onboard. We name our system as teach-repeat-replan. It can capture users' intention of a flight mission, convert an arbitrarily jerky teaching path to a smooth repeating trajectory, and generate safe local replans to avoid unexpected collisions. The proposed planning system is integrated into a complete autonomous quadrotor with global and local perception and localization submodules. Our system is validated by performing aggressive flights in challenging indoor/outdoor environments. We release all components in our quadrotor system as open-source ros packages.

AB Rotation modulation technology can enhance the autonomous navigation accuracy of inertial navigation system significantly, which has contributed to the wide applications of rotational inertial navigation system (RINS). To ensure the reliability and safety of high-precision autonomous navigation for the long endurance navigation in vehicle or marine applications, two or more RINSs are usually equipped. In this condition, the RINSs fault detection and isolation can be realized by comparing the differences of navigation information from different RINSs. In this paper, an on-line monitoring method for inertial device biases in the applications of two RINSs redundant configuration is proposed. The method takes advantages that the rotation modulation technology could improve the observable degrees of inertial device biases to achieve on-line optimal estimation of the gyro drifts and accelerometer biases for all the six gyros and accelerometers of the two RINSs. Two RINSs redundant configuration was presented and the inertial device biases estimation models were deduced. Based on the system model, simulations and experiments were both conducted. Simulation and experimental results showed that the proposed method could detect and isolate the faulty inertial devices of two RINSs effectively in autonomous navigation. Furthermore, gyro drifts monitoring accuracy could be better than 0.001 degrees/h and accelerometer biases monitoring accuracy could be better than 1 mu g in cases where the random constant gyro drifts are 0.02 degrees/h (1 sigma) and random constant accelerometer biases are 50 mu g (1 sigma), which demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed inertial device biases on-line monitoring method.

ID POSITION TRACKING
AB Recent events have highlighted the need for unmanned remote sensing in dangerous areas, particularly where structures have collapsed or explosions have occurred, to limit hazards to first responders and increase their efficiency in planning response operations. In the case of the Fukushima nuclear reactor explosion, an unmanned helicopter capable of obtaining overhead images, gathering radiation measurements, and mapping both the structural and radiation content of the environment would have given the response team invaluable data early in the disaster, thereby allowing them to understand the extent of the damage and areas where dangers to personnel existed. With this motivation, the Unmanned Systems Lab at Virginia Tech has developed a remote sensing system for radiation detection and aerial imaging using a 90 kg autonomous helicopter and sensing payloads for the radiation detection and imaging operations. The radiation payload, which is the sensor of focus in this paper, consists of a scintillating type detector with associated software and novel search algorithms to rapidly and effectively map and locate sources of high radiation intensity. By incorporating this sensing technology into an unmanned aerial vehicle system, crucial situational awareness can be gathered about a post-disaster environment and response efforts can be expedited. This paper details the radiation mapping and localization capabilities of this system as well as the testing of the various search algorithms using simulated radiation data. The various components of the system have been flight tested over a several-year period and a new production flight platform has been built to enhance reliability and maintainability. The new system is based on the Aeroscout B1-100 helicopter platform, which has a one-hour flight endurance and uses a COFDM radio system that gives the helicopter an effective range of 7 km.

AB Quantifying the condition of aging structures is important to verify structural integrity and long-term reliability. Structural health monitoring plays a key role in the prevention of catastrophic failure, in improving the safety of infrastructure, and in reducing the downtime and costs associated with their maintenance. Bridges are typically designed to have a lifespan on order of 50years; therefore, bridge monitoring is important since many of them are near to or have already exceeded their design life. Conventional sensors and examination techniques such as accelerometers and strain gages produce results at only a discrete number of points. Visual inspection only provides qualitative information and is subject to human variability and inconsistencies between inspectors. Moreover, both approaches are labor intensive and time-consuming. In recent years, three-dimensional digital image correlation systems have proven their efficiency in being able to provide accurate quantitative information of structural deformations, full-field strain, and geometry profiles of large-scale structures. At the same time, unmanned aerial vehicles have emerged as valuable tools for remotely performing measurements in places, which are either difficult or dangerous to access. With regard to bridge inspection, unmanned aerial vehicles have the capability to expedite the measurement process, offer increased accessibility, and reduce interference with the structures' functionality. In this study, a novel approach that combines the use of an unmanned aerial vehicle and three-dimensional digital image correlation is developed to perform non-contact, optically based measurements to monitor the health of bridges. Extensive laboratory tests and a long-term monitoring campaign on two in-service concrete bridges demonstrated the accuracy of this system in detecting structural changes. Results show that this system is able to detect changes to the bridge geometry with an uncertainty on the order of 10(-5)m while improving accessibility. The feasibility of the approach, best practices, and lessons learned is presented.

AB Many map matching-based localization algorithms estimate the autonomous car's pose using a registration between lanes measured by a camera and the High-Definition (HD) map. However, the registration methods based on numerical optimization, such as the Iterative Closest Point (ICP) and Normal Distributions Transform (NDT), can cause underdetermined problems due to no unique solution when matching under-constrained lane shapes such as straight lines and circular arcs. This paper proposes a robust localization algorithm with centimeter-level accuracy by applying different matching techniques depending on the road shape. We proposed a road shape classification-based map matching algorithm to overcome the under-constrained problems, which have no unique solution due to insufficient constraints. The proposed algorithm classifies lane segments into line, arc, and clothoid curves considering their curvature characteristics. After that, we find correction information through a map matching and covariance estimation method using lane pairs with the same type of their shape. For the under-constrained shapes, the geometry-based map-matching algorithm and covariance estimation method are applied to avoid underdetermined results. Finally, the measurement calculated from the correction information and predicted pose of the ego-vehicle is exploited for the measurement update of the Extended Kalman Filter (EKF). The proposed method was quantitatively evaluated in the simulation environment, which contains various road shapes, and qualitatively validated for experimental data from an autonomous driving platform. The proposed algorithm shows more robust matching capability, efficient computation time, and higher accuracy than the localization system based on ICP-based lane matching.

AB A shift to larger farms, bigger equipment and reduced crop diversity has been occurring in North American agriculture for many years. This has resulted in an increased reliance on genetic resistance and pesticides because much of the pest reduction from natural biological control (ecosystem services) associated with crop rotation and biological diversity has been lost. This shift has contributed to erosion of cultivar resistance and loss of sensitivity to pesticides. However, the impending change to autonomous field equipment represents an opportunity to reverse the trend towards ever-larger farm equipment. Small autonomous units have the potential to make intercropping, deployment of multi-lines, precision agriculture and even crop rotation, easier and more cost-effective. Remote sensing using drones, combined with precision application of pesticides and improved weather forecasts to help select optimum conditions, could improve the efficacy of both biocontrol agents and synthetic pesticides. Similarly, technologies such as marker-assisted selection for complex traits, gene editing to provide novel sources of resistance, and RNAi (gene silencing) to manage target pest populations could reduce reliance on synthetic pesticides. Crop rotation and improved strategies for deploying genetic resistance, combined with smaller fields, improved scouting and optimized pesticide application, could shift the balance back towards biological diversity and natural biological control within fields. Adding improved genetics for resistance to this mix could further reduce the need for large-scale pesticide application, and minimize both the use and impact of synthetic pesticides in agricultural systems.

AB The European Union's 2020 climate and energy package (known as "20-20-20" targets) requests, among other key objectives, 40% of the electricity production in Greece to be supplied from Renewable Energy Sources by 2020. The main barriers for reaching this target is the intermittency of renewable energy sources combined with the penetration limits in the local electrical grids and the high seasonal demand fluctuations. In this context, the introduction of energy storage systems, comprises one of the main solutions for coping with this situation. One of the most promising technologies for storing the excess energy, that would be otherwise lost, is the production and storage of hydrogen through water electrolysis. Hydrogen can be used for supporting the electricity grid during periods of high demand but also as transportation fuel for hydrogen-based automobiles (e.g. fuel cell vehicles). For this purpose, a simulation algorithm has been developed, able to assess the specifications of the optimum sizing of hydrogen production storage systems. For the application of the algorithm, the area of the Aegean Sea has been selected, owed to the considerable renewable energy sources curtailments recorded in the various non-interconnected islands in the region. More specifically, the developed algorithm is applied to an autonomous electricity network of 9 islands, located at the SE area of the Aegean Sea and known as the "Kos-Kalymnos" electricity system. The results obtained designate the optimum size of the hydrogen-based configuration, aiming to maximize the recovery of otherwise curtailed renewable energy production.

AB Obstacle visualization and detection are essential parts of autonomous driving. The capability of accurately and rapidly collecting 3-D information of the surrounding environment plays a key role in driving decisions of autonomous vehicles. As an active detection device, light detection and ranging (LiDAR) enables high-speed and real-time depth information acquisition by emitting laser pulses and then receiving echoes. However, the frame rate and density of the point cloud generated by conventional LiDARs are limited by the fixing trajectory of the beam-steering unit, which cannot satisfy the requirements of various scenes. This article presented a novel nonrepetitive scanning algorithm and a LiDAR prototype using a galvanometer scanner as the beam-steering unit. The algorithm achieves dynamic scanning between frame rate and lateral resolution by the superposition of multiple raw frames with sparser nonrepetitive trajectory. The LiDAR was made of off-the-shelf components to limit the cost less than U.S. $450 and extend its application scenarios. Experimental results demonstrated that the proposed LiDAR achieved dynamic frame rate and lateral resolution. Each raw frame of point cloud has a lateral resolution of 190 x 16 and four raw frames with different trajectories synthesize a superposition frame with a quadruple resolution of 190 x 64. Complex profiles of targets become clear with the superposition of multiple raw frames. Thus, the novel nonrepetitive scanning improves the LiDAR performance in detecting obstacles with small sizes and maintains the detection of large obstacles at higher speed.

AB We consider autonomous racing of two cars and present an approach to formulate racing decisions as a noncooperative nonzero-sum game. We design three different games where the players aim to fulfill static track constraints as well as avoid collision with each other; the latter constraint depends on the combined actions of the two players. The difference between the games is the collision constraints and the payoff. In the first game, collision avoidance is only considered by the follower, and each player maximizes their own progress toward the finish line. We show that, thanks to the sequential structure of this game, equilibria can be computed through an efficient sequential maximization approach. Furthermore, we show that these actions, if feasible, are also a Stackelberg and Nash equilibrium in pure strategies of our second game where both players consider the collision constraints. The payoff of our third game is designed to promote blocking, by additionally rewarding the cars for staying ahead at the end of the horizon. We show that this changes the Stackelberg equilibrium, but has a minor influence on the Nash equilibria. For online implementation, we propose to play the games in a moving horizon fashion and discuss two methods for guaranteeing feasibility of the resulting coupled repeated games. Finally, we study the performance of the proposed approaches in simulation for a setup that replicates the miniature race car tested at the Automatic Control Laboratory, ETH Zurich, Switzerland. The simulation study shows that the presented games can successfully model different racing behaviors and generate interesting racing situations.

AB Image-based object detection is a crucial task in autonomous driving. In many cases, objects are not correctly detected and classified if they are only partially visible due to a limited field of view. Also, even if stitched panoramic images are used, errors in object detection can still occur if the seam between individual images is visible. This happens due to vignetting or different exposure, although the images are optimally aligned. In this article, we present a real-time capable and effective method for vignetting compensation and exposure correction. Before runtime, the camera response function is determined and the vignetting model is preliminarily approximated. We obtain the irradiance from the intensity values of incoming images. Then, the vignetting model is applied. Afterwards, the pixels at the seam are used to correct the exposure. Finally, we convert the corrected irradiance back to intensity values. We evaluate our approach by measuring the image stitching accuracy in the overlapping area by the IoU of grayscale histograms and the mean absolute error of intensity values. The metrics are applied both on data recorded with our experimental vehicle and on the publicly available nuScenes dataset. Finally, we demonstrate that our approach runs in real-time on GPU.

AB Performing agile maneuvers autonomously remains a challenge for miniature fixed-wing unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) because they are required to fly along complex trajectories while approaching their physical limits. This article proposes an integrated maneuver planning and tracking method to address this issue. The developed approach is built upon the learning from demonstration (LFD) framework. First, an experienced pilot performs several sophisticated maneuvers manually. Then, instead of directly controlling the UAV to track the demonstrated trajectory, we split the teaching maneuvers into multiple segments. A novel dynamic motion primitive in terms of a unit dual quaternion (DQ-DMP) is then developed to encode and store those segments' rotational and translational features. Besides, a robust connecting method for the learned DQ-DMPs is introduced, resulting in a smooth maneuvering trajectory that even the pilot has not taught yet. Additionally, a cascaded dynamic inversion control scheme with stable tracking performance is also developed. Our system is integrated into an autonomous fixed-wing drone and implements severalcomplex maneuvers in the outdoor environment. The results of comparative experiments and outdoor flight reveal that our approach can learn, adapt and generalize maneuvers in real-world scenarios.

AB Autonomous unmanned systems and robots must be able to actively leverage all available information sources - including imprecise but readily available semantic observations provided by human collaborators. This work develops and validates a novel active collaborative human-machine sensing solution for robotic information gathering and optimal decision making problems, with an example implementation of a dynamic target search scenario. Our approach uses continuous partially observable Markov decision process (CPOMDP) planning to generate vehicle trajectories that optimally exploit imperfect detection data from onboard sensors, as well as semantic natural language observations that can be specifically requested from human sensors. The key innovations are a method for the inclusion of a human querying/sensing model in a CPOMDP based autonomous decision making process, as well as a scalable hierarchical Gaussian mixture model formulation for efficiently solving CPOMDPs with semantic observations in continuous dynamic state spaces. Unlike previous state-of-the-art approaches this allows planning in large, complex, highly segmented environments. Our solution is demonstrated and validated with a real human-robot team engaged in dynamic indoor target search and capture scenarios on a custom testbed. (C) 2021 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Cities strive to invent and deploy smart solutions in the domain of urban mobility, so as to offer innovative services to citizens and visitors and improve the overall quality of life. The focus of this paper is on Autonomous Vehicular Safety (AVS) management systems. Such systems exploit vehicular and road side infrastructures to increase the effectiveness of vehicular communications and the relevant services and applications offered in urban environments. AVS management systems combine physical with digital components, each with different capabilities, and involve many different stakeholders, with often competing goals. Sophisticated development of algorithms for simulating the behaviour of the AVS system is required to avoid wasted resources if, after it is implemented, shortcomings with respect to the originally stated goals are found. To achieve this, a capability-oriented modelling approach is introduced and applied to AVS using the CORE framework. This paper argues that the development of an AVS system entails a coherent approach that gradually progresses from vague statements of requirements to the algorithm implementation. To this end, the paper demonstrates how one may proceed from requirements to implementation in a systematic and model-driven manner, while simulation results prove the applicability of the approach.

AB Introduction: Work Zones (WZs) have long been identified as a source of traffic fatalities and delays. Despite considerable technological advances that have alleviated many operational challenges associated with a WZ, social concerns about safety and mobility near WZs remain. Notably, the concept of a Smart Work Zone (SWZ) emerged from the compelling need to improve the safety and mobility of traffic and other WZ participants. This study reviewed the literature to assimilate studies related to SWZ Systems (SWZSs), report their findings, and ascertain a future path forward. Method: To accomplish this, the existing WZ-related literature base was clustered into safety and traffic mobility topics using Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) modeling. A thorough investigation of the pivotal inferences for the research topics was undertaken to comprehend current SWZ technologies and the need for further research. Results: The review uncovered the prominent features of SWZSs reported in the literature and the hindrances to their adoption. The most reported hindrances are the cost and effort associated with development, installation, and relocation. We uncover that Connected Autonomous Vehicles, vehicle-to-vehicle, and vehicle-to-infrastructure communication, along with technology-based worker training are the most promising next frontier for SWZ. Conclusion: Significant research gaps exist in the literature regarding developing and implementing SWZS. Additionally, little effort has been directed toward developing workers' skills and competency. Practical approaches such as Virtual Reality (VR)-based training are necessary to bring workers up to pace with the developing SWZ technologies. Practical Applications: Future research should be directed towards interconnecting and implementing available safety technologies to automate WZ safety and management. Workers should be trained using more practical techniques. In this context, using VR will enable the simulation of hazardous events in a safe environment while also improving workers' skill retention.(c) 2023 National Safety Council and Elsevier Ltd.

AB IntroductionPD is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder that affects, according to the ICF, body systems (cognitive, visual, and motor), and functions (e.g., decreased executive functions, decreased visual acuity, impaired contrast sensitivity, decreased coordination)-all which impact driving performance, an instrumental activity of daily living in the domain of "Activity" and "Participation" according to the ICF. Although there is strong evidence of impaired driving performance in PD, few studies have explored the real-world benefits of in-vehicle automation technologies, such as in-vehicle information systems (IVIS) and advanced driver assistance systems (ADAS), for drivers with PD. These technologies hold potential to alleviate driving impairments, reduce errors, and improve overall performance, allowing individuals with PD to maintain their mobility and independence more safely and for longer periods. This preliminary study aimed to fill the gap in the literature by examining the impact of IVIS and ADAS on driving safety, as indicated by the number of driving errors made by people with PD in an on-road study.MethodsForty-five adults with diagnosed PD drove a 2019 Toyota Camry equipped with IVIS and ADAS features (Toyota Safety Sense 2.0) on a route containing highway and suburban roads. Participants drove half of the route with the IVIS and ADAS systems activated and the other half with the systems deactivated.ResultsThe results suggest that systems that assume control of the driving task, such as adaptive cruise control, were most effective in reducing driving errors. Furthermore, individual differences in cognitive abilities, particularly memory, were significantly correlated with the total number of driving errors when the systems were deactivated, but no significant correlations were present when the systems were activated. Physical capability factors, such as rigidity and bradykinesia, were not significantly correlated with driving error.DiscussionTaken together, these results show that in-vehicle driver automation systems can benefit drivers with PD and diminish the impact of individual differences in driver cognitive ability.

AB Traditionally, underwater acoustic modems and positioning systems were developed for military and Oil & Gas industries, that require deep water deployments and extremely reliable systems, focusing on high power expensive systems and leaving the use of low-cost devices only attractive for academic studies. Conversely, recent developments of low-cost unmanned vehicles, such as remotely operated vehicles (ROVs) and autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs), suitable for shallow water coastal missions, and the need of sensors network deployments for measuring water quality and studying the effect of climate change in coastal areas, called to the need of low-cost and low-power acoustic modems and positioning systems that are gaining more and more momentum to date. The use of these devices can enable a wide set of applications, often based on low-cost AUV swarm formations, where an acoustic link between the vehicles is required to coordinate the mission, perform the maneuvers, and maintain the formation along the time. Moreover, they can make environmental wireless sensor deployment cost effective by substituting wired systems. Underwater positioning systems, usually used in large-scale operations, can be finally applied to small-scale application thanks to the reduction in costs, at the price of a lower transmission and positioning range and precision. While in open-sea application this performance reduction is a huge limitation, in river, lagoon, port and lake deployments this is not an issue, given that the extremely shallow water and the presence of many obstacles would deteriorate the acoustic signal anyway, not allowing long range transmissions even with expensive and sophisticated acoustic devices. In this paper, we review the recent developments of low-cost and low-power acoustic communication and positioning systems, both analyzing University prototypes and new commercial devices available in the market, identifying advantages and limitations of these devices, and we describe potential new applications that can be enabled by these systems.

AB Power system maintenance is an important guarantee for the stable operation of the power system. Power line autonomous inspection based on Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) provides convenience for maintaining power systems. The Power Line Extraction (PLE) is one of the key issues that needs solved first for autonomous power line inspection. However, most of the existing PLE methods have the problem that small edge lines are extracted from scene images without power lines, and bringing about that PLE method cannot be well applied in practice. To solve this problem, a PLE method based on edge structure and scene constraints is proposed in this paper. The Power Line Scene Recognition (PLSR) is used as an auxiliary task for the PLE and scene constraints are set first. Based on the characteristics of power line images, the shallow feature map of the fourth layer of the encoding stage is transmitted to the middle three layers of the decoding stage, thus, structured detailed edge features are provided for upsampling. It is helpful to restore the power line edges more finely. Experimental results show that the proposed method has good performance, robustness, and generalization in multiple scenes with complex backgrounds.

ID ROAD
AB Lane detection is considered as a key component for the autonomous vehicles of futuristic transport systems. The extraction and fitting problems of lane markers from the road images have been addressed in recent research studies. However, these are still ineffective under curved lane and color light conditions. Illumination changes and the road structure mainly affect the efficiency of lane detection which may lead to traffic accidents especially in case of a curved road. In this work, a novel method based on a low complexity but efficient functional link artificial neural network (FLANN) model is proposed to estimate the entire lane by interpolating the lane markers under different road scenarios. The road image is divided into regions and the extracted lane markers from each region are employed in the proposed trigonometric, polynomial, exponential, and Chebyshev functional expansion based FLANN models for the estimation of the lane curvature. The performance of each model is evaluated and tested on road images using three standard datasets. In terms of mean accuracy and computational time out of four FLANN models, the Chebyshev FLANN (CFLNN) outperforms other three proposed methods. The detection accuracy of CFLANN model is found to be 94.3% which is higher than the results reported by other three models.

AB In this article, we propose a methodology to co-register multitemporal images captured from different sources in order to make it possible to generate precise, fully-automatic spatial information. The goal is to identify objects in images without metric or assigned coordinates by relating them with the same objects in images from other sources where the metric is known. In this way, processing times are reduced and manual intervention is unnecessary, thus making it ideally suited for continuous update programmes. This article describes the use of a modified optimization of the scale invariant feature transform to successfully match old and new images. After that, control points are automatically assigned to each new image to generate orthophotos automatically and evaluate them through positional accuracy tests.

AB A recursive subspace identification algorithm for autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) is proposed in this paper. Due to the advantages at handling nonlinearities and couplings, the AUV model investigated here is for the first time constructed as a Hammerstein model with nonlinear feedback in the linear part. To better take the environment and sensor noises into consideration, the identification problem is concerned as an errors-in-variables (EIV) one which means that the identification procedure is under general noise assumption. In order to make the algorithm recursively, propagator method (PM) based subspace approach is extended into EIV framework to form the recursive identification method called PM-EIV algorithm. With several identification experiments carried out by the AUV simulation platform, the proposed algorithm demonstrates its effectiveness and feasibility.

AB In this work, it is proposed a new family of potentials for path planning algorithms, one kind to the goal and other to the obstacles. With these new potentials it is possible to parameterize the potential scale length and strength easily, providing better control over the moving object path characteristics. In this way, the path problem can be treated analytically. For example, the minimum distance between the moving object and the obstacles can be calculated as a function of the potential parameters. Simulations are made to test its ability to guide a vehicle through an obstacle-free path towards the goal. The success rate of the moving object on reaching the goal is compared with the potential parameters and with obstacle configuration and distribution parameters.

AB The ultra-tight integration of GNSS (Global Navigation Satellite System) and INS (Inertial Navigation System) may suffer from faults in GNSS, INS and integration filter. Both the faults occurred at the current epoch and at previous epochs affect the position solution deviation of ultra-tight integration at the current epoch, and the effect is reflected in GNSS code phase tracking errors. In this paper, a new autonomous integrity monitoring algorithm is proposed for the federated GNSS/INS ultra-tight integrations in which the code phases of local GNSS signal replicas for GNSS signal tracking are completely derived from the integrated navigation solution. In the proposed algorithm, GNSS code phase tracking errors are employed to construct the test statistics for fault detection through a MHSS (Multiple Hypothesis Solution Separation) method improved from the classical MHSS used in ARAIM (Advanced Receiver Autonomous Integrity Monitoring). With the improved MHSS, the proposed algorithm can account for GNSS nominal biases, multiple GNSS faults and the faults in INS and integration filter. The protection levels under multiple hypothesis are also derived. A semi-physical simulation of the federated ultra-tight integration of GPS (Global Positioning System) and INS in airplane approaching case and a vehicle based field test of the federated ultra-tight integration of GPS, Galileo and INS are conducted to validate the proposed algorithm. The experiments show that the designed fault detection can effectively detect the occurred faults and the derived protection levels can correctly bound the caused position solution error.

AB In this paper we present a direct semi-dense stereo Visual-Inertial Odometry (VIO) algorithm enabling autonomous flight for quadrotor systems with Size, Weight, and Power (SWaP) constraints. The proposed approach is validated through experiments on a 250 g, 22 cm diameter quadrotor equipped with a stereo camera and an IMU. Semi-dense methods have superior performance in low texture areas, which are often encountered in robotic tasks such as infrastructure inspection. However, due to the measurement size and iterative nonlinear optimization, these methods are computationally more expensive. As the scale of the platform shrinks down, the available computation of the on-board CPU becomes limited, making autonomous navigation using optimization-based semi-dense tracking a hard problem. We show that our direct semi-dense VIO performs comparably to other state-of-the-art methods, while taking less CPU than other optimization-based approaches, making it suitable for computationally-constrained small platforms. Our method takes less amount of CPU than the state-of-the-art semi-dense method, VI-Stereo-DSO, due to a simpler framework in the algorithm and a multi-threaded code structure allowing us to run real-time state estimation on an ARM board. With a low texture dataset obtained with our quadrotor platform, we show that this method performs significantly better than sparse methods in low texture conditions encountered in indoor navigation. Finally, we demonstrate autonomous flight on a small platform using our direct semi-dense Visual-Inertial Odometry. Supplementary code, low texture datasets and videos can be found on our github repo: .

AB Answering what is the bare minimum combination of avionics and vehicle platform design that enables useful autonomous indoor flight without a Global Positioning System (GPS) is required to understand the lower-cost bounds for indoor unmanned aerial system (UAS) technology. The GT Lama indoor UAS, capable of autonomously exploring indoor areas in the GPS-denied environment discussed here, was designed in an attempt to answer this question. The GT Lama weighs around 600 g (1.3 lb), has a diameter of approximately 70 cm (27.6 in.), and costs less than 900 U. S. dollars. Cost and weight savings are realized through development of an innovative indoor guidance, navigation, and control algorithm that uses only five small off-the-shelf low-cost range sensors rather than expensive and sophisticated sensors such as inertial measurement units, scanning laser range sensors, and GPS. The onboard software leverages the inherent stability of the coaxial rotorcraft platform and fuses information from the low-fidelity range sensors to detect and follow walls and other stationary obstacles. The algorithms are designed to encourage maximum exploration of the perimeter of an indoor environment in a reasonable amount of time. The avionics design and the guidance, navigation, and control algorithms used are discussed in detail and validated through flight tests.

ID IMPINGING JET
AB Mini-vertical take-off and landing aircraft have a wide range of potential applications in urban areas. In flights in confined spaces, however, the aerodynamics of the lifting devices (e.g., tilted ducted fans) change which significantly affects the flight performance. Therefore, for a successful flight, a model is required to provide the control system with the environmental effects on the lifting devices in real time. This paper presents the study performed on a tilted ducted fan to characterize ground/wall effects and develop a practical model for online flight control. For this, computational fluid dynamic simulations were performed in Fluent, for a ducted fan at different distances from ground/wall and with different tilt angles. The incompressible Reynolds Averaged Navier Stokes (RANS) equations, with the standard k-epsilon model and the non-equilibrium wall function, were solved. To reduce the complexity of meshing, the fan was represented by Virtual Blade Model (VBM). A comprehensive study was performed to show that, by using the method of images and representing the fan as a single potential dipole, the fan performance can be predicted accurately on a practical range of operation. The developed potential flow model highly reduces the computational requirements and is practical to use for online semi-autonomous or autonomous navigation of ducted fan aerial vehicles.

ID EGO-MOTION ESTIMATION
AB Object detection is a crucial task in autonomous driving. Currently, object-detection methods for autonomous driving systems are primarily based on information from cameras and light detection and ranging (LiDAR), which may experience interference from complex lighting or poor weather. At present, the 4-D (x, y, z, v) millimeter-wave radar can provide a denser point cloud to achieve 3-D object-detection tasks that are difficult to complete with traditional millimeter wave radar. Existing 3-D object point-cloud-detection algorithms are mostly based on 3-D LiDAR; these methods are not necessarily applicable to millimeter-wave radars, which have sparser data and more noise and include velocity information. This study proposes a 3-D object-detection framework based on a multiframe 4-D millimeter-wave radar point cloud. First, the ego vehicle velocity information is estimated by the millimeter-wave radar, and the relative velocity information of the millimeter-wave radar point cloud is compensated for the absolute velocity. Second, by matching between millimeter-wave radar frames, the multiframe millimeter-wave radar point cloud is matched to the last frame. Finally, the object is detected by the proposed multiframe millimeter-wave radar point-cloud-detection network. Experiments are performed using our newly recorded TJ4DRadSet dataset in a complex traffic environment. The results showed that the proposed object-detection framework outperformed the comparison methods based on the 3-D mean average precision. The experimental results and methods can be used as the baseline for other multiframe 4-D millimeter-wave radar-detection algorithms.

AB Positioning using Wi-Fi received signal strength indication (RSSI) signals is an effective method for identifying the user positions in an indoor scenario. Wi-Fi RSSI signals in an autonomous system can be easily used for vehicle tracking in underground parking. In Wi-Fi RSSI signal based positioning, the positioning system estimates the signal strength of the access points (APs) to the receiver and identifies the user's indoor positions. The existing Wi-Fi RSSI based positioning systems use raw RSSI signals obtained from APs and estimate the user positions. These raw RSSI signals can easily fluctuate and be interfered with by the indoor channel conditions. This signal interference in the indoor channel condition reduces localization performance of these existing Wi-Fi RSSI signal based positioning systems. To enhance their performance and reduce the positioning error, we propose a hybrid deep learning model (HDLM) based indoor positioning system. The proposed HDLM based positioning system uses RSSI heat maps instead of raw RSSI signals from APs. This results in better localization performance for Wi-Fi RSSI signal based positioning systems. When compared to the existing Wi-Fi RSSI based positioning technologies such as fingerprint, trilateration, and Wi-Fi fusion approaches, the proposed approach achieves reasonably better positioning results for indoor localization. The experiment results show that a combination of convolutional neural network and long short-term memory network (CNN-LSTM) used in the proposed HDLM outperforms other deep learning models and gives a smaller localization error than conventional Wi-Fi RSSI signal based localization approaches. From the experiment result analysis, the proposed system can be easily implemented for autonomous applications.

AB There have been recent efforts to increase the degree of automation and frequency of data collection for construction applications using Unmanned Aerial/Ground Vehicles (UAV/UGV). However, the current practice of data collection is traditionally performed, which is manual, costly, time-consuming, and error-prone. Developing vision-based mobile robotic systems that are aware of its surrounding and capable of autonomous navigation are becoming essential to many construction applications, namely surveying, monitoring, and inspection. Nevertheless, the systems above suffer from a series of performance issues. One major problem is inefficient navigation in indoor and cluttered scenes with many obstacles and barriers, where some places are inaccessible by a UGV. To provide a solution to this problem, this paper designs a UAV-UGV team that integrates two custom-built mobile robots. The UGV autonomously navigates through space, leveraging its sensors. The UAV acts as an external eye for the UGV, observing the scene from a vantage point that is inaccessible to the UGV. The relative pose of the UAV is estimated continuously, which allows it to maintain a fixed location that is relative to the UGV. The key aspects for the development of this system that is capable of autonomous navigation are the localization of both UAV and UGV, mapping of the surrounding environment, and efficient path planning using multiple sensors. The proposed system is tested in an indoor and cluttered construction-like environment. The performance of the system demonstrates the feasibility of developing and deploying a robust and automated data collection system for construction applications in the near future.

AB While machines called weeding robots are now commercially available and many more designs are being actively researched, I contend that current machines are not truly robotic weeders, rather they are essentially self-guiding vehicles carrying weeding tools. I consider true robotic weeders to be a far more difficult objective. While advances in robotics have been outstanding, the weeding component often appears to be an afterthought. I contend that the weeding is as complex as the robotics. A genuine weeding robot should be able to: (i) monitor the crop, weeds, weather and soil, (ii) decide when the crop should be weeded, (iii) choose the optimal weeder, (iv) take the weeder to the field, (v) adjust the weeder for optimal performance, (vi) continuously monitor the entire weeder for blockages and mechanical breakages and fix them in the field, (vii) continuously monitor and adjust the weeder's performance, (viii) return the weeder to the farmyard and (ix) clean, maintain and store the weeder, that is replace all human intervention. This ten-point list both defines and is a guide to what is required for completely autonomous robotic weeding. Currently, this list is far beyond current technology and it may be decades before it is realisable. The aim of this study therefore was not to disparage the achievements of agricultural roboticists, rather it is to highlight the complexity and demands of mechanical weeding and therefore describe what is really required to create a true robotic weeder. I therefore hope it will guide and expedite research and lead to more rapid success for robotic weeding.

AB Future traffic will be composed of both human-driven vehicles (HDVs) and automated vehicles (AVs). To accurately predict the performance of mixed traffic, an important aspect is describing HDV behavior when interacting with AVs. A few exploratory studies show that HDVs change their behavior when interacting with AVs, being influenced by factors such as recognizability and driving style of AVs. Unsignalized priority intersections can significantly affect traffic flow effi-ciency and safety of the road network. To understand HDV behavior in mixed traffic at unsign-alized priority T-intersections, a driving simulator experiment was set up in which 95 drivers took part in it. The route in the driving simulator included three T-intersections where the drivers had to give priority to traffic on the major road. The participants drove different scenarios which varied in whether the AVs were recognizable or not, and in their driving style (Aggressive or Defensive). The results showed that in mixed traffic having recognizable aggressive AVs, drivers accepted significantly larger gaps (and had larger critical gaps) when merging in front of AVs as compared to mixed traffic having either recognizable defensive AVs or recognizable mixed AVs (composed of both aggressive and defensive). This was not the case when merging in front of an HDV in the same scenarios. Drivers had significantly smaller critical gaps when driving in traffic having non-recognizable aggressive AVs compared to non-recognizable defensive AVs. The findings suggest that human drivers change their gap acceptance behavior in mixed traffic depending on the combined effect of recognizability and driving style of AVs, including accepting shorter gaps in front of non-recognizable aggressive AVs and changing their original driving behavior. This could have implications for traffic efficiency and safety at such priority in-tersections. Decision makers must carefully consider such behavioral adaptations before imple-menting any policy changes related to AVs and the infrastructure.

AB Deep reinforcement learning (DRL) has emerged as a promising approach for developing more intelligent autonomous vehicles (AVs). A typical DRL application on AVs is to train a neural network-based driving policy. However, the black-box nature of neural networks can result in unpredictable decision failures, making such AVs unreliable. To this end, this work proposes a method to identify and protect unreliable decisions of a DRL driving policy. The basic idea is to estimate and constrain the policy's performance uncertainty, which quantifies potential performance drop due to insufficient training data or network fitting errors. By constraining the uncertainty, the DRL model's performance is always greater than that of a baseline policy. The uncertainty caused by insufficient data is estimated by the bootstrapped method. Then, the uncertainty caused by the network fitting error is estimated using an ensemble network. Finally, a baseline policy is added as the performance lower bound to avoid potential decision failures. The overall framework is called uncertainty-bound reinforcement learning (UBRL). The proposed UBRL is evaluated on DRL policies with different amounts of training data, taking an unprotected left-turn driving case as an example. The result shows that the UBRL method can identify potentially unreliable decisions of DRL policy. The UBRL guarantees to outperform baseline policy even when the DRL policy is not well-trained and has high uncertainty. Meanwhile, the performance of UBRL improves with more training data. Such a method is valuable for the DRL application on real-road driving and provides a metric to evaluate a DRL policy.

AB Autonomous mobile robots are increasingly employed to take measurements for environmental monitoring, but planning informative, measurement-rich paths through large three-dimensional environments is still challenging. Designing such paths, known as the informative path planning (IPP) problem, has been shown to be NP-hard. Existing algorithms focus on providing guarantees on suboptimal solutions, but do not scale well to large problems. In this paper, we introduce a novel IPP algorithm that uses an evolutionary strategy to optimize a parameterized path in continuous space, which is subject to various constraints regarding path budgets and motion capabilities of an autonomous mobile robot. Moreover, we introduce a replanning scheme to adapt the planned paths according to the measurements taken in situ during data collection. When compared to two state-of-the-art solutions, our method provides competitive results at significantly lower computation times and memory requirements. The proposed replanning scheme enables to build models with up to 25% lower uncertainty within an initially unknown area of interest. Besides presenting theoretical results, we tailored the proposed algorithms for data collection using an autonomous surface vessel for an ecological study, during which the method was validated through three field deployments on Lake Zurich, Switzerland. Spatiotemporal variations are shown over a period of three months and in an area of 350m x 350m x 13m. Whereas our theoretical solution can be applied to multiple applications, our field results specifically highlight the effectiveness of our planner for monitoring toxic microorganisms in a pre-alpine lake, and for identifying hot-spots within their distribution.

AB The introduction of automated vehicles (AVs) is commonly expected to improve different aspects of transportation. A long transition period in which AVs will coexist with human-driven vehicles (HVs) is expected until AVs become prevalent. Dedicated lane strategy is considered an effective way to improve road capacity and promote AV use. However, there is a lack of comprehensive research on when and how to implement lane management strategies, and further verification is needed to determine to what extent lane management strategies will affect traffic flow. The dedicated lane strategy will first be applied in highway scenarios, and the merging area is an important zone prone to congestion on highways. There are many impacts of AV on the merging area of highways, but research on the issue that the traffic flow is continually affected after the completion of merging is still lacking. Therefore, this study establishes a lane control strategies framework to investigate the effect on road capacity on the multilane freeway after the merging area. This paper explores the traffic performance of three different lane control strategies with mixed AV/HV traffic flow and investigate when the tested strategies make sense and how sensitive they are to varying AV rates and demands. Specifically, using the open-source microscopic traffic simulation tool SUMO, this study investigates the impacts on traffic performance in terms of throughput, travel time and space mean speed on two-lane motorways at increasing penetration rates of AVs. Moreover, three different lane control strategies (two mixed lanes, one reserved AV lane, and one reserved HV lane) are compared under various demand and AV rates. The simulation results demonstrate that road capacity increases convexly with AV rates. In addition, the results show that the capacity on a one-way two-lane motorway road can be improved with appropriate lane control strategies, especially under high demand and at low to medium AV rates.
   The simulation experiments are described in this study, in which a SUMO-based study is designed to evaluate the different capacities for pure HV or AV traffic, and different lane control strategies under different AV rates and traffic demands, together with the results and the traffic performance in terms of changes in capacity, by measuring throughput. We first evaluate the traffic performance of three different lane control strategies with mixed AV/HV traffic flow and investigate when the tested strategies make sense and how sensitive they are to varying AV rates and demands. According to the results, lane strategy can improve traffic capacity. Based on the giving quantized extent of the capacity improvement, the authorities can make decisions on when and how to deploy to dedicated lanes systematically. Lane strategies can significantly improve traffic performance; it should be deployed first on highways, as there is less interference, especially in merging areas, which are prone to traffic congestion. Subsequent testing can be conducted in different road environments to obtain more comprehensive results.

ID AGGREGATION; PERCEPTION
AB 3D perception is an essential capability of autonomous vehicles. Most state-of-the-art stereo matching networks pursue higher prediction accuracy at the cost of the inference speed. However, high demand on computational resource pushes the cost of hardware, hindering practical applications of stereo matching. In this paper, we propose RMCNet, a novel re-parameterized coarse-to-fine network for stereo matching. RMCNet achieves real time on edge devices while outputs accurate disparity maps. To reduce the computing complexity of 3D convolution in cost aggregation, we propose Mixed Cost Volumes that consist of 4D and 3D cost volumes, enabling efficient optimization of the initial disparity map for real-time inference. An Efficient Feature Matching module is proposed to provide absolute disparity candidates for 3D cost volume. To increase the reliability of 4D and 3D cost volumes, we propose a simple but efficient 3D cost aggregation module and a pyramid 2D cost aggregation module for the aggregation of Mixed Cost Volumes. Moreover, we propose a Re-parameterized Channel Sensing module and a Re-parameterized Disparity-Aware module to replace 2D and 3D convolutional blocks with residual connections. Being evaluated on KITTI 2012 and KITTI 2015, the comprehensive performance of the proposed network is improved by the re-parameterization approach. Outstanding trade-off between accuracy and speed on edge devices over existing SOTA works is achieved. With fast average inference speed on NVIDIA Jetson Nano of 33.74 FPS, the accuracy in terms of 3px-all on KITTI 2012 test set and D1-all on KITTI 2015 test set are 3.01% and 3.41%, respectively.

ID ADJUSTMENTS; MOVEMENT
AB Human body models (HBMs) for vehicle occupant simulations have recently been extended with active muscles and postural control strategies. Feedback control has been used to model occupant responses to autonomous braking interventions. However, driver postural responses during driver initiated braking differ greatly from autonomous braking. In the present study, an anticipatory postural response was hypothesized, modelled in a whole-body HBM with feedback controlled muscles, and validated using existing volunteer data. The anticipatory response was modelled as a time dependent change in the reference value for the feedback controllers, which generates correcting moments to counteract the braking deceleration. The results showed that, in 11 m/s(2) driver braking simulations, including the anticipatory postural response reduced the peak forward displacement of the head by 100 mm, of the shoulder by 30 mm, while the peak head flexion rotation was reduced by 18 degrees. The HBM kinematic response was within a one standard deviation corridor of corresponding test data from volunteers performing maximum braking. It was concluded that the hypothesized anticipatory responses can be modelled by changing the reference positions of the individual joint feedback controllers that regulate muscle activation levels. The addition of anticipatory postural control muscle activations appears to explain the difference in occupant kinematics between driver and autonomous braking. This method of modelling postural reactions can be applied to the simulation of other driver voluntary actions, such as emergency avoidance by steering. (C) 2014 Published by Elsevier B. V.

AB In this article, a mission planner of field coverage operations for an autonomous agricultural tractor is presented. Missions for a particular autonomous tractor are defined using an XML (extendible markup language) formatted file that can be uploaded to the tractor through the user interface. Using the tree hierarchy of the mission file, several actions are determined, including the sequence of points the tractor has to follow, the type of motion between successive points (e.g., straight motion or maneuvering), the type of predefined turning routine used in maneuvering, and the actions that should be taken once the tractor reaches the desired point (e.g., raising or lowering the attached tool, turning on or turning off the power take-off). In order to automatically create the XML mission files, a program was developed using the MATLAB technical programming language. The program uses data regarding the field (geometry, dimensions, field sub-regions, working direction, initial and final desired locations of the tractor), the operating width, and the operation type (mowing, spraying) as inputs. The planning method is based on an algorithmic approach where field coverage planning is transformed and formulated, via semantic representations, as a vehicle routing problem (VRP). By using this approach, the total non-working distance can be reduced by up to 50% compared to the conventional non-optimized method. Three sets of experiments are presented. In the first set, three fields were separately covered; in the second set, three neighboring fields were covered as part of a single tractor mission; and in the third set of experiments, a single field was covered during a hypothetical spraying operation for two different locations of the refilling facility.

AB Rapid development of AI technologies has propelled the seamless integration of physical and cyber worlds with various kinds of online/offline information collected from millions of multimodal sensing systems. The complexity, diversity and uncertainty inherited in such systems, such as Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITSs), have gone far beyond human capacity of managing and controlling. Our team is among the first to propose the idea of utilizing the nearly unlimited computational resources in cyberspace to construct a bottom-up and top-down combined artificial ITSs for testing, experimenting, representation, verification, and validation of physical ITSs. Especially, the parallel transportation has been developed for safer, smarter, greener, and more reliable transportation services. After three decades of research and field studies, the DeCAST in Transverse, i.e., Decentralized/Distributed Autonomous Operations/Organizations (DAO) in transportation systems, has been envisioned. In this paper, we introduce its architecture, operational processes, software and hardware platforms, and real world applications. Specifically, a transportation foundation model driven by artificial transportation systems, parallel learning and federated intelligence, named TengYun, is outlined for DeCAST.

AB This paper describes the initial results from the first of 3 years of planned testing aimed at developing methods, metrics, and targets necessary to develop standardized tests for these instruments. Here, we evaluate range error accuracy and precision for eight automotive grade lidars; a survey grade lidar is used as a reference. These lidars are tasked with detecting a static, child-sized, target at ranges between 5 and 200 m. Our target, calibrated to 10% reflectivity and Lambertian, is a unique feature of this test. We find that lidar range precision is in line with the values reported by each manufacturer. However, we find that maximum range and target detection can be negatively affected by presence of an adjacent strong reflector. Finally, we observe that design trade-offs made by each manufacturer lead to important performance differences that can be quantified by tests such as the ones proposed here. This paper also includes some lessons learned, planned improvements, and discussion of future iterations of this activity. (c) The Authors.

AB Detecting pedestrians in autonomous driving is a safety-critical task, and the decision to avoid a a person has to be made with minimal latency. Multispectral approaches that combine RGB and thermal images are researched extensively, as they make it possible to gain robustness under varying illumination and weather conditions. State-of-the-art solutions employing deep neural networks offer high accuracy of pedestrian detection. However, the literature is short of works that evaluate multispectral pedestrian detection with respect to its feasibility in obstacle avoidance scenarios, taking into account the motion of the vehicle. Therefore, we investigated the real-time neural network detector architecture You Only Look Once, the latest version (YOLOv4), and demonstrate that this detector can be adapted to multispectral pedestrian detection. It can achieve accuracy on par with the state-of-the-art while being highly computationally efficient, thereby supporting low-latency decision making. The results achieved on the KAIST dataset were evaluated from the perspective of automotive applications, where low latency and a low number of false negatives are critical parameters. The middle fusion approach to YOLOv4 in its Tiny variant achieved the best accuracy to computational efficiency trade-off among the evaluated architectures.

AB The Deep Autonomous Profiler (DAP) is a full-ocean-depth profiler rated to 11 km. Its hydrographic profiles and water samples can provide information on physical oceanographic properties, seawater composition, and biological communities at every depth in the ocean. Designed around a 24-bottle rosette, the DAP is an untethered system able to autonomously collect temperature, salinity, and oxygen profiles, as well as water samples. An adaptive sampling method was developed to analyze the water-column data to identify and sample desired features while under way. Acoustic ranging-only tracking is used to monitor and geolocate the system underwater. In September 2018 the vehicle was tested to 8377 m in the Puerto Rico Trench. The DAP was able to generate full-ocean-depth profiles and collect water samples at both preset and adaptively determined depths. To demonstrate the utility of the DAP, we radiocarbon dated the deepest water sampled in the Puerto Rico Trench, providing the first direct evidence of hadal water-mass age in the trench: 318 +/- 25 yr. This paper presents an overview of the DAP system and the Puerto Rico Trench sea trials.

ID PREDICTION
AB Autonomous cars need continuously updated depth information. Thus far, depth is mostly estimated independently for a single frame at a time, even if themethod starts fromvideo input. Our method produces a time series of depth maps, which makes it an ideal candidate for online learning approaches. In particular, we put three different types of depth estimation (supervised depth prediction, self-supervised depth prediction, and self-supervised depth completion) into a common framework. We integrate the corresponding networks with a ConvLSTM such that the spatiotemporal structures of depth across frames can be exploited to yield a more accurate depth estimation. Our method is flexible. It can be applied to monocular videos only or be combined with different types of sparse depth patterns. We carefully study the architecture of the recurrent network and its training strategy. We are first to successfully exploit recurrent networks for real-time self-supervised monocular depth estimation and completion. Extensive experiments show that our recurrent method outperforms its image-based counterpart consistently and significantly in both self-supervised scenarios. It also outperforms previous depth estimation methods of the three popular groups. Please refer to our webpage(1) for details.

AB Geophysical information such as the Earth geomagnetic field and gravity gradient (GG) data can provide a basis for autonomous concurrent orbit and attitude estimation (COAE) of satellites in low earth orbits (LEO), as magnetometers and gravity gradiometer measurements are in general functions of time, position as well as the vehicle's orientation. While gradiometer has recently been investigated just for orbit estimation (OE), the current study is focused on COAE via only utility of the GG data. To this aim, observability conditions are analyzed, where the sensitivity of the proposed COAE approach with respect to various system and roto-translational elements is also examined. Considering the nonlinear nature of the COAE problem, a modified robust unscented Kalman filter is adopted for state estimation that is enhanced by innovation-based fading factors to be robust against the modeling errors. Subsequently, a centralized fusion of GG and three-axis magnetometer (TAM) measurement data is employed to improve the accuracy and reliability of the proposed approach for space navigation. The results obtained from numerical test cases confirm feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed technique for complete COAE of space navigation in LEO satellites. (C) 2019 Elsevier Masson SAS.

AB The distributed nature of policy violations in spectrum sharing necessitate the use of mobile autonomous agents (e.g., UAVs, self-driving cars, and crowdsourcing) to implement cost-effective enforcement systems. We define this problem as multiagent planning with cardinality (MPC), where cardinality represents multiple, unique agents visiting each infraction location to collectively improve the accuracy of the enforcement tasks. Designed as a practical and deployable system, our solution leverages crowdsourced information to determine the optimum cardinality and provide a routing schedule for the agents to achieve the desired level of accuracy of detection and localization at minimum possible cost. We show that by estimating spatial orientation of the agents with single antenna, the accuracy is improved by 96% over crowdsourcing only. Using geographical maps as the basis, we solve the scheduling problem with a 3-approximation ratio in polynomial time that exhibits statistically similar performance under variety of urban locale across multiple continents. The longest path traversed by an agent on average is 1.2 km per unit diagonal length of a rectangular geographic area, even when there are twice as many infractions as agents. Deploying UAVs to the estimated region of infraction improves localization accuracy by approximate to 70% compared to ground vehicles.

AB Language plays a prominent role in the activities of human beings and other intelligent creatures. One of the most important functions of languages is communication. Inspired by this, we attempt to develop a novel language for cooperation between artificial agents. The language generation problem has been studied earlier in the context of evolutionary games in computational linguistics. In this paper, we take a different approach by formulating it in the computational model of rationality in a multi-agent planning setting. This paper includes three main parts: First, we present a language generation problem that is connected to state abstraction and introduce a few of the languages' properties. Second, we give the sufficient and necessary conditions of a valid abstraction with proofs and develop an efficient algorithm to construct the languages where several words are generated naturally. The sentences composed of words can be used by agents to regulate their behaviors during task planning. Finally, we conduct several experiments to evaluate the benefits of the languages in a variety of scenarios of a path-planning domain. The empirical results demonstrate that our languages lead to reduction in communication cost and behavior restriction.

ID SYSTEM
AB Estimating and predicting traffic situations over time is an essential capability for sophisticated driver assistance systems and autonomous driving. When longer prediction horizons are needed, e.g., in decision making or motion planning, the uncertainty induced by incomplete environment perception and stochastic situation development over time cannot be neglected without sacrificing robustness and safety. Building consistent probabilistic models of drivers interactions with the environment, the road network and other traffic participants poses a complex problem. In this paper, we model the decision making process of drivers by building a hierarchical Dynamic Bayesian Model that describes physical relationships as well as the driver's behaviors and plans. This way, the uncertainties in the process on all abstraction levels can be handled in a mathematically consistent way. As drivers behaviors are difficult to model, we present an approach for learning continuous, non-linear, context-dependent models for the behavior of traffic participants. We propose an Expectation Maximization (EM) approach for learning the models integrated in the DBN from unlabeled observations. Experiments show a significant improvement in estimation and prediction accuracy over standard models which only consider vehicle dynamics. Finally, a novel approach to tactical decision making for autonomous driving is outlined. It is based on a continuous Partially Observable Markov Decision Process (POMDP) that uses the presented model for prediction.

DT Article
AB One of the goals of the Mars Science Laboratory (MSL) mission is to collect powderized samples from the interior of rocks in order to deliver these samples to onboard science instruments. This paper describes the algorithms and software used to control the drill, which is the component of the sample collection and delivery system that directly interacts with rocks to create and acquire powderized samples from their interior. This is the first time that autonomous drilling of rocks has ever been performed on another planet. One of the most important components of the algorithm used for drilling is a force feedback control system used to regulate the force applied to the rock during drilling. This algorithm and all of the other algorithms and software used to enable the process of robustly, efficiently, and autonomously drilling into rocks with a priori unknown and widely varying properties are described in detail in this paper. Results are shown from drilling rocks using the drill software on testbed hardware on Earth as part of the software development process. Results are also shown from the first holes drilled with the flight vehicle on Mars, thus successfully demonstrating the first extraterrestrial autonomous drilling of a rock.

AB Autonomous agricultural systems are a promising solution to bridge the gap between labor shortage for agriculture tasks and the continuing needs for increasing productivity in agriculture. Automated mapping and navigation system will be a cornerstone of most autonomous agricultural system. Accordingly, we propose a ground-level mapping and navigating system based on computer vision technology (Mesh Simultaneous Localization and Mapping algorithm, Mesh-SLAM) and Internet of Things (IoT), to generate a 3D farm map on both the edge side and cloud. The innovation of this system includes three layers as sub-systems that are 1) ground-level robot vehicles' layer for conducting frames collection only with a monocular camera, 2) edge node layer for image feature data edge computing and communication, and 3) cloud layer for general management and deep computing. High efficiency and speed of mapping stage are enabled by making the robot vehicles directly stream continuous frames to their corresponding edge node. Then each edge node, that coordinate a certain range of robots, applies a new Mesh-SLAM frame by frame, whose core is reconstructing the features map by a mesh-based algorithm with scalable units and reduce the feature data size by a filtering algorithm. Additionally, the cloud-computing allows comprehensive arrangement and heavily deep computing. The system is scalable to larger-scale fields and more complex environment by taking advantage of dynamically distributing the computation power to edges. Our evaluation indicates that: 1) this Mesh-SLAM algorithm outperforms in mapping and localization precision, accuracy, and yield prediction error (resolution at centimeter); and 2) The scalability and flexibility of the IoT architecture make the system modularized, easy adding/removing new functional modules or IoT sensors. We conclude the trade-off between cost and performance widely augments the feasibility and practical implementation of this system in real farms.
