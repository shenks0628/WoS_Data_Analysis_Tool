AB Increasingly guided by the use of ICT, the flow of humans and materials, smart cities and autonomous mobility amalgamate into a game changer in urban planning. This paper critically explores the role of autonomous (driverless) vehicles in plans for urban futures. By looking into the urban plans of 10 European capitals, we investigate the anticipated promises and hazards of autonomous vehicles. Theoretically, the paper draws upon critical urban mobilities studies that invite interlinking carbon reduction, smart cities and mobility planning. By examining these plans, the paper critically evaluates current urban planning for autonomous vehicles by asking whether one can identify any links to the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals of sustainable cities and communities. A practice-based view on automation is then suggested as a pathway to promote a thorough sustainable mobility transition. It is concluded that none of the plans of the 10 capitals studied require AVs to integrate with public means of transport or to be fuelled by renewable energy sources. Hence, AVs are likely to individualise and intensify the existing automobility regime further and emissions are likely to increase, according to the comparative urban analysis. We therefore conclude that urban policy-making needs to contest the existing techno-centric conception of autonomous vehicles if these are to support the sustainable development goals of cities.

AB This paper presents an efficient and practical approach for a car navigation system (CVM-Car) based on the velocity space optimization paradigm. The method calculates the velocity control commands to keep the car in the lane while avoiding the obstacles detected by the proximity sensors. The car has to follow a road path consisting of a sequence of lanelets. This approach is a lower-level reactive control that combines the pure pursuit method to obtain a reference curvature and a reactive control algorithm that keeps the vehicle in the center of the lane' s free space while avoiding obstacles that can partially block it. CVM-Car formulates local obstacle avoidance as a constrained optimization problem in the velocity space of the car. In addition to the vehicle dynamics and obstacles constraints included by the curvature method, car-shape and non-holonomic restrictions are considered in the CVM-Car velocity space. The method has been applied to an autonomous vehicle prototype.

AB The current non-connected autonomous vehicle scheme for speed changing along the road has limitations. Other alternatives require a central control or a complex communication system between the vehicles. We suggest a low cost and simple method for controlling the traffic of a line of autonomous vehicles using predetermined speed profiles imposed upon the vehicles along the road. We introduce a novel method to control autonomous vehicles traffic. Particularly, we investigate cases where specific velocities are required at some points along the road. This is done by comparing different velocity profiles for acceleration, deceleration or a combination of both. As traffic flow and speed limit may change due to upcoming road conditions, it is imperative to control vehicle line traffic, such that phantom jams will be prevented while preserving maximal traffic flow at minimum energy. We provide a comparison of these profiles for acceleration, deceleration, and for the combined case in terms of traffic flow, energy consumption, travel duration and the resulting jam characteristics. Following the comparison, we conclude that the best strategy would be to use linear speed profiles both to accelerate and to decelerate. Lastly, we suggest a tool to compare speed profiles for deceleration cases where the formation of an upstream propagated traffic congestion is inevitable.

AB One of the challenges with autonomous vehicles is their performance at intersections. An alternative control method for the coordination of autonomous vehicles at intersections is shown. The proposed approach was grounded in multiple-robot coordination and took into account vehicle dynamics as well as realistic communications constraints. The existing concept of decentralized navigation functions was combined with a sensing model, and a crossing strategy was developed. The simulation results showed that because of the proposed approach, vehicles had smoother trajectories when crossing at a four-way intersection. The proposed method was compared with adaptive traffic lights and roundabouts in terms of throughput. Results showed that using a decentralized navigation function for the coordination of autonomous vehicles improved their performance by reducing energy consumption and pollution emissions.

AB Autonomous driving will change the role of the driver. From being the main actor in driving, the driver will now have a supervisory role during the autonomous driving phases. However, if the driver has to take over control of the vehicle, he must be aware of the situation around him. This is why it is important to develop interfaces to keep him in the loop. This article proposes a systematic review of Human Vehicle Interaction providing situation awareness in the context of autonomous driving. Thirty seven articles presenting such interactions are analyzed in terms of design of the interaction (modalities, location, conveyed information) but also in term of evaluation and experimental conditions. We present an overview of previous studies in order to highlight the work already done or in progress. Current studies present mainly monomodal interfaces although the evaluation of multimodal interactions present promising results in this field.

AB This paper proposes a novel two-level model predictive control (MPC) speed control algorithm for autonomous vehicles as a successive convex optimization problem focused on both energy use and arrival time. Internal losses such as detailed motor/inverter efficiency and battery loss, as well as external losses, such as wind and grade, are considered. The effect of the higher accessory energy usage of autonomous vehicles on the energy-optimal speed profile is considered in the algorithm and investigated in the paper. The proposed successive convex approach produces a highly accurate optimal speed profile while also being solvable in real-time with the vehicle on-board computing resources. An electric vehicle model is created in MATLAB/Simulink and validated to real-world logged driving data. This vehicle model is used to perform a variety of simulated test cases, which show an energy savings potential of about 1% to 20% for different driving conditions, compared to a non-energy-optimal driving profile.

AB A driving velocity decision algorithm is used as an auxiliary means for estimating the velocity at which an autonomous vehicle appropriately follows a predetermined path, or for estimating a safe velocity of a remotely controlled robot. To find a reliable velocity decision algorithm for an autonomous vehicle moving over a rough terrain, it is necessary to satisfy the conditions such as the roughness of the terrain, the dynamic characteristics of the vehicle, and safety criteria. Conventional methods usually do not consider these conditions at the same time, and some methods do not estimate a perfect safe driving velocity due to a probabilistic velocity estimation technique. In this study, we propose a new velocity decision algorithm that satisfies safety criteria while considering the roughness of the terrain and the dynamic characteristics of the vehicle. To verify the proposed method, a driving simulation of a 4 x 4 vehicle model with various roughness characteristics was carried out, and the results of the safe velocity estimation were compared with those of the existing method.

AB This paper considers the problem of routing and rebalancing a shared fleet of autonomous (i.e., self-driving) vehicles providing on-demand mobility within a capacitated transportation network, where congestion might disrupt throughput. We model the problem within a network flow framework and show that under relatively mild assumptions the rebalancing vehicles, if properly coordinated, do not lead to an increase in congestion (in stark contrast to common belief). From an algorithmic standpoint, such theoretical insight suggests that the problems of routing customers and rebalancing vehicles can be decoupled, which leads to a computationally-efficient routing and rebalancing algorithm for the autonomous vehicles. Numerical experiments and case studies corroborate our theoretical insights and show that the proposed algorithm outperforms state-of-the-art point-to-point methods by avoiding excess congestion on the road. Collectively, this paper provides a rigorous approach to the problem of congestion-aware, system-wide coordination of autonomously driving vehicles, and to the characterization of the sustainability of such robotic systems.

AB This paper presents a new method to analyze the stability of a general class of mobile robot path-tracking algorithms taking into account explicitly the computation and communication delays in the control loop. These pure delays are present in autonomous vehicles due to position estimation. The problem is analyzed by solving directly the transcendental characteristic equation that appears when the time delay is considered. The analysis has been done for straight paths and paths of constant curvature. The method has been applied to the pure pursuit path-tracking algorithm, one of the most widely used. The paper presents several tests with two different outdoor autonomous vehicles (ROMEO-3R and a computer controlled HMMWV), in spite of difficulties of practical experiments with real vehicles close to the stability limits. These tests pointed out how the predictions of the stability of the proposed methods obtained by using simple models are verified in practice with two different outdoor vehicles.

AB This paper presents an object classification method for vision and light detection and ranging (LIDAR) fusion of autonomous vehicles in the environment. This method is based on convolutional neural network (CNN) and image upsampling theory. By creating a point cloud of LIDAR data upsampling and converting into pixel-level depth information, depth information is connected with Red Green Blue data and fed into a deep CNN. The proposed method can obtain informative feature representation for object classification in autonomous vehicle environment using the integrated vision and LIDAR data. This method is also adopted to guarantee both object classification accuracy and minimal loss. Experimental results are presented and show the effectiveness and efficiency of object classification strategies.

AB Automated vehicles are increasingly getting main-streamed and this has pushed development of systems for autonomous manoeuvring (e.g., lane-change, merge, and overtake) to the forefront. A novel framework for situational awareness and trajectory planning to perform autonomous overtaking in high-speed structured environments (e.g., highway and motorway) is presented in this paper. A combination of a potential field like function and reachability sets of a vehicle are used to identify safe zones on a road that the vehicle can navigate towards. These safe zones are provided to a tube-based robust model predictive controller as reference to generate feasible trajectories for combined lateral and longitudinal motion of a vehicle. The strengths of the proposed framework are: 1) it is free from non-convex collision avoidance constraints; 2) it ensures feasibility of trajectory even if decelerating or accelerating while performing lateral motion; and 3) it is real-time implementable. The ability of the proposed framework to plan feasible trajectories for high-speed overtaking is validated in a high-fidelity IPG CarMaker and Simulink co-simulation environment.

AB Cluster evolution is a challenging problem for vehicular ad hoc network (VANET) in a highway scene with fast moving autonomous vehicles and frequent cluster topology changes. Most of the existing studies analyze the cluster evolution behavior of cluster heads (CHs), and these approaches lead to frequent changes in vehicle structure when CHs change, which easily makes the cluster unstable. In this work, we propose a decentralized autonomous car cluster dynamic evolution model. First, we define a decentralized cluster structure. Then, we analyze the cluster evolution behavior and propose a maintenance method. Next, we define eight vehicle states and their transitions. Finally, we introduce the cluster dynamic evolution model and the collaboration model. The results of extensive simulation experiments show that our method can effectively maintain the consistency of cluster consensus and improve the stability of the cluster structure compared with the centralized cluster maintenance method.

ID STEERING CONTROL
AB This work proposes the control of an autonomous vehicle using a Lyapunov-based technique with a LQR-LMI tuning. Using the kinematic model of the vehicle, a non-linear control strategy based on Lyapunov theory is proposed for solving the control problem of autonomous guidance.
   To optimally adjust the parameters of the Lyapunov controller, the closed loop system is reformulated in a linear parameter varying (LPV) form. Then, an optimization algorithm that solves the LQR-LMI problem is used to determine the controller parameters. Furthermore, the tuning process is complemented by adding a pole placement constraint that guarantees that the maximum achievable performance of the kinematic loop could be achieved by the dynamic loop. The obtained controller jointly with a trajectory generation module are in charge of the autonomous vehicle guidance. Finally, the paper illustrates the performance of the autonomous guidance system in a virtual reality environment (SYNTHIA) and in a real scenario achieving the proposed goal: to move autonomously from a starting point to a final point in a comfortable way.

AB Operations with multiple autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) have a variety of underwater applications. For example, a coordinated group of vehicles with environmental sensors can perform adaptive ocean sampling at the appropriate spatial and temporal scales. We describe a methodology for cooperative control of multiple vehicles based on virtual bodies and artificial potentials (VBAP). This methodology allows for adaptable formation control and can be used for missions such as gradient climbing and feature tracking in an uncertain environment. We discuss our implementation on a fleet of autonomous underwater gliders and present results from sea trials in Monterey Bay in August, 2003. These at-sea demonstrations were performed as part of the Autonomous Ocean Sampling Network (AOSN) II project.

DT Article
DE Autonomous vehicle; defense; security analysis; ultrasonic sensor
AB Autonomous vehicles rely on sensors to measure road condition and make driving decisions, and their safety relies heavily on the reliability of these sensors. Out of all obstacle detection sensors, ultrasonic sensors have the largest market share and are expected to be increasingly installed on automobiles. Such sensors discover obstacles by emitting ultrasounds and analyzing their reflections. By exploiting the built-in vulnerabilities of sensors, we designed random spoofing, adaptive spoofing, and jamming attacks on ultrasonic sensors, and we managed to trick a vehicle to stop when it should keep moving, and let it fail to stop when it should. We validate our attacks on stand-alone sensors and moving vehicles, including a Tesla Model S with the "Autopilot" system. The results show that the attacks cause blindness and malfunction of not only sensors but also autonomous vehicles, which can lead to collisions. To enhance the security of ultrasonic sensors and autonomous vehicles, we propose two defense strategies, single-sensor-based physical shift authentication that verifies signals on the physical level, and multiple sensor consistency check that employs multiple sensors to verify signals on the system level. Our experiments on real sensors and MATLAB simulation reveal the validity of both schemes.

Thus, the RACS system and its routing are formulated with a consideration for system efficiency and passengers' concerns. A meta-heuristic Tabu search method is investigated as a solution approach, in combination with K-Means (KMN-Tabu) or K-Medoids (KMD-Tabu) clustering algorithms. The proposed solution algorithms are tested in two different networks of varying complexity, and the performance of the algorithms is evaluated. The evaluation results show that the TS method is more suitable for small-scale problems, while KMD-Tabu is suitable for large-scale problems. However, KMN-Tabu has the least computation time, although the solution quality is lower.

AB Autonomous vehicles (AVs) are rapidly emerging in United States cities, leaving urban and regional planning institutions unsure how to plan and develop policies. This paper analyzes how regional transportation plans (RTPs) developed by metropolitan planning organizations (MPOs) are approaching the risks and opportunities presented by AVs. Among 52 MPOs, a majority only mention key issues and emphasize high levels of uncertainty. Twelve MPOs develop policies on infrastructure, safety, partnerships, data-sharing, and multimodal transportation. Despite a positive trend, many recently adopted RTPs do not incorporate AVs. To plan for uncertain mobility futures, MPOs must develop more flexible approaches to long-term infrastructure investment.

AB In recent years, autonomous driving technologies are being developed for vehicles and personal mobility devices including golf carts and autonomous wheelchairs for various use cases, not only outside areas but inside areas like shopping malls, hospitals and airpots. The main purpose of developing these autonomous vehicles is to avoid the traffic accidents caused by human errors, to assist people with walking, and to improve human comfort by relieving them from driving. Most relevant research focuses on the efficiency and safety of autonomous driving, however, in order to use by the widespread of people in the society, it is important to consider passenger comfort inside vehicles as well as safety and efficiency. Therefore, in this work, we emphasize the importance of considering passenger comfort in designing the control loop of autonomous navigation for the concept of comfortable intelligence in the future autonomous mobility. Moreover, passenger characteristics, in terms of ride comfort in an autonomous vehicle, have not been investigated with regard to safety and comfort, depending on each passenger's driving experience, habits, knowledge, personality, and preference. There are still few studies on the optimization of autonomous driving control reflecting passenger characteristics and different stress factors during the ride. In this study, passenger stress characteristics with different stress factors were objectively analyzed using physiological indices (heart rate and galvanic skin response sensors) during autonomous wheelchair usages. Two different experimental results from 12 participants suggest that there are always at least two types of passengers: one who experiences stress and the other who does not, depending on the stress factors considered. Moreover, with regard to the classification result for the stress reduction method, there are two types of passenger groups, for whom the solution method is, respectively, either effective or ineffective.

AB Connected and Autonomous Vehicles (CAVs) enable various capabilities and functionalities like automated driving assistance, navigation and path planning, cruise control, independent decision making, and low-carbon transportation in the real-time environment. However, the increased CAVs usage renders the potential vulnerabilities in the Internet of Vehicles (IoV) environment, making it susceptible to cyberattacks. An Intrusion Detection System (IDS) is a technique to report network assaults by potential Autonomous Vehicles (AVs) without encryption and authorization procedures for internal and external vehicular communications. This paper proposes an Intelligent IDS (IIDS) to enhance intrusion detection and categorize malicious AVs using a modified Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) with hyperparameter optimization approaches for IoV systems. The proposed IIDS framework works in a 5G Vehicle-to-Everything (V2X) environment to effectively broadcast messages about malicious AVs. Thus IIDS aids in preventing collisions and chaos, enhancing safety monitoring in the traffic. The experimental results depict that the proposed IIDS achieves 98% accuracy in detecting attacks.

TI Intelligent driving intelligence test for autonomous vehicles with
   naturalistic and adversarial environment
SO NATURE COMMUNICATIONS
LA English
DT Article
AB Driving intelligence tests are critical to the development and deployment of autonomous vehicles. The prevailing approach tests autonomous vehicles in life-like simulations of the naturalistic driving environment. However, due to the high dimensionality of the environment and the rareness of safety-critical events, hundreds of millions of miles would be required to demonstrate the safety performance of autonomous vehicles, which is severely inefficient. We discover that sparse but adversarial adjustments to the naturalistic driving environment, resulting in the naturalistic and adversarial driving environment, can significantly reduce the required test miles without loss of evaluation unbiasedness. By training the background vehicles to learn when to execute what adversarial maneuver, the proposed environment becomes an intelligent environment for driving intelligence testing. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed environment in a highway-driving simulation. Comparing with the naturalistic driving environment, the proposed environment can accelerate the evaluation process by multiple orders of magnitude. Tests for autonomous vehicles are usually made in the naturalistic driving environment where safety-critical scenarios are rare. Feng et al. propose a testing approach combining naturalistic and adversarial environment which allows to accelerate testing process and detect dangerous driving events.

AB In this paper, the leader-follower formation control problem of autonomous over-actuated electric vehicles on a highway is studied. As the autonomous over-actuated electric vehicles have the characteristics of non-linearities, external disturbances and strong coupling, a novel coordinated three-level control system is constructed to supervise the longitudinal and lateral motions of autonomous electric vehicles. Firstly, an adaptive terminal sliding high-level control algorithm is designed to compute a vector of total forces and torque of vehicles, and the stability of the high-level control system is proven via Lyapunov analysis where uniform ultimate boundedness of the closed-loop signals is guaranteed. Then, a pseudo-inverse control allocation algorithm, which can achieve fault tolerance and reconfiguration of the redundant tyre actuation system, is presented to generate the desired longitudinal and lateral tyre forces. Then, a separate low-level controller consisting of an inverse tyre model and two inner loops for each wheel is designed to achieve its desired forces. Finally, simulation results demonstrate that the proposed control system not only enhance the tracking performance, but also improve the stability and riding comfort of autonomous over-actuated electric vehicles in a platoon.

AB The autonomous vehicle, as an emerging and rapidly growing field, has received extensive attention for its futuristic driving experiences. Although the fast developing depth sensors and machine learning methods have given a huge boost to self-driving research, existing autonomous driving vehicles do meet with several avoidable accidents during their road testings. The major cause is the misunderstanding between self-driving systems and human drivers. To solve this problem, we propose a humanlike driving system in this paper to give autonomous vehicles the ability to make decisions like a human. In our method, a convolutional neural network model is used to detect, recognize, and abstract the information in the input road scene, which is captured by the on-board sensors. And then a decision-making system calculates the specific commands to control the vehicles based on the abstractions. The biggest advantage of our work is that we implement a decision-making system which can well adapt to real-life road conditions, in which a massive number of human drivers exist. In addition, we build our perception system with only the depth information, rather than the unstable RGB data. The experimental results give a good demonstration of the efficiency and robustness of the proposed method.

DE Vehicular sensor network (VSN); cooperative autonomous driving;

AB The current autonomous driving vehicles cannot collaborate with each other due to the disconnection of sensors between vehicles, which leads to poor performance in traffic efficiency and safety. Recently, with the development of wireless intelligent sensors, vehicular sensor network (VSN) is emerging to provide information sharing between vehicles, so that cooperative autonomous driving (CAD) can be enabled. This paper especially investigates the VSN-assisted straight-going CAD at urban intersections under the rule of traffic signals. First, the function of VSN is presented, and the information sharing mechanism is designed. Then distributed stop-and-go strategies with maintaining the optimal safety spacing between adjacent vehicles are proposed for multiple traffic cases. With the proposed strategies, every vehicle can get an exact time to decelerate or accelerate at signalized intersections. Finally, we use the model predictive control (MPC) scheme to actuate our strategies, and it is demonstrated that vehicles perform well in both passage safety and efficiency as expected.

Hence, the motivation of this review is to provide information to develop practical physiological sensors to assess behavior, while maintaining the acceptance, privacy, and safety of vehicle occupants. In order to improve driver and passenger experiences and build trust between autonomous vehicles and humans, the current review considers a number of studies addressing driving tasks based on sensors that monitor vehicle occupant behavior. By including applications to emergency and non-emergency driving scenarios, a survey of literature is conducted on physiological sensing for personalization of semi-autonomous driving. Given the limited availability of sensor technology that is specifically designed to monitor behavior in automobiles, the survey is provided as a resource to further physiological sensor development for automotive applications.

AB Motor vehicle powered by regular gasoline is one of major sources of pollutants for local and global environment. The current study developed and validated a new fuel-economy optimization system (FEOS), which receives input from vehicle variables and environment variables (e.g., headway spacing) as input, mathematically computes the optimal acceleration/deceleration value with Lagrange multipliers method, and sends the optimal values to drivers via a human-machine interface (HMI) or automatic control systems of autonomous vehicles. FEOS can be used in both free-flow and car-following traffic conditions. An experimental study was conducted to evaluate FEOS. It was found that without sacrificing driver safety, drivers with the aid of FEOS consumed significant less fuel than those without FEOS in all acceleration conditions (22-31% overall gas saving) and the majority of deceleration conditions (12-26% overall gas saving). Compared to relative expensive vehicle engineering system design and improvement, FEOS provides a feasible way to minimize fuel consumptions considering human factors. Applications of the optimal model in the design of both HMI for vehicles with human drivers and autonomous vehicles were discussed. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The paper gives a survey on the new Expectation-based Multifocal Saccadic vision (EMS-vision) system for autonomous vehicle guidance developed at the Universitat der Bundeswehr Munchen (UBM). EMS-vision is the third generation dynamic vision system following the 4-D approach. Its core element is a new camera arrangement, mounted on a high bandwidth pan-tilt head for active gaze control. Central knowledge representation and a hierarchical system architecture allow efficient activation and control of behavioral capabilities for perception and action. The system has been implemented on commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) hardware components in both UBM test vehicles VaMoRs and VaMP. Results from autonomous turnoff maneuvers, performed on army proving grounds, are discussed.

AB Target following plays an important role in oceanic detection and target capturing for autonomous underwater vehicles. Due to the model nonlinearity and external disturbance, the dynamic model of a portable autonomous underwater vehicle was usually established with parameter uncertainties. In this article, a petri-based recurrent type 2 fuzzy neural network has been built to approximate the unknown autonomous underwater vehicle dynamics. The type 2 fuzzy logic system has been applied to the network to improve the approximation accuracy for systematic nonlinearity, and the petri layer in the network can improve estimation speed and reduce energy consumption. A petri-based recurrent type 2 fuzzy neural network-based adaptive robust controller has been proposed for target tracking. In the offshore experiments, the proposed controller has not only realized stable position and pose control but also successfully followed mobile target on the surface. In the tank underwater experiments, the pipeline target has been successfully followed to further verify the controller performance.

AB The ISO 23150 standard defines the logical interface between sensors and fusion units. To apply this standard to actual vehicles, software is required to convert sensor data into ISO 23150-compliant sensor data. In this study, we developed sensor data processing software to provide ISO 23150-compliant sensor data to autonomous vehicle software. The main contributions of this study are as follows: First, the safety of the software is considered, and its structure and error detection method are designed to minimize the impact of errors. Second, the software structure is in accordance with the ISO 23150 standard, and a framework structure is designed with convenience in mind. Third, we considered its compatibility with adaptive AUTOSAR by designing a data delivery service using SOME/IP communication. We evaluated the security and data delivery delay of the software on a controller used in an actual vehicle and noted high security and real-time performance. The evaluation results demonstrated the feasibility of this method for real-world vehicles. Our study can serve as a basis for advancing autonomous driving technology in the context of ensuring software safety.

AB Aiming at the local minimum point problem in an artificial potential field based on a safe distance model, this article proposes an algorithm for active obstacle avoidance path planning and tracking of autonomous vehicles using an improved artificial potential field. First, a possible road operating condition in which the artificial potential field based on the safety-distance model falls into a local minimum point is studied. Subsequently, an improved artificial potential field method is proposed by introducing the second virtual target attraction potential field, which successfully overcomes the local minimum point problem. Second, a model for autonomous vehicle active obstacle avoidance path planning and tracking based on the improved artificial potential field is established. Finally, MATLAB/CarSim co-simulations were performed under the road conditions of constant- and variable-velocity obstacle vehicles. The simulation results demonstrate that the improved artificial potential field method can effectively solve the local minimum point problem of the artificial potential field based on the safe distance model. Additionally, the safety and stability of autonomous vehicle active obstacle avoidance are improved.

AB The autonomous vehicle is widely applied in various ground operations, in which motion planning and tracking control are becoming the key technologies to achieve autonomous driving. In order to further improve the performance of motion planning and tracking control, an efficient hierarchical framework containing motion planning and tracking control for the autonomous vehicles is constructed in this paper. Firstly, the problems of planning and control are modeled and formulated for the autonomous vehicle. Then, the logical structure of the hierarchical framework is described in detail, which contains several algorithmic improvements and logical associations. The global heuristic planning based artificial potential field method is developed to generate the real-time optimal motion sequence, and the prioritized Q-learning based forward predictive control method is proposed to further optimize the effectiveness of tracking control. The hierarchical framework is evaluated and validated by the numerical simulation, virtual driving environment simulation and real-world scenario. The results show that both the motion planning layer and the tracking control layer of the hierarchical framework perform better than other previous methods. Finally, the adaptability of the proposed framework is verified by applying another driving scenario. Furthermore, the hierarchical framework also has the ability for the real-time application.

AB Influencing factors on crash severity involved with autonomous vehicles (AVs) have been paid increasing attention. However, there is a lack of comparative analyses of those factors between AVs and human-driven vehicles. To fill this research gap, the study aims to explore the divergent effects of factors on crash severity under autonomous and conventional (i.e., human-driven) driving modes. This study obtained 180 publicly available autonomous vehicle crash data, and 39 explanatory variables were extracted from three categories, including environment, roads, and vehicles. Then, a hierarchical Bayesian approach was applied to analyze the impacting factors on crash severity (i.e., injury or no injury) under both driving modes with considering unobserved heterogeneities. The results showed that some influencing factors affected both driving modes, but their degrees were different. For example, daily visitors' flowrate had a greater impact on the crash severity under the conventional driving mode. More influencing factors only had significant impacts on one of the driving modes. For example, in the autonomous driving mode, mixed land use increased the severity of crashes, while daytime had the opposite effects. This study could contribute to specifying more appropriate policies to reduce the crash severity of both autonomous and human-driven vehicles especially in mixed traffic conditions.

AB This paper examines the kinematics and control of a Load Haul Dump Vehicle used in underground mining operations. The aim of the work is to develop an autonomous guidance strategy. A linear state-space, mathematical model of the vehicle is derived purely from geometric consideration of the vehicle and its desired path. Autonomous regulation of the vehicle is shown to be theoretically feasible using state variable feedback of displacement, heading, and curvature error A relationship between stability and vehicle speed is derived. This expression forms the basis of an adaptive tuning strategy, which optimizes the vehicle's dynamic response.

AB Autonomous vehicle systems have been significantly increasing in design complexity, including precise control, reliable communications, and data security. This paper presents a Model-Based Design (MBD) framework on MATLAB/Simulink to integrate the vehicle model, Vehicle-to-Vehicle (V2V) communication model, and autonomous driving scenario model. A vehicle-following control model is demonstrated to maneuver a follower vehicle using locations and velocities of the leader vehicle sent via V2V. The vehicle model consists of Time to Collision (TTC), velocity decision control, path-following control, and vehicle dynamics. The follower vehicle decision is modeled by MathWorks Stateflow considering the important factors including velocities, positions, lanes, obstacles, and buildings that effect V2V communication efficiency. Simulink Design Verifier which is a formal verification tool was then used to verify the TTC, velocity decision, and path following control. The test coverage analysis and test harness were repeated to generate test patterns with 100% coverage results. The experiments were done under the following communications and environmental conditions: single-input-single-output (SISO) without buildings, SISO with buildings, and single-input-multiple-output (SIMO) with buildings. The resulting communication packet delivery ratios were 100%, 95.32%, and 99.91%, respectively. This reveals that the proposed method can effectively model the vehicle following control and autonomous driving scenario including the effects of V2V communications efficiencies.

AB Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) have become essential tools for exploring, mapping and inspection of unknown three-dimensional (3D) tunnel-like environments which is a very challenging problem. A computationally light navigation algorithm is developed in this paper for quadrotor UAVs to autonomously guide the vehicle through such environments. It uses sensors observations to safely guide the UAV along the tunnel axis while avoiding collisions with its walls. The approach is evaluated using several computer simulations with realistic sensing models and practical implementation with a quadrotor UAV. The proposed method is also applicable to other UAV types and autonomous underwater vehicles.

AB Deep reinforcement learning is poised to be a revolutionised step towards newer possibilities in solving navigation and autonomous vehicle control tasks. Deep Q-network (DQN) is one of the more popular methods of deep reinforcement learning that allows the agent that controls the vehicle to learn through its mistakes based on its actions and interactions with the environment. This paper presents the implementation of DQN to an autonomous self-driving vehicle control in two different simulated environments; first environment is in Python which is a simple 2D environment and then advanced to Unity software separately which is a 3D environment. Based on the scores and pixel inputs, the agent in the vehicle learns and adapts to its surrounding. It develops the best solution strategy to direct itself in the environment where its task is to manoeuvre the vehicle from point to point on a simulated highway scenario. The implemented DQN technique approximates the action value function with convolutional neural network. This evaluates the Q-function for the Q-learning architecture and updates the action value function. This paper shows that DQN is an effective learning method for the agent of an autonomous vehicle. In both simulated environments, the autonomous vehicle gradually learnt the manoeuvre operations and progressively gained the ability to successfully navigate itself and avoid obstacles without prior information of the surrounding.

AB A key issue in autonomous driving is the problem of decision logic, particularly, as it pertains to mixed traffic involving autonomous and human-driven vehicles. With this in mind, we develop an approach for modeling the interaction between autonomous and human-driven (or perhaps other autonomous) vehicles via game theory and assess the time evolution of potential collision paths via a reachability analysis of the solution set of a simple hybrid dynamical system that captures the kinematics of the lane-change process. We further utilize a control strategy based on model predictive control to develop a safety-assured motion profile on the part of the subject vehicle. This model is subsequently evaluated in multiple simulation scenarios as a function of a programmable safety assurance parameter. We should emphasize that the proposed approach is proactive in its outlook, as it considers a temporal horizon spanning several seconds and assumes a certain behavioral consistency on the part of the local traffic participants. As such it must be augmented with an appropriate reactive collision mitigation scheme that responds to immediate threats caused by abrupt behaviors that are not predictable via algorithmic schemes. Nevertheless, the scenarios studied here appear to produce intuitively reasonable behaviors that seem consistent with ordinary driving and highlight the prospects of this approach being implemented in autonomous driving strategies.

AB To ensure driving safety, autonomous electric vehicles need to follow the planned path accurately, which depends on the vehicle path following control strategy. It is widely acknowledged that the model-based control strategies have excellent potential on path following, but their effect is seriously affected by the parametric uncertainty. To solve this problem, an adaptive constrained path following control scheme considering the influence of parametric uncertainty is proposed for autonomous electric vehicles. Firstly, an adaptive feedback control law and its update law are proposed to deal with the variation of tire cornering stiffness during vehicle path following process. Secondly, a constraint function for lateral displacement error during path following process is designed to further improve driving safety. And then, the closed-loop stability of the proposed control scheme is proved. Finally, the validation is implemented by simulation and experiment, the results show that the proposed control scheme is effective under different working conditions. The maximum lateral displacement error is reduced to 0.0297m by using the proposed scheme in the experiment. The proposed scheme might provide a theoretical reference for control practice of autonomous vehicles.

ID VERIFICATION
AB The use of neural networks and reinforcement learning has become increasingly popular in autonomous vehicle control. However, the opaqueness of the resulting control policies presents a significant barrier to deploying neural network-based control in autonomous vehicles. In this paper, we present a reinforcement learning based approach to autonomous vehicle longitudinal control, where the rule-based safety cages provide enhanced safety for the vehicle as well as weak supervision to the reinforcement learning agent. By guiding the agent to meaningful states and actions, this weak supervision improves the convergence during training and enhances the safety of the final trained policy. This rule-based supervisory controller has the further advantage of being fully interpretable, thereby enabling traditional validation and verification approaches to ensure the safety of the vehicle. We compare models with and without safety cages, as well as models with optimal and constrained model parameters, and show that the weak supervision consistently improves the safety of exploration, speed of convergence, and model performance. Additionally, we show that when the model parameters are constrained or sub-optimal, the safety cages can enable a model to learn a safe driving policy even when the model could not be trained to drive through reinforcement learning alone.

AB As an emerging concept in the intelligent transportation system (ITS), Opportunistic Autonomous Vehicle Platoon (OAVP) enables autonomous vehicles to self-organize a temporary platoon and travel together. Whereas, electing the platoon leader is a crucial issue to be solved in this scenario. The platoon leader not only suffers from more wind resistance but also spends more computation resources in dealing with tremendous information obtained from the surrounding environment. Hence, vehicles tend to be a follower rather than a leader. In this paper, we propose a reputation-based leader election system for OAVP named RLE, which contains two sub-systems: leader election and incentive mechanism. In the former one, a reputation-based election scheme is first constructed to elect a relatively trustful leader according to the reputation value recorded on the blockchain. The proposed scheme integrates previous experience with recommendations from other members. In the second sub-system, an incentive mechanism is designed to stimulate platoon members to participate actively in the process of election, which is based on the recorded real-time fuel economy among vehicles participating in a platoon. Security analysis shows that the system is sufficient to deal with potential security threats. Experimental results based on the simulated platform demonstrate the practicality and feasibility of our solution.

AB Vehicle automation is used to increase traffic throughput and road safety. Automated vehicles should be highly versatile to navigate on both highways and urban roads. To do so, fully automated autonomous vehicles often adopt motion planners to ensure collision-free and comfortable trajectories. In contrast, in cooperative driving, feedback control is often used to achieve string-stable vehicle-following at very short inter-vehicle distances. In this work, the gap between cooperative vehicle following and trajectory planning is bridged, by using a trajectory planner to generate cooperative trajectories, such that the versatility of an autonomous vehicle is retained, but cooperation is included. The presented method uses B-splines to generate cooperative trajectories. Simulations are used to demonstrate that even under large communication delays, string stable behaviour can be achieved. The use of parametrized trajectories in the form of B-splines ensures only a small number of parameters needs to be communicated between vehicles.

DE Acoustic based navigation; autonomous surface vehicle; marine robot;

AB The use of autonomous marine robots has been rapidly increasing in the development of marine environments. This paper presents the development of an autonomous surface vehicle (ASV) and validation of autonomous navigation technologies. The ASV was developed as a testbed to validate fundamental navigation technologies for autonomous marine robots including both surface and underwater vehicles. The ASV was developed on a catamaran by integrating various sensors and power and electrical propulsion systems, navigation and control systems, and communication devices. As fundamental navigation technologies for ASV, waypoint tracking and obstacle avoidance are developed and tested. Further, using the ASV as a testbed to validate underwater navigation technologies, two types of underwater localization methods were developed. First, an acoustic-based navigation was developed by using acoustic sources as landmarks in underwater environment. The proposed acoustic-based navigation localized both vehicle and source by Kalman filter-based SLAM. Second, terrain-based localization as geophysics-based navigation was developed using a particle filter. Effective resampling can be achieved by using a measurement of terrain roughness. Both acoustic and terrain-based underwater navigation methods are implemented with the developed ASV, and the performance of the navigation methods are evaluated by comparing the estimated localization results to the ground truth acquired by GPS. Several field tests conducted in inland water environments demonstrate the performance of the developed vehicle and navigation algorithms.

AB One of the main goals of the automotive industry is to develop a fully autonomous vehicle. Among the tasks which the fully autonomous vehicle should perform is traffic sign (TS) detection, which has a great impact on the behavior of the autonomous vehicle on the road. In this article, a solution for controlling a vehicle based on detected TSs is presented. For the TS detection, the possibility of using state-of-the-art algorithms based on machine learning, specifically you only look once (YOLOv3) and YOLOv4, was examined. The part of the solution for controlling the vehicle is developed using robot operating system (ROS), where the complete solution is tested in the car learning to act (CARLA) open-source simulator. TS detectors are evaluated on a real-world dataset and synthetic dataset, after which the proposed solution is tested on different scenarios created in the CARLA simulator in different weather conditions (sunny, rainy, foggy, night). The results show that the proposed solution achieved the highest correct actions rate of 95.83% when using the TS detector based on YOLOv4 trained on both real and synthetic data.

AB Autonomous marine vehicles (AMVs), including autonomous surface and underwater vehicles, are versatile means to explore, exploit, monitor, and protect marine resources and environments. Motion control is a fundamental enabling technique for state-of-the-art AMV development. Especially, guidance is a critical component in AMV motion control. In recent years, line-of-sight (LOS) guidance, as an efficient guidance method, has attracted tremendous interest from both theoretical and practical perspectives. In this paper, an overview of recent advances in LOS guidance for AMV path following is provided. First, a control objective for the path following of an AMV with a kinematic model is specified. Next, major LOS guidance laws for path following are reviewed in detail. Then, LOS guidance laws applicable to coordinated path following of multiple AMVs are elaborated. Finally, six challenging issues for future research are addressed.

AB This paper proposes a novel robust path-following strategy for autonomous road vehicles based on type-2 fuzzy PID neural network (PIDT2FNN) method coupled to an Extended Kalman Filter-based Fuzzy Neural Network (EKFNN) observer. Uncertain Gaussian membership functions (MFs) are employed to self-adjust the universe of discourse for MFs using the adaptation mechanism derived from Lyapunov stability theory and Barbalat's lemma. External disturbances are significant in autonomous vehicles by changing the driving condition. Furthermore, parametric uncertainties related to the physical limits of tires and the change of the vehicle mass may significantly affect the desired performance of autonomous vehicles. The robustness of the proposed controller against the parametric uncertainties and external disturbances is compared with one active disturbance rejection control (ADRC) algorithm, and a linear-quadratic tracking (LQT) method. The obtained results in terms of the maximum error and root mean square error (RMSE), demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed control algorithm to reach the minimized path-tracking error.

AB Autonomous Vehicles have become the focus of research around the world. Meanwhile, the continuous development of various emerging technologies in recent years has paved the way for the realization of fully autonomous driving. Furthermore, high-precision navigation and positioning systems are crucial to self-driving cars. For navigation and positioning technology of autonomous vehicles, Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS)/Inertial Navigation System (INS) integrated navigation is of great significance to realizing high-precision navigation and positioning of autonomous vehicles. This paper researches and summarizes the development and current situation of GNSS, INS, and GNSS/INS integrated navigation technology. GNSS/INS integrated navigation algorithms are divided into four different models of combination methods: Ultra tightly Coupled, Tightly Coupled, Semi-tightly Coupled, and Loosely Coupled. Besides, the advantages and disadvantages of these four integrated navigation algorithms are compared and discussed. The characteristics of different GNSS/INS coupling models are summarized in the last chapter, and the potential research direction of GNSS/INS in the future is proposed.

AB Autonomous urban vehicle prototypes are expected to be efficient even in not explicitly planned circumstances and dynamic environments. The development of autonomous vehicles for urban driving needs real-time information from vehicles and road network to optimize traffic flows. In traffic agent-based models, each vehicle is an agent, while the road network is the environment. Cognitive agents are able to reason on the perceived data, to evaluate the information obtained by reasoning, and to learn and respond, preserving their selfsufficiency, independency, self-determination, and self-reliance. In this paper, a bio-inspired cognitive agent for autonomous urban vehicles routing optimization is proposed. The use of selected bio-inspired analyzing techniques, which are commonly employed to investigate the topological and functional features of a metabolic network, allows the agent to analyze the structural aspects of a road network, find its extreme pathways and outline the balanced flow combinations. This approach optimizes traffic flows over network, minimizes road congestions, and maximizes the number of autonomous vehicles reaching their destination target. Agent behavior has been tested using data coming from Palermo urban road network, Italy, while the adopted bio-inspired analysis techniques have been compared with the A* literature algorithm. Experimental results demonstrate that the approach permits to find a better global routing optimization solution. To the best of our knowledge, it is the first time that metabolic mechanisms involved in a cell survival process have been used to design a congestion solution.

AB Autonomous vehicles are aiming at improving driving safety and comfort. They need to perform socially accepted behaviors in complex urban scenarios including human-driven vehicles with uncertain intentions. What's more, understanding human drivers' driving styles that make the systems more human-like or personalized is the key to improve the system performance, in particular, the acceptance and adaption of autonomous vehicles to human passengers. In this study, a personalized intention-aware autonomous driving strategy is proposed. An online driving style identification is proposed based on double-level Multi-dimension Gaussian Hidden Markov Process (MGHMP) with arbitration mechanism and evaluated in field test. A Mixed Observable Markov Decision Process (MOMDP) is built to model the general personalized intention-aware framework. A human-like policy generation mechanism is used to generate the possible candidates to overcome the difficulty in solving MOMDP. The index of surrounding vehicles' intention of the upper-level MGHMP is updated during each prediction time step. The weighting factors of the reward function are configured with the identification result of lower-level MGHMP. The personalized intention-aware autonomous driving strategy is evaluated on a Real-Time Intelligent Simulation Platform. Results show that the proposed strategy can achieve the online identification accuracy above 95 % and for personalized autonomous driving in scenarios mixed with human-driven vehicles with uncertain intentions.

AB In order to improve the safety and comfort of autonomous vehicles passing through the expressway, relevant departments of expressway construction often design and lay consecutive speed control humps (SCHs) with cross-sections of different shapes according to different road conditions, such as the combination of trapezoidal and sinusoidal SCHs. In this paper, we conduct a study about the nonlinear dynamic characteristics of the autonomous vehicle passing through hybrid SCHs. Firstly, a four-degree-of-freedom (4-DOF) nonlinear model of the vehicle suspension and the speed coupling excitation model under hybrid SCHs are established. Then the fourth-fifth order Runge-Kutta method is used to simulate the nonlinear system, and its nonlinear dynamic characteristics are analyzed. The results show that chaotic motion occurs when the vehicle passes through hybrid SCHs, and the speed range of chaotic motion is obtained. Then, a direct variable feedback control method is used to suppress the chaotic vibration of semi-active suspension vehicles, and the effect is verified by simulation experiments. Finally, this paper presents a multi-objective optimization model based on a genetic algorithm (GA) for active suspension vehicles. The optimization model selects the vertical displacement and pitching angle of the vehicle body as the objective function. The research results of this paper can provide information on the ride comfort's optimization for autonomous vehicles passing through hybrid SCHs and on the design of vehicle suspension system.

AB The development of autonomous vehicles is becoming increasingly popular and gathering real-world data is considered a valuable task. Many datasets have been published recently in the autonomous vehicle sector, with synthetic datasets gaining particular interest due to availability and cost. For a real implementation and correct evaluation of vehicles at higher levels of autonomy, it is also necessary to consider human interaction, which is precisely something that lacks in existing datasets. In this article the UPCT dataset is presented, a public dataset containing high quality, multimodal data obtained using state-of-the-art sensors and equipment installed onboard the UPCT's CICar autonomous vehicle. The dataset includes data from a variety of perception sensors including 3D LiDAR, cameras, IMU, GPS, encoders, as well as driver biometric data and driver behaviour questionnaires. In addition to the dataset, the software developed for data synchronisation and processing has been made available. The quality of the dataset was validated using an end-to-end neural network model with multiple inputs to obtain the speed and steering wheel angle and it obtained very promising results.

AB Transportation sustainability is adversely affected by recurring traffic congestions, especially at urban intersections. Frequent vehicle deceleration and acceleration caused by stop-and-go behaviours at intersections due to congestion adversely impacts energy consumption and ambient air quality. Availability of the maturing vehicle technologies such as autonomous vehicles and Vehicle-To-Vehicle (V2V) / Vehicle-To-Infrastructure (V2I) communications provides technical feasibility to develop solutions that can reduce vehicle stops at intersections, hence enhance the sustainability of intersections. This paper presents a next-generation intersection control system for autonomous vehicles, which is named ACUTA. ACUTA employs an enhanced reservation-based control algorithm that controls autonomous vehicles' passing sequence at an intersection. Particularly, the intersection is divided into n-by-n tiles. An intersection controller reserves certain time-space for each vehicle, and assures no conflict exists between reservations. The algorithm was modelled in microscopic traffic simulation platform VISSIM. ACUTA algorithm modelling as well as enhancement strategies to minimize vehicle intersection stops and eventually emission and energy consumption were discussed in the paper. Sustainability benefits offered by this next-generation intersection were evaluated and compared with traditional intersection control strategies. The evaluation reveals that multi-tile ACUTA reduces carbon monoxide (CO) and Particulate Matter (PM) 2.5 emissions by about 5% under low to moderate volume conditions and by about 3% under high volume condition. Meanwhile, energy consumption is reduced by about 4% under low to moderate volume conditions and by about 12% under high volume condition. Compared with four-way stop control, single-tile ACUTA reduces CO and PM 2.5 emissions as well as energy consumption by about 15% under any prevailing volume conditions. These findings validated the sustainability benefits of employing next-generation vehicle technologies in intersection traffic control. In addition, extending the ACUTA to corridor level was explored in the paper.

AB An important area of cyber-physical systems research is the development of smart ground transportation systems due to their potentially significant impact on safety, the economy, and the environment. We propose an approach based on model predictive control (MPC) for the development of provably collision free autonomous ground transportation systems, and present an autonomous intersection management framework. The MPC approach enables a vehicle to generate its own motion locally in time based on an optimization framework, incorporating constraints based on the states of other vehicles in the neighborhood, the speed limit of a road, the maximum values of acceleration and deceleration, etc. Safety and liveness of the traffic are however system-wide properties, not merely neighborhood properties, and the challenge is to augment this distributed optimization with coordination rules that guarantee overall system-wide safety as well as liveness of the traffic. We design two vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) coordination rules, along with a vehicle-to-infrastructure rule, and establish the system-wide safety and liveness of the autonomous traffic based on each vehicle's MPC motion planner, operating in conjunction with an algorithm that orders vehicles according to their runtime properties. We also conduct a comparative simulation study of the throughput performance at an intersection of the above approach against another popular algorithm, the All-Way STOP.

AB This paper presents a path-planning strategy for autonomous vehicles which aims to provide safe and feasible manoeuvres in various driving environments. Our strategy uses a hierarchical architecture which consists of three components: a behaviour planner, a map and path selector and a local-path planner. The behaviour planner performs the rule-based decision process which determines the overall vehicle manoeuvres. The map and path selector preprocesses perception data and chooses a local-path-planning algorithm using the results of the behaviour planner. From this selection, the local-path planner generates a driveable and collision-free path. For reliable path generation under various driving conditions, the proposed local path planner employs two algorithms: a road-model-based path planning algorithm and a graph-structure-based path-planning algorithm. The former is used for structured road driving, such as lane keeping or changing, and the latter is used for unstructured road driving. The proposed hierarchical path-planning algorithm was implemented in the autonomous vehicle called A1, which was applied with an in-vehicle-network-based distributed system architecture. A1 won the 2012 Autonomous Vehicle Competition organized by the Hyundai Motor Group in Korea.

AB We are developing a novel framework, PRIDE (PRediction In Dynamic Environments), to perform moving object prediction (MOP) for autonomous ground vehicles. The underlying concept is based upon a inulti-reSOILItional, hierarchical approach which incorporates multiple prediction algorithms into a single, unifying framework. The lower levels of the framework utilize estimation-theoretic short-term predictions while the upper levels utilize a probabilistic prediction approach based oil Situation recognition with an underlying cost model. The estimation-theoretic short-term prediction is via an extended Kalman filter-based algorithm using sensor data to predict the future location of moving objects with an associated confidence measure. The proposed estimation-theoretic approach does not incorporate a priori knowledge such as road networks and traffic signage and assumes uninfluenced constant trajectory and is thus Suited for short-term prediction in both on-road and off-road driving. In this article, we analyze the complementary role played by vehicle kinematic models in such short-term prediction of moving objects. In particular, the importance of vehicle process models and their effect oil predicting the positions and orientations of moving objects for autonomous ground vehicle navigation are examined. We present results using field data obtained from different autonomous ground vehicles operating in Outdoor environments.

AB Active safety systems contribute significantly to the safe driving of autonomous vehicles in hazardous circumstances. However, conventional active safety systems that mainly depend on braking intervention may not yield the desired vehicle behaviour in critical situations where the tyre forces tend to saturate. Over-actuation through individually cambering the wheels provides a possibility of overcoming this difficulty, as extra lateral tyre forces can potentially be produced. This paper presents active camber for improving the path following and yaw stability performance of over-actuated autonomous electric vehicles (AEVs). With a modified Dugoff tyre model, the camber effect on the lateral tyre force is modelled as an effective linear component. The modified tyre model, together with a double-track vehicle model, is utilised for active camber of the AEVs. The camber controller is developed in the framework of model predictive control (MPC), including both actuator- and safety-related constraints. The camber controller is investigated at different camber rates and road friction levels, in terms of path following, yaw stability and vehicle velocity gain.

AB Collision avoidance and stabilisation are two of the most crucial concerns when an autonomous vehicle finds itself in emergency situations, which usually occur in a short time horizon and require large actuator inputs, together with highly nonlinear tyre cornering response. In order to avoid collision while stabilising autonomous vehicle under dynamic driving situations at handling limits, this paper proposes a novel emergency steering control strategy based on hierarchical control architecture consisting of decision-making layer and motion control layer. In decision-making layer, a dynamic threat assessment model continuously evaluates the risk associated with collision and destabilisation, and a path planner based on kinematics and dynamics of vehicle system determines a collision-free path when it suddenly encounters emergency scenarios. In motion control layer, a lateral motion controller considering nonlinearity of tyre cornering response and unknown external disturbance is designed using tyre lateral force estimation-based backstepping sliding-mode control to track a collision-free path, and to ensure the robustness and stability of the closed-loop system. Both simulation and experiment results show that the proposed control scheme can effectively perform an emergency collision avoidance manoeuvre while maintaining the stability of autonomous vehicle in different running conditions.

AB Random network delay will introduce uncertainty into trajectory tracking model of the autonomous vehicle, which seriously deteriorates the vehicle's control system stability and trajectory tracking accuracy. In this paper, considering steering angle oscillation caused by random network delay, trajectory tracking system robustness and stability is analyzed and a linear uncertain time-delay system is established. Comprehensively considering control system accuracy, robustness, and computational efficiency in the rolling optimization of Model Predictive Control (MPC), Adaptive Model Predictive Control for Uncertain model (UM-AMPC) algorithm is proposed to predict control variables for the next sampling time and alleviate the target angle discontinuity. This is achieved by operating target angle signal and augmented state variables, which are received by the lower nodes during the period from the current sampling time to network delay upper bound. The hardware-in-the-loop simulation results show that the proposed algorithm can effectively guarantee system stability and tracking accuracy of the autonomous vehicle under random network delay.

AB As an important driving behavior, lane-changing has a great impact on the safety and efficiency of traffic flow interacting with surrounding vehicles, especially in mixed traffic flows with autonomous vehicles and humandriven vehicles. This study proposes a deep reinforcement learning-based lane-changing model to train autonomous vehicles to complete lane-changing in the interaction with different human driving behaviors. First, a mixed-flow lane-changing environment of vehicle group level is constructed with surrounding vehicle trajectories extracted from natural driving trajectories. Then, the state space and action space are determined, the reward function is designed to comprehensively consider safety and efficiency, so as to guide autonomous vehicles not to collide, and determine the acceleration and direction angle to complete lane-changing behavior, and a collision avoidance strategy is integrated into the proposed method to ensure the safety of longitudinal motion. Furthermore, the trained model can learn the experience of successful lane-changing, resulting in a 90% success rate without collision in testing. Finally, the driving performance of the proposed method is analyzed in terms of safety and efficiency evaluation indicators, which proves that the proposed method can improve the efficiency and safety of the lane-changing process.

AB In autonomous driving vehicles, the driver can engage in non-driving-related tasks and does not have to pay attention to the driving conditions or engage in manual driving. If an unexpected situation arises that the autonomous vehicle cannot manage, then the vehicle should notify and help the driver to prepare themselves for retaking manual control of the vehicle. Several effective notification methods based on multimodal warning systems have been reported. In this paper, we propose an advanced method that employs alarms for specific conditions by analyzing the differences in the driver's responses, based on their specific situation, to trigger visual and auditory alarms in autonomous vehicles. Using a driving simulation, we carried out human-in-the-loop experiments that included a total of 38 drivers and 2 scenarios (namely drowsiness and distraction scenarios), each of which included a control-switching stage for implementing an alarm during autonomous driving. Reaction time, gaze indicator, and questionnaire data were collected, and electroencephalography measurements were performed to verify the drowsiness. Based on the experimental results, the drivers exhibited a high alertness to the auditory alarms in both the drowsy and distracted conditions, and the change in the gaze indicator was higher in the distraction condition. The results of this study show that there was a distinct difference between the driver's response to the alarms signaled in the drowsy and distracted conditions. Accordingly, we propose an advanced notification method and future goals for further investigation on vehicle alarms.

AB Autonomous ride-hailing fleets are approaching commercialization as an on-demand, low-cost transportation solution. Although battery electric vehicles (BEVs) are well-studied for this application, hydrogen fuel cell electric vehicles (FCEVs) may provide additional advantages that have not been sufficiently investigated. Here, we developed a stochastic ride-hailing autonomous vehicle (RHAV) model to compare these technologies and applied this model to seven BEVs and two FCEVs. FCEV fleets are 3-10% smaller than BEV fleets due to shorter refueling times and greater driving ranges, which enable greater fleet efficiency. The Hyundai Kona (BEV) provides the greatest fleet profitability; however, the Toyota Mirai (FCEV) is only 3% less profitable despite having a 25% higher purchase price. We demonstrate that FCEVs are economically competitive as RHAVs, and that expected price reductions can make them the most profitable technology. Furthermore, FCEV fleets provide qualitative benefits, including a substantial increase in local hydrogen demand to catalyze hydrogen infrastructure development.

AB In this article, we propose a nonlinear receding horizon game-theoretic planner for autonomous cars in competitive scenarios with other cars. The online planner is specifically formulated for a multiple-car autonomous racing game, in which each car tries to advance along a given track as far as possible with respect to the other cars. The algorithm extends previous work on game-theoretic planning for single-integrator agents to be suitable for autonomous cars in the following ways: 1) by representing the trajectory as a piecewise polynomial; 2) incorporating bicycle kinematics into the trajectory; and 3) enforcing constraints on path curvature and acceleration. The game-theoretic planner iteratively plans a trajectory for the ego vehicle and then the other vehicles in sequence until convergence. Crucially, the trajectory optimization includes a sensitivity term that allows the ego vehicle to reason about how much the other vehicles will yield to the ego vehicle to avoid collisions. The resulting trajectories for the ego vehicle exhibit rich game strategies such as blocking, faking, and opportunistic overtaking. The game-theoretic planner is shown to significantly outperform a baseline planner using model-predictive control, which does not take interaction into account. The performance is validated in high-fidelity numerical simulations with three cars, in experiments with two small-scale autonomous cars, and in experiments with a full-scale autonomous car racing against a simulated vehicle (video is available at https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLmIcLEh8KMje4rYBqRANDuKvqFvj7LCRp).

AB In an era of connectivity and automation, the vehicle industry is adopting numerous technologies to transform driver-centric vehicles into intelligent mechanical devices driven by software components. Software integration and network connectivity inherit numerous security issues that open the door for malicious attacks. Software security testing is a scalable and practical approach to identify systems' weaknesses and vulnerabilities at an early stage and throughout their life-cycle. Security specialists recommend fuzz testing to identify vulnerabilities within vehicle software systems. Nevertheless, the randomness and blindness of fuzzing hinder it from becoming a reliable security tool. This article presents a vulnerability-oriented fuzz (VulFuzz) testing framework that utilizes security vulnerability metrics designed particularly for connected and autonomous vehicles to direct and prioritize the fuzz testing toward the most vulnerable components. While most gray-box fuzzing techniques aim solely to expand code coverage, the proposed approach assigns weights to ensure a thorough examination of the most vulnerable components. Moreover, we employ an input structure-aware mutation technique that can bypass vehicle software systems' input formats to boost test performance and avoid dropped test cases. Such a testing technique will contribute to the quality assurance of vehicle software engineering. We implemented the proposed approach on OpenPilot, a driver assistance system, and compared our results to American fuzzy lop (AFL) and an unguided mutation-based fuzzer. Within 16.8 h, VulFuzz exposed 335 crashes, 41 times more than AFL and two times more than an unguided mutation-based fuzzer. VulFuzz is explicitly efficient for automotive systems, reaching the same code coverage as AFL but with more exposed crashes and fewer dropped messages.

TI Analysis of the Relationship between the Density and Lane-Changing
   Behavior of Circular Multilane Urban Expressway in Mixed Traffic
SO JOURNAL OF ADVANCED TRANSPORTATION

ID AUTONOMOUS VEHICLES; AUTOMATED VEHICLES; SPEED; MODEL
AB The behavior of changing lanes has a great impact on road traffic with heavy traffic. Traffic flow density is one of the important parameters that characterize the characteristics of traffic flow, and it will also be affected by the behavior of changing lanes, especially in the case of each lane. The penetration of autonomous vehicles can effectively reduce lane-changing behavior. Studying the relationship between traffic flow density and lane-changing behavior under different autonomous vehicle penetration rates is of great significance for describing the operation mechanism of mixed traffic flow and the control of mixed traffic. In this article, we use empirical, simulation, and data-driven methods to analyze the urban expressway of autonomous vehicles with penetration rates of 10%, 20%, 30%, 40%, 50%, 60%, 70%, and 80%, respectively. A simulation experiment was carried out on the road, and data related to density, the rate of changing into the lanes, and the rate of changing out lanes were collected. The analysis of the experimental results found the following: (1) The increase in penetration of autonomous vehicles leads to a certain degree of downward trend in density, the rate of changing into the lanes, and the rate of changing out lanes. (2) Different lanes have different effects on the penetration of autonomous vehicles. In a 4-lane road, the two lanes farther from the entrance and exit are closer in appearance, while the two lanes closer to the entrance and exit are similar. (3) The relationship between density and the rate of changing into the lanes and the rate of changing out lanes shows a linear relationship with the penetration of autonomous vehicles. Although the performance of each lane is slightly different, in general, it can be carried out by a multiple regression model. The given parameter value range is relatively close under different permeability. In summary, autonomous vehicles effectively reduce the traffic density and lane-changing behavior of each lane. There is a linear relationship between traffic flow density and lane-changing behavior with the penetration of autonomous vehicles. The density-lane-changing behavior model proposed in this paper can better describe the relationship between the density of the circular multilane urban expressway and the lane-changing behavior in the case of a large traffic flow in mixed traffic.

AB Construction and maintenance of road pavements are both expensive and environmentally unfriendly. The prolongation of pavement life can reduce material consumption and produce a cleaning effect. This study attempts to propose a lateral control scheme for autonomous vehicles that aims at maximizing pavement life. In the key unit of the scheme, the trajectory-oriented method and fatigue damage-oriented method were compared that would be applied to assign vehicle lateral positions. The simulation of a specific pavement structure had been conducted to calculate the fatigue damage growth with the lateral control scheme. The comparison among different methods revealed that fatigue damage-oriented method performs best. Using the fatigue damage-oriented method, fatigue damage growth decreased by 28% when trucks were 100% autonomous vehicles. Besides, the fatigue damage oriented method was found to be insensitive to the autonomous vehicle proportion higher than 20%. The example of dealing with two lanes situation suggests this scheme was also suitable for minimizing the fatigue difference caused by vehicle volume difference on two lanes. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd.

AB Small ducted-fan autonomous vehicles have potential for several applications, especially for missions in urban environments. This paper discusses the use of dynamic inversion with neural-network adaptation to provide an adaptive controller for the GTSpy, a small ducted-fan autonomous vehicle based on the Micro Autonomous Systems' Helispy. This approach allows utilization of the entire low-speed flight envelope with a relatively poorly understood vehicle. A simulator model is constructed from a force and moment analysis of the vehicle, allowing for a validation of the controller in preparation for flight testing. Data from flight testing of the system are provided.

AB Autonomous vehicles have attracted considerable attention in the research community and industry. This paper addresses a problem in designing lateral control law and develops a strategy to determine the given speed of autonomous vehicles. An improved method for calculating the lateral offset and heading angle error is proposed to reduce the impact of reference path data noise. Multiple fuzzy inference engines are used to design the steering controller and determine the given driving speed, including the forward and backward directions. The stability condition is given to guide the design of fuzzy inference engines. Satisfactory simulation and experimental results have been obtained from different reference paths.

AB Heavy-duty vehicles (HDVs) are responsible for a significant amount of CO2 emissions in the transport sector. The share of these vehicles is still increasing in the European Union (EU); nevertheless, rigorous CO2 emission reduction schemes will apply in the near future. Different measures to decrease CO2 emissions are being already discussed, e.g., the electrification of the powertrain. Additionally, the impact of autonomous driving on energy consumption is being investigated. The most common types are fuel cell vehicles (FCEVs) and battery-only vehicles (BEVs). It is still unclear which type of powertrain will prevail in the future. Therefore, we developed a method to compare different powertrain options based on different scenarios in terms of primary energy consumption, CO2 emissions, and fuel costs. We compared the results with the internal combustion engine vehicle (ICEV). The model includes a model for the climatization of the driver's cabin, which we used to investigate the impact of autonomous driving on energy consumption. It became clear that certain powertrains offer advantages for certain applications and that sensitivities exist with regard to primary energy and CO2 emissions. Overall, it became clear that electrified powertrains could reduce the CO2 emissions and the primary energy consumption of HDVs. Moreover, autonomous vehicles can save energy in most cases.

AB This paper studies the connected cruise control problem for a platoon of human-operated and autonomous vehicles. The autonomous vehicles can receive motional data, ie, headway and velocity information from other vehicles by wireless vehicle-to-vehicle communication. The use of wireless communications in information exchange between vehicles inevitably causes input delay in the platooning system. Meanwhile, unpredictable behaviors of the leading vehicle constitute exogenous disturbance for the system. An adaptive optimal control problem with input delay and disturbance is formulated, and a novel data-driven control solution is proposed such that each vehicle in the platoon can achieve safe distance and desired velocity. By adopting an adaptive dynamic programming technique with sampled-data system theory, a data-driven adaptive optimal control approach is proposed for autonomous vehicles by the learning strategies of policy iteration without the accurate knowledge of the dynamics of all human drivers and vehicles. The efficacy of the proposed controller is substantiated by rigorous analysis and validated by simulation results in different scenarios.

AB This paper is devoted to an autonomous approach to a moving ship for unmanned vehicles. The problem is introduced and formulated first. Cooperation between the vehicle and the ship is needed, such that the moving ship to be approached is set to move at a constant speed along a straight line or a circle. Hence, an approaching algorithm based on 3-D path generation is proposed. The 3-D vehicle trajectory produced by the path generation realizes smooth transition from the initial pose to the final pose with geometric constraints. The final poses the unmanned vehicle and the ship's reach simultaneously are analyzed and obtained based on 3-D path generation. The related parameters for autonomous navigation of an unmanned vehicle are discussed according to the straight line or the circle that the ship sails along. The approaching algorithm is sequentially summarized. The simulations are conducted, and the results show the effectiveness and real-time performance of the proposed method.

AB Underwater cultural heritage sites are subject to constant change, whether due to natural forces such as sediments, waves, currents or human intervention. Until a few decades ago, the documentation and research of these sites was mostly done manually by diving archaeologists. This paper presents the results of the integration of remote sensing technologies with autonomous marine vehicles in order to make the task of site documentation even faster, more accurate, more efficient and more precisely georeferenced. It includes the integration of multibeam sonar, side scan sonar and various cameras into autonomous surface and underwater vehicles, remotely operated vehicle and unmanned aerial vehicle. In total, case studies for nine underwater cultural heritage sites around the Mediterranean region are presented. Each case study contains a brief archaeological background of the site, the methodology of using autonomous marine vehicles and sensors for their documentation, and the results in the form of georeferenced side-scan sonar mosaics, bathymetric models or reconstructed photogrammetric models. It is important to mention that this was the first time that any of the selected sites were documented with sonar technologies or autonomous marine vehicles. The main objective of these surveys was to document and assess the current state of the sites and to establish a basis on which future monitoring operations could be built and compared. Beyond the mere documentation and physical preservation, examples of the use of these results for the digital preservation of the sites in augmented and virtual reality are presented.

AB Visual servoing approaches navigate a robot to the desired pose with respect to a given object using image measurements. As a result, these approaches have several applications in manipulation, navigation and inspection. However, existing visual servoing approaches are instance specific, that is, they control camera motion between two views of the same object. In this paper, we present a framework for visual servoing to a novel object instance. We further employ our framework for the autonomous inspection of vehicles using Micro Aerial Vehicles (MAVs), which is vital for day-to-day maintenance, damage assessment, and merchandising a vehicle. This visual inspection task comprises the MAV visiting the essential parts of the vehicle, for example, wheels, lights, and so forth, to get a closer look at the damages incurred. Existing methods for autonomous inspection could not be extended for vehicles due to the following reasons: First, several existing methods require a 3D model of the structure, which is not available for every vehicle. Second, existing methods require expensive depth sensor for localization and path planning. Third, current approaches do not account for the semantic understanding of the vehicle, which is essential for identifying parts. Our instance invariant visual servoing framework is capable of autonomously navigating to every essential part of a vehicle for inspection and can be initialized from any random pose. To the best our knowledge, this is the first approach demonstrating fully autonomous visual inspection of vehicles using MAVs. We have validated the efficacy of our approach through a series of experiments in simulation and outdoor scenarios.

AB This paper presents an obstacle avoidance scheme for autonomous vehicles as all active safety procedure in unknown environments. Safe trajectories are generated using the non-linear model predictive framework, in which the simplified dynamics of the vehicle are used to predict the state of the vehicle over the look-ahead horizon. To compensate for the slight dissimilarity between the simplified model and the actual vehicle, a separate controller is designed to track the generated trajectory. The longitudinal dynamics of the vehicle are controlled using the inverse dynamics of the vehicle powertrain model, and the lateral dynamics are controlled using a linear quadratic regulator. In the non-linear model predictive framework, to obtain safe trajectories, local obstacle information is incorporated into the performance index using a parallax-based method. Simulation results on a full non-linear vehicle model show that the proposed combination of model-predictive-control-based trajectory generation and tracking controller gives satisfactory online obstacle avoidance performance.

AB Human-driven vehicles and different levels of autonomous vehicles are expected to coexist on roads in the future. However, autonomous systems behave differently from their human-driver counterparts, these two behaviors are incompatible with one another, thereby negatively impacting traffic efficiency and safety. Herein, we present the construction of human-like trajectories for use in autonomous vehicles as a possible solution to this issue. We present a trajectory planning method based on the spatiotemporal geometric transformation of driving scenarios to generate human-like trajectories. Speed and safety redundancy data were collected through driving tests to understand human driving behaviors. Self-driving scenarios were abstracted as a Lorentz coordinate system under a three-dimensional Minkowski space-time. A surrounding-manifold tensor equation was established using differential geometry theory to depict the relationship between the trajectory constraints and the geometric spatiotemporal background. A metric tensor field can be solved from the equation to construct the corresponding "volcano space-time", which is a three-dimensional general Riemannian space for placing the subject vehicle and the surroundings. The geodesics of the volcano space-time are solved using the geodesic equation and are projected back into the three-dimensional Minkowski space-time. Geodesic trajectories were fitted as Bezier curves in this study and corrected according to the vehicle dynamics constraints for trackability. In simulation and real vehicle tests, trajectories generated using the proposed algorithm exhibited collision avoidance and trackability, and the algorithm offered behaviors that were similar to those of human drivers under the same scenarios.

AB In an era of environmental and socio-economic crisis, sustainable transport planning is vital as ever, especially given that the transport sector is responsible for the greatest part of total air pollution and greenhouse gas emissions. New vehicle technologies, such as autonomous and electric vehicles, emerge as promising alternatives, creating, however, both opportunities and challenges and raising questions relating to their performance. Can these new vehicle technologies really perform better than conventional ones in terms of sustainable mobility? Which one of them constitutes the optimum solution? How does each alternative perform with regard to different evaluation criteria, such as air pollution or road safety? In order to answer such questions, and to select the optimum solution, a comparison between autonomous, electric, autonomous electric and conventional vehicles is executed, based on a set of social, economic and environmental criteria. For this purpose, a new decision-aiding methodology, allowing for a holistic evaluation of the alternatives through a comprehensive literature review and experts' participation, is applied. It is mainly based on the combined application of two hybrid multi-criteria analysis models, creating a more solid background towards optimum decision-making, thus constituting an important decision support tool for project appraisal and funding within the framework of sustainability in any sector.

AB This article investigates the leader-follower formation control problem for the multiple underactuated autonomous underwater vehicles with model uncertainties and external disturbances. Sliding mode control, multilayer neural network, and adaptive robust techniques are employed to design a formation controller for underwater vehicles. After that, a Lyapunov-based stability analysis is proposed to guarantee that all variables are uniformly ultimately bounded in the closed-loop control system. The following advantages of this approach are highlighted: 1) the proposed control strategy only depends on the measurements of line-of-sight and angle sensors; no other information about the leader vehicle is required; 2) a continuous function is designed to replace the signum term in the control system, which greatly reduces the inherent chattering of sliding mode controller; 3) the proposed controller does not rely on any prior knowledge about hydrodynamic damping and external disturbances, which is easily implemented in practice. Finally, the numerical simulations are provided to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed controller.

AB In the last few years, there has been an exponential increase in the usage of the autonomous vehicles across the globe. It is due to an exponential increase in the popularity and usage of the artificial intelligence techniques in various applications. Traffic flow predication is important for autonomous vehicles using which they decide their itinerary and take adaptive decisions (for example, turn let or right, move straight, lane change, stop, or accelerate) with respect to their surrounding objects. From the existing literature, it has been observed that research on autonomous vehicles has shifted from the traditional statistical models to adaptive machine learning techniques. However, existing machine learning models may not be directly applicable in this environment due to non-linear complex relationship between spatial and temporal data collected from the surroundings during the aforementioned adaptive decisions taken by the vehicles. So, with focus on these issues, in this article, we explore various deep learning models for traffic flow prediction in autonomous vehicles and compared these models with respect to their applicability in modern smart transportation systems. Various parameters are chosen to have a relative comparison among different deep learning models. Moreover, challenges and future research directions are also discussed in the article.

AB The moth-inspired plume-tracing strategies on a single REMUS underwater vehicle successfully tracked a Rhodamine dye plume over 100 m and declared its source location in near-shore ocean environments that are characterized by turbulence, tides, and waves. This paper expands moth-inspired plume tracing via a single vehicle to multiple vehicles. The new strategy includes a mechanism determining a leader vehicle to perform moth-inspired plume-tracing maneuvers and a formation algorithm controlling non-leaders to follow the leader during plume-tracing missions. The Monte Carlo studies evaluate the strategy in a virtual environment where a simulated plume with significant filament intermittency and meander is developed. Considering our application, our simulation studies address an autonomous underwater vehicle's kinematics and dynamics. The results demonstrate plume-tracing performance achieved by multiple vehicles, which automatically switch their roles superior to the single vehicle.

AB This paper proposes a robust path following controller that aims to controlling the autonomous ground vehicle to the handling and driving limits, which is demonstrated by an autonomous racecar. As a worldwide competition for autonomous racecar, the formula student autonomous competition (FSAC) is introduced. The autonomous racecar developed by the authors, who won the champion of the 2017 FSAC, is also introduced. As the key of control framework, an integrated longitudinal/lateral controller is proposed, which is supposed to control the autonomous racecar to the limits on the random racetrack. The longitudinal controller is based on the G-G diagram, which is proposed in our previous work. The lateral controller is designed based on the robust H-infinity output-feedback approach. The particular uncertainties and disturbances of the autonomous racecar, which are caused by limit driving or chassis adjustments, are considered in the controller design. Finally, the proposed controller is demonstrated on the self-developed autonomous racecar. The experimental results on a random wet racetrack are discussed to show the efficiency and robustness of the proposed controller.

AB How to enhance and ensure the vehicle yaw/lateral stability and safety performance is a crucial and worthy research problem for the autonomous four in-wheel-motor independent-drive vehicle. In this paper, a hierarchical path tracking control strategy coordinated with the direct yaw moment control for autonomous four in-wheel-motor independent-drive vehicle is proposed with consideration of the lateral stability. In the upper controller, a novel model predictive control method based on the vehicle 7-degree-of-freedom dynamic model is presented to obtain the front wheel steering angle and two virtual generalized forces, the traction and yaw moment. A dynamic adjustment method of target weight based on variance adjustment factor is proposed to realize multi-objective cooperative control of maneuverability, path tracking accuracy, and yaw stability. Moreover, the tire stability margin and its standard deviation are put forward in the objective function of the lower optimal generalized force distributor, making full use of the road adhesion of each wheel. Carsim-Simulink joint simulation results illustrate that the proposed coordinated control strategy could prosper the multi-objective coordinated control. In addition, the path tracking coordinated control strategy could further improve the lateral stability and safety of the vehicle compared with the mere path tracking control strategy, when autonomous four in-wheel-motor independent-drive vehicle is placed under extremely dangerous road conditions.

AB When autonomous underwater vehicle following the wall, a common problem is interference between sonars equipped in the autonomous underwater vehicle. A novel work mode with weighted polling (which can be also called "weighted round robin mode") which can independently identify the environment, dynamically establish the environmental model, and switch the operating frequency of the sonar is proposed in this article. The dynamic weighted polling mode solves the problem of sonar interference. By dynamically switching the operating frequency of the sonar, the efficiency of following the wall is improved. Through the interpolation algorithm based on velocity interpolation, the data of different frequency ranging sonar are time registered to solve the asynchronous problem of multi-sonar and the system outputs according to the frequency of high-frequency sonar. With the reinforcement learning algorithm, autonomous underwater vehicle can follow the wall at a certain distance according to the distance obtained from the polling mode. At last, the tank test verified the effectiveness of the algorithm.

AB This article presents a comparison of different path-planning algorithms for autonomous underwater vehicles using terrain-aided navigation. Four different path-planning methods are discussed: the genetic algorithm, the A* algorithm, the rapidly exploring random tree* algorithm, and the ant colony algorithm. The goal of this article is to compare the four methods to determine how to obtain better positioning accuracy when using terrain-aided navigation as a means of navigation. Each algorithm combines terrain complexity to comprehensively consider the motion characteristics of the autonomous underwater vehicles, giving reachable path between the start and end points. Terrain-aided navigation overcomes the challenges of underwater domain, such as visual distortion and radio frequency signal attenuation, which make landmark-based localization infeasible. The path-planning algorithms improve the terrain-aided navigation positioning accuracy by considering terrain complexity. To evaluate the four algorithms, we designed simulation experiments that use real-word seabed bathymetry data. The results of autonomous underwater vehicle navigation by terrain-aided navigation in these four cases are obtained and analyzed.

AB The advent of autonomous vehicles (AVs) and shared autonomous vehicles (SAVs) is expected to improve network performance and increase accessibility. However, the improved accessibility will most likely induce more vehicle miles traveled, which necessitates the use of travel demand management tools like road pricing (RP). This research deploys dynamic traffic assignment for Budapest network using "Visum" to investigate the impact of three RP schemes (static and dynamic) on network performance and social welfare in three proposed future traffic scenarios for the years 2030 and 2050. The 2030 scenario combines conventional cars (CC), AVs, and SAVs, where CC is the dominant private transport mode (Mix-Traffic Scenario), while the two scenarios for 2050 include AVs and SAVs only and are characterized by high adoption of AVs (AV-Focused Scenario) or wide usage of SAVs (SAV-Focused Scenario). The results revealed that the impact of RP schemes differs according to the different penetration rates of AVs and SAVs. Nevertheless, considering the social benefits gained, implementing a dynamic pricing strategy (Link-based Scheme) in the case of AV-Focused and SAV-Focused scenarios shows better outcomes compared to other pricing schemes. Conversely, the static pricing strategies (i.e., Bridge Toll and Distance-based Schemes) outperform dynamic strategies in the Mix-Traffic scenario.

AB In this paper, an online platform for a system of shared autonomous vehicles (AVs) is designed and tested. A model of fractional ownership among different households is presented, and a one-sided many-to-many matching problem between households and vehicles is solved. Preferences over vehicles, demographics of other co-owners, and weekly activity patterns of households are key factors taken into account in the matching process. In the designed platform, co-owners of each vehicle can reserve the vehicle in advance and can trade the reserved time with the other co-owners if the vehicle is no longer needed. Real-time submission of requests can also be accommodated through a trading mechanism among co-owners. The proposed architecture of the platform consists of three main components: (i) a web-based user interface, (ii) database, and (iii) backend computation. The platform was tested using data collected from 15 households, who entered their trips and trading requests into the system.

AB This paper presents an adaptive coordination control strategy for path-following of distributed drive autonomous electric vehicles (DDAEV). A model predictive control (MPC) algorithm is used to realize path-following through autonomous steering, where the prediction time is adaptive in relation to different driving conditions. Due to the dynamic characteristic of distributed drive vehicle, the differential torque control is also utilized based on the deviation of path to realize path-following. In order to make full use of the advantages of these two path-following methods, coordination control of autonomous steering and differential steering is adopted to improve the transient response speed, flexibility of steering system and path-following performance by setting moving weight coefficients based on neural network. Results of CarSim-Simulink co-simulation and real vehicle experiment both verify that the proposed coordination control can obtain steering flexibility, as well as tracking accuracy and reliability under various driving conditions.

AB The autonomous vehicle parking problem has drawn increased attention in recent times. It can resolve the parking-related issues that involve minimizing human driving errors and saving fuel and time. In practice, parallel parking needs extra care when dynamicity is present in the environment. Many human drivers have the expertise to take quick action when obstacles appear on their driving path. An autonomous system should possess such intelligence that can mimic human-like behavior in the presence of obstacles. This work focuses on providing an intelligent autonomous parking design using a car-like mobile robot (CLMR) that efficiently parks the vehicle in dynamic environmental conditions. A novel fuzzy-based obstacle avoidance controller is proposed that integrates sensor information into the parking problem, obtained from the surrounding of a CLMR. Ultrasonic sensors' arrangement and their grouping provide inputs for the fuzzy system. A fuzzy-based obstacle avoidance controller can execute intelligent parking like a human by avoiding static as well as moving obstacles. The proposed work is tested in different challenging environmental conditions. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm accomplishes autonomous parallel parking reasonably well in the presence of static and moving obstacles and can be used to park the vehicle in real-time. The proposed work helps to solve the autonomous parking problem with safety, especially in dynamic environmental conditions.

AB This study derives design elements for urban regeneration in the autonomous vehicle era through literature review and interdisciplinary discussions and prioritizes the design elements via expert survey and hierarchical composite analysis. The derived design elements were organized into five regeneration categories ?environment and landscape (EL), transportation and technology (TT), resource and energy (RE), society and culture (SC), and economy and industry (EI)? each with six design elements and their priorities were analyzed in relation to ten urban spatial types classified under four criteria. The most prioritized element among the 13 composite weighted design elements was inclusive design (TT1), followed by smart infrastructure (TT3), pedestrian friendly street (EL4), public open space (EL3), and renewable energy (RE3) with regards to spatial types of parking only (H), transportation infrastructure (J), and lower floors (B). This study contributes to the growing body of research on renewal of vehicle-occupied space in the autonomous future, thus assisting in the practical implementation of sustainable urban regeneration.

AB Mobility of autonomous vehicles is a challenging task to implement. Under the given traffic circumstances, all agent vehicles' behavior is to be understood and their paths for a short future needs to be predicted to decide upon the maneuver of the ego vehicle. We explore variational autoencoder networks to get multimodal predictions of agents. In our work, we condition the network on past trajectories of agents and traffic scenes as well. The latent space representation of traffic scenes is achieved by using another variational autoencoder network. The proposed networks are trained for varied prediction horizon. The performance of a network is compared with other networks trained on the dataset.

AB In the present article, it is presented the modeling and identification of an autonomous vehicle that has been designed for agricultural tasks. With the purpose of defining the best model structure, different models have been presented. Particularly, it is assumed that the lateral and longitudinal dynamics are decoupled dynamics, and based on this assumption these are modeled and identified in an isolated way. Particular emphasis was made in lateral and rotational dynamics. The vehicle under study is a quadricycle (ATV) that has been modified and adapted to work in an autonomous way. It has been presented simulation proofs and experimentation with the real vehicle that allows guaranteeing the performance of the developed models.

AB This study explores vehicle fleet emissions changes due to connected and autonomous vehicle (CAV) diffusion, over the years 2030 and 2040 in Metro Vancouver, using the US Environmental Protection Agency's MOtor Vehicle Emission Simulator (MOVES). Impacts were assessed across scenarios with varying future vehicle kilometers traveled (VKT), transit use, fuel-type, and diffusion rate. In all models, greenhouse gas emissions (GHGs) were reduced due to increasing electric vehicles, though reductions varied. At best, CAVs decreased GHGs by 20% compared to no-CAV conditions in 2040. At worst, we model a 6% decrease in GHGs if autonomy provokes increased use of personal vehicles (Motor City scenario), even with 85% electric vehicles. An overall reduction in emissions is seen for other pollutants, with the exception of PM, ranging from emissions reductions of up to 20% (PM exhaust) to an increase in emissions by 30% (PM2.5 brakewear) in 2040. Increased VKT per CAV had the most significant impact.

AB A key feature of an autonomous vehicle is the ability to re-plan its motion from a starting configuration (position and orientation) to a goal configuration while avoiding obstacles. Moreover, it Should react robustly to uncertainties throughout its maneuvers. We present a predictive approach for autonomous navigation that incorporates the shortest path, obstacle avoidance, and uncertainties in sensors and actuators. A car-like robot is considered as the autonomous vehicle with nonholonomic and minimum turning radius constraints. The results (arcs and line segments) from I shortest-path planner are used as a reference to find action sequence candidates. The vehicle's states and their corresponding probability distributions are predicted to determine a future reward Value for each action sequence candidate. Finally. an optimal action policy is calculated by maximizing an objective function. Through simulations, the proposed method demonstrates the capability of avoiding obstacles as well as of approaching a goal. The regenerated path will incorporate uncertainty information.

AB Diversified traffic participants and complex traffic environment (e.g., roadblocks or road damage exist) challenge the decision-making accuracy of a single connected and autonomous vehicle (CAV) due to its limited sensing and computing capabilities. Using Internet of Vehicles (IoV) to share driving rules between CAVs can break limitations of a single CAV, but at the same time may cause privacy and safety issues. To tackle this problem, this paper proposes to combine IoV and blockchain technologies to form an efficient and accurate autonomous guidance strategy. Specifically, we first use reinforcement learning for driving decision learning, and give the corresponding driving rule extraction method. Then, an architecture combining IoV and blockchain is designed to ensure secure driving rule sharing. Finally, the shared rules will form an effective autonomous driving guidance strategy through driving rules selection and action selection. Extensive simulation proves that the proposed strategy performs well in complex traffic environment, mainly in terms of accuracy, safety, and robustness.

AB Due to global purposes to ensure growth of a competitive and sustainable transport system, also to solve traffic safety and environmental problems, various engineering solutions are being sought out. It can be assumed that autonomous vehicles are the technology, which will ensure the positive change in the transport system. Even though many studies successfully advanced toward realisation of autonomous vehicles, a significant amount of technical and policy, framework problems still has to be solved. This paper addresses the problem of predefined path feasibility and proposes an effective methodology fora path to follow re-planning. The proposed methodology is composed of three parts and is based on the Dubins path approach. In order to modify the vector based Dublin path approach and to ensure the path feasibility, the optimisation problem was solved. A cost function with different inequality constraints was formulated. The performance and reliability of the proposed methodology were analysed and evaluated by carrying out an experimental research while using the autonomous test vehicle.

ID MOBILITY
AB Multibody models built in commercial software packages, e.g., ADAMS, can be used for accurate vehicle dynamics, but computational efficiency and numerical stability are very challenging in complex driving environments. These issues can be addressed by using data-driven models, owing to their robust generalization and computational speed. In this study, we develop a deep neural network (DNN) based model to predict longitudinal-lateral dynamics of an autonomous vehicle. Dynamic simulations of the autonomous vehicle are performed based on a semirecursive multibody method for data acquisition. The data are used to train and test the DNN model. The DNN inputs include the torque applied on wheels and the vehicle's initial speed that imitates a double lane change maneuver. The DNN outputs include the longitudinal driving distance, the lateral driving distance, the final longitudinal velocities, the final lateral velocities, and the yaw angle. The predicted vehicle states based on the DNN model are compared with the multibody model results. The accuracy of the DNN model is investigated in detail in terms of error functions. The DNN model is verified within the framework of a commercial software package CarSim. The results demonstrate that the DNN model predicts accurate vehicle states in real time. It can be used for real-time simulation and preview control in autonomous vehicles for enhanced transportation safety.

AB In practice, many autonomous vehicle developers put a tremendous amount of time and efforts in tuning and calibrating the path tracking controllers in order to achieve robust tracking performance and smooth steering actions over a wide range of vehicle speed and road curvature changes. This design process becomes tiresome when the target vehicle changes frequently. In this study, a model-based Linear Quadratic Gaussian (LQG) Control with adaptive Q-matrix is proposed to efficiently and systematically design the path tracking controller for any given target vehicle while effectively handling the noise and error problems arise from the localization and path planning algorithms. The regulator, in turn, is automatically designed, without additional efforts for tuning at various speeds. The performance of the proposed algorithm is validated based on KAIST autonomous vehicle. The experimental results show that the proposed LQG with adaptive Q-matrix has tracking performance in both low (15kph) and high (45kph) speed driving conditions better than those of other conventional tracking methods like the Stanley and Pure-pursuit methods.

AB A novel two-loop structured robust generalized dynamic inversion-based control system is proposed for autonomous underwater vehicles. The outer (position) loop of the generalized dynamic inversion control system utilizes proportional-derivative control of the autonomous underwater vehicle's inertial position errors from the desired inertial position trajectories, and it provides the reference yaw and pitch attitude angle commands to the inner loop. The inner (attitude) loop utilizes generalized dynamic inversion control of a prescribed asymptotically stable dynamics of the attitude angle errors from their reference values, and it provides the required control surface deflections such that the desired inertial position trajectories of the vehicle are tracked. The dynamic inversion singularity is avoided by augmenting a dynamic scaling factor within the Moore-Penrose generalized inverse in the particular part of the generalized dynamic inversion control law. The involved null control vector in the auxiliary part of the generalized dynamic inversion control law is constructed to be linear in the pitch and yaw angular velocities, and the proportionality gain matrix is designed to guarantee global closed-loop asymptotic stability of the vehicle's angular velocity dynamics. An additional sliding mode control element is included in the particular part of the generalized dynamic inversion control system, and it works to robustify the closed-loop system against tracking performance deterioration due to generalized inversion scaling, such that semi-global practically stable attitude tracking is guaranteed. A detailed six degrees-of-freedom mathematical model of the Monterey Bay Aquarium Research Institute autonomous underwater vehicle is used to evaluate the control system design, and numerical simulations are conducted to demonstrate closed-loop system performance under various types of autonomous underwater vehicle maneuvers, under both nominal and perturbed autonomous underwater vehicle system's mathematical model parameters.

AB Accurately processing dynamic evolution events is extremely challenging for autonomous vehicle groups in an urban scene, which can be disturbed by manned vehicles, roadside obstacles, traffic lights, and pedestrians. Existing work focuses on a dynamic evolution method for such groups in a highway scene only. Its outcomes cannot be directly used to an urban scene due to different environmental factors, incomplete dynamic evolution events, and lack of simulation evaluation with real road networks. In this work, we present a dynamic evolution method for such groups in an urban scene. First, we analyze their dynamic evolution reasons. Then, we abstract five dynamic evolution events, i.e., joining, leaving, merging, splitting, and disappearing, and introduce a dynamic evolution method to process them. Finally, we deduce the evolvability that can reflect dynamic evolution states of a vehicle group. The simulation results in synthetic and real urban scenes show that the connectivity, coupling, timeliness, and evolvability of vehicle groups using the proposed dynamic evolution method are higher than those of using a dynamic evolution method for a highway scene.

AB The recent advancement in industrial technology has offered new opportunities to overcome different problems of stochastic driving behavior of humans through effective implementation of autonomous vehicles (AVs). Optimum utilization of driving behavior and advanced capabilities of the AVs has enabled researchers to propose autonomous cooperative-based methods for signalized intersection control under an AV traffic environment. In the future, AVs will share road networks with regular vehicles (RVs), representing a dynamic mixed traffic environment of two groups of vehicles with different characteristics. Without compromising the safety and level of service, traffic operation and control of such a complex environment is a challenging task. The current study includes a comprehensive review focused on the signalized intersection control methods under a mixed traffic environment. The different proposed methods in the literature are based on certain assumptions, requirements, and constraints mainly associated with traffic composition, connectivity, road infrastructures, intersection, and functional network design. Therefore, these methods should be evaluated with appropriate consideration of the underlying assumptions and limitations. This study concludes that the application of adaptive traffic signal control can effectively optimize traffic signal plans for variations of AV traffic environments. However, artificial intelligence approaches primarily focusing on reinforcement learning should be considered to better utilization of the improved AV characteristics.

AB A microgrid can operate in two different operating modes, i.e. utility-grid connected mode or autonomous mode. In this paper, the operation of a microgrid with fully inverter-based renewable sources in transition from utility-grid connected mode to the autonomous mode is investigated. Energy storage device as a kind of buffering system might compromise microgrid autonomous operation due to the limited capacity; hence, available electric vehicles and responsive loads in the microgrid are used in primary frequency control upon separation from the utility grid. Secondary frequency control is performed by slow-response sources. In order to establish a readiness for upcoming disturbances, the state of charge of the energy storage device is held in a secure range by proper coordination and management of the electrical vehicles, responsive loads, energy storage devices and controllable microsources. The proposed control strategy is standalone and does not need any communication link in controlling the sources and loads. Copyright (c) 2014 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB A common cause of traffic congestions is the concentration of intersecting vehicle routes. It can be difficult to reduce the intersecting routes in existing traffic systems where the routes are decided independently from vehicle to vehicle. The development of connected autonomous vehicles provides the opportunity to address the intersecting route problem as the route of vehicles can be coordinated globally. We prototype a traffic management system for optimizing traffic with connected autonomous vehicles. The system allocates routes to the vehicles based on streaming traffic data. We develop two route assignment algorithms for the system. The algorithms can help to mitigate traffic congestions by reducing intersecting routes. Extensive experiments are conducted to compare the proposed algorithms and two state-of-the-art route assignment algorithms with both synthetic and real road networks in a simulated traffic management system. The experimental results show that the proposed algorithms outperform the competitors in terms of the travel time of the vehicles.

AB The advent of autonomous vehicles has opened new horizons for transportation efficiency and safety. Platooning, a strategy where vehicles travel closely together in a synchronized manner, holds promise for reducing traffic congestion, lowering fuel consumption, and enhancing overall road safety. This article explores the application of Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) combined with Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) to optimize autonomous vehicle platooning. We delve into the world of MARL, which empowers vehicles to communicate and collaborate, enabling real-time decision making in complex traffic scenarios. PPO, a cutting-edge reinforcement learning algorithm, ensures stable and efficient training for platooning agents. The synergy between MARL and PPO enables the development of intelligent platooning strategies that adapt dynamically to changing traffic conditions, minimize inter-vehicle gaps, and maximize road capacity. In addition to these insights, this article introduces a cooperative approach to Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL), leveraging Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) to further optimize autonomous vehicle platooning. This cooperative framework enhances the adaptability and efficiency of platooning strategies, marking a significant advancement in the pursuit of intelligent and responsive autonomous vehicle systems.

DE Connected autonomous vehicles; communication; motion planning;

AB This paper proposes a novel communication-enabled distributed conflict resolution mechanism in order for a group of connected autonomous vehicles to navigate safely and efficiently in intersections without any traffic manager. The conflict resolution strategy for individual vehicle is decoupled temporally. In a decision maker, the vehicle computes the desired time slots to pass the conflict zones by solving a conflict graph locally based on the broadcasted information from other vehicles. In a motion planner, the vehicle computes the desired speed profile by solving a temporal optimization problem constrained in the desired time slot. The estimated time to occupy the conflict zones given the new speed profile is then broadcasted again. It is proved that the aggregation of these local decisions solves the conflicts globally. Theoretically, this method provides an efficient parallel mechanism to obtain local optimal solutions of a large-scale optimization problem (e.g., multivehicle navigation). Application-wise, as demonstrated by extensive simulation, this mechanism increases the efficiency of autonomous vehicles in terms of smaller delay time, as well as the efficiency of the traffic in terms of larger throughput when there is no traffic manager to mediate the conflicts.

AB This paper presents a novel and exploratory investigation of how users might control future autonomous vehicles with user-defined in-air static hand gestures. In the era of autonomous vehicles, how to support "driving" without steering control may become a key issue affecting user experience. As the navigation interface of future autonomous cars will be wholly dependent on GPS, and passengers will be unable to make manual control adjustments, verbal or gestural communication will become a primary means to assist them in vehicle control. We thus focus on gesture as an innovative solution for this "final 100 meters" problem in automated navigation. A study (N = 24) conducted in a full chassis simulator shows that hand gesture control is feasible for autonomous vehicle navigation. It further reveals that hand gestures are influenced by task types, local regional norms, and participant culture. In particular, the spatial region where gestures occur can affect execution time, gender can impact user preference and demand, and culture differences and priorities can affect adoption, ease of learning, and user comfort, influencing longer-term use.

AB Rapid advances in the development of autonomous and alternative-fuel vehicles (AFVs) are likely to transform the future of mobility and could bring benefits such as improved road safety and lower emissions. Achieving these potential benefits requires widespread consumer support for these disruptive technologies. To date, research to explore consumer perceptions of transport innovations has tended to consider them in isolation (e.g., driverless cars, electric vehicles). The current paper examines the predictors of consumer interest in and willing to pay for both AFVs and autonomous vehicles through a choice experiment conducted in six diverse markets: Germany, India, Japan, Sweden, UK and US. Using Latent Class Discrete Choice Models, we observe significant heterogeneity both within and across the country samples. For example, while Japanese consumers are generally willing to pay for autonomous vehicles, in most European countries, consumers need to be compensated for automation. Within countries, though, we found some segments - typically, those with a university degree, and self-identifying as having a pro-environmental identity and as being innovators- are more in favour of automation. Significantly, we also found that support for autonomous vehicles is associated with support for AFVs, perhaps, due to common demographic or socio-psychological predictors of both types of innovative technology. These findings are valuable for policymakers and the automotive industry in identifying potential early adopters, as well as consumer segments or cultures less convinced to adopt these innovative transport technologies.

AB Spot hover and high speed capabilities of underwater vehicles are essential for ocean exploring, however, few vehicles have these two features. Moreover, the motion of underwater vehicles is prone to be affected by the unknown hydrodynamics. This paper presents a novel negative-buoyancy autonomous underwater vehicle equipped with tri-tilt-rotor to obtain these two features. A detailed mathematical model is derived, which is then decoupled to altitude and attitude subsystems. For controlling the underwater vehicle, an attitude error model is designed for the attitude subsystem, and an adaptive nonlinear controller is proposed for the attitude error model based on immersion and invariance methodology. To demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed controller, a three degrees of freedom (DOF) testbed is developed, and the performance of the controller is validated through a real-time experiment.

AB The introduction of autonomous cars will help to improve road traffic safety, and the use of a cargo trailer improves the energy efficiency of transport. One of the critical (collision) road situations has been considered, where immediate counteraction is required in a space that has been only partly defined. This research work was aimed at determining the impact of the trajectory planning method and the values of some parameters of the control system on the feasibility of safe avoidance of an obstacle that has suddenly appeared. The obstacle is assumed to be a motor vehicle moving on a road intersection along a collision path in relation to the autonomous car-trailer unit (CT unit) travelling at high speed. Analysis of cooperation between several non-linear models (representing the car, trailer, tyre-road interaction, and driving controller) has been carried out. Mathematical models of the control system and the CT unit have been built. The process of selection of temporary and variable parameters, applied to the control system for the time of the critical situation under consideration, has been shown. The research work carried out has made it possible to recommend appropriate parameter values for the control system.

DE autonomous vehicle; path tracking; improved active disturbance rejection

AB The antidisturbance control problem of autonomous vehicle path tracking considering lateral stability is studied in this paper. This paper proposes an improved active disturbance rejection control (IADRC) control method including an improved extended state observer (IESO) and an error compensator based on LQR, where a new continuous nonlinear function is proposed in the IESO instead of the classical piecewise function. Based on the IADRC, an autonomous vehicle path-tracking controller considering lateral stability is designed. Using the output wheel steering angle and external yaw moment, the IESO estimates the disturbance value and compensates for the disturbance in the feedback to meet the goal of antidisturbance control. Based on the concept of control allocation (CA), the control distributor is designed to distribute the external yaw moment to the four wheels in a reasonable and optimal way to achieve differential braking. Finally, the control scheme is evaluated in the form of CarSim/Simulink cosimulation; the results show that the proposed autonomous vehicle path-tracking control scheme has better path-tracking effect and higher antidisturbance robustness.

AB Numerous recent innovations have been achieved with the goal of enhancing electric vehicles and the parts that go into them, particularly in the areas of managing energy, battery design and optimization, and autonomous driving. This promotes a more effective and sustainable eco-system and helps to build the next generation of electric car technology. This study offers insights into the most recent research and advancements in electric vehicles (EVs), as well as new, innovative, and promising technologies based on scientific data and facts associated with e-mobility from a technological standpoint, which may be achievable by 2030. Appropriate modeling and design strategies, including digital twins with connected Internet of Things (IoT), are discussed in this study. Vehicles with autonomous features have the potential to increase safety on roads, increase driving economy, and provide drivers more time to focus on other duties thanks to the Internet of Things idea. The enabling technology that entails a car moving out of a parking spot, traveling along a long highway, and then parking at the destination is also covered in this article. The development of autonomous vehicles depends on the data obtained for deployment in actual road conditions. There are also research gaps and proposals for autonomous, intelligent vehicles. One of the many social concerns that are described is the cause of an accident with an autonomous car. A smart device that can spot strange driving behavior and prevent accidents is briefly discussed. In addition, all EV-related fields are covered, including the likely technical challenges and knowledge gaps in each one, from in-depth battery material sciences through power electronics and powertrain engineering to market assessments and environmental assessments.

AB Controlling, influencing and managing the fuel/energy consumption and refill frequency of hybrid vehicles will be essential in the coming decades of increasing vehicle autonomy and not have depleted or low battery vehicles, along the roadways. The presented research aims to establish a fuel consumption model with the vehicles' fuel consumption influencing factors, to simulate and evaluate the consumption and refill rate. The aim is to collect the effect of fuel consumption in a comprehensive literature overview. We defined the most relevant work for modelling and simulation. Results were validated in proving ground tests at a high-speed handling track. Several tests were done to validate different parameters' effects on fuel consumption and refine the models. As a result, we built a model that enables the correct prediction of reality in a model environment. It is valuable while autonomous vehicle testing is increasingly becoming simulations. Based on our results, autonomous vehicles can be developed with real environmental effects and fuel consumption behavior.

It is a slow vehicle designed to tackle urban environment with complete autonomy. A slow vehicle may have slightly different strategies for avoiding obstacles. Unlike on a highway, it has to deal with pedestrians, traffic lights and slower vehicles while maintaining smoothness in its drive. To tackle obstacle avoidance for this vehicle, sensor feedback based strategies have been formulated for smooth drive and obstacle avoidance. A full mathematical model for the vehicle is formulated and simulated in MATLAB environment. The mathematical model uses velocity control for obstacle avoidance without steering control. The obstacle avoidance is attained through velocity control and strategies are formulated with velocity profiling. Innovative techniques are formulated in creating the simulated sensory feed-backs of the environment. Using these feed-backs, correct velocity profiling is autonomously created for giving velocity profile input to the velocity controller. Proximity measurements are assumed to be available for the vehicle in its given range of drive. Novelty is attained by manipulating velocity profile without prior knowledge of the environment. Four different type of obstacles are modeled for simulated environment of the vehicle. These obstacles are randomly placed in the path of the vehicle and autonomous velocity profiling is verified in simulated environment. The simulated results obtained show satisfactory velocity profiling for controller input. The current technique helps to tune the existing controller and in designing of a better velocity controller for the autonomous vehicle and bridges the gap between sensor feed-back and controller input. Moreover, accurate input profiling creates less strain on the system and brings smoothness in drive for an overall safer environment.

ID AVOIDANCE
AB The autonomous emergency brake (AEB) is an active safety function for vehicles which aims to reduce the severity of a collision. An AEB performs a full brake when an accident becomes unavoidable. Even if this system cannot, in general, avoid the accident, it reduces the energy of the crash impact and is therefore referred to as a collision mitigation system. A new approach for the calculation of the trigger time of an emergency brake will be presented. The algorithm simultaneously considers all physically possible trajectories of the object and host vehicle. It can be applied to all different scenarios including rear-end collisions, collisions at intersections, and collisions with oncoming vehicles. Thus, 63% of possible accidents are addressed. The approach accounts for the object and host vehicles' dimensions. Unlike previous work, the orientation of the vehicles is incorporated into the collision estimation.

AB The objective of this paper is to find feasible path planning algorithms for nonholonomic vehicles including flatness, polynomial, and symmetric polynomial trajectories subject to the real vehicle dynamical constraints. Performances of these path planning methods are simulated and compared to evaluate the more realistic and smoother generated trajectories. Results show that the symmetric polynomial algorithm provides the smoothest trajectory. Therefore, this algorithm is recommended for the development of an automatic control for autonomous vehicles.

AB In this paper, we investigate the problem of reducing the use of radio resources for vehicle-to-vehicle communications in an autonomous platooning scenario. Achieving reliable communications, which is a key element allowing for the tight coordination of platoon vehicles' motion, might be challenging in a case of heavy road traffic. Thus, in this paper, we propose to reduce the number of intra-platoon transmissions required to facilitate the safe autonomous control of vehicle mobility, by analyzing the impact of cars' behaviors (in terms of acceleration changes) on the evolution of the inter-vehicle distance errors within the platoon. We derive formulas representing the relation between the platoon leader's acceleration changes and the evolution of the distance error, velocity difference, and the accelerations for the first pair of vehicles. Furthermore, we propose a heuristic algorithm for selection of the intra-platoon messaging period for each platoon vehicle that minimizes the use of radio resources subject to the safety constraint, represented as the fraction of the total time when emergency braking is activated. The presented simulation results indicate that the proposed approach is capable of ensuring safe platoon operation and simultaneously providing a significant reduction in the use of resources, compared with conventional fixed-period transmission.

AB Autonomous vehicles typically transmit information over wireless communication network, which is vulnerable to malicious cyber attacks and poses huge security threats for autonomous vehicles. To address these challenges, this paper is concerned with resilient H. path-following control problem for autonomous vehicles under false data injection (FDI) attacks and denial-of-service (DoS) attacks, simultaneously. Firstly, a novel observer is constructed to estimate both sensor FDI attack signal and system state. An attack parameter dependent time-varying piecewise Lyapunov function is constructed to ensure stability of the underlying system. Then, a resilient H. path-following control scheme is developed to suppress the impact of FDI attacks and external interference despite the presence of intermittent DoS attacks. The design criterion of resilient controller is derived to assure the exponential stability of the closed-loop system and maintain the desired H. performance. Finally, simulation studies are carried out to verify the efficiency and merits of the developed results.

AB This paper presents an autonomous formation flight algorithm for micro aerial vehicles (MAVs) and its experiment results. We choose the leader follower scheme for formation flight as it is more appropriate for tracking arbitrary maneuvering of the leader in a formation. The sensing of other vehicles in the formation is achieved by sharing the vehicles' states using a high-speed peer-to-peer radio data link. The designed guidance law is combined with a PD controller for tracking heading, velocity and altitude commands. A series of test flights were performed to validate the proposed formation guidance law. The test result confirms that the proposed formation flight algorithm is feasible to yield satisfactory results.

AB Traffic incident management is combining the assets of authorities to identify, deal with, and manage traffic problems as rapidly as possible while providing the safety of on-scene responders and the traveling public. The advancement of autonomous vehicles is an opportunity for enhancing incident management implementations. This study aims to provide policymakers with four main alternatives to control freeway incidents using autonomous vehicles in mixed traffic. The presented alternatives are namely autonomous vehicles behaving as human-driven vehicles, ones connected, ones using an algorithm for incident management, and ones used in the traditional incident management methodology. The study also aims to introduce an integrated decision-making tool that is comprehendible for policymakers and mobility experts. It is based on the integration of an Entropy-based approach and the complex proportional assessment (COPRAS) method under the type-2 neutrosophic number (T2NN) environment. T2NN can represent uncertainties such as uncertainty, inconsistency, and inconsistency in real-world problems. T2NN-Entropy is presented to reveal the objective importance of evaluation criteria for freeway incident management. T2NN-COPRAS is proposed to order alternatives when deciding on the behavior of autonomous vehicles. The comparative investigation shows the superiority of the T2NN-Entropy-COPRAS model. Its major advantages are high robustness in making real -world multi-criteria decisions due to the triple-normalization backbone, and high flexibility in solving complex decision-making problems. The research findings show that using an algorithm for incident management is the best alternative to solve problems during and after an incident in mixed traffic, while autonomous vehicles that act like human-driven vehicles are the least advantageous.

DE curb detection; intelligent vehicles; autonomous driving
ID ROAD
AB The localization system of low-cost autonomous vehicles such as autonomous sweeper requires a highly lateral localization accuracy as the vehicle needs to keep a near lateral-distance between the side brush system and the road curb. Existing methods usually rely on a global navigation satellite system that often loses signal in a cluttered environment such as sweeping streets between high buildings and trees. In a GPS-denied environment, map-based methods are often used such as visual and LiDAR odometry systems. Apart from heavy computation costs from feature extractions, they are too expensive to meet the low-price market of the low-cost autonomous vehicles. To address these issues, we propose a mono-vision based lateral localization system of an autonomous sweeper. Our system relies on a fish-eye camera and precisely detects road curbs with a deep curb detection network. Curbs locations are then referred to as straightforward marks to control the lateral motion of the vehicle. With our self-recorded dataset, our curb detection network achieves 93% pixel-level precision. In addition, experiments are performed with an intelligent sweeper to prove the accuracy and robustness of our proposed approach. Results demonstrate that the average lateral distance error and the maximum invalid rate are within 0.035 m and 9.2%, respectively.

ID FRAMEWORK
AB This article is devoted to the development of an optimal speed profile for autonomous vehicles in order to cross a signalized intersection without stopping. The design objective is to achieve both a short travel time and low energy consumption by taking full advantage of the traffic light information based on vehicle-to-infrastructure communication. The eco-driving problem is formulated as an optimal control problem. For the case where the vehicles are in free-flow mode, we derive a real-time on-line analytical solution, distinguishing our method from most existing approaches based on numerical calculations. Under mild assumptions, the optimal eco-driving algorithm is readily extended to cases where the free-flow mode does not apply due to the presence of interfering traffic. Extensive simulations are provided to compare the performance of autonomous vehicles under the proposed speed profile and human-driven vehicles. The results show quantitatively the advantages of the proposed algorithm in terms of energy consumption and travel time. Note to Practitioners-This article is motivated by the requirements for increased safety, increased efficiency in energy consumption, and lower congestion in signalized intersections. We take advantage of the traffic signal phase and timing information based on vehicle to infrastructure communication, and use the information to plan the vehicle's trajectory to avoid the red traffic signal. An optimal speed profile is developed to achieve a trade-off between minimizing trip time and avoiding unnecessary braking and acceleration which corresponds to minimizing energy consumption. We then show how such a speed profile can be efficiently computed and control the motion of an autonomous vehicle (or serve as an intelligent speed advisory system for human-driven vehicles) leading to a safe, time-efficient, and energy-efficient trip. A video of a real autonomous vehicle test implementing our control algorithm can be found at https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x-ao4szeLYo.

AB When traveling in an autonomous car, the travel time can be used for performing activities other than driving. This paper distinguishes users' work-related and home-related activities in autonomous cars and proposes an activity-based bottleneck model to investigate travelers' behavior in the morning commute, shedding light on how the scope to undertake in-vehicle activities affects travelers' trip-timing preferences and decisions, and therewith social welfare. These welfare effects can be expected to depend on the optimality of both the market for trips, and the market for vehicles. We therefore consider different supply regimes for vehicles, as well as unpriced congestion versus queue-eliminating road pricing. We reveal analytically the relationship between various in-vehicle activities and trip-timing decisions by users of autonomous and normal cars. Three supply regimes for autonomous cars are investigated: welfare-maximizing public supply, competitive marginal cost supply, and profit-maximizing private supply. Pricing rules under different supply regimes are compared analytically, and the relative efficiencies in terms of the welfare gains are compared numerically. The results show that travelers' in-vehicle activity choices have significant impacts on travel patterns, congestion externality, supply decisions, and the associated welfare effects.

TI Autonomous Transport: Transforming Logistics through Driverless
   Intelligent Transportation
SO TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH RECORD
LA English
DT Article
AB How can autonomous technology be used beyond end-customer autonomous driving features? This position paper addresses this problem by exploring a novel autonomous transport solution applied in the automotive logistics domain. We propose that factory-complete cars can be transformed to become their own autonomous guided vehicles and thus transport themselves when being moved from the factory for shipment. Cars equipped with such a system are driverless and use an onboard autonomous transport solution combined with the advanced driver assistance systems pre-installed in the car for end-customer use. The solution uses factory-equipped sensors as well as the connectivity infrastructure installed in the car. This means that the solution does not require any extra components to enable the car to transport itself autonomously to complete a transport mission in the logistics chain. The solution also includes an intelligent off-board traffic control system that defines the transport mission and manages the interaction between vehicles during systems operation. A prototype of the system has been developed which was tested successfully in live trials at the Volvo Car Group plant in Gothenburg Sweden in 2017. In the paper, autonomous transport is positioned in between autonomous guided vehicles and autonomous driving technology. A review of the literature on autonomous vehicle technology offers contextual background to this positioning. The paper also presents the solution and displays lessons learned from the live trials. Finally, other use areas are introduced for driverless autonomous transport beyond the automotive logistics domain that is the focus of this paper.

AB In the paper a hierarchical overtaking strategy, which is a driver assistance function or rather an autonomous function in electric/autonomous vehicles, is proposed. The solution uses speed and acceleration signals from the surrounding vehicles. These signals are processed with clustering methods in order to achieve probability density functions and predict their expected motion. The strategy includes several additional layers, such as decision making concerning the maneuver, the computation of the required trajectory, and the tracking control of the vehicle. Trajectory generation is formed as an optimization task, which is able to include the prediction model of the surrounding vehicles in the constraints. A robust Linear Parameter Varying (LPV) control design method is proposed to guarantee the tracking of the computed reference. The proposed strategy is able to guarantee the safe motion of the vehicles and handle the interactions with the other traffic participants.

AB Autonomous vehicles can obtain real-time road information using 3D sensors. With road information, vehicles avoid obstacles through real-time path planning to improve their safety and stability. However, most of the research on driverless vehicles have been carried out on urban even driveways, with little consideration of uneven terrain. For an autonomous full tracked vehicle (FTV), the uneven terrain has a great impact on the stability and safety. In this paper, we proposed a method to predict the pose of the FTV based on accurate road elevation information obtained by 3D sensors. If we could predict the pose of the FTV traveling on uneven terrain, we would not only control the active suspension system but also change the driving trajectory to improve the safety and stability. In the first, 3D laser scanners were used to get real-time cloud data points of the terrain for extracting the elevation information of the terrain. Inertial measurement units (IMUs) and GPS are essential to get accurate attitude angle and position information. Then, the dynamics model of the FTV was established to calculate the vehicle's pose. Finally, the Kalman filter was used to improve the accuracy of the predicted pose. Compared to the traditional method of driverless vehicles, the proposed approach was more suitable for autonomous FTV. The real-world experimental result demonstrated the accuracy and effectiveness of our approach.

ID SYSTEMS
AB Artificial intelligence research is ushering in a new era of sophisticated, mass-market transportation technology. While computers can already fly a passenger jet better than a trained human pilot, people are still faced with the dangerous yet tedious task of driving automobiles. Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS) is the field that focuses on integrating information technology with vehicles and transportation infrastructure to make transportation safer, cheaper, and more efficient. Recent advances in ITS point to a future in which vehicles themselves handle the vast majority of the driving task. Once autonomous vehicles become popular, autonomous interactions amongst multiple vehicles will be possible. Current methods of vehicle coordination, which are all designed to work with human drivers, will be outdated. The bottleneck for roadway efficiency will no longer be the drivers, but rather the mechanism by which those drivers' actions are coordinated. While open-road driving is a well-studied and more-or-less-solved problem, urban traffic scenarios, especially intersections, are much more challenging.
   We believe current methods for controlling traffic, specifically at intersections, will not be able to take advantage of the increased sensitivity and precision of autonomous vehicles as compared to human drivers. In this article, we suggest an alternative mechanism for coordinating the movement of autonomous vehicles through intersections. Drivers and intersections in this mechanism are treated as autonomous agents in a multiagent system. In this multiagent system, intersections use a new reservation-based approach built around a detailed communication protocol, which we also present. We demonstrate in simulation that our new mechanism has the potential to significantly outperform current intersection control technology-traffic lights and stop signs. Because our mechanism can emulate a traffic light or stop sign, it subsumes the most popular current methods of intersection control. This article also presents two extensions to the mechanism. The first extension allows the system to control human-driven vehicles in addition to autonomous vehicles. The second gives priority to emergency vehicles without significant cost to civilian vehicles. The mechanism, including both extensions, is implemented and tested in simulation, and we present experimental results that strongly attest to the efficacy of this approach.

AB Connected and autonomous vehicles (CAV) employ vehicle-to-vehicle communications to safely drive in a platoon with short inter-vehicle distances, which can improve traffic throughput and reduce fuel consumption. With the development of wireless communication technology, more and more information can be used for vehicle controllers. However, is more information better? In this paper, a fuel economy-based performance evaluation index is established for evaluating the efficiency of CAVs driving in a platoon with different communication topologies. Four typical communication topologies that describe the CAV with different amounts of information are studied by the linear controller. The differential evolution algorithm is used to solve the parameters. Due to the increase in information, more control parameters need to be computed, and it is hard to find an optimal solution. So, the simulation results show that CAV with more information did not obtain a better fuel economy.

AB Automation and electrification are changing vehicles and mobility. Whereas electrification is mainly changing the powertrain, automation enables the rethinking of the vehicle and its applications. The actual driving range is an important requirement for the design of automated and electric vehicles, especially if they are part of a fleet. To size the battery accordingly, not only the consumption of the powertrain has to be estimated, but also that of the auxiliary users. Heating Ventilation and Air Conditioning (HVAC) is one of the biggest auxiliary consumers. Thus, a variable HVAC model for vehicles with electric powertrain was developed to estimate the consumption depending on vehicle size and weather scenario. After integrating the model into a tool for autonomous and electric vehicle concept development, various vehicle concepts were simulated in different weather scenarios and driving cycles with the HVAC consumption considered for battery sizing. The results indicate that the battery must be resized significantly depending on the weather scenario to achieve the same driving ranges. Furthermore, the percentage of HVAC consumption is in some cases higher than that of the powertrain for urban driving cycles, due to lower average speeds. Thus, the HVAC and its energy demand should especially be considered in the development of autonomous and electric vehicles that are primarily used in cities.

AB Speed planning is one of the tasks that a self-driving vehicle carries out. A complete planner should consider and balance passengers comfort, trip time and energy consumption. This paper proposes a computationally efficient global speed planner for autonomous vehicles that explicitly includes comfort as one of the main objectives. In particular, our approach considers the trip time as a user-specified constraint and optimizes a cost function that accounts for both energy consumption and comfort. Since passenger comfort plays a critical role for self driving vehicle, we propose a comfort model that captures different aspects: planar and vertical accelerations and the contribution of different frequency components. We test the algorithm on a realistic case study and we quantify the trade-off between energy consumption and comfort.

AB In this paper, a model predictive control (MPC) approach for controlling an active front steering system in an autonomous vehicle is presented. At each time step, a trajectory is assumed to be known over a finite horizon, and an WC controller computes the front steering angle in order to follow the trajectory on slippery roads at the highest possible entry speed. We present two approaches with different computational complexities. In the first approach, we formulate the MPC problem by using a nonlinear vehicle model. The second approach is based on successive online linearization of the vehicle model. Discussions on computational complexity and performance of the two schemes are presented. The effectiveness of the pro posed MPC formulation is demonstrated by simulation and experimental tests up to 21 m/s on icy roads.

AB This study investigates individuals' preference towards autonomous vehicle (AV) as a privately-owned vehicle and as a vehicle in shared services. One of the key features of this study is to examine the effects of historical changes and experiences over the life course towards the adoption of AVs. A joint bivariate ordered probit model is developed using data from a retrospective survey conducted in the Okanagan region of British Columbia, Canada. The model captures unobserved error correlation between the response variables: preference towards AV ownership and using AV as a vehicle in shared services. The model confirms the existence of a significant error correlation between preferences for AV ownership and sharing. The model results suggest that AV adoption is significantly affected by individuals' historical experiences over the life course, such as exposure to technology, household characteristics, vehicle ownership, and accessibility and built-environment attributes of the residential location. For example, individuals with historical exposure to technologies including average smartphone ownership/person in the household over the life course and availability of advanced vehicle technology such as lane assist, parking assist, and autonomous emergency stop in the current and previously owned vehicles are more likely to adopt AVs. Individuals historically living in suburban areas have a higher likelihood of owning AVs whereas historically urban dwellers living in higher mixed land use neighbourhoods over the lifetime are more likely to prefer AV sharing. Ownership of technology devices such as smartphones and google home may lead to owning as well as sharing AVs. In addition, the model retains the effects of attitudinal factors, and sociodemographics. For instance, pro-environment individuals are likely to own and share AVs. Pro-shared-mobility individuals are more likely to share AVs whereas they are less interested in owning.

AB Much effort is put right now into how to make autonomous vehicles as capable as possible in order to be able to replace humans as drivers. Less focus is put into how to ensure that this transition happens in a safe way that we can put trust in. The verification of the extreme dependability requirements connected to safety is expected to be one of the largest challenges to overcome in the commercialization of autonomous vehicles. Using traditional statistical methods to validate complete vehicle safety would require the vehicle to cover extreme distances to show that collisions occur rare enough. However, recent research has shown the possibility of using near-collisions in order to estimate the frequency of actual collisions using Extreme Value Theory. To use this method, there is a need for a measure related to the closeness of a collision. This paper shows that the choice of this threat measure has a significant impact on the inferences drawn from the data. With the right measure, this method can be used to validate the safety of a vehicle. This, while keeping the validity high and the data required lower than the state of the art statistical methods.

AB In this paper, traffic and vehicle density optimization issues are discussed, and a suitable solution for autonomous driving environments is proposed. The problem of scalable traffic flow management is hindered by the unpredictable vehicle density and its navigation. This problem increases the flow congestion at the intersection during the change of lane in particular. This paper introduces density-scaling traffic management for autonomous vehicle driving scenarios. The proposed technique relies on navigation output and the autonomous vehicles' trajectory decisions for predicting their availability and time duration. The traffic flow is streamlines based on the predictions; the prediction error is mitigated by rescheduling the successive traffic flow. In this process, predictive iterated learning is employed for improving the scalable traffic flows in an intersection. The predictive learning handles navigation assistance output change of trajectory independently and correlates the decisions' match. The process of prediction matching is performed for improving the flow management with the time factor. The traffic management technique is useful in providing latency-less travel and errorless decision and flow complexity and collision probability.

TI A Platoon Control Strategy for Autonomous Vehicles Based on Sliding-Mode
   Control Theory

AB Platooning is one of the innovations in the automotive industry, which aims to improve the safety and efficiency of automobiles, while alleviating traffic congestion, reducing pollution, and reducing passenger pressure. According to the car-following (CF) theory, a platoon control strategy for autonomous vehicles based on sliding-mode control (SMC) theory is proposed. This strategy can be applied to achieve the rapid platoon forming of multiple autonomous vehicles and maintain the stable state of the vehicle platoon. The Multiple Velocity Difference (MVD) model is selected to describe the positional state of vehicle platoon changing over time. The control target is to converge the error between the actual headway (the distance between front tips of two neighboring cars) and the expected headway to zero while ensuring the stable velocity and acceleration of the platoon. In addition, a hypothetical first car strategy is proposed to improve the control efficiency. Numerical simulation experiments for urban roads and highways are designed, the space-time states of vehicle platoon under different MVD model parameters (non-control strategy) and sliding-mode control strategies are compared. The results show: proposed improved vehicle platoon sliding-mode control strategy can provide a shorter time of forming a platoon and better stability in the simulated environment, and its control effect is better than that of non-control strategy and conventional sliding-mode control strategy. Besides the proposed strategy allows vehicle platoon to quickly reach a stable and controllable state, and it provides an idea for collaborative control of autonomous vehicles.

DE Autonomous vehicle; Deep reinforcement learning algorithm; Markov

AB Stability is the most significant component of an autonomous driving system, affecting both the lives of drivers and pedestrians and traffic flow. Reinforcement learning (RL) is a representative technology used in autonomous driving, but it has challenges because it is based on trial and error. In this letter, we propose an efficient learning approach for stable autonomous driving. The proposed deep reinforcement learning based approach can address the partially observable scenario in mixed traffic which includes both autonomous vehicles and human-driven vehicles. Simulation results show that the proposed model outperforms the control-theoretic and vanilla RL approaches. Furthermore, we confirm the effect of the sync-penalty, which teaches the agent about unsafe decisions without experiencing the accidents. (C) 2022 The Author(s).

AB Predicting future trajectories is crucial for autonomous vehicles, as accurate predictions enhance safety and inform subsequent decision-making and planning modules. This is however a challenging task due to the complex interactions between surrounding vehicles. Existing methods struggled to extract deep representations and often overlook spatial dependence. To address this problem, this paper introduces GIVA, an interaction-aware trajectory prediction method based on the Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU)-Improved Visual Geometry Group (VGG)-Attention Mechanism model. GIVA first encodes the historical trajectories of the target vehicle and its surrounding vehicles using a GRU Encoder. Next, an Interaction Module, which combines the Improved VGG Pooling Module and the Attention Mechanism Pooling Module, effectively captures spatial interaction features between vehicles. The Improved VGG Pooling Module extracts more detailed and effective interaction information, while the Attention Mechanism Pooling Module emphasizes the importance of surrounding vehicles for the target vehicle's future trajectory. Lastly, the dynamic encoding feature of the target vehicle and the fused interaction feature are concatenated and input into a GRU Decoder to generate the future trajectory. Experiments on the public Next Generation Simulation (NGSIM) dataset showcase the effectiveness of GIVA compared to existing prediction approaches, demonstrating its potential for improving autonomous vehicle performance.

AB For autonomous driving vehicles, there are currently some issues, such as limited environmental awareness and locally optimal decision-making. To increase the capacity of autonomous cars' environmental awareness, computation, decision-making, control, and execution, intelligent roads must be constructed, and vehicle-infrastructure cooperative technology must be used. The Roadside unit (RSU) deployment, a critical component of vehicle-infrastructure cooperative autonomous driving, has a direct impact on network performance, operation effects, and control accuracy. The current RSU deployment mostly uses the large-spacing and low-density concept because of the expensive installation and maintenance costs, which can accomplish the macroscopic and long-term communication functions but fall short of precision vehicle control. Given these challenges, this paper begins with the specific requirements to control intelligent vehicles in the cooperative vehicle-infrastructure environment. An RSU deployment scheme, based on the improved multi-objective quantum-behaved particle swarm optimization (MOQPSO) algorithm, is proposed. This RSU deployment scheme was based on the maximum coverage with time threshold problem (MCTTP), with the goal of minimizing the number of RSUs and maximizing vehicle coverage of communication and control services. Finally, utilizing the independently created open simulation platform (OSP) simulation system, the model and algorithm's viability and effectiveness were assessed on the Nguyen-Dupuis road network. The findings demonstrate that the suggested RSU deployment scheme can enhance network performance and control the precision of vehicle-infrastructure coordination, and can serve as a general guide for the deployment of RSUs in the same application situation.

AB A mobility model is a basis of constructing the simulation environment for vehicular ad hoc network (VANET) research. Most existing models mainly focus on the geographical movement of individual mobile communication devices. However, few works focus on the cooperative movement of multiple autonomous vehicles. In this paper, we propose a cooperative mobility model for multiple autonomous vehicles, making vehicles run as a swarm in an orderly manner. Specifically, inspired by artificial fish swarm algorithms, we draw on the cooperative behaviors of the fish swarm to model the collaboration and self-organization in multi-vehicle formation. Then we design several force functions to express the interactions between vehicles and the influence of the driving environment based on the artificial potential field. Under Newtonian dynamics, the proposed mobility model determines the coordinated movement of multiple autonomous vehicles by force functions. Furthermore, we introduce a parallel orientation area in the interaction area division to improve vehicle stability. Following existing works, we assume that the road is straight and of infinite length. This is, the considered environment is suitable for intersection-free double-lane roads. To comprehensively verify the effectiveness of our proposed approach, we conduct extensive simulations under different traffic scenarios. Simulation results confirm that using our mobility model, multiple vehicles are able to keep driving in the center of the lane at the allowed speed limit, form an ordered collision-free motorcade, and collaboratively avoid collisions with obstacles. Particularly, our proposed mobility model has better stability.

AB The development of drifting control technology is crucial when it comes to the advancement of autonomous driving and active safety. This article presents the development of a multilayer autonomous drifting controller that aims to stabilize the drifting states (the sideslip angle, yaw rate, and velocity) of all-wheel drive (AWD) vehicles simultaneously. The steady-state drifting analysis, which is based on nonlinear four-wheel dynamics equilibria, reveals that both the saturation of the vehicle's four tires and the deep sideslip are the primary characteristics of drifting AWD vehicles. To achieve autonomous control of drifting AWD vehicles, we designed a multilayer drifting controller that consists of three progressive layers, i.e., vehicle states stabilization, dynamics model inversion, and chassis mapping. Upon testing the controller on a 1:5 scale AWD vehicle, we verified the effectiveness and robustness of our controller, with an average sideslip angle of up to 70 degrees.

AB Vehicle detection plays an important role in the development of an autonomous driving system. Fast processing and accurate detection are two major aspects of generating the autonomous vehicle detection system. This paper proposes a novel computer vision-based cost-effective vehicle detection system. Here, a Gentle Adaptive Boosting algorithm is trained with Haar-like features to generate the hypothesis of vehicles. Haar-like feature generates hypotheses very fast but may detect false vehicle candidates. The support vector machine algorithm is trained with the histogram of oriented gradient features to filter out the generated false hypothesis. The histogram of oriented gradients descriptor utilizes the shape and outlines of the vehicles, hence detects vehicles more accurately. Haar-Likes features and histogram of oriented gradients features are organized to accomplish the aspects of autonomous driving. The performance of the proposed vehicle detector is evaluated for day time and night time captured images and compared with three different existing vehicle detectors. The average precision of the proposed system for day time captured image is 0.97 and for night time captured image is 0.94. The proposed system requires 15 times less training time as compared to the existing technique for the same number of image data and on the same CPU.

AB An autonomous V2V communication mode (also known as side-link mode 4), which facilitates V2V communication in out of eNB coverage areas, has recently been introduced into the Long term evolution (LTE) standard. Recent research has studied the performance of this LTE-V2V autonomous mode for a highway use case. However, performance analysis for a highway use case cannot be easily applied to an intersection use case as it may contain non-line-of-sight (NLOS) communication links. In this paper, we analyze and evaluate the safety message broadcasting performance of LTE-V2V autonomous mode in an urban intersection scenario. Considering practical path loss models, we present the impact of NLOS communication link on the overall message dissemination performance. Through the analytical and simulation results, we show that the overall message dissemination performance degrades drastically with increasing vehicle density and increasing distance of the transmitting vehicle from the intersection. To improve the performance, we propose a vehicle-assisted relaying scheme in which the relaying vehicle is selected in an autonomous manner. We also present two resource allocation strategies for the relaying vehicle. For low to medium vehicle density along the street, we observe significant improvement in message dissemination through relaying compared to the scheme without relaying.

TI A Block Object Detection Method Based on Feature Fusion Networks for

SO COMPLEXITY
LA English
DT Article
AB Nowadays, automatic multi-objective detection remains a challenging problem for autonomous vehicle technologies. In the past decades, deep learning has been demonstrated successful for multi-objective detection, such as the Single Shot Multibox Detector (SSD) model. The current trend is to train the deep Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) with online autonomous vehicle datasets. However, network performance usually degrades when small objects are detected. Moreover, the existing autonomous vehicle datasets could not meet the need for domestic traffic environment. To improve the detection performance of small objects and ensure the validity of the dataset, we propose a new method. Specifically, the original images are divided into blocks as input to a VGG-16 network which add the feature map fusion after CNNs. Moreover, the image pyramid is built to project all the blocks detection results at the original objects size as much as possible. In addition to improving the detection method, a new autonomous driving vehicle dataset is created, in which the object categories and labelling criteria are defined, and a data augmentation method is proposed. The experimental results on the new datasets show that the performance of the proposed method is greatly improved, especially for small objects detection in large image. Moreover, the proposed method is adaptive to complex climatic conditions and contributes a lot for autonomous vehicle perception and planning.

AB Localization is a fundamental and crucial module for autonomous vehicles. Most of the existing localization methodologies, such as signal-dependent methods (RTK-GPS and Bluetooth), simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM), and map-based methods, have been utilized in outdoor autonomous driving vehicles and indoor robot positioning. However, they suffer from severe limitations, such as signal-blocked scenes of GPS, computing resource occupation explosion in large-scale scenarios, intolerable time delay, and registration divergence of SLAM/map-based methods. In this article, a self-localization framework, without relying on GPS or any other wireless signals, is proposed. We demonstrate that the proposed homogeneous normal distribution transform algorithm and two-way information interaction mechanism could achieve centimeter-level localization accuracy, which reaches the requirement of autonomous vehicle localization for instantaneity and robustness. In addition, benefitting from hardware and software co-design, the proposed localization approach is extremely light-weighted enough to be operated on an embedded computing system, which is different from other LiDAR localization methods relying on high-performance CPU/GPU. Experiments on a public dataset (Baidu Apollo SouthBay dataset) and real-world verified the effectiveness and advantages of our approach compared with other similar algorithms.

AB Purpose Over the past decades, there has been significant research effort dedicated to the development of autonomous vehicles. The decision-making system, which is responsible for driving safety, is one of the most important technologies for autonomous vehicles. The purpose of this study is the use of an intensive learning method combined with car-following data by a driving simulator to obtain an explanatory learning following algorithm and establish an anthropomorphic car-following model. Design/methodology/approach This paper proposed car-following method based on reinforcement learning for autonomous vehicles decision-making. An approximator is used to approximate the value function by determining state space, action space and state transition relationship. A gradient descent method is used to solve the parameter. Findings The effect of car-following on certain driving styles is initially achieved through the simulation of step conditions. The effect of car-following initially proves that the reinforcement learning system is more adaptive to car following and that it has certain explanatory and stability based on the explicit calculation of R. Originality/value The simulation results show that the car-following method based on reinforcement learning for autonomous vehicle decision-making realizes reliable car-following decision-making and has the advantages of simple sample, small amount of data, simple algorithm and good robustness.

AB Autonomous vehicle industry is making rapid progress in the development of commercial vehicles with higher levels of autonomy. Although the general advanced driver assistance system (ADAS) architecture is widely discussed, limited details are available about the functionality of the modules and their interactions, backed up by scientific justification. This, in turn, limits the utilization of such architecture for pragmatic implementation. A cognitive ADAS architecture for level 4 autonomous-capable electrified vehicles (EVs) is proposed. Variations for levels 3 and 3.5, which are simply seen to be a combination of 3 and 4, with the primary fallback through a human driver and the secondary through an automated driving system, are also presented. A simulation framework is built for highway driving based on the proposed level 4 architecture for an enhanced Tesla Model S. It was concluded that the autonomous control provided a 23% energy economy increase, on average, compared to a human driver control. Through a detailed sensitivity analysis, the optimal mission/motion planning and energy management in addition to the positive impact on the EV battery, motor, and acceleration/deceleration profiles are considered to contribute to this significant increase in the energy economy of an autonomous-controlled EV.

AB Human driver behavior strongly influences traffic flow by increasing the spread of shock waves in a downstream direction. This paper addresses the problem of traffic congestion mitigation in a mixed scenario composed of connected human-driven and autonomous vehicles. The control protocol, driving the longitudinal motion of the autonomous vehicles, is designed for damping down traffic waves. The effectiveness of the strategy, and ability to cope with multiple and time-varying delays originated by the non-ideal wireless communication among connected vehicles, is both analytically and numerically analyzed. The asymptotic stability of the algorithm is mathematically proved by leveraging a Lyapunov-Krasovskii functional, while the head-to-tail stability tool is exploited for the tuning of the control gains. The performance of the control strategy is disclosed by using hardware-in-the-loop real-time simulation for an exemplary pattern of three vehicles. The effectiveness of the proposed cooperative strategy in longer queues of vehicles is, instead, investigated through PLEXE, an inter-vehicular communication and mobility simulator that includes features for autonomous vehicles as well as for the realistic emulation of the IEEE 802.11p standard. The results confirm the robustness of the approach and its ability in damping disturbances and mitigating stop-and-go effects according to the theoretical derivation.

AB In this study, the hardware and software design and implementation of an autonomous electric vehicle are addressed. We aimed to develop an autonomous electric vehicle for path tracking. Control and navigation algorithms are developed and implemented. The vehicle is able to perform path-tracking maneuvers under environments in which the positioning signals from the Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) are not accessible. The proposed control approach uses a modified constrained input-output nonlinear model predictive controller (NMPC) for path-tracking control. The proposed localization algorithm used in this study guarantees almost accurate position estimation under GNSS-denied environments. We discuss the procedure for designing the vehicle hardware, electronic drivers, communication architecture, localization algorithm, and controller architecture. The system's full state is estimated by fusing visual inertial odometry (VIO) measurements with wheel odometry data using an extended Kalman filter (EKF). Simulation and real-time experiments are performed. The obtained results demonstrate that our designed autonomous vehicle is capable of performing path-tracking maneuvers without using Global Navigation Satellite System positioning data. The designed vehicle can perform challenging path-tracking maneuvers with a speed of up to 1 m per second.

AB Autonomous Vehicles have the potential to change the urban transport scenario. However, to be able to safely navigate autonomously they need to deal with faults that its components are subject to. Therefore, Health Monitoring System is a essential component of the autonomous system, since allows Fault Detection and Diagnosis. In addition, Prognosis System is also important, since it allows predictive maintenance and safer decisions during vehicle navigation. This paper presents a Hierarchical Component-based Health Monitoring System with Fault Detection, Diagnosis and Prognosis using Dynamic Bayesian Network (DBN) with residue generation, a combination of knowledge-based and model-based detection, diagnosis and prognosis approaches. We evaluate the proposed Dynamic Bayesian Network using different machine learning metrics and a dataset with sensor readings gathered using the CaRINA II autonomous vehicle platform, and the CARLA simulator. Both simulated and experimental results demonstrated a positive performance of the DBNs even with high rate of missing data for some of the model's variables.

DT Article
DE chemical plume tracing; odour source localisation; guidance; autonomous

AB Autonomous vehicles with an ability to trace chemical plumes can be instrumental in tasks such as detection of unexploded ordnance, search for undersea wreckage and environmental monitoring. As a consequence, use of autonomous vehicles to perform chemical plume tracing has received an increasing interest from the research community in recent years. Owing to the diversity of applications and ambient fluid environment of the plumes, there are numerous plume tracing strategies and approaches. This paper reviews two main approaches and a number of strategies that have been successfully implemented to track air or water borne plumes in order to locate odour sources using autonomous vehicles. The first strategy considered is the biomimetic approach that offers excellent models for the development of robotic systems. Strategies inspired by lobsters and bacterium are the main focus in this study. The second scheme considers parallelization of the search procedure by employing a multi-robot approach. This approach has the advantage of utilising a group of smaller and simpler communicating robots which are capable of performing a collaborative search of the plume.

AB Understanding the factors that affect the uptake of emerging transport modes is critical for understanding if and how they will be used once they are implemented. In this study, we undertook a stated-preference analysis to understand the factors that affect the use of shared autonomous vehicles and shared personal mobility (micromobility) as competing modes on a university campus in Korea. We applied a binary logit model, which included time and cost variables as well as the perceptions of convenience (in-car congestion and availability) and safety. For autonomous vehicles, the cost- and time-related demand elasticities were estimated to be -0.45 and -0.25, respectively, while the cost elasticity for shared electric bicycles was -0.42. The elasticities of perceived convenience (availability) and safety for the shared electric bicycle system were estimated to be 0.72 and 0.29, respectively. Finally, the elasticity for perceived convenience (in-car congestion) of the shared autonomous vehicle was 0.42. Our results show that there is an innate preference for shared autonomous vehicles when these are compared to shared personal mobility, and that the effect of subjective variables (convenience and safety) on the use of emerging transport modes is as important as traditional cost and time variables.

AB This paper presents the development and field testing of multiple autonomous surface vehicles (ASVs) for autonomous cooperative navigation tasks in marine environments. The developed ASVs were designed in a catamaran hull form, and various systems related to autonomous functionalities, including the electrical propulsion, wireless communication, and guidance, navigation, and control (GNC) systems, were integrated with the situational awareness sensor system. Because not all of the navigation and situational awareness sensor data can be shared owing to the large network load, the network communication and data protocol structure was designed to enhance the data management efficiency. Furthermore, for cooperative navigation between multiple ASVs, the network communication system was synchronously shared with motion information through a robot operating system (ROS) multi-master system. In particular, an autonomy framework with cooperative navigation and control was designed to enable autonomous cooperative maneuvering with multiple ASVs in a global navigation satellite system (GNSS)-denied environment. Furthermore, a cooperative navigation and control approach based on relative geometric information between vehicles was implemented in the framework, which incorporated the capabilities of following a predefined path and maintaining a specific formation based on the relative distance between ASVs. Moreover, to demonstrate the essential maneuvering and functional capabilities of the cooperative navigation and control approach of the developed ASVs, preliminary field tests were conducted in an inland water environment, and the test results are discussed in this paper.

AB Connected autonomous vehicle technology is conductive to promoting the transition from traditional merging control (e.g., ramp metering) to automated merging control. This paper proposes a platoon-based hierarchical merging control algorithm for on-ramp vehicles to achieve automated merging control under connected traffic environment. The proposed algorithm optimizes merging maneuvers of on-ramp vehicles to smooth their merging trajectories without frequent decelerations or stops at the end of the ramp, and to minimize disruption to the mainline traffic in the merging zone. A tactical layer controller is designed to select pre-target merging gaps for on-ramp vehicles, in which the future motion (i.e., acceleration and deceleration) of mainline vehicles is considered through the grey prediction model. An operational layer controller is constructed based on model predictive control to adjust the speed of on-ramp vehicles in advance, and controls on-ramp vehicles to merge into the pre-target merging gaps under state constraints (i.e., safe headway, maximum speed and so on). Through numerical simulation, the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm is validated under different merging scenarios. It is shown that on-ramp vehicles smoothly merge into the mainline within the pre-target merging gap at the same speed as adjacent mainline vehicles. Compared with the baseline merging control algorithm, the proposed algorithm significantly reduces both fuel consumption and travel time of on-ramp vehicles, and improves passenger comfort.

AB Connected and autonomous vehicles (CAVs) have the ability to receive information on their leading vehicles through multiple sensors and vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) technology and then predict their future behaviour thus to improve roadway safety and mobility. This study pres-ents an innovative algorithm for connected and autono-mous vehicles to determine their trajectory considering surrounding vehicles. For the first time, the XGBoost model is developed to predict the acceleration rate that the object vehicle should take based on the current status of both the object vehicle and its leading vehicle. Next Generation Simulation (NGSIM) datasets are utilised for training the proposed model. The XGBoost model is com-pared with the Intelligent Driver Model (IDM), which is a prior state-of-the-art model. Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) and Mean Absolute Error (MAE) are applied to evaluate the two models. The results show that the XG-Boost model outperforms the IDM in terms of prediction errors. The analysis of the feature importance reveals that the longitudinal position has the greatest influence on vehicle trajectory prediction results.

AB The environmental adaptability of autonomous underwater vehicles is always a problem for its path planning. Although reinforcement learning can improve the environmental adaptability, the slow convergence of reinforcement learning is caused by multi-behavior coupling, so it is difficult for autonomous underwater vehicle to avoid moving obstacles. This article proposes a multi-behavior critic reinforcement learning algorithm applied to autonomous underwater vehicle path planning to overcome problems associated with oscillating amplitudes and low learning efficiency in the early stages of training which are common in traditional actor-critic algorithms. Behavior critic reinforcement learning assesses the actions of the actor from perspectives such as energy saving and security, combining these aspects into a whole evaluation of the actor. In this article, the policy gradient method is selected as the actor part, and the value function method is selected as the critic part. The strategy gradient and the value function methods for actor and critic, respectively, are approximated by a backpropagation neural network, the parameters of which are updated using the gradient descent method. The simulation results show that the method has the ability of optimizing learning in the environment and can improve learning efficiency, which meets the needs of real time and adaptability for autonomous underwater vehicle dynamic obstacle avoidance.

AB The recent race for autonomous or 'driverless' vehicles, has spawned a lot of research in the area of Internet of Autonomous Vehicles (IAVs). With the advent of the latest technology fueled by Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning, Autonomous Vehicles (AVs) can now determine the best possible route to a destination based on the current traffic situation and take dynamic driving decisions accordingly, while preventing accidents. Field trials for single autonomous vehicles have been largely successful. However, as more autonomous vehicles will be added to the intelligent transport networks, current research is now centered around their synergistic coexistence in the offering of network-centric and user-centric services. This development is governed by borrowing several concepts from the legacy Internet to address the problems of IAVs. In this paper, we present an extensive overview of the research challenges in the IAVs. Moreover, our contributions in this paper are that (i) We show how the network-oriented cooperative client-server model will give way to a more unorthodox and 'selfish' decentralized and peer-to-peer (P2P) model, for example in the offering of navigation services on the IAV. (ii) We discuss how centralized architecture will give way to more distributed architectures for real-time information propagation over the IAV. (iii) We discuss how network-centric policies will begin to shift to user-centric under more beneficial revenue models by offering network-assisted quality of service (QoS) provisioning. (iv) We discuss in detail how vehicle traffic grooming in the IAV would present as much of a challenge as in the legacy Internet. (v) We discuss the disruptive role of value-added services on the IAV, and (iv) Finally, we discuss the problem of cyber threats in the IAV just as in the legacy Internet.

AB Highway platooning of vehicles has been identified as a promising framework in developing intelligent transportation systems. By autonomous or semi-autonomous vehicle control and intervehicle coordination, an appropriately managed platoon can potentially offer enhanced safety, improved highway utility, increased fuel economy, and reduced emissions. This paper is focused on quantitative characterization of the impact of communication information structures and contents on platoon safety. By comparing different information structures that combine front sensors, rear sensors, and wireless communication channels, as well as different information contents such as distances, speeds, and drivers' actions, we reveal a number of intrinsic relationships between vehicle coordination and communications in platoons. Typical communication standards and related communication latency are used as benchmark cases in this paper. The findings of this paper provide useful guidelines in sensor selections, communication resource allocations, and vehicle coordination.

ID CHALLENGE
AB Existing collision avoidance methods for autonomous vehicles, which ignore the driving intent of detected vehicles, thus, cannot satisfy the requirements for autonomous driving in urban environments because of their high false detection rates of collisions with vehicles on winding roads and the missed detection rate of collisions with maneuvering vehicles. This study introduces an intent-estimation-and motion-model-based (IEMMB) method to address these disadvantages. First, a state vector is constructed by combining the road structure and the moving state of detected vehicles. A Gaussian mixture model is used to learn the maneuvering patterns of vehicles from collected data, and the patterns are used to estimate the driving intent of the detected vehicles. Then, a desirable long-term trajectory is obtained by weighting time and comfort. The long-term trajectory and the short-term trajectory, which are predicted using a constant yaw rate motion model, are fused to achieve an accurate trajectory. Finally, considering the moving state of the autonomous vehicle, collisions can be detected and avoided. Experiments have shown that the intent estimation method performed well, achieving an accuracy of 91.7% on straight roads and an accuracy of 90.5% on winding roads, which is much higher than that achieved by the method that ignores the road structure. The average collision detection distance is increased by more than 8 m. In addition, the maximum yaw rate and acceleration during an evasive maneuver are decreased, indicating an improvement in the driving comfort.

AB A primary task in autonomous driving is to design a control algorithm that presents an effective and yet human-compatible behavior. To this aim, present paper considers the problem of autonomous overtaking under both state and environment constraints with dynamic surrounding vehicles. The solution is formulated based on quadratic programming optimization and is solved in receding horizon fashion. The proposed method evaluates the traffic condition online and executes a safe trajectory of an overtaking maneuver with on-coming traffic. To better incorporate traffic participants' behaviors, a dynamic predictive model-based reachability analysis of the surrounding vehicles is utilized in the design. Reachable sets aim to ensure the drivability of the planned motions, as well as producing drivable collision-free trajectories. To this end, forward reachable sets are employed by predicting traffic vehicles' future actual and worst-case behaviors in the design, in which the autonomous vehicle determines its trajectory accordingly. A simulation scenario is tested via MATLAB/Simulink for autonomous overtaking and the effectiveness of the proposed method is shown, demonstrating the potential utility of the present approach for implementation as an advanced driver assistance system (ADAS) in next-generation vehicles.

AB To date, commercial fully autonomous driving is not realized, while level 3 is the next step in the development of autonomous driving. At level 3, the vehicle is driving under the control of the machine, but when feature requests, human driver must take over control. Therefore, autonomous driving control should consider not only efficiency and safety but also human driver's acceptance. This paper develops a car-following (CF) model as a longitudinal control strategy for level 3 autonomous driving based on the automating entropy adjustment on Tsallis actor-critic (ATAC) algorithm. 1641 pairs of CF trajectories extracted from the Next Generation Simulation (NGSIM) data are applied to train the reinforcement learning (RL) agent. Based on the empirical data distributions, we use time margin, time gap, and jerk to construct the reward function and testify the proposed CF model's merits. Simulation results show that the proposed model can enable vehicles to drive safely, efficiently, and comfortably. The proposed model has good stability, and the generated driving behaviors are more acceptable for drivers. This work sheds light on developing a better autonomous driving system from the perspective of human factors.

AB There are driving situations that avoiding all obstacles is infeasible. In such situations, an autonomous vehicle should avoid vulnerable obstacles like pedestrians. In this paper, a motion planning method is presented that avoids obstacles according to their priority orders. The method utilizes a model predictive controller with obstacle constraints and applies lexicographic optimization to the controller to prioritize the constraints, and subsequently, prioritize the obstacles. The proposed method is simulated on a high fidelity CarSim vehicle model. The results show that when avoiding all obstacles is not feasible, the proposed method avoids the obstacles with the highest priority orders.

ID MOTION CONTROL
AB Recently, autonomous driving technology has received significant interest, and consequently, various autonomous driving algorithms have been developed by researchers. An experimental (conventional) vehicle verifies the strategy for autonomous driving by testing the performance and feasibility of the corresponding algorithms. Implementation of the autonomous driving strategy in the conventional vehicle system requires modification of the electronic control unit (ECU); however, this is limited by security issues and the high cost of development. In this paper, a maneuvering system that can control the steering angle, braking force, and accelerating signal so that autonomous driving does not operate via the ECU is proposed. Because the steering angle is an important factor in terms of the vehicle motion behavior, a robust angle controller based on the disturbance observer is adopted. Moreover, to ensure safety and user convenience, a user intention recognition algorithm is proposed. Based on this algorithm, the maneuvering system can be disabled during control without using any perception sensor. Finally, several experiments are conducted to evaluate the functions of the maneuvering system. A scenario-based driving test is also performed to verify the feasibility of the maneuvering system.

AB Autonomous vehicles promise to revolutionize the automobile market, although their implementation could take several decades in which both types of cars will coexist on the streets. We formulate a model for a circular city based on continuous approximations, considering demand surfaces over the city. Numerical results from our model predict direct and indirect effects of connected and autonomous vehicles. Direct effects will be positive for our cities: (a) less street supply is needed to accommodate the traffic; (b) congestion levels decrease: travel costs may decrease by 30%. Some indirect effects will counterbalance these positive effects: (c) a decrease of 20% in the value of travel time can reduce the total cost by a third; (d) induced demand could be as high as 50%, bringing equivalent total costs in the future scenario; (e) the vehicle-kilometers traveled could also affect the future scenario; and (f) increases in city size and urban sprawl. As a conclusion, the implementation of autonomous vehicles could be neutral for the cities regarding travel time costs. City planning agencies still have to promote complementary modes such as active mobility (walking and bicycle), transit (public transportation), and shared mobility (shared autonomous vehicles and mobility as a service).

ID DESIGN
AB Autonomous vehicle motion control development requires testing and evaluation at all stages of the process. The development phase involving the instrumentation and operation of a full-size vehicle can be especially costly. Scale vehicles have been developed in the literature to serve as a cost-effective transition from testing in a simulation environment to a physical system. However, the existing scale vehicle platforms do not support four-wheel steering and cannot isolate the performance of motion control algorithms from other modules such as perception and path planning. This letter closes this gap by proposing a new scale vehicle platform, called JetRacer-4WS, based on the open-source JetRacer autonomous vehicle with additional modifications to support four-wheel steering, model predictive control-based path following, and high-precision ultrasonic-based real-time positioning. The proposed JetRacer-4WS can be used as a low-cost platform for both research and education on motion control, path following, and vehicle dynamics. We describe the design of JetRacer-4WS, and experimentally demonstrate JetRacer-4WS' ability to perform controller auto-tuning and illustrate the advantage of four-wheel steering. We also show that JetRacer-4WS can be used as a validation platform for testing advanced control algorithms such as event-triggered model predictive control.

AB The motion planner determines the autonomy of the autonomous underwater vehicle. However, many studies often ignore the characteristics of autonomous underwater vehicles and the underwater environment, resulting in unreasonable trajectories. To solve this problem, this paper plans the motion force through prediction and optimization to integrate the characteristics of the autonomous underwater vehicle. The fast travel algorithm is modified to take advantage of favorable currents and output arrival times, taking into account the peculiarities of the underwater environment. A novel objective function is proposed, which incorporates the arrival times to imply the requirements of obstacle avoidance and distance optimization. A penalty item is included in the objective function to avoid strong side flow. At the same time, the force and its changing rate limited in appropriate ranges are also included to balance energy consumption. In order to meet the high running time requirements in practical applications, the warm-start improved quantum particle swarm optimization is introduced into force optimization. Simulation studies are performed on a self-developed autonomous underwater vehicle. The method has good application effects in multi-island areas, ocean currents, and dynamic threedimensional environments. Comparative simulations show that the planner plans shorter paths with good robustness and adaptability.

AB Internet of vehicles (IoV) is gradually combined with connected autonomous vehicles (CAV), which accelerates the development of CAV. In order to meet the service requirements of CAV, mobile edge computing (MEC) provides IoV with a novel paradigm which provides services by fast processing vehicle tasks at the road side units distributed near target vehicles. In this way, vehicle tasks can be offloaded to edge servers deployed in road side units (RSU). A vehicle tasks offloading problem requires load balance of edge servers to be maintained with minimum total time cost. Thus, we proposed a vehicle tasks offloading method (VTO) in which the vehicle tasks offloading problem is formulated as a multi-objective optimization problem. Hence, we design a multi-objective optimization evolutionary algorithm basing on improving the strength pare to evolutionary algorithm (SPEA2) and technique for order preference by similarity to ideal solution (TOPSIS) and multiple criteria decision making (MCDM). Through theoretical analysis and experimental evaluation, the results shows that the performance of VTO is effective and efficient.

AB Autonomous Vehicles (AVs) are an emergent technology. The very few studies focusing on how people perceive and react to autonomous vehicles are mainly based on online surveys. Although important, these studies measure people's opinions on AVs, but not their actual reaction when using them. In this paper, we assess users' perceptions of AVs using an immersive virtual reality experiment. We modeled autonomous boats that are intended to be deployed in Amsterdam, the Netherlands. We compared users' reactions to manned and unmanned boats in a virtual reality environment. In total, 30 participants were exposed to a Virtual Reality (VR) simulation, where we collected skin conductance data, which was compared with a participant's responses to a questionnaire regarding perceived risk, stress, and trust toward manned and unmanned boats. The study finds that autonomous boats do not substantially influence the experienced stress, trust, or perceived risk in comparison with human-controlled boats. This article also shows the gains that virtual reality can bring to studies of the social appropriation of technologies. Results show the need for objective, quantitative data regarding the societal acceptance toward autonomous systems to better understand how these technologies will be appropriated.

AB This paper presents a novel interactive motion planning approach for left-turning of autonomous vehicles at uncontrolled intersections. A typical left-turning scenario that consists of agent vehicles and an autonomous ego vehicle is established. The autonomous ego vehicle aims to cross the uncontrolled intersection quickly and safely when meeting with the agent vehicles. A modified obstacle reciprocal collision avoidance (MORCA) prediction model is proposed to predict the trajectory of the agent vehicles with the considerations of longitudinal and lateral interaction-aware behaviors. The parameters of the MORCA prediction model are optimized using particle swarm optimization (PSO) with the inD datasets. Based on MORCA, a partially observable Markov decision process (POMDP) framework is established. The action and state spaces of the POMDP are extended reasonably to satisfy the requirement of real-time application. The simulation results show that the prediction precision is improved by 15% using the MORCA compared with the obstacle reciprocal collision avoidance (ORCA) prediction model. Meanwhile, the results manifest that the proposed MORCA-based POMDP planning method improves 43.8% in commuting efficiency compared with a traditional rule-based method, nearly as good as the vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) communication is equipped. Note to Practitioners-The motivation of this article is to establish a safe and efficient planning framework for the left-turning of autonomous vehicles at uncontrolled intersections. Rule-based approaches were widely used in the previous studies but they are not optimal. In this paper, the lateral movements of vehicles at the intersection are considered for the first time. A MORCA prediction model is established and optimized to formulate a POMDP planning framework. The CARLA simulation demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed MORCA-based POMDP planner. In future work, we will migrate the algorithm to a real-world test platform for experimentation.

AB Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV), or drones, have gained a lot of popularity over the last decade. The use of autonomous drones appears to be a viable and low-cost solution to problems in many applications. Path planning capabilities are essential for autonomous control systems. An autonomous drone must be able to rapidly compute feasible and energy-efficient paths to avoid collisions. In this study, we review two key aspects of path planning: environmental representation and path generation techniques. Common path planning techniques are analyzed, and their key limitations are highlighted. Finally, we review thirty-five highly cited publications to identify current trends in drone path planning research. We then use these results to identify factors that need to be addressed in future studies in order to develop a practical path planner for autonomous drones.

AB Deployment of autonomous vehicles on public roads promises increased efficiency and safety. It requires understanding the intent of human drivers and adapting to their driving styles. Autonomous vehicles must also behave in safe and predictable ways without requiring explicit communication. We integrate tools from social psychology into autonomous-vehicle decision making to quantify and predict the social behavior of other drivers and to behave in a socially compliant way. A key component is Social Value Orientation (SVO), which quantifies the degree of an agent's selfishness or altruism, allowing us to better predict how the agent will interact and cooperate with others. We model interactions between agents as a best-response game wherein each agent negotiates to maximize their own utility. We solve the dynamic game by finding the Nash equilibrium, yielding an online method of predicting multiagent interactions given their SVOs. This approach allows autonomous vehicles to observe human drivers, estimate their SVOs, and generate an autonomous control policy in real time. We demonstrate the capabilities and performance of our algorithm in challenging traffic scenarios: merging lanes and unprotected left turns. We validate our results in simulation and on human driving data from the NGSIM dataset. Our results illustrate how the algorithm's behavior adapts to social preferences of other drivers. By incorporating SVO, we improve autonomous performance and reduce errors in human trajectory predictions by 25%.

DE Automation; Robotics; Autonomous Underwater Vehicles; Acoustic

AB Although narrow-azimuth towed-streamer data provide good image quality for structural interpretation, it is generally accepted that for wide-azimuth marine surveys seabed receivers deliver superior seismic reflection measurements and seismically derived reservoir attributes. However, seabed surveys are not widely used due to the higher acquisition costs when compared to streamer acquisition. In recent years, there have been significant engineering efforts to automate receiver deployment and retrieval in order to minimize the cost differential and conduct cost-efficient seabed receiver seismic surveys. These engineering efforts include industrially engineered nodes, nodes on a rope deployment schemes and even robotic nodes, which swim to and from the deployment location. This move to automation is inevitable, leading to robotization of seismic data acquisition for exploration and development activities in the oil and gas industry. We are developing a robotic-based technology, which utilizes autonomous underwater vehicles as seismic sensors without the need of using a remotely operated vehicle for deployment and retrieval. In this paper, we describe the autonomous underwater vehicle evolution throughout the project years from initial heavy and bulky nodes to fully autonomous light and flexible underwater receivers. Results obtained from two field pilot tests using different generations of autonomous underwater vehicles indicate that the seismic coupling, and navigation based on underwater acoustics are very reliable and robust.

AB Connected and automated vehicles (CAVs) are becoming increasingly feasible, and these vehicles are expected to enhance road safety, traffic throughput, energy efficiency, and human comfort, especially at road intersections and for lane changing, merging, and unprotected turning maneuvers. However, there is likely to be a long transition period before human-driven vehicles are completely replaced by such automated vehicles. To leverage the autonomous driving technologies on public roads, we have to design and develop safe interaction and cooperation for mixed traffic environments, where human-driven and autonomous vehicles cooperate with one another in order to avoid vehicle collisions and possible deadlocks. In this article, we study the requirements and challenges for such safe cooperation of autonomous vehicles and human drivers, and review three prospective components: road infrastructure, vehicular communications, and online recognition and prediction. First, road infrastructure contributes to improving CAV capabilities for safe cooperation as a centralized coordinator. In addition, vehicle-to-vehicle communications might be key to safe cooperation in a decentralized manner that can guarantee road safety for multiple connected vehicles. Online motion prediction and real-time gesture recognition are also essential to develop a safe cooperation system in a decentralized manner with non-connected vehicles. These three approaches are not exclusive, and CAVs may complementarily use them in practice. Finally, we discuss the feasibility and limitations of each approach and conclude with future research directions.

AB The on-line optimal autonomous reentry guidance of the hypersonic vehicle is proposed based on the improved Gauss pseudospectral method (IGPM). The autonomous reentry guidance requires the hypersonic vehicle can generate the optimal trajectory for the latest flight mission on line and track the new trajectory well under the uncertainty. These two problems are simplified into a nonlinear optimal control problem with nonlinear constraints. The IGPM is introduced to solve the above two problems. The trajectory has to change according to the flight mission and therefore the new optimal trajectory can be obtained by IGPM within about 10 s. The optimal feedback guidance law is used to track the reference trajectory to handle the uncertainty. In order to deal with the CPU time delay, which comes from optimizing the new trajectory, the new on-line optimal autonomous reentry guidance is depicted. Finally, the numerical simulation shows that the proposed autonomous guidance can generate optimal trajectory for the new flight mission and have a high tracking accuracy.

AB A cooperative control approach for autonomous vehicles is developed in order to perform different complex traffic maneuvers, e.g., double lane-switching or intersection situations. The problem is formulated as a distributed optimal control problem for a system of multiple autonomous vehicles, and then solved using a nonlinear Model Predictive Control (MPC) technique, where the distributed approach is used to make the problem computationally feasible in real-time. To provide safety, a collision avoidance constraint is introduced, also in a distributed way. In the proposed method, each vehicle computes its own control inputs using estimated states of neighboring vehicles. In addition, a compatibility constraint is defined that takes collision avoidance into account but also ensures that each vehicle does not deviate significantly from what is expected by neighboring vehicles. The method allows us to construct a cost function for several different traffic scenarios. The asymptotic convergence of the system to the desired destination is proven, in the absence of uncertainty, and disturbances, for a sufficiently small MPC control horizon. Simulation results show that the distributed algorithm scales well with increasing number of vehicles.

TI Driving Risk Field and Control Strategies for Autonomous Vehicles at a
   Signalized Intersection
SO JOURNAL OF ADVANCED TRANSPORTATION
LA English
DT Article
ID CRASHES
AB Driving pattern has been increasingly researched to improve driving safety and develop autonomous vehicles. Oriented towards the complex infrastructures at signalized intersections, this research digs into the risk sources brought by different kinds of road elements, including road lane markings, road curbs, median separators, signal timing, and neighboring vehicles around the ego car. Referring to vehicle speed both in the longitudinal and latitudinal dimensions, risk scope and distribution are quantified with the vehicle position of a torus with a Gaussian cross-section. Then, the risk is summed over all the road elements across all the points involved by the ego car, the level of which should be controlled within the threshold value when the ego vehicle explores to minimize trip delay. Thus, autonomous driving strategies are developed with respect to vehicle speed and steering angle. The proposed model is validated with NGSIM data, where a signalized intersection on Peachtree Street is selected and vehicles moving in different directions are analyzed. It is found that the proposed model manages to control vehicles with risk at the accepted level and to enhance the speed level as well as reduce acceleration fluctuations. This research contributes to improving autonomous driving against complex driving conditions for driving safety and efficiency.

AB As autonomous vehicle technology advances, the development of energy-efficient control methodologies emerges as a critical area in the literature. This includes the behavior control of vehicles near signalized intersections, which still needs comprehensive exploration. Through connectivity, the adoption of promising eco-driving approaches can manage a vehicle's speed profile to improve energy consumption. This study focuses on controlling the speed of an autonomous electric vehicle (AEV) both up and downstream of a signalized intersection in the presence of preceding vehicles. In order to achieve this, a dynamic pro-active predictive cruise control eco-driving (eco-PPCC) framework is developed that, instead of merely reacting to the preceding vehicle's speed changes, uses the preceding vehicle's upcoming data to actively adjust and optimize the speed profile of the AEV. The proposed algorithm is compared to the conventional Gipps and eco-PCC models for benchmarking and performance analysis through numerous scenarios. Additionally, real-world measurements are performed and taken to consider practical use cases. The results demonstrate that when compared to the two baseline methods, the proposed framework can add significant value to reducing energy consumption, preventing unnecessary stops at intersections, and improving travel time.

AB The possible applications of communication based on big data have steadily increased in several industries, such as the autonomous vehicle industry, with a corresponding increase in security challenges, including cybersecurity vulnerabilities (CVs). The cybersecurity-related symmetry of big data communication systems used in autonomous vehicles may raise more vulnerabilities in the data communication process between these vehicles and IoT devices. The data involved in the CVs may be encrypted using an asymmetric and symmetric algorithm. Autonomous vehicles with proactive cybersecurity solutions, power-based cyberattacks, and dynamic countermeasures are the modern issues/developments with emerging technology and evolving attacks. Research on big data has been primarily focused on mitigating CVs and minimizing big data breaches using appropriate countermeasures known as security solutions. In the future, CVs in data communication between autonomous vehicles (DCAV), the weaknesses of autonomous vehicular networks (AVN), and cyber threats to network functions form the primary security issues in big data communication, AVN, and DCAV. Therefore, efficient countermeasure models and security algorithms are required to minimize CVs and data breaches. As a technique, policies and rules of CVs with proxy and demilitarized zone (DMZ) servers were combined to enhance the efficiency of the countermeasure. In this study, we propose an information security approach that depends on the increasing energy levels of attacks and CVs by identifying the energy levels of each attack. To show the results of the performance of our proposed countermeasure, CV and energy consumption are compared with different attacks. Thus, the countermeasures can secure big data communication and DCAV using security algorithms related to cybersecurity and effectively prevent CVs and big data breaches during data communication.

AB The main purpose of this work is to develop an output state-dependent controller that solves the path-tracking deviation error for a skid-steering autonomous vehicle. The controller takes advantage of a nonlinear diffeomorphism that transforms skid-steering autonomous vehicle into a multi-input multi-output chain of integrators. This research assumes that available skid-steering autonomous vehicle variables are its position and its orientation. This in fact motivates the development of a modified super-twisting algorithm operating as a sequential step-by-step differentiator that estimates traslational velocity and acceleration of the studied autonomous vehicle in a finite time, which were used as part of the controller implementation. Based on the estimated states by the step-by-step multi-variable differentiator, an adaptive control design enforces the asymptotic convergence of the tracking trajectories for the skid-steering autonomous vehicle to the origin. The explicit form of the controller gains is derived using a class of control Lyapunov function including the deviation corresponding to the tracking error and a term that defines a matrix norm associated with control gains. Numerical results confirm the workability of the proposed controller considering the reduced norm of tracking error obtained with the proposed controller. Experimental evaluations compared the adaptive control introduced in this study and a state-feedback form justifying the control proposal. The adaptive form enforced smaller tracking errors using the estimated states forced by the step-by-step differentiator and the information obtained from a multi-camera video high-frequency acquisition system.

AB Only recently, smart cities are taking shape, thanks to the rapid development of Internet of Things (IoT), cloud computing, and other similar technologies. Given the high demands placed on advanced technologies such as autonomous driving, cloud data services, and high-precision sensors, smart cities are creating an intelligent transportation environment conducive to the introduction of autonomous vehicles (AVs). In this context, the use of AVs in transportation is also considered a form of transportation innovation. As a result, AVs are considered more favorable to people interested in new technologies because they appear to be technologically superior. Their association with the most up-to-date technology can serve as a symbol for those who wish to demonstrate their interest in new technologies through their appearance. The positive image of technological innovation projected by AVs may influence their acceptance among technology enthusiasts to a significant degree. In this context, this study investigates the effects of perceived advantage, perceived risk, and perceived safety on the intention to use autonomous vehicles. For this purpose, data were collected from vehicle users living in Turkey by survey method. Secondly, factor analyses and regression analyses were performed with the data set obtained from 611 participants. As a result of the analyses, it has been determined that the perceived advantage and perceived security increase the intention to use autonomous vehicles. In contrast, the perceived risk reduces this intention to use. According to these results, recommendations were made to the companies about the level of acceptance of this technology by the users to assess their investments in autonomous vehicles better.

AB Trajectory tracking is an important aspect of autonomous vehicles. The idea behind trajectory tracking is the ability of the vehicle to follow a predefined path with zero steady state error. The difficulty arises due to the nonlinearity of vehicle dynamics. Therefore, this paper proposes a stable tracking control for an autonomous vehicle. An approach that consists of steering wheel control and lateral control is introduced. This control algorithm is used for a non-holonomic navigation problem, namely tracking a reference trajectory in a closed loop form. A proposed future prediction point control algorithm is used to calculate the vehicle's lateral error in order to improve the performance of the trajectory tracking. A feedback sensor signal from the steering wheel angle and yaw rate sensor is used as feedback information for the controller. The controller consists of a relationship between the future point lateral error, the linear velocity, the heading error and the reference yaw rate. This paper also introduces a spike detection algorithm to track the spike error that occurs during GPS reading. The proposed idea is to take the advantage of the derivative of the steering rate. This paper aims to tackle the lateral error problem by applying the steering control law to the vehicle, and proposes a new path tracking control method by considering the future coordinate of the vehicle and the future estimated lateral error. The effectiveness of the proposed controller is demonstrated by a simulation and a GPS experiment with noisy data. The approach used in this paper is not limited to autonomous vehicles alone since the concept of autonomous vehicle tracking can be used in mobile robot platforms, as the kinematic model of these two platforms is similar.

AB This paper presents a novel modeling method for the control design of autonomous vehicle systems. The goal of the method is to provide a control-oriented model in a predefined Linear Parameter Varying (LPV) structure. The scheduling variables of the LPV model through machine-learning-based methods using a big dataset are selected. Moreover, the LPV model parameters through an optimization algorithm are computed, with which accurate fitting on the dataset is achieved. The proposed method is illustrated on the nonlinear modeling of the lateral vehicle dynamics. The resulting LPV-based vehicle model is used for the control design of path following functionality of autonomous vehicles. The effectiveness of the modeling and control design methods through comprehensive simulation examples based on a high-fidelity simulation software are illustrated.

AB Navigating roundabouts is a complex driving scenario for both manual and autonomous vehicles. This paper proposes an approach based on the use of the Q-learning algorithm to train an autonomous vehicle agent to learn how to appropriately navigate roundabouts. The proposed learning algorithm is implemented using the CARLA simulation environment. Several simulations are performed to train the algorithm in two scenarios: navigating a roundabout with and without surrounding traffic. The results illustrate that the Q-learning-algorithm-based vehicle agent is able to learn smooth and efficient driving to perform maneuvers within roundabouts.

AB The thermocline plays a key role in underwater acoustics and marine ecology. In oceanographic surveys, it is often desirable to detect the thermocline and track its spatio-temporal variation. Mobility of an autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) makes it an efficient platform for thermocline tracking. In this paper, we present an autonomous algorithm for detecting and tracking the thermocline by an AUV. The key is detection and close tracking of the maximum vertical gradient of temperature. On August 31 and September 1, 2010, the Tethys AUV ran the algorithm to closely track the thermocline across a sharp temperature front in Monterey Bay, CA.

AB This study examines the impacts of cooperative adaptive cruise control (CACC) and cooperative lane changing (CLC) on the delay and the riding comfort in autonomous car-autonomous truck (AC-AT) mixed traffic at a freeway merging area. For this task, AC-AT mixed traffic on a 5.25 km section of freeway was analyzed using the Aimsun Next microscopic traffic simulation. The effects of different CACC parameters and CLC on the average speed and acceleration distributions as the measures of delay and riding comfort, respectively, were evaluated. It was found that (1) lower sensitivity to the lead vehicle reduced the merging time, (2) shorter time gaps between autonomous vehicles and between platoons decreased the delay, and (3) longer time gaps reduced the delay at higher percentage of ATs. These results demonstrate that the delay of AC-AT mixed traffic at a freeway merging area can be reduced and riding comfort can be increased by adjusting CACC parameters.

AB This study develops an autonomous vehicle control method that enables it to perform a drift maneuver which is an expert driving technique consisting of sliding the rear wheel intentionally for fast cornering. By developing an autonomous control algorithm for such an agile maneuver, the safety of the future autonomous vehicle on extreme conditions such as slippery road, will be increased. Drift equilibrium states are derived to find the suitable feedforward control input for the scale car to enter the drifting region. In addition, a feedback controller is designed based on the linear quadratic regulator method in order to track the circular trajectory and maintain drift equilibrium states. To validate the performance of the developed control algorithm a 1:10 scale car experimental platform is developed with on-board control and sensor system. The feasibility of the developed method for the autonomous vehicle is confirmed through both simulation and experiments following circular trajectories while maintaining the desired equilibrium states.

AB Automated driving is expected to enormously evolve the transportation industry and ecosystems. Advancement in communications and sensor technologies have further accelerated the realization process of the autonomous driving goals. There are a number of autonomous driving initiatives around the world with varying objectives and scope, e.g. vehicle perception in a controlled environment or highway settings. Autonomous driving in a more complex environment with mixed traffic poses major challenges. The solutions for such environments is the focus of this paper. We start with a quick overview of current autonomous driving development activities worldwide. We then discuss the solution concept for autonomous driving in urban environments and its enabling components, e.g. road digitization and flexible communication infrastructure, to realize an urban autonomous driving testbed. We highlight the major challenges hindering the realization use-cases of Level 5 autonomous driving. Solution sketches to address these or similar changes are briefly discussed. We also implement some elements of the solution approaches on the real test-road. We demonstrate an artificial intelligence based approach for the analysis of real traffic data measured on the testbed. We implement approaches for predicting the network resource demands and allocation, which are crucial for realizing the use-cases of autonomous driving in complex environments. For the experiments, real data from the test-road is used. Results show that traffic patterns and resource demands are predicted accurately. These experiments are expected to instrumental for realizing other use-cases of autonomous driving.

AB This research aims to develop a novel method for recognizing the shape of an object located behind thin medium utilizing combination of ultrasonic sensor signal and edge detection technique. This system is extensively designed so that it can be easily mounted on a surveillance autonomous ground vehicle and is robust for operating in a hazardous environment. Once the autonomous ground vehicle reaches near the hidden objects, the proposed ultrasonic sensor system will identify shapes of the objects. Generally, the number of different sensors mounted on the robot and the number of tasks related to navigation, exploration and detection operation make the design of the autonomous ground vehicle control system very complex. The proposed ultrasonic sensing system for an autonomous ground vehicle provides two-dimensional shape information with low computational cost and will not add significant computational burden to the autonomous ground vehicle's overall control system. At first, a mathematical model for the ultrasonic sensor is created to find the relationships between the attenuation coefficient, the transmission coefficient, the thickness of the medium and ultrasonic wavelength. The mathematical model is followed by numerical simulation to establish several design parameters. Finally, a prototype for the proposed shape detection system is developed using the kHz range off-the-shelf ultrasonic sensors and edge detection technique. Experimental results confirmed that the accuracy of the proposed mathematical model and shape of an object located behind a thin medium could be estimated successfully. It was concluded from the results that the developed novel method was useful for identifying objects located behind thin media and this will help in conducting the further development of research for surveillance and rescue operation using the autonomous ground vehicle.

AB There are activities in viticulture and mariculture that require extreme physical endurance from human workers, making them prime candidates for automation and robotization. This paper presents a novel, practical, heterogeneous, autonomous robotic system divided into two main parts, each dealing with respective scenarios in viticulture and mariculture. The robotic components and the subsystems that enable collaboration were developed as part of the ongoing HEKTOR project, and each specific scenario is presented. In viticulture, this includes vineyard surveillance, spraying and suckering with an all-terrain mobile manipulator (ATMM) and a lightweight autonomous aerial robot (LAAR) that can be used in very steep vineyards where other mechanization fails. In mariculture, scenarios include coordinated aerial and subsurface monitoring of fish net pens using the LAAR, an autonomous surface vehicle (ASV), and a remotely operated underwater vehicle (ROV). All robotic components communicate and coordinate their actions through the Robot Operating System (ROS). Field tests demonstrate the great capabilities of the HEKTOR system for the fully autonomous execution of very strenuous and hazardous work in viticulture and mariculture, while meeting the necessary conditions for the required quality and quantity of the work performed.

AB Automated driving functions are expected to increase both the safety and ride comfort of future vehicles. Ensuring their functional safety and optimizing their performance requires thorough testing. Costs and duration of tests can be reduced if more tests can be performed numerically in a feasible simulation framework. This simulation setup must include all subsystems of the autonomous vehicle, which significantly interact with the system under test. In this paper, a modular model chain is presented, which is developed for testing systems with an impact on vehicle motion. It includes trajectory planning, motion control, and a model of the vehicle dynamics in a closed loop. Each subsystem can easily be exchanged to adapt the model chain with respect to the simulation objectives. As a use case, the testing of an active suspension control system is discussed. It is designed directly for use in autonomous cars and uses inputs from the vehicle motion planning subsystem for planning the suspension actuator motion. Using the presented closed-loop model chain, the effect of different actuator control strategies on ride comfort is compared, such as curve tilting. Furthermore, the impact of the active suspension system on lateral vehicle motion is shown.

AB Pedestrian trajectory prediction is essential for collision avoidance in autonomous driving, which can help autonomous vehicles have a better understanding of traffic environment and perform tasks such as risk assessment in advance. In this paper, pedestrian path prediction at a time horizon of 2s for autonomous driving is systematically investigated using waiting/crossing decision model (W/CDM) and modified social force model (MSFM), and the possible conflict between pedestrians and straight-going vehicles at an un-signalized crosswalk is focused on. First of all, a W/CDM is efficiently developed to judge pedestrians' waiting/crossing intentions when a straight-going vehicle is approaching. Then the humanoid micro-dynamic MSFM of pedestrians who have been judged to cross is characterized by taking into account the evasion with conflicting pedestrians, the collision avoidance with straight-going vehicles, and the reaction to crosswalk boundary. The influence of pedestrian heterogeneous characteristics is considered for the first time. Moreover, aerial video data of pedestrians and vehicles at an un-signalized crosswalk is collected and analyzed for model calibration. Maximum likelihood estimation (MLE) is proposed to calibrate the non-measurable parameters of the proposed models. Finally, the model validation is conducted with two cases by comparing with the existing methods. The result reveals that the integrated method (W/CDM-MSFM) outperforms the existing methods and accurately predicts the path of pedestrians, which can give us great confidence to use the current method to predict the path of pedestrian for autonomous driving with significant accuracy and highly improve pedestrian safety.

AB This article introduces an accurate, robust, and efficient direct yaw-moment control (DYC) architecture for four-wheel independently actuated (FWIA) autonomous vehicles via the nonsingular terminal sliding mode (NTSM) control method. To improve the DYC performance of FWIA autonomous vehicles for path tracking under critical maneuvers, a more accurate vehicle lateral dynamics model that considers the tire nonlinear mechanics under combined conditions is established first. On this basis, a method based on phase plane theory is introduced to analyze the vehicle lateral stability, and the two optimal external yaw moments are calculated by using the NTSM control algorithm that takes the reference yaw rate and the reference sideslip angle as the control objectives, respectively. Then, the external yaw moment finally applied to the vehicle is the weighting of the two calculated values, and the weight coefficient is optimized in real time by the particle swarm optimization method according to the vehicle lateral instability analysis results. A real-time and fast torque distribution method is further proposed to achieve the target yaw moment, in which the tire force saturations, the adaptive weight coefficient of each wheel, and the partial derivative of the target function are involved. Simulation results are, finally, provided to verify the effectiveness of the proposed controller in improving the lateral stability of FWIA autonomous vehicles for path tracking under four extreme conditions and eliminating the steady errors of the vehicle target yaw rate and sideslip angle.

AB Recent advances in vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) communication technologies enable autonomous vehicle platoons to better utilize the information of other members in the platoon to achieve the desired longitudinal intervehicular spacing specifications. However, most existing studies adopt a fixed time headway h(w), and do not take into account the effects of V2V communication delay on the desired design specifications for the platoons. Moreover, for stability analysis, the commonly adopted Routh-Hurwitz approach usually needs a lot of computation time, which will significantly reduce the efficiency and flexibility of the platoons in real-time applications. In order to overcome the aforementioned issues with the existing results on autonomous vehicle platoons, this paper investigates the robust control and optimization problem for a platoon of autonomous and connected vehicles subject to V2V communication delay and uncertain parasitic actuation lag under a constant time headway policy (CTHP). First, by employing the Pade approximation approach, the spacing error propagation transfer function, from the preceding vehicle to the following vehicle, under immediate predecessor's acceleration, velocity, and position feedback control mechanism is derived. In addition, in order to improve the computation efficiency, a signature method is utilized for the Hurwitz stability analysis. Then the string stability analysis for attenuating the spacing propagation error along the platoon is performed. Both lower and upper bounds for the time headway h(w) as well as the admissible sets for controller gains are achieved for Hurwitz stability and string stability. Comparative simulation results are finally provided to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed design scheme. (C) 2021 American Society of Civil Engineers.

ID LANES
AB Autonomous vehicle merging schemes require a central control or a complex communication system between the vehicles. We suggest an alternative local traffic control method based on distance sensors and roadside units which provides the vehicles with the desired gap profile without the need for vehicle-to-vehicle communication. The gap profile aims to open gaps between the vehicles before an upcoming junction. To explore the profiles' governing parameters, 140,000 simulation cases with varying conditions were run. Results show that, for a speed limit of 100 km/h and high inlet density (of 1-1.5 s between vehicles), the best strategy with respect to flow and merging percentage (of similar to 90%) is to use early gapping and platoon merging using linear profiles with long stabilization sections (>0.6 km). Moreover, the gapping process should start when the vehicle ahead attains a velocity of 75 km/h. In this way, fluent traffic can be sustained without perpetuating upstream traffic jams.

AB Autonomous underwater vehicle with the ability to generate electricity is an effective solution for detecting the ocean. In this article, a vertical-axis current generator for underwater vehicle is designed. The blades used for power generation are attached to the surface of the underwater vehicle and can be freely deployed and closed so as not to affect the fluid performance of the underwater vehicle. Comparing the experimental data of an ordinary impeller with simulation data, the initial error of the experiment is obtained. Through the experimental method with adjusting the spread angle and blade curvature, the best configuration of the impeller was eventually obtained. When the radian and expansion angle are both set to 120 degrees, the maximum power of 0.599 W can be provided.

AB Reliable object detection using cameras plays a crucial role in enabling autonomous vehicles to perceive their surroundings. However, existing camera-based object detection approaches for autonomous driving lack the ability to provide comprehensive feedback on detection performance for individual frames. To address this limitation, we propose a novel evaluation metric, named as the detection quality index (DQI), which assesses the performance of camera-based object detection algorithms and provides frame-by-frame feedback on detection quality. The DQI is generated by combining the intensity of the fine-grained saliency map with the output results of the object detection algorithm. Additionally, we have developed a superpixel-based attention network (SPA-NET) that utilizes raw image pixels and superpixels as input to predict the proposed DQI evaluation metric. To validate our approach, we conducted experiments on three open-source datasets. The results demonstrate that the proposed evaluation metric accurately assesses the detection quality of camera-based systems in autonomous driving environments. Furthermore, the proposed SPA-NET outperforms other popular image-based quality regression models. This highlights the effectiveness of the DQI in evaluating a camera's ability to perceive visual scenes. Overall, our work introduces a valuable self-evaluation tool for camera-based object detection in autonomous vehicles.

The conceptual design of the vehicle, its physical realization, and the results of both preliminary testing and the final competition are presented. The initial configuration of a stereoscopic vision system and navigation algorithm is explored through testing in a controlled environment. With this approach, the vehicle is shown to be capable of navigating through various courses of colored buoys; approximately 25% of the attempts result in successful navigation of all buoy pairs while 75% of the attempts result in successful navigation of half the buoy pairs or more.

ID ADAPTIVE CRUISE CONTROL; CONGESTION
AB The dramatic progress of Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS) has made autodriving technology extensively emphasised. Various models have been developed for the aim of modelling the behaviour of autonomous vehicles and their impacts on traffic, although there is still a lot to be researched about the technology. There are three main features that need to be represented in any car-following model to enable it to model autonomous vehicles: desired time gap, collision avoidance system and sensor detection range. Most available car-following models satisfy the first feature, most of the available car-following models do not satisfy the second feature and only few models satisfy the third feature. Therefore, conclusions from such models must be taken cautiously. Any of these models could be considered for updating to include a collision avoidance-system module, in order to be able to model autonomous vehicles. The Helly model is car-following model that has a simple structure and is sometimes used as the controller for Autonomous Vehicles (AV), but it does not have a collision avoidance concept. In this paper, the Helly model, which is a very commonly used classic car-following model is assessed and examined for possible update for the purpose of using it to model autonomous vehicles more efficiently. This involves assessing the parameters of the model and investigating the possible update of the model to include a collision avoidance-system module. There are two procedures that have been investigated in this paper to assess the Helly model to allow for a more realistic modelling of autonomous vehicles. The first technique is to investigate and assess the values of the parameters of the model. The second procedure is to modify the formula of that model to include a collision avoidance system. The results show that the performance of the modified full-range Auto Cruising Control (FACC) Helly model is superior to the other models in almost all situations and for almost all time-gap settings. Only the Alexandros E. Papacharalampous's Model (A.E.P.) controller seems to perform slightly better than the (FACC) Helly model. Therefore, it is reasonable to suggest that the (FACC) Helly model be recommended as the most accurate model to use to represent autonomous vehicles in microsimulations, and that it should be further investigated.

AB In recent years, the privacy issue in Vehicular Edge Computing (VEC) has gained a lot of concern. The privacy problem is even more severe in autonomous driving business than the other businesses in VEC such as ordinary navigation. Federated learning (FL), which is a privacy-preserved strategy proposed by Google, has become a hot trend to solve the privacy problem in many fields including VEC. Therefore, we introduce FL into autonomous driving to preserve vehicular privacy by keeping original data in a local vehicle and sharing the training model parameter only with the help of MEC server. Moreover, different from the common assumption of honest MEC server and honest vehicle in former studies, we take the malicious MEC servers and malicious vehicles into account. First, we consider honest-hut-curious MEC server and malicious vehicles and propose a traceable identity-based privacy preserving scheme to protect the vehicular message privacy where improved Dijk-Gentry-Halevi-Vaikutanathan (DGHV) algorithm is proposed and a blockchain-based Reputation-based Incentive Autonomous Driving Mechanism (RIADM) is adopted. Further, when the case comes to the non-credibility of both parties where semi-honest. MEC server and malicious vehicles are considered, we propose an anonymous identity-based privacy preserving scheme to protect the identity privacy of vehicles with Zero-Knowledge Proof (ZKP). Based on the simulation of virtual autonomous driving based on real-world road images, it is verified that our proposes scheme can reduce 73.7 % training loss of autonomous driving, increase the accuracy to around 5.55 % while keeps effective privacy of message and identity under the threat of dishonest MEC server and vehicles.

AB Industry 4.0 leads to a strong digitalization of industrial processes, but also a significant increase in communication and cooperation between the machines that make it up. This is the case with autonomous industrial vehicles (AIVs) and other cooperative mobile robots which are multiplying in factories, often in the form of fleets of vehicles, and whose intelligence and autonomy are increasing. While the autonomy of autonomous vehicles has been well characterized in the field of road and road transport, this is not the case for the autonomous vehicles used in industry. The establishment and deployment of AIV fleets raises several challenges, all of which depend on the actual level of autonomy of the AIVs: acceptance by employees, vehicle location, traffic fluidity, collision detection, or vehicle perception of changing environments. Thus, simulation serves to account for the constraints and requirements formulated by the manufacturers and future users of AIVs. In this paper, after having proposed a broad state of the art on the problems to be solved in order to simulate AIVs before proceeding to experiments in real conditions, we present a method to estimate positions of AIVs moving in a closed industrial environment, the extension of a collision detection algorithm to deal with the obstacle avoidance issue, and the development of an agent-based simulation platform for simulating these two methods and algorithms. The resulting/final/subsequent simulation will allow us to experiment in real conditions.

AB This paper addresses the novel design of an underwater manipulator with a lightweight multilink structure and its free-floating autonomous operation. The concept design reduces the coupling between the manipulator and the vehicle efficiently, even in the case where the vehicle weight in air is not significantly greater than the manipulator weight. The specific implementation of the mechanical structure is elaborated. Moreover, a closed-loop control system based on binocular vision is proposed for underwater manipulation. In the end, experimental results demonstrate that the conceived underwater manipulator can accomplish the autonomous operation quickly.

AB The megatrends of individualization and sharing will dramatically change our consumer behavior. The needs of a product's users will be central input for its development. Current development processes are not suitable for this product development; thus, we propose a combination of a genetic algorithm and a fuzzy system for user-centered development. We execute our new methodological approach on the example of autonomous vehicle concepts to demonstrate its implementation and functionality. The genetic algorithm minimizes the required number of vehicle concepts to satisfy the mobility needs of a user group, and the fuzzy system transfers user needs into vehicle-related properties, which are currently input for vehicle concept development. To present this method, we use a typical family and their potential mobility behavior. Our method optimizes their minimal number of vehicle concepts to satisfy all mobility needs and derives the properties of the vehicle concepts. By integrating our method into the entire vehicle concept development process, autonomous vehicles can be designed user-centered in the context of the megatrends of individualization and sharing. In summary, our method enables us to derive an optimized number of products for qualitatively described, heterogeneous user needs and determine their product-related properties.

DE Takagi-Sugeno LPV design; traffic control; autonomous vehicles
AB The paper proposes a strategy to control heterogeneous traffic flow which contains both autonomous and human-driven vehicles. The purpose of the control strategy is to consider differences in the longitudinal driving characteristics of autonomous and human-driven vehicles. In the paper the modeling of the heterogeneous traffic flow based on the results of the VISSIM traffic simulator is presented. The traffic model yielded is in a Linear Parameter-Varying (LPV) form. The control design is based on the Takagi-Sugeno methodology, in which the performances, the constraints of the ramp-controlled interventions and the uncertainties are incorporated. The design task leads to an optimization with Linear Matrix Inequality (LMI) constraints. The result of the method is the optimal intervention of the freeway ramps with which traffic inflow can be controlled.

ID FRAMEWORK
AB Accurate behavior anticipation is essential for autonomous vehicles when navigating in close proximity to other vehicles, pedestrians, and cyclists. Thanks to the recent advances in deep learning and inverse reinforcement learning (IRL), we observe a tremendous opportunity to address this need, which was once believed impossible given the complex nature of human decision making. In this article, we summarize the importance of accurate behavior modeling in autonomous driving and analyze the key approaches and major progress that researchers have made, focusing on the potential of deep IRL (D-IRL) to overcome the limitations of previous techniques. We provide quantitative and qualitative evaluations substantiating these observations. Although the field of D-IRL has seen recent successes, its application to model behavior in autonomous driving is largely unexplored. As such, we conclude this article by summarizing the exciting pathways for future breakthroughs.

AB In this paper, a three-level decision-making framework is developed to generate safe and effective decisions for autonomous vehicles (AVs). A key component in this decision framework is a normal-form game to capture the interactions between the ego vehicle and its surrounding vehicles. The payoffs in the normal-form game are designed to capture both safety reward and the reward gained by obeying (or the price paid by violating) ``soft'' traffic rules, e.g., first-come-first-go. This game formulation enables the ego to 1) make appropriate decisions considering the payoffs and possible actions of its surrounding vehicles, and 2) take intelligent actions in emergencies that may sacrifice some soft traffic rules to ensure safety. Moreover, we introduce parameters in the payoff matrix to tune the ego vehicle's behavior, e.g., aggressiveness level. A neural network is developed to learn the tuning parameters via supervised learning. In addition, to enable the ego to respond timely to different surrounding vehicles' driving styles, driving style characterization is incorporated into the payoff design for the normal-form game. Simulation studies are conducted to demonstrate the performance of the developed algorithms in two-vehicle intersection-crossing and lane-changing scenarios.

One example is the use of autonomous underwater vehicles to perform ocean surveys, and within this group, autonomous underwater gliders have made their mark. Gliders enable the-scientist to make extended complex studies on topics such as the effect of metals, pesticides, and nutrients on fish abundance, reproductive success, and ability to feed or on contaminants such as chemicals or biological toxins that are transported in particulate form and may become incorporated into living organisms (plankton, bivalves, and fish) or become deposited in bottom sediments. With these vehicles, the scientist or environmentalist can detect hazardous substances in the ocean such as chemicals from an oil spill or toxic algae such as red tide.

ID ADAPTIVE CRUISE CONTROL; STABILITY; SYSTEMS; PATH; FLOW
AB Up-to-date information wirelessly communicated among vehicles can be used to select the optimal route between a given origin and destination. To elucidate how to make use of such information, simulations are performed for autonomous vehicles traveling on a square lattice of roads. All the possible routes between the origin and the destination (without backtracking) are of the same length. Congestion is the only determinant of delay. At each intersection, right-of-way is given to the closest vehicle. There are no traffic lights. Trip times of a subject vehicle are recorded for various initial conditions using different routing algorithms. Surprisingly, the simplest algorithm, which is based on the total number of vehicles on a route, is as good as one based on computing travel times from the average velocity of vehicles on each road segment.

ID COLLISION RISK-ASSESSMENT
AB Automated and autonomous vehicles are often required to operate in complex road environments with potential hazards that may lead to hazardous events causing injury or even death. Therefore, a reliable autonomous hazardous event detection system is a key enabler for highly autonomous vehicles (e.g., Level 4 and 5 autonomous vehicles) to operate without human supervision for significant periods of time. One promising solution to the problem is the use of graph-based methods that are powerful tools for relational reasoning. Using graphs to organise heterogeneous knowledge about the operational environment, link scene entities (e.g., road users, static objects, traffic rules) and describe how they affect each other. Due to a growing interest and opportunity presented by graph-based methods for autonomous hazardous event detection, this paper provides a comprehensive review of the state-of-the-art graph-based methods that we categorise as rule-based, probabilistic, and machine learning-driven. Additionally, we present an in-depth overview of the available datasets to facilitate hazardous event training and evaluation metrics to assess model performance. In doing so, we aim to provide a thorough overview and insight into the key research opportunities and open challenges.

AB In an avoidable harmful situation, autonomous vehicles systems are expected to choose the course of action that causes the less damage to everybody. However, this behavioral protocol implies some predictability. In this context, we show that if the autonomous vehicle decision process is perfectly known then malicious, opportunistic, terrorist, criminal and non-civic individuals may have incentives to manipulate it. Consequently, some levels of uncertainty are necessary for the system to be manipulation proof. Uncertainty removes the mis-behavior incentives because it increases the risk and likelihood of unsuccessful manipulation. However, uncertainty may also decrease the quality of the decision process with negative impact in terms of efficiency and welfare for the society. We also discuss other possible solutions to this problem.

AB Real-time, precise and low-cost vehicular positioning systems associated with global continuous coordinates are needed for path planning and motion control in autonomous vehicles. However, existing positioning systems do not perform well in urban canyons, tunnels and indoor parking lots. To address this issue, this paper proposes a multi-sensor positioning system that combines a global positioning system (GPS), a camera and in-vehicle sensors assisted by kinematic and dynamic vehicle models. First, the system eliminates image blurring and removes false feature correspondences to ensure the local accuracy and stability of the visual simultaneous localisation and mapping (SLAM) algorithm. Next, the global GPS coordinates are transferred to a local coordinate system that is consistent with the visual SLAM process, and the GPS and visual SLAM tracks are calibrated with the improved weighted iterative closest point and least absolute deviation methods. Finally, an inverse coordinate system conversion is conducted to obtain the position in the global coordinate system. To improve the positioning accuracy, information from the in-vehicle sensors is fused with the interacting multiple-model extended Kalman filter based on kinematic and dynamic vehicle models. The developed algorithm was verified via intensive simulations and evaluated through experiments using KITTI benchmarks (A project of Karlsruhe Institute of Technology and Toyota Technological Institute at Chicago) and data captured using our autonomous vehicle platform. The results show that the proposed positioning system improves the accuracy and reliability of positioning in environments in which the Global Navigation Satellite System is not available. The developed system is suitable for the positioning and navigation of autonomous vehicles.

ID MODEL
AB Autonomous driving technology is divided into 0-5 levels. Of these, Level 5 is a fully autonomous vehicle that does not require a person to drive at all. The automobile industry has been trying to develop Level 5 to satisfy safety, but commercialization has not yet been achieved. In order to commercialize autonomous unmanned vehicles, there are several problems to be solved for driving safety. To solve one of these, this paper proposes 'A Deep Learning Part-diagnosis Platform(DLPP) based on an In-vehicle On-board gateway for an Autonomous Vehicle that diagnoses not only the parts of a vehicle and the sensors belonging to the parts, but also the influence upon other parts when a certain fault happens. The DLPP consists of an In-vehicle On-board gateway(IOG) and a Part Self-diagnosis Module(PSM). Though an existing vehicle gateway was used for the translation of messages happening in a vehicle, the IOG not only has the translation function of an existing gateway but also judges whether a fault happened in a sensor or parts by using a Loopback. The payloads which are used to judge a sensor as normal in the IOG is transferred to the PSM for self-diagnosis. The Part Self-diagnosis Module(PSM) diagnoses parts itself by using the payloads transferred from the IOG. Because the PSM is designed based on an LSTM algorithm, it diagnoses a vehicle's fault by considering the correlation between previous diagnosis result and current measured parts data.

AB This research aims to compare autonomous ground vehicles with conventional and electric vans on the basis of associated vehicle costs and benefits related to their use, taking into account economic feasibility. Cost per vehicle kilometre is derived using the total cost of ownership method adjusted with the inclusion of labour costs and the impact of solar panel application on fuel efficiency while travel time-related and capacity occupations and reliability benefits serve as a basis for the total possible number of parcels delivered. The results show that, under the current structural and infrastructural conditions of urban delivery, the experimental model can be potentially successful in terms of cost per kilometre (0.133/km) but not as effective in terms of the total possible number of parcels delivered. This study defines autonomous ground vehicles with lockers as an innovative last mile solution and contributes to the academic literature by investigating the concept's efficiency competitiveness.

DT Article
DE AI-based methods; autonomous agents; continual learning
AB Autonomous vehicles have become one of the most-awaited technologies of the century. In the recent years the advances in the area of deep learning and artificial intelligence enabled rapid development of the autonomous driving sector. Some car companies have already deployed autonomous driving software into their vehicles and millions of customers are using them. Although the autonomous driving modules are typically extensively tested prior to its release on the market, the customers can either still encounter certain previously overlooked failure cases or identify missing functionalities of the model. In this letter we focus on developing the methodology for repairing the deep neural network (DNN) steering the self-driving vehicle in response to these two scenarios via patching such that the following conditions are satisfied: i) the patch is added on the top of the original DNN to extend or fix its functionality for the particular failure case, ii) the patched model keeps the original functionalities of the DNN unchanged, and iii) the size of the patch is significantly smaller than the size of the original DNN. Our approach avoids training and evaluating the network from the scratch to improve or fix it, effectively enabling fast response of the autonomous vehicle manufacturers to the customer needs. We demonstrate the plausibility of the proposed approach on the task of autonomous driving in the Carla simulator A. Dosovitskiy et al.

The proposed design is able to memorize a route based on Global Positioning System (GPS) rather than using pre-saved maps that are infrequently updated and do not include all roads of all countries. Moreover, it can autonomously avoid obstacles and detect bumps. Experimental tests are conducted using a small-scale car equipped with the proposed mechatronics system. The results show that the proposed system operates with minor errors and slips. The proposed autonomous vehicle can serve normal, disabled, and elderly people. It can be used on roads and even inside facilities like campuses, airports, and factories to transport passengers or loads thus reducing workmanship and costs.

AB We introduce a distributed control method for coordinating multiple vehicles in the framework of an automated valet parking (AVP) system. The control functionality is distributed between an infrastructure server, called parking area management (PAM) system, and local autonomous vehicle control units. Via a vehicle-to-infrastructure (V2I) communication interface, model predictive control (MPC) decisions of the vehicles are shared with the coordination unit in the PAM. This unit in turn computes a coupling feedback which is shared with the vehicles. The control system is integrated in an automated test-system to cope with the high test requirements and short development cycles of highly automated systems. Evaluations conducted with the test-system show the functionality of the proposed distributed control method for multi-vehicle coordination. Results indicate safe coordination, and an efficiency increase compared to an uncoordinated method in an AVP simulation environment.

AB We describe a novel navigation sensor used for real-time navigation in which a position-sensitive detector is used. According to the features of the position-sensitive detector, the special floor mark stuck on the predefined path is developed. In addition, the formulas for the centroid position of the image of incident laser line on the position-sensitive detector, which is determined by the relative position between the floor mark and the navigation sensor, are derived. The navigation sensor, which can obtain proper navigation accuracy and controlling signal, navigates the autonomous guide vehicle running on the predefined path. It is suitable for application in autonomous guide vehicles and other automatic instruments. The experimental results are given.

TI Traffic Manager Development for a Roundabout Crossed by Autonomous and
   Connected Vehicles Using V2I Architecture
SO SUSTAINABILITY
LA English
DT Article
DE roundabout; autonomous vehicle; zone booking; CSU; V2I; CBVC
AB Connected Autonomous Vehicle (CAV) is considered as a proposal toward sustainable mobility. In order to succeed in a sustainable mobility solution, "CAV" or more precisely "CAV Transport System" should prove to be low energy, safe, and allow better performances than human-driven vehicles. This paper will propose a system architecture for a sustainable CAV Transport System on a standard scenario: crossing a roundabout. Nowadays, roundabouts are very common and practical crossing alternatives to improve the traffic flow and increase safety. This study aims to simulate and analyze the behavior of connected autonomous vehicles crossing a roundabout using a V2I (vehicle-to-infrastructure) architecture. The vehicles are exchanging information with a so-called central signaling unit. All vehicles are exchanging their position, speed, and target destination. The central signaling unit has a global view of the system compared to each ego vehicle (has more local than global information); thus, can safely and efficiently manage the traffic of the vehicles in the roundabout using a standard signaling block strategy. This strategy of decision of the central signaling unit (CSU) is performed by dividing the roundabout into several zones/blocks which can be booked by only one vehicle at a time. A solver, reproducing a vehicle's behavior and dynamics, computes the trajectory and velocity of each vehicle depending on its surroundings. Finally, a graphical representation is used and implemented to facilitate the analysis and visualization of the roundabout crossing. The vehicle flow performance of the developed traffic control model is compared with SUMO.

DE Autonomous vehicles; Optimization; Heuristic
ID OPTIMIZATION
AB Roads intersections are one of the main causes of traffic jams since vehicles need to stop and wait for their time to go. Scenarios that only consider autonomous vehicles can minimize this problem using intelligent systems that manage the time when each vehicle will pass across the intersection. This paper proposes a mathematical model and a heuristic that optimize this management. The efficiency of this approach is demonstrated using traffic simulations, with scenarios of different complexities, and metrics representing the arrival time, CO2 emission and fuel consumption. The results show that the present approach is scalable, maintaining its performance even in complex real scenarios. Moreover, its execution time is maintained in milliseconds, what suggests this approach as a candidate for dealing with real-time and dynamic scenarios.

AB Conventional rigid machines, even biological systems in nature, generally do not own the capabilities like autonomous convergence or divergence. Here, such extraordinary behavior was demonstrated for the first time with the liquid metal vehicle. This synthetic soft machine fueled with an aluminum flake could initiate its autonomous locomotion in an open-top circular channel containing NaOH solution, like a running vehicle. If cutting a large machine into several smaller separately running vehicles, each of them still resumes its traveling state along the original track and chases each other. If the volumes of such dispersive vehicles were close to each other and they were all squeezed in the channel, the vehicles would move synchronously with oscillation. Otherwise, such self-motion would become desynchronized with interval between the inequable vehicles decreased gradually. If their volumes were significantly different, and the smaller vehicles were not squeezed in the channel, the faster vehicle would overtake the slower ones, until they finally coalesced seamlessly. The assembled vehicle could deform itself along with change of its velocity. This finding may shed light on future researches on smart material, fluid mechanics and soft matter to self-fueled machine and biomimics. It would also offer opportunities for constructing self-reconfigurable soft robots.

DE Autonomous aerial vehicle (AAV); fixedwing aircraft; sliding mode
   control (SMC); system identification
AB This paper proposes an autonomous system identification methodology for fixed wing autonomous aerial vehicles (AAVs) and implementation with a robust control technique. This system identification methodology does not require the user to provide any knowledge of the aerodynamic derivatives of the AAV. Hence, this control methodology is applicable to a wide range of fixed-wing AAVs. Since the system identification process generates errors due to the measurement noise and external disturbances, a robust control methodology, slidingmode control (SMC), is proposed to control the AAV based on the system identification results. To characterize the capability of the control methodology, experiments have been conducted on commercially available fixed-wing aircraft platforms using low-cost sensing equipment. Experimental results demonstrate that the autonomous system identification-based SMC enables the AAV to follow the desired trajectory without prior knowledge of the aerial vehicle or manual tuning of control system parameters.

We provide a brief survey of current deployed mobile autonomous systems and their capabilities (with a primary focus on the air domain but including other domains-underwater, ground, space, and surface-as well). We discuss techniques that are currently used for achieving resiliency and assurance in autonomous navigation, pointing out some of the shortcomings of these techniques. We describe techniques under development in the industry that aims to overcome these shortcomings by combining emerging approaches to resilient behavior with assured autonomous behavior constructs to yield reliable and mission-effective systems necessary to operate successfully in dynamic and adversarial environments. We briefly discuss ongoing efforts to develop multidomain standards that are designed to be applicable across these disparate vehicle domains.

AB In future real-time systems such as those required for intelligent autonomous vehicle control, we need flexibility in choosing the set of services to support under varying environmental conditions and system states. It is not feasible to make an optimal choice of services at run-time, so we propose a method of ranking the services pre-runtime, based on the 'utility' of each service. This paper focuses on the problem of calculating a 'value' for the utility of each service alternative. We show how to derive values systematically and rationally, using Measurement Theory and Decision Analysis. The approach relies on engineering judgement and data input by a domain expert. In the context of autonomous vehicles, we believe that such knowledge would be available, making 'value-based scheduling' a feasible approach.

Linear Parameter Varying (LPV) theory is used to model the dynamics of the vehicle and implement an LPV-Model Predictive Controller (LPV-MPC) that can be computed online with reduced computational cost. The optimal time problem is solved by an optimal off-line trajectory planner that calculates the best trajectory under the constraints of the circuit. An identification of the system model based on optimization is also carried out. The planning and control scheme is validated in simulation and experimentally in a real platform where the effectiveness of the proposed LPV-MPC is demonstrated.

AB Accurate localization is a critically important issue for autonomous vehicles as it is closely related to the safety and efficiency of autonomous driving. However, current technologies for autonomous vehicle localization face many challenges. To provide accurate and robust localization services to autonomous vehicles, we propose a novel solution by employing a newly designed pavement marking. This marking operates on color contrast, temperature contrast, and binary code with some special features. We also trained and customized an object detector based on a deep learning model: YOLOv5, and integrated it with the decoding algorithm. The localization system is capable of running at a steady frame rate of more than 50 FPS. Road trials up to 80 km/h were conducted, and satisfactory results confirmed the feasibility and robustness of the localization system. Specifically, with a common onboard camera, more than four continuous frames can be detected and decoded correctly when the speed is slower than 30 km/h. At least one frame can be detected and decoded correctly at a higher speed (i.e., 30 - 50 km/h). With a high-speed camera, more than 18 frames can be detected and decoded even at 80 km/h. The findings suggest that the specially designed road marking and associated algorithms can provide a viable and economical option for accurate localization of autonomous vehicles. The performance of the system has potentials for further improvement by using better hardware such as faster CPUs, GPUs, and thermal imaging techniques.

LA English

ID KALMAN FILTER; CORRECTION SCHEME
AB On-board sensory systems in autonomous vehicles make it possible to acquire information about the vehicle itself and about its relevant surroundings. With this information the vehicle actuators are able to follow the corresponding control commands and behave accordingly. Localization is thus a critical feature in autonomous driving to define trajectories to follow and enable maneuvers. Localization approaches using sensor data are mainly based on Bayes filters. Whitebox models that are used to this end use kinematics and vehicle parameters, such as wheel radii, to interfere the vehicle's movement. As a consequence, faulty vehicle parameters lead to poor localization results. On the other hand, blackbox models use motion data to model vehicle behavior without relying on vehicle parameters. Due to their high non-linearity, blackbox approaches outperform whitebox models but faulty behaviour such as overfitting is hardly identifiable without intensive experiments. In this paper, we extend blackbox models using kinematics, by inferring vehicle parameters and then transforming blackbox models into whitebox models. The probabilistic perspective of vehicle movement is extended using random variables representing vehicle parameters. We validated our approach, acquiring and analyzing simulated noisy movement data from mobile robots and vehicles. Results show that it is possible to estimate vehicle parameters with few kinematic assumptions.

AB Automatic lane-changing is a complex and critical task for autonomous vehicle control. Existing researches on autonomous vehicle technology mainly focus on avoiding obstacles; however, few studies have accounted for dynamic lane changing based on some certain assumptions, such as the lane-changing speed is constant or the terminal state is known in advance. In this study, a typical lane-changing scenario is developed with the consideration of preceding and lagging vehicles on the road. Based on the local trajectory generated by the global positioning system, a path planning model and a speed planning model are respectively established through the cubic polynomial interpolation. To guarantee the driving safety, passenger comfort and vehicle efficiency, a comprehensive trajectory optimization function is proposed according to the path planning model and speed planning model. In addition, a dynamic decoupling model is established to solve the problems of real-time application to provide viable solutions. The simulations and real vehicle validations are conducted, and the results highlight that the proposed method can generate a satisfactory lane-changing trajectory for automatic lane-changing actions.

AB In the path following process, once vehicle steering system fails, the common path following control system will not work properly, and even worse, the vehicle will be seriously deviated from the ideal path and the risk of vehicle instability will also increase. Reliable fault-tolerant control strategy can promote the autonomous vehicle to maintain stability and path following accuracy in case of failure. In this paper, a passive fault-tolerant path following control method of autonomous distributed drive electric vehicle is presented considering the vehicle steering system fault. The reduced-order Kalman filter is applied to estimate the vehicle sideslip angle and the vehicle steering system fault. The hierarchical control strategy was developed, and in the upper layer controller, the adaptive sliding mode control method is proposed to facilitate the fault-tolerant path following controller and used to improve the lateral stability and anti-roll performance of vehicle and ensure path following accuracy at the same time, using the estimated sideslip angle and steering system fault as inputs. In the lower layer controller, a novel adaptive orientated tire force allocation method is proposed to execute the control efforts of upper layer controller. The simulations are implemented in the CarSim-Simulink co-simulation platform, and the effectiveness of proposed fault-tolerant path following control method is verified.

AB In recent years, the research has focused firmly on Autonomous Aerial Vehicles (AAVs) owing to their vast array of potential applications, to aid those applications this study presents a technical approach for source localization and landing trajectory identification for Autonomous Aerial Vehicle (AAV) landing, leveraging computer vision and photogrammetry techniques. The proposed method aims to achieve accurate and robust localization of the landing target area and precise determination of the AAV's landing trajectory. The source localization module utilizes a computer vision system equipped with onboard cameras and advanced image processing algorithms. The system captures images of the target area and performs feature extraction and matching to estimate the position of the landing target. Additionally, the A* algorithm serves as a pivotal tool in deriving an optimized trajectory by harnessing the relative positions of the Autonomous Aerial Vehicle (AAV) and the designated landing target.

AB During the past two years, the Institute for Marine Technology Problem, Russian Academy of-Sciences, Far East Branch and the Autonomous Undersea Systems institute have undertaken a joint program 50 develop a Solar Powered Autonomous Underwater Vehicle (SAUV). This paper will describe some of the analyses that led to the design and implementation of the prototype vehicle. The vehicle system relies on the availability of solar energy and its performance depends on the effective utilization of that energy. Various strategies and algorithms to manage the acquired energy were investigated in detail. The results of this analysis and the design of a. solar AW testbed will be described. The vehicle design is greatly impacted by the necessity of integrating the solar array with the vehicle platform. This results in an unconventional vehicle shape which generates some unique dynamics problems. These will be discussed along with the characteristics of the onboard control system. The prototype vehicle will be described and the results of-in water field tests of the prototype system will be reported.

AB Autonomous vehicles require highly reliable navigation capabilities. For example, a lane-following method cannot be applied in an intersection without lanes, and since typical lane detection is performed using a straight-line model, errors can occur when the lateral distance is estimated in curved sections due to a model mismatch. Therefore, this paper proposes a localization method that uses GPS/DR error estimation based on a lane detection method with curved lane models, stop line detection, and curve matching in order to improve the performance during waypoint following procedures. The advantage of using the proposed method is that position information can be provided for autonomous driving through intersections, in sections with sharp curves, and in curved sections following a straight section. The proposed method was applied in autonomous vehicles at an experimental site to evaluate its performance, and the results indicate that the positioning achieved accuracy at the sub-meter level.

AB We provide a review of recent work on formal methods for autonomous driving. Formal methods have been traditionally used to specify and verify the behavior of computer programs and digital circuits. Enabled by abstraction techniques for dynamical systems and the availability of verification and synthesis tools for finite systems, they have been adopted by the control and robotics communities. In particular, in autonomous driving, recent research proposes formal languages such as temporal logics to specify driving behaviors ranging from safety, such as collision avoidance, to compliance with complex rules of the road. Our review focuses on formal verification, monitoring, and synthesis techniques enabling autonomous vehicles to adhere to such specifications. We only consider works about system-level methods that have an ego-centric perspective, i.e., we focus on the behavior of an autonomous vehicle in its entirety, rather than specific software code within the vehicle or traffic networks consisting of multiple vehicles. This paper also identifies the main remaining challenges. (c) 2022 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB This study investigated what information items should be presented to drivers in future autonomous vehicles by comparing how preferences regarding information differ from those in the current manual-driving environment. A survey of 29 in-vehicle information items was conducted among 156 participants, who drove a virtual indoor simulator in both manual- and autonomous-driving modes. In all, 29 items of in-vehicle information were classified into three tasks. The primary driving task had mobility as its core value, secondary driving tasks were activities that played supportive roles in vehicular movements (e.g., car accident notifications, wipers), and tertiary driving tasks included non-driving activities. The results indicated that drivers place less priority on receiving secondary task-related information and greater priority on tertiary driving task information in the autonomous mode of driving compared to the manual driving environment. Second, females have a higher preference for information in both modes of driving, whereas males demonstrated a higher incremental level for information in the autonomous environment. Third, older drivers and those in their 20s should be given the highest priority in information dissemination. This study is useful as it can provide a basic guideline for designers of user experiences and user interfaces.

AB Technological advances are bringing connected and autonomous vehicles (CAVs) to the ever-evolving transportation system. Anticipating public acceptance and adoption of these technologies is important. A recent internet-based survey polled 347 Austinites to understand their opinions on smart-car technologies and strategies. Results indicate that respondents perceive fewer crashes to be the primary benefit of autonomous vehicles (AVs), with equipment failure being their top concern. Their average willingness to pay (WTP) for adding full (Level 4) automation ($7253) appears to be much higher than that for adding partial (Level 3) automation ($3300) to their current vehicles.
   Ordered probit and other model specifications estimate the impact of demographics, built-environment variables, and travel characteristics on Austinites' WTP for adding various automation technologies and connectivity to their current and coming vehicles. It also estimates adoption rates of shared autonomous vehicles (SAVs) under different pricing scenarios ($1, $2, and $3 per mile), choice dependence on friends' and neighbors' adoption rates, and home-location decisions after AVs and SAVs become a common mode of transport. Higher-income, technology-savvy males, who live in urban areas, and those who have experienced more crashes have a greater interest in and higher WTP for the new technologies, with less dependence on others' adoption rates. Such behavioral models are useful to simulate long-term adoption of CAV technologies under different vehicle pricing and demographic scenarios. These results can be used to develop smarter transportation systems for more efficient and sustainable travel. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB There will be a complex driving environment formed by manned and unmanned vehicles with highly uncertain and dynamic interaction when autonomous vehicles enter actual traffic flow. Autonomous vehicles need to detect and analyze the movement of surrounding vehicles to make safe driving decisions. This paper proposes a Clustering Convolution-LSTM (CC-LSTM) vehicle trajectory prediction model. Using Fuzzy Clustering method, similar trajectories of surrounding vehicles are clustered to mine the temporal features of vehicles trajectory. The result is carried out to classify the features of historical trajectory by Density Clustering and find the similarity during segments which are used as the spatial features of target vehicles trajectory. The screened spatio-temporal features are fused by Las Vegas Wrapper (LVW) algorithm to obtain new input data of Convolution-LSTM network to make prediction. This model is trained by different features of data. Simulation shows that the CC-LSTM prediction model with surrounding vehicle interaction information and selected features can meet the real-time and accuracy requirements of prediction.

AB This article presents a coordinated vehicle-manipulator control method for an underwater biomimetic vehicle-manipulator system (UBVMS) to implement floating autonomous manipulation in practice. An algorithm framework composed of adaptive tracking differentiator (ATD), extended state observer (ESO), improved nonsingular terminal sliding-mode control (I-NTSMC), fuzzy-logic controller (FLC), and estimator of manipulator disturbances, is proposed. The ATD is designed to generate desired motion state and alleviate noise. The ESO is developed to estimate the motion state, systematic uncertainties, and external disturbances. The proposed I-NTSMC method assures the finite-time convergence of the system states and alleviate chattering. The estimation of the manipulator disturbances is incorporated into the control strategy to enhance the station keeping of the vehicle. Finally, underwater autonomous free floating manipulation experiments about opening a door and grasping objects are conducted to validate the theoretical results and confirm the feasibility of the proposed control strategy.

AB In this paper, we consider the problem of decentralized cohesive motion control of a formation of autonomous vehicles or robots moving in three dimensions, where the formation is required to move from its initial setting (defined by the positions of the agents in the formation) to a final desired setting and, during thismotion, maintain its formation geometry defined by the initial distances between the agent pairs. We propose a distributed control scheme to solve this problem utilizing the notions of graph rigidity and persistence as well as techniques of virtual target tracking and smooth switching. The distributed control scheme is developed by modeling the agent kinematics as single-velocity integrator; nevertheless, extension to the cases with practical kinematic and dynamic models of fixed-wing autonomous aerial vehicles and quadrotors is discussed. In this context, we examine the maintenance of geometric formation of a swarm of autonomous flight vehicles. The developed coordination and control schemes are verified via a number of simulations.

AB Autonomous decision making is a critical and difficult task for intelligent vehicles in dynamic transportation environments. In this paper, a reinforcement learning approach with value function approximation and feature learning is proposed for autonomous decision making of intelligent vehicles on highways. In the proposed approach, the sequential decision making problem for lane changing and overtaking is modeled as a Markov decision process with multiple goals, including safety, speediness, smoothness, etc. In order to learn optimized policies for autonomous decision-making, a multiobjective approximate policy iteration (MO-API) algorithm is presented. The features for value function approximation are learned in a data-driven way, where sparse kernel-based features or manifold-based features can be constructed based on data samples. Compared with previous RL algorithms such as multiobjective Q-learning, the MO-API approach uses data-driven feature representation for value and policy approximation so that better learning efficiency can be achieved. A highway simulation environment using a 14 degree-of-freedom vehicle dynamics model was established to generate training data and test the performance of different decision-making methods for intelligent vehicles on highways. The results illustrate the advantages of the proposed MO-API method under different traffic conditions. Furthermore, we also tested the learned decision policy on a real autonomous vehicle to implement overtaking decision and control under normal traffic on highways. The experimental results also demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.

AB For autonomous vehicle path tracking control, the general path tracking controllers usually only consider vehicle dynamics' constraints, without taking vehicle stability evaluation index into account. In this paper, a linear three-degree-of-freedom vehicle dynamics model is used as a predictive model. A comprehensive control method combining Model Predictive Control and Fuzzy proportional-integral-derivative control is proposed. Model Predictive Control is used to control the vehicle yaw stability and track the target path by considering the front wheel angle, sideslip angle, tire slip angles, and yaw rate during the path tracking. Fuzzy proportional-integral-derivative algorithm is adopted to maintain the vehicle roll stability by controlling the braking force of each tire. Co-simulation with CarSim and MATLAB/Simulink shows the designed controller has good tracking performance. The controller is smooth and effective and ensures handling stability in tracking the target path.

AB Rapid technological advances in artificial intelligence and additive manufacturing have fueled the speculation that large numbers of cheap autonomous robots swarming to achieve mission objectives with minimal human control will revolutionize search-and-rescue, disaster relief and humanitarian assistance operations. These kinds of operations usually occur in a GPS-denied and communication austere environment, where only nearest-neighbors networking among the autonomous robots may be possible. Hence, the ability to predict and control the real-time global dynamic behavior of this high-dimensional, highly complex and highly nonlinear, decentralized autonomous system, immersed in an uncertain and changing environment-and yet successfully performing at the edge of chaos-will be critical. This paper proposes a rigorous computational framework for prediction and control of a large-scale joint swarm of unmanned ground vehicles (UGVs) and unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), performing a joint autonomous land-air operation. We present two cases for this joint UGV + UAV swarm: (1) a discrete Hamiltonian dynamics and affine control over Euclidean groups of individual UGVs and UAVs in a swarm of hundreds of vehicles and (2) a continuous 2-soliton 'signature' evolution of a joint UGV and UAV swarm of thousands of vehicles.

AB Autonomous vehicles are expected to shape mobility and tourism. This paper introduces an extension to the TAM to better understand the adoption of self-driving cars for tourism purposes. The new model (TAMAT) confirms some under-explored impacts of tourism-related variables, such as Openness to Tourism Usage and Unusual Surroundings, and the Adherence to Conven-tional Use on the Intention to Use self-driving cars. The research is based on online data collection (n = 646) and applies Covariance-Based Structural Equation Modelling. Findings indicate that the opportunity of using self-driving cars for tourism and unusual environments has a positive impact, while adherence to conventional car use has a negative impact on the intention to use self-driving cars.

AB Situational awareness for industrial vehicles is crucial to ensure safety of personnel and equipment. While human drivers and onboard sensors are able to detect obstacles and pedestrians within line-of-sight, in complex environments, initially occluded or obscured dynamic objects can unpredictably enter the path of a vehicle. We propose a system that integrates a vision-based offboard pedestrian tracking subsystem with an onboard localization and navigation subsystem. This combination enables warnings to be communicated and effectively extends the vehicle controller's field of view to include areas that would otherwise be blind spots. A simple flashing light interface in the vehicle cabin provides a clear and intuitive interface to alert drivers of potential collisions. Alternatively, the system can be also applied to vehicles that have autonomous navigation capabilities, in which case, instead of alert lights, the vehicle is halted or redirected. We implemented and tested the proposed solution on an automated industrial vehicle under autonomous operation and on a human-driven vehicle in a full-scale production facility, over a period of four months.

AB Road vehicle steering automation is an essential part of any kind of application that involves autonomous driving or navigation. Vehicle manufacturers can perform this automatic control because they have access to the vehicle control unit and the internal communication bus. However, this solution involves knowledge of communication protocols and a certain electronic architecture. This paper presents a device able to control the steering of a road vehicle without necessity of the intervention of human drivers. This device can be installed in any kind of vehicle independently of the kind of assistance of the steering only by attaching a single mechanical coupling element between the device and the steering column. The architecture of the device also allows switching between manual and automatic control electronically at any moment. The developed device can be used to support any kind of Advanced Driver Assistance System that requires automatic steering control up to autonomous driving.

AB How to improve the velocity tracking accuracy is a core and difficult problem in autonomous driving, especially while some core parameters of the controlled vehicle cannot be measured or obtained accurately enough. Without employing a complex longitudinal dynamic model and some difficultly obtained engine parameters, a numerical reasonable model is established based on the off-line data of the vehicle motion. And based on this model, a feed-forward and feedback control scheme is presented and a parameter-varying controller with high robustness is designed. To verify the tracking performance, the electric vehicle model in Matlab2018b is used in the simulating process and results conclude that the new control strategy is very effective.

AB As inter-vehicle communication and automatic driving technology continue to develop, but are not yet popular, regular vehicles, connected vehicles and connected autonomous vehicles (CAVs) will coexist on the road for a long time. This mixed traffic environment highlights the need to theoretically analyze the impacts of some connected and autonomous technologies (i.e., accurate detection technology, inter-vehicle communication technology, data storage technology and inter-vehicle cooperation technology) on the stable operation of heterogeneous traffic. According to the characteristics of the vehicles equipped with different technologies, this paper extends the corresponding car-following models based on the optimal velocity model. Through these analytical models, these connected and autonomous technologies are quantified and the linear stability analyses are conducted. Numerical simulation shows that the inter-vehicle communication between three vehicles, and two previous time-step data storage or two future time-step intervehicle cooperation are sufficient to stabilize the mixed traffic. As CAV penetration rates increase, the stability of heterogeneous traffic is improved. Furthermore, the stability of heterogeneous traffic is weakened when the size of the largest single fleet increases. These theoretical results can serve as a quantitative tool for scholars and vehicle designers before drawing any qualitative conclusions of related technologies on heterogeneous fleet stability to avoid wasting resources such as data storage capacity and inter-vehicle communication ranges.

AB A distributed robust consensus of multiple autonomous underactuated surface vessels (AUSV) is studied in the presence of unknown environmental disturbances. The vehicles have 3 degrees of freedom and two actuators. Since the actuated and unactuated states of the vehicles are strongly coupled, first their kinematics and dynamics are transformed to a cascade non-linear system. Then, based on the properties of non-linear cascade systems, a state-based switching controller is proposed which guarantees the robust consensus of AUSVs. To illustrate the performance of the proposed consensus approach, simulation results are provided.

AB In this paper a combined open/closed-loop method for point stabilization of autonomous wheeled vehicles using feedback linearization technique is presented. For point stabilization of the vehicle in planar motion (the vehicle has 2 degrees of freedom), both position (in two directions) and orientation must be stabilized (approach their desired values).
   Here, we propose to apply feedback linearization and exponentially stabilize the position of the center of mass of the vehicle in curvilinear coordinates (closed-loop part) and the vehicle's orientation along a path that connects the initial and final positions with the corresponding desired orientations (open-loop part with bounded error).
   The vehicle used for illustration in this paper has one front (steering and driving) and two rear (idle) wheels and also a computer, two dc motors, two batteries and two measurement systems is an example of an autonomous ground vehicle. The dynamic model of this vehicle is presented in the state-space form with steering and driving torques as inputs.
   The results of the simulation and the experimental study of the proposed controller on this three-wheel vehicle as a prototype show that when the arc length coordinate of the position of the center of mass of the vehicle reaches its desired value, the vehicle stops at the desired position with the desired orientation with small acceptable errors proving the validity of the proposed method.

TI COVID-19 Along With Autonomous Vehicles Will Put an End to Rail Systems

SO IEEE INTELLIGENT TRANSPORTATION SYSTEMS MAGAZINE
LA English
DT Article
AB Even before the coronavirus (COVID-19) disease pandemic outbreak, the rail systems on islands turned out to be failures. The main concept of rail systems is to convey many people in one large means of transportation. However, on islands, the small area limits the ability of the train to go through a good path that can meet the need of a sufficient number of people. Therefore, the rail systems are unproductive. Moreover, in the near future, the trains will have tough competition with autonomous vehicles. Autonomous vehicles will go in platoons with a constant distance from the vehicle ahead, which will look like a long train. These autonomous vehicle trains will be much more efficient than the old-fashioned trains. COVID-19 influenced many passengers to leave the rails because the rails seem to be one of the most substantial disseminators of the virus. Train passenger numbers may perhaps rebound little by little following the COVID-19 crisis, but the looming technology of autonomous vehicles will be competition that is too tough for the rails, and such a passenger-numbers rebound is unlikely to succeed. Therefore, transportation authorities in isolated territories should refrain from investing in the infrastructures of rail systems.

AB This work addresses the design of a path tracking controller for autonomous vehicles. It reformulates the Reference Aware MPC in order to guarantee closed-loop stability, while maintaining a safe and comfortable ride, and minimizing wear and tear of vehicle components. Stability is proved via Lyapunov techniques. Furthermore, to adapt the response of the controller online while in operation, a novel model for the nonlinear curvature response of the vehicle is proposed. This model is estimated online by means of Kalman filtering. Both the proposed controller and curvature response model are evaluated with simulations and through experiments on a Scania construction truck, where the advantages to the previous state-of-the-art are highlighted and discussed.

AB Autonomous control of a robotic manipulator mounted on a submersible autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) is simulated with various strategies employing combinations of feedback and feedforward control. Feedforward compensation of the manipulator motion is accomplished using a model of the system kinematics and dynamics. Hydrodynamic effects including drag, buoyancy, and added mass, as well as the reaction of the vehicle, are all compensated. Effective manipulator position control is accomplished through stabilization of the vehicle orientation and system barycenter. Stabilization of the vehicle position using feedback and/or feedforward control is also considered for comparison. Compensation of the hydrodynamic effects while stabilizing the vehicle orientation and allowing vehicle translation resulted in a significant reduction in power consumption. Although experimental verification of the results is required, the improvement in efficiency may be beneficial for submersible vehicles operating in extremely remote conditions or extraterrestrial environments such as the oceans of Jupiter's moon, Europa.

AB Exploring the drift maneuver could extend the dynamic control envelope and application range of autonomous vehicles. This paper presents a novel autonomous drift controller for a distributed drive electric vehicle, whose configuration provides more possibilities for drift. In the upper-level controller, a control channel recombination method transforms the over-actuated system into a standard square system, which is compatible with the proposed fuzzy-integral sliding-mode controller considering the input coupling and uncertain disturbance of the system to bring the vehicle into a marginally stable condition. The operation of the lower-level controller considers the dynamic characteristics of actuators and tires, and distributes the "virtual control input"among each physical actuator. This controller's performance with fast response and strong robustness was proved through the bench test. (c) 2021 ISA. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

ID TRACKING
AB The potential of autonomous driving technology to revolutionize the transportation industry has attracted significant attention. Path following, a fundamental task in autonomous driving, involves accurately and safely guiding a vehicle along a specified path. Conventional path-following methods often rely on rule-based or parameter-tuning aspects, which may not be adaptable to complex and dynamic scenarios. Reinforcement learning (RL) has emerged as a promising approach that can learn effective control policies from experience without prior knowledge of system dynamics. This paper investigates the effectiveness of the Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (DDPG) algorithm for steering control in ground vehicle path following. The algorithm quickly converges and the trained agent achieves stable and fast path following, outperforming three baseline methods. Additionally, the agent achieves smooth control without excessive actions. These results validate the proposed approach's effectiveness, which could contribute to the development of autonomous driving technology.

AB With the predicted increase in world population to over 10 billion, by the year 2050, growth in agricultural output needs to be continued. Considering this, autonomous vehicles application in precision agriculture is one of the main issues to be regarded noteworthy to improve the efficiency. In this research many papers on autonomous farm vehicles are reviewed from navigation systems viewpoint. All navigation systems are categorized in six classes: dead reckoning, image processing, statistical based developed algorithms, fuzzy logic control, neural network and genetic algorithm, and Kalman filter based. Researches in many agricultural operations from water monitoring to aerial crop scouting revealed that the centimeter level accuracy in all techniques is available and the velocity range for evaluated autonomous vehicles almost is smaller than 1 m/s. Finally it would be concluded although many developments in agricultural automation using different techniques and algorithms are obtained especially in recent years, more works are required to acquire farmer's consensus about autonomous vehicles. Additionally some issues such as safety, economy, implement standardization and technical service support in the entire world are merit to consideration. (C) 2013 ISTVS. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB Purpose - Navigating in off-road environments is a huge challenge for autonomous vehicles, due to the safety requirement, the effects of noises and non-holonomic constraints of vehicle. This paper aims to describe a path planning method based on fuzzy support vector machine (FSVM) and general regression neural network (GRNN) that is able to provide a solution path for the autonomous vehicle navigating in the off-road environments.
   Design/methodology/approach - The authors decompose the path planning problem into three steps. In the first step, A* algorithm is applied to obtain the positive and negative samples. In the second step, the authors use a learning approach based on radial basis function kernel FSVM to maximize the safety margin for driving, and the fuzzy membership is designed based on GRNN which can help to resolve the problem that the traditional path planning method is easily influenced by noises or outliers. In the third step, the Bezier interpolation algorithm is used to smooth the path. The simulations are designed to verify the parameters of the path planning algorithm.
   Findings - The method is implemented on autonomous vehicle and verified against many outdoor scenes. Road test indicates that the proposed method can produce a flexible, smooth and safe path with good anti-jamming performance.
   Originality/value - This paper applied a new path planning method based on GRNN-FSVM for autonomous vehicle navigating in off-road environments. GRNN-FSVM can reduce the effects of outliers and maximize the safety margin for driving, the generated path is smooth and safe, while satisfying the constraint of vehicle kinematic.

AB This work develops a distributed message-passing approach to cooperative localization for autonomous mobile vehicles that communicate via mm-wave wireless connection in vehicle-to-vehicle networks. Vehicles in the network obtain the measurement information about the relative distance and the angle of arrival from the mm-wave connections made with each other. Some vehicles may obtain knowledge about their absolute position information of different quality, for example, via additional localization feature. The main objective is to estimate the locations of all vehicles using reciprocal exchanges of simple information called a message in a distributed and autonomous way. A simulation is developed to examine the performance of the localization and navigation of vehicles under various network configurations. The results show that it does provide better positioning results in most cases and there are also several cases where the use of the cooperative technique adapts to design parameters such as accuracies of measurement equipment, and initial position estimates, that can affect the localization performance.

AB Autonomous driving functions have gained great interests from both academia and industry over the years. This paper proposes a Model Predictive Control based method to generate a safe and feasible trajectory for the ego vehicle to perform various lateral maneuvers and to produce optimized control inputs to guide the ego vehicle through a mixed traffic environment with both human drivers and autonomous vehicle. A novel reference speed generation function is proposed to automatically adjust the position of the ego vehicle before the initiation of any lateral maneuvers. After a proper gap is selected, the lateral maneuver initiation function with an add-on threshold function is introduced to ensure the safety of the maneuver and to enable the ego vehicle to automatically start or stop the lateral maneuver. A nonlinear and high fidelity tire model is utilized in the simulation to validate the algorithm and the simulation results show that various maneuvers can be successfully achieved without re-tuning the weights or changing the parameters of the controller.

AB A basic requirement of autonomous vehicles is that of guaranteeing the safety of the vehicle by avoiding hazardous situations. This paper analyses this requirement in general terms of real-time response, throughput, and the resolution and accuracy of sensors and computations. Several nondimensional expressions emerge which characterize requirements in canonical form.
   The automatic generation of dense geometric models for autonomously navigating vehicles is a computationally expensive process. Using first principles, it is possible to quantify the relationship between the raw throughput required of the perception system and the maximum safely achievable speed of the vehicle. We derive several useful expressions for the complexity of terrain mapping perception under various assumptions. All of them can be reduced to polynomials in the response distance.
   The significant time consumed by geometric perception degrades real-time response characteristics. Using our results, several strategies of active geometric perception arise which are practical for autonomous vehicles and increasingly important at higher speeds.

On the other hand, connected autonomous vehicles (CAVs) are a set of technologies that combines, on the one hand, communication technologies to stay always ubiquitous connected, and on the other hand, automated technologies to assist or replace the human driver during the driving process. Autonomous vehicles are being visualized as a viable alternative to solve road accidents providing a general safe environment for all the users on the road specifically to the most vulnerable. One of the problems facing autonomous vehicles is to generate mechanisms that facilitate their integration not only within the mobility environment, but also into the road society in a safe and efficient way. In this paper, we analyze and discuss how this integration can take place, reviewing the work that has been developed in recent years in each of the stages of the vehicle-human interaction, analyzing the challenges of vulnerable users and proposing solutions that contribute to solving these challenges.

AB With the growth of the Internet of Vehicles (IoV) in Intelligent Autonomous Transport Systems (IATS), a huge volume of data is exchanged between vehicles in these newly developed infrastructures. As a result, the requirements of securing data exchange between vehicles, autonomous or otherwise, have also increased tremendously. Securing data transfer and keeping a record of each transaction becomes a necessity in IoV/IATS. In this paper, we propose some optimized security algorithms using symmetric encryption for secure multimedia data transfer between vehicles. The main feature of these optimized algorithms is that they use a lower amount of data to generate fingerprints. The algorithms convert approximately 3.7 x 10(5) samples of data into 3600 samples to generate the fingerprint. Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) is used to fetch the highest three peak values of the signal in the frequency domain. A centralized server authenticates the data transfer by comparing the HASH of the fingerprints and also keeps the transaction record. Through experimental analysis, the performance of proposed algorithms is confirmed by achieving reduced size samples to generate fingerprints and their authentication at the server-side.

AB Disruptive technology, especially autonomous vehicles, is predicted to provide higher safety and reduce road traffic emissions. Lane detection and tracking are critical building blocks for developing autonomous or intelligent vehicles. This study presents a lane detecting algorithm for autonomous vehicles on different road pavements (structured and unstructured roads) to overcome challenges such as the low detection accuracy of lane detection and tracking. First, datasets for performance evaluation were created using an interpolation method. Second, a learning-based approach was used to create an algorithm using the steering angle, yaw angle, and sideslip angle as inputs for the adaptive controller. Finally, simulation tests for the lane recognition method were carried out by utilising a road driving video in Melbourne, Australia, and the BDD100K dataset created by the Berkeley DeepDrive Industrial Consortium. The mean detection accuracy ranges from 97% to 99%, and the detection time ranges from 20 to 22 ms under various road conditions with our proposed algorithm. This lane detection algorithm outperformed conventional techniques in terms of accuracy and processing time, as well as efficiency in lane detection and overcoming road interferences. The proposed algorithm will contribute to advancing the lane detection and tracking of intelligent-vehicle driving assistance and help further improve intelligent vehicle driving safety.

AB The advent of autonomous vehicles (AV) is expected to significantly impact the built environment in the long-term. However, the mechanism through which these effects would occur is not known. This study aims to develop conceptual frameworks in the form of causal loop diagrams to enhance understanding through a systematic scoping review of the literature. The review process followed the PRISMA framework and 82 eligible studies were sourced from the Scopus and Web of Science databases. Data were extracted for six attributes of the built environment (parking, density, land use diversity, destination accessibility, urban sprawl and street design). Both qualitative/speculative and quantitative findings are presented stratified by AV types (i.e. shared-autonomous vehicle and private autonomous vehicles), and geographical contexts (i.e. citywide, suburbs and central business district). The findings show that the long-term effects of AVs on the built environment would not be uniformly distributed across the city and vary by AV types. Built environment effects would occur through changes in accessibility, the redistributive demand for parking spaces and other mechanisms. The study provides a knowledge repository and identifies gaps in knowledge for researchers and practitioners interested in the long-term effects of AVs on the built environment.

AB Autonomous vehicles have successfully driven autonomously on urban roads, relying on numerous sensors for environmental perception and vehicle control. However, the abnormality and degradation of sensors will make vehicles face serious safety risks. Therefore, autonomous vehicles must have complete sensor fault diagnosis systems to detect anomalies and avoid accidents. Therefore, this paper explores brain-inspired spiking neural networks (SNN) for sensor fault diagnosis. Specifically, this paper proposes a brain-inspired membrane learnable residual spiking neural network (MLR-SNN) for sensor fault and health index prediction. SNN accurately sim-ulates the dynamic mechanism of biological neurons and exhibits excellent spatiotemporal information pro-cessing potential and low power consumption while being highly biologically credible. Based on the convolution topology, this study designs a spike-residual-based SNN framework that optimizes the gradient transfer efficiency to enable deep-level spiking information encoding. In addition, membrane-learnable mechanisms are introduced to simulate the differences of neuronal membrane-related parameters in brains, which can better characterize the dynamics of neurons. The proposed MLR-SNN is validated on actual autonomous vehicle sensor datasets. Experimental results show that MLR-SNN with neural dynamics mechanism has excellent performance, and it can accurately predict fault mode and health index from multivariate sensor data under open environments.

AB To autonomously navigate in traffic roads, an Autonomous Vehicle must take into account perception information, as well as the topological and geometric structure of the environment it is inserted in. Specifically in urban scenarios, the vehicle has to plan its path across intersections, roundabouts and perform lane changes to obey traffic rules. In addition, the planning algorithm must also consider the kinematics constraints of the vehicle and comfort parameters to the passengers. This paper proposes a road network model based on clothoids, which embraces the geometric and topological representation of the environment in a compact data structure. Piecewise linear continuous-curvature paths composed of clothoids, circular arcs, and straight lines are used for this purpose. The proposed approaches are evaluated in an urban scenario composed of curved and straight roads with single and double lanes, roundabouts, and intersections. As a result, a navigation architecture for Autonomous Vehicles was developed using the model, including global planning with continuous-curvature paths.

AB Autonomous Mobility-on-Demand (AMoD) systems hold potential promise for addressing urban mobility challenges. Their key principle is to utilize fleets of shared self-driving vehicles to respond to customer demand on flexible routes in realtime. This research investigates station-based AMoD car-sharing systems and uses scenario analyses to identify plausible future paths for their deployment. A traffic simulation model which implements real-time rebalancing of idle vehicles is developed to evaluate their performance under uncertain travel demands. Unlike other literature which assumed homogeneous demand and resulted in low increases in vehicle kilometers travelled (VKT), this study relied on realistic heterogeneous demand and showed a significant increase in VKT. A case study for Melbourne demonstrated the impacts and showed that while AMoD can meet the demand for travel using only 16% of the current vehicle fleet, they would produce 77% increase in VKT. This would significantly increase congestion in any real-world scenario and goes against the hype of AMoD being the answer to congestion problems.

AB The capability of path tracking and obstacle avoidance in a complex ocean environment is the basis of the autonomous ocean vehicle voyage. In this paper, a hybrid sea surface path tracking guidance and controller for the autonomous surface underwater vehicle based on the carrot-chasing (CC) and deep reinforcement learning (DRL) is proposed. Firstly, the reference heading angle is provided by the CC algorithm, and then the DRL algorithm is used to combine it with the vehicle-borne sensor information for decision and control. The vehicle's tracking capability is self-developed through a Markov decision process model that includes states, actions, and reward functions, so as to interact and train with the surrounding environment without prior knowledge. The simulation experiments are carried out in high-fidelity sea surface environments with wind, wave and current disturbances, and the experimental results show that the proposed method can converge effectively, has high tracking accuracy and flexible obstacle avoidance ability while avoiding the calculation of complex parameters.

AB This paper proposes extensions of system conceptualisation models for autonomous vehicle storage and retrieval systems (AVS/RSs) to deal with non-exponential lift service times when the number of lifts and vehicles are both design variables. These extensions are based on an adaptation of a computational algorithm for estimating the probability distribution of queue lengths in capacitated, non-Poisson queuing systems. Simulation-based validation studies suggest that the proposed model extensions yield estimation errors comparable to those observed in earlier studies restricted to cases where the number of vehicle and lifts is treated as a single design variable.

AB Autonomous driving technologies have received notable attention in the past decades. In autonomous driving systems, identifying a precise dynamical model for motion control is nontrivial due to the strong nonlinearity and uncertainty in vehicle dynamics. Recent efforts have resorted to machine learning techniques for building vehicle dynamical models, but the generalization ability and interpretability of existing methods still need to be improved. In this paper, we propose a pure data-driven vehicle modeling approach based on deep neural networks with an interpretable Koopman operator. The main advantage of using the Koopman operator is to represent the nonlinear dynamics in a linear lifted feature space. In the proposed approach, a deep learning-based extended dynamic mode decomposition algorithm is presented to learn a finite-dimensional approximation of the Koopman operator. A multi-step prediction loss function is used in the training process, enabling a long-term prediction capability. Furthermore, a data-driven model predictive controller with the learned Koopman model is designed for velocity profile tracking control of autonomous vehicles. Simulation results in a high-fidelity CarSim environment show that our approach outperforms previously developed traditional and advanced modeling methods. Velocity profile tracking tests of the autonomous vehicle are also performed in the CarSim environment. The results show that our approach has better tracking accuracy and higher computational efficiency than the model predictive control algorithms using a nonlinear model and a linear time-varying model.

AB This paper presents a systematic method on how to design the coordinated lateral and longitudinal motion control system of autonomous four wheel drive (4WD) electric vehicles for platooning and trajectory tracking. First, mathematical models that perfectly describe the behaviors of autonomous 4WD vehicles are built-up, and the coupled effects in vehicle dynamic systems are given. Second, owing to the fact that autonomous vehicles are large-scale systems with strong coupling, nonlinearities, and uncertainties, a novel multi-objective hierarchical architecture used for coordinated lateral and longitudinal motion control is constructed, which is composed of a global cooperative control layer, a control allocation layer, and an action execution layer. A robust backstepping sliding mode controller (RBSMC) is presented in the cooperative control layer to provide the resultant forces/moment. The control allocation layer is designed using interior-point (IP) algorithm to determine the tire lateral and longitudinal forces, which result in the desired resultant forces/moment. The action execution layer consists of an inverse tire model, a slip ratio regulator for each wheel, and a slip angle regulator. Finally, simulation experiments are carried out under adverse driving conditions, and the results show that the proposed control architecture not only possesses excellent tracking performance but also enhances the riding comfort, stability, and safety of autonomous 4WD electric vehicles.

AB Since vehicles from multiple roads frequently merge at intersections, it formulates a typical traffic bottleneck of modern transportation systems. Proper vehicle coordination and motion plan at road intersections are of importance to guarantee safety as well as improving the traffic throughput, fuel efficiency and so on. In this paper, we try to present a general dedicated intersection coordination framework for autonomous vehicles, where both high- and low-level planners are appropriately designed and integrated. In the high-level planner, two different strategies are formulated to coordinate the autonomous vehicles to generate <italic>reference trajectories</italic> and <italic>feasible tunnels</italic>, respectively. Especially, a novel space-time-block based resource allocation scheme is presented to describe the feasible tunnels. Furthermore, to avoid collisions with unexpected obstacles such as pedestrians, bicycles or other vehicles with human drivers, a low-level planner is designed to generate practical trajectories based on the solutions from the high-level planner, according to their local on-board observations. Simulations and practical experiments are carried out, to show that our proposed coordination framework can achieve obvious performance advantages in various traffic metrics, including the throughput, fairness in driving maneuvers and driving comfort, etc. We also find that the high-level planner is effective in eliminating possible <italic>deadlocks</italic> among autonomous vehicles, which is rarely discussed in existing investigations.

AB The intelligent transportation system, especially autonomous vehicles, has seen a lot of interest among researchers owing to the tremendous work in modern artificial intelligence (AI) techniques, especially deep neural learning. As a result of increased road accidents over the last few decades, significant industries are moving to design and develop autonomous vehicles. Understanding the surrounding environment is essential for understanding the behavior of nearby vehicles to enable the safe navigation of autonomous vehicles in crowded traffic environments. Several datasets are available for autonomous vehicles focusing only on structured driving environments. To develop an intelligent vehicle that drives in real-world traffic environments, which are unstructured by nature, there should be an availability of a dataset for an autonomous vehicle that focuses on unstructured traffic environments. Indian Driving Lite dataset (IDD-Lite), focused on an unstructured driving environment, was released as an online competition in NCPPRIPG 2019. This study proposed an explainable inception-based U-Net model with Grad-CAM visualization for semantic segmentation that combines an inception-based module as an encoder for automatic extraction of features and passes to a decoder for the reconstruction of the segmentation feature map. The black-box nature of deep neural networks failed to build trust within consumers. Grad-CAM is used to interpret the deep-learning-based inception U-Net model to increase consumer trust. The proposed inception U-net with Grad-CAM model achieves 0.622 intersection over union (IoU) on the Indian Driving Dataset (IDD-Lite), outperforming the state-of-the-art (SOTA) deep neural-network-based segmentation models.

AB Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS) are attracting much attention from the industry, academia, and government in staging the new generation of transportation. In the coming years, the human-driven vehicles and autonomous vehicles would co-exist for a long time in uncertain environments. How to efficiently control the autonomous vehicle and improve the interaction accuracy as well as the human drivers' safety is a hot topic for the autonomous industry. The safety-critical nature of the ITSs demands the system designers to provide provably correct guarantees about the actions, models, control, and performance. To model and recognize the drivers' behavior, we use machine learning classification algorithms based on the data we get from the uncertain environments. We define a parameterized modeling language stohChart(p) (parameterized stochastic hybrid statecharts) to describe the interactions of agents in ITSs. The learning result of the driver behavior classification is transferred to stohChart(p) as the parameters timely. Then we propose a mapping algorithm to transform stohChart(p) to NPTA (Networks of Probabilistic Timed Automata) and use the statistical model checker UPPAAL-SMC to verify the quantitative properties. So the run-time verification method can help autonomous vehicles make "more intelligent" decisions at run-time. We illustrate our approach by modeling and analyzing a scenario of the autonomous vehicle try to change to a lane occupied by a human-driven car. (C) 2020 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Autonomous vehicles must be programmed with procedures for dealing with trolley-style dilemmas where actions result in harm to either pedestrians or passengers. This paper outlines a Rawlsian algorithm as an alternative to the Utilitarian solution. The algorithm will gather the vehicle's estimation of probability of survival for each person in each action, then calculate which action a self-interested person would agree to if he or she were in an original bargaining position of fairness. I will employ Rawls' assumption that the Maximin procedure is what self-interested agents would use from an original position, and then show how the Maximin procedure can be operationalized to produce unique outputs over probabilities of survival.

AB While intelligent transportation systems come in many shapes and sizes, arguably the most transformational realization will be the autonomous vehicle. As such vehicles become commercially available in the coming years, first on dedicated roads and under specific conditions, and later on all public roads at all times, a phase transition will occur. Once a sufficient number of autonomous vehicles is deployed, the opportunity for explicit coordination appears. This article treats this challenging network control problem, which lies at the intersection of control theory, signal processing, and wireless communication. We provide an overview of the state of the art, while at the same time highlighting key research directions for the coming decades.

AB Existing autonomous vehicles use a myriad of onboard sensors to detect objects and survey environment. Among these sensors, LiDAR is probably the most critical and a high-end LiDAR can cost several tens of thousands USD. High cost of sensors can be a formidable barrier to the proliferation of autonomous vehicles. This article proposes the idea of installing LiDAR sensors on roadside lamp posts for sharing among passing vehicles. This can avoid installing expensive sensors onboard each vehicle. Due to limited computation resources at lamp posts, the task of processing sensor data into environment maps for broadcast to vehicles are performed at edge-cloud servers. This article develops a scheme to identify which edge-cloud servers to host the virtual machines for which lamp posts, so that the total computation and communication cost can be minimized. The proposed scheme exploits reuse of existing data at servers for lower cost. The scheme is formulated as a mixed integer program, which is NP-hard. Therefore, we further propose an iterative algorithm with LP-relaxation to find good approximate solutions to the optimization. Extensive evaluation results confirm the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm. As an example, for a system with 50 lamp posts, the proposed algorithm can find solutions in less than 5 s while solving the original optimization using exhaustive search takes more than 24 h.

AB Autonomous intersection management (AIM) will be a future method for improving traffic efficiency in the urban area. Instead of using the traffic signal control like nowadays, it uses wireless communication with autonomous vehicles to support the management of road traffic more safely and efficiently. A single AIM shows an exceptional performance in managing traffics at an intersection. However, it could not be represented a traffic in the real world, which is composed of multiple intersections. We show that coordination of traffic information among vehicles and infrastructures is an essential part of macroscopic traffic management. Coordination of traffic information among the network of AIMs is the key to improve the overall traffic flow throughout the network not only has an optimal flow in some intersections and very heavy traffic in others. In this paper, we introduce the distributed control to a graph-based intersection network to control traffic in a macroscopic level. Vehicle to infrastructure and infrastructure to infrastructure communication are used to exchange the traffic information between a single autonomous vehicle to the network of autonomous intersections. We implement a discrete time consensus algorithm to coordinate the traffic density of an intersection with its neighborhoods and determine the control policy to maximize a traffic throughput of each intersection as well as stabilizing the overall traffic in the network. We use the Greenshields traffic model to define the boundary condition of various traffic flows to the corresponded traffic density and velocity. Our proposed method represents the ability to maintain traffic flow rate of each intersection without having a back up traffic. As well, every intersection operates under the uncongested flow condition. The simulation results of the graph-based networked control of a multiple autonomous intersection showed that the overall traffic flow in the network achieves up to higher than using traffic signal system.

AB Self-driving cars (also known as driverless cars, autonomous vehicles, and highly automated vehicles [HAVs]) will change the regulatory, political, and ethical frameworks surrounding motor vehicles. At the highest levels of automation, HAVs are operated by independent machine agents, making decisions without the direct intervention of humans. The current transportation system assumes human intervention though, including legal and moral responsibilities of human operators. Has the development of these artificial intelligence (AI) and autonomous system (AS) technologies outpaced the ethical and political conversations? This paper examines discussions of HAVs, driver responsibility, and technology failure to highlight the differences between how the policy-making institutions in the United States (Congress and the Public Administration) and technology and transportation experts are or are not speaking about responsibility in the context of autonomous systems technologies. We report findings from a big data analysis of corpus-level documents to find that enthusiasm for HAVs has outpaced other discussions of the technology.

AB Autonomous cars have become a reality due to breakthroughs in technology enablers such as embedded computing systems and artificial intelligence. Automated platooning, which can be employed in autonomous cars, allows grouping of vehicles into platoons. Using this technology in highways brings forth a number of benefits such as improving traffic throughput, increasing fuel efficiency, and reducing collisions. Towards that end, this paper proposes a cooperative cruise controller for both homogeneous and heterogeneous vehicle platoon systems. The controller consists of two control layers; namely, platoon supervisory control layer and cruise control layer. The developed controller was validated and evaluated through an intensive set of simulation scenarios. The results show that the controller outperforms other contenders by 40 % in improving the road capacity. In addition, the results indicate that the controller is capable of handling different traffic scenarios (i.e. homogeneous vs. heterogeneous vehicle platoons) as well as being fault-tolerant to disruptions such as loss of communication between vehicles.

AB An autonomous vehicle routing problem solution (VRPS) algorithm with parallel ant colony optimization (ACO) considering pilot satisfaction is proposed in this paper to solve the problem in traditional autonomous vehicle routing, such as the service quality is affected by longer flying time of pilot due to too much emphasis on cost factors and ignoring of delivery time. First, the flying time of pilot is considered to improve traditional autonomous flight model so as to comprehensively consider autonomous cost and pilot satisfaction. Then, for NP problems in autonomous flight, a parallel ACO algorithm is used for global optimization and design Mapreduce improvement method of parallel ACO, to improve optimization performance of the algorithm and to obtain optimal global solution. At last, a contrast experiment is conducted and the results show that, the algorithm proposed herein can effectively reduce the flying time of pilot and help to improve the service quality.

ID FRAMEWORK; SYSTEMS
AB In this paper, we proposed a decentralized cooperative lane-changing decision-making framework for connected autonomous vehicles, which is composed of three modules, i.e., state prediction, candidate decision generation, and coordination. In other words, each connected autonomous vehicle makes cooperative lane-changing decision independently. In the state prediction module, we employed existing cooperative car-following models to predict the vehicles' future state. In the candidate decision generation module, we proposed incentive based model to generate a candidate decision. In the candidate decision coordination module, we proposed an algorithm to avoid candidate lane-changing decision that may lead to a vehicle collision or traffic deterioration to be final decision. Moreover, the effects of decentralized cooperative lane-changing decision-making framework on traffic stability, efficiency, homogeneity, and safety are investigated in a numerical simulation experiment. Some stability, efficiency, homogeneity, and safety indicators are evaluated and show the high potential of our proposed framework in traffic dynamics.

AB Autonomous driving technologies can provide greater safety, comfort, and efficiency for future transportation systems. Until now, much of the research effort has been devoted to developing different sensing and control algorithms. However, there has been limited research on how to handle sensor errors efficiently. A simple error in the sensor may lead to an unexpected failure in the whole autonomous driving function. In those cases, the vehicle is then recommended to be sent back to the manufacturer for repair, which costs time and money. This paper introduces an efficient automatic online sensor correction method. The method includes four major functions: sensor error detection, human teaching, vehicle learning, and vehicle self-evaluation. The first function is assumed to be ready and the major contribution of this paper is the human-vehicle teaching and learning framework, which utilizes human-vehicle interaction to collaboratively adjust the parameter in the control model in order to compensate for the errors of the sensors. The self-evaluation function is also briefly introduced. The applications of this method to radar and vision sensors to recover adaptive cruise control and lane keeping functions are introduced in detail. Experimental results acquired from high-fidelity 1/10-scale autonomous driving vehicles illustrate the effectiveness and advantages of the proposed approach.

AB Recent work has shown that the introduction of autonomous vehicles (AVs) in traffic could help reduce traffic jams. Deep reinforcement learning methods demonstrate good performance in complex control problems, including autonomous vehicle control, and have been used in state-of-the-art AV controllers. However, deep neural networks (DNNs) render automated driving vulnerable to machine learning-based attacks. In this work, we explore the backdooring/trojanning of DRL-based AV controllers. We develop a trigger design methodology that is based on well-established principles of traffic physics. The malicious actions include vehicle deceleration and acceleration to cause stop-and-go traffic waves to emerge (congestion attacks) or AV acceleration resulting in the AV crashing into the vehicle in front (insurance attack). We test our attack on single-lane and two-lane circuits. Our experimental results show that the backdoored model does not compromise normal operation performance, with the maximum decrease in cumulative rewards being 1%. Still, it can be maliciously activated to cause a crash or congestion when the corresponding triggers appear.

AB This paper investigates the joint network equilibrium of parking and travel route choices in the future mobility paradigm with mixed traffic of private and shared autonomous vehicles. Specifically, we consider that private autonomous vehicle (PAV) travelers need to make both route and parking choices though the vehicle can drive itself to parking after dropping off the traveler. The origin-destination-based shared autonomous vehicle (OD-SAV) ride service allows multiple travelers with a common origin and destination (OD) pair to share the same vehicle, while the routing of OD-SAVs is determined by the operator. In this context, a bi-level model is developed which optimizes the OD-SAV service fare and OD-SAV flow in the upper-level, and specifies the travel demands, route and parking choices, and network traffic equilibrium in the lower-level. In particular, PAV travelers choose their route and parking location to minimize their own travel time or cost, while the routing of OD-SAVs is subject to the decision of the operator. The OD-SAVs controlled by the operator may minimize each vehicle's travel time (user equilibrium, 'UE') or minimize the total travel time of all OD-SAVs operated by the operator (Cournot-Nash equilibrium, 'CN'). The joint equilibrium of travel and parking under either UE or CN routing for OD-SAVs can be modeled as a Variational Inequalities (VI) problem. The uniqueness/non-uniqueness properties of the joint network equilibrium are investigated. Moreover, we examine the OD-SAV service operator's optimal operation decisions subject to the lower-level network equilibrium. Solution approaches are introduced to solve the joint equilibrium and the proposed bi-level model. Numerical studies are conducted to illustrate the model and analytical results, and also to provide further understanding.

AB Current Self-Adaptive Systems (SASs) such as Autonomous Vehicles (AVs) are systems able to deal with highly complex contexts. However, due to the use of static feedback loops they are not able to respond to unanticipated situations such as sensor faults. Previously, we have proposed HAFLoop (Highly Adaptive Feedback control Loop), an architecture for adaptive loops in SASs. In this paper, we incorporate HAFLoop into an AV solution that leverages machine learning techniques to determine the best monitoring strategy at runtime. We have evaluated our solution using real vehicles. Evaluation results are promising and demonstrate the great potential of our proposal.

AB Driving safety is the most basic demand for autonomous vehicles but is also the most difficult task at the same time. Intelligent tires equipped with in-tire sensors have been proposed to recognize the tire-road interaction conditions, such as road surface conditions, tire dynamics states, and friction conditions, which can help realize safer driving of autonomous vehicles. In this study, we first review the related research of intelligent tires about the sensing system and tire-road contact state estimation methods and discuss their desirability and limitations. On this basis, we propose our constructive strategies for improving the design of the intelligent tire sensing system to adapt to the extremely harsh working condition of tires, make full use of the installed sensors, and realize the continuous measurement of tire-road contact information. In addition, we analyze the specific requirements for the implementation process when applying intelligent tires to autonomous driving. In the future, intelligent tires with specially designed sensing systems combined with optimal recognition methods can bring new opportunities to safer vehicle dynamics control and promote the development of autonomous driving technology.

AB Recently, there has been an increasing interest in the development of autonomous vehicles. However, some of the challenges that are associated with autonomous vehicles are yet to be resolved. Here, we investigate the user dependence on autonomous control in autopilot vehicles. Further, we verify whether drivers can control the vehicles in an appropriate manner after a system failure based on the range of biometric data. The participants in this study experienced three scenarios in a driving simulator: manual-driving, autonomous-driving, and system-failure scenarios, which forced the participants to resume manual control. The data obtained from salivary amylase depict that drivers tend to be anxious while performing the transition from the manual-driving scenario to the autonomous-driving scenario; however, all drivers have to be accustomed with the system in order to drive using a driving simulator. Thus, the difference of anxiety between various drivers is observed to be suppressed. The seat pressure data illustrate that an area having a value equal to 95% of the probability-deviation ellipse during the second day of the manual-driving and autonomous-driving scenarios is observed to have the largest value from among each driving scenario, which seems to be caused due to the driver's concentration or fatigue. Further, the systolic blood pressures of all the drivers increased with time. However, in the autonomous-driving scenario, the average relative systolic blood pressure is, on the whole, higher than that in the manual-driving scenario. It is suggested that the drivers had never previously used an autonomous-driving system and that he/she may be uncomfortable or uneasy to autonomously control the brake, accelerator, and steering wheel. Additionally, after a system failure during the manual-driving scenario, the behavior is observed to be similar to that in the initial manual-driving scenario, and the totally average relative systolic blood pressure is higher than that during the initial manual-driving scenario. This indicates that the drivers' mental workload is relatively low during the autonomous-driving scenario because they do not experience any stress from driving. However, the drivers' systolic blood pressure increased because of the transition from autonomous driving to manual control and because of the mental workload to control the vehicle on their own just after using an autonomous-driving system. From the viewpoint of the brain activity in the left frontal lobe, the data indicates that the drivers' cognition level during autonomous driving is lower than that during manual driving and that the declining tendency of the average relative hemoglobin concentration is remarkable during the manual-driving scenario after encountering a system failure. This is because the driver feels that he/she may commit mistakes during manual driving. Additionally, if he/she is driving an autonomous vehicle and if the autonomous-driving system failed, he/she does not need to pay attention to the surrounding subjects and control the vehicle. The eye-gaze data indicate that "mind distraction" occurred in the participants while resuming control after a system failure because their brain activity at this instance was relatively low. Our results indicate that drivers who depend on autonomous control systems experience stress upon switching to manual control after a system failure.

AB This paper proposes a genetic algorithm (GA) for path planning of an autonomous underwater vehicle in an ocean environment characterized by strong currents and enhanced space-time variability. The goal is to rind a safe path that takes the vehicle from its starting location to a mission-specified destination, minimizing the energy cost. The GA includes novel genetic operators that ensure the convergence to the global minimum even in cases where the structure (in space and time) of the current field implies the existence of different local minima. The performance of these operators is discussed. The proposed algorithm is suitable for situations in which the vehicle has to operate energy-exhaustive missions.

AB Autonomous vehicles include driverless, self-driving and robotic cars, and other platforms capable of sensing and interacting with its environment and navigating without human help. On the other hand, semiautonomous vehicles achieve partial realization of autonomy with human intervention, for example, in driver-assisted vehicles. Autonomous vehicles first interact with their surrounding using mounted sensors. Typically, visual sensors are used to acquire images, and computer vision techniques, signal processing, machine learning, and other techniques are applied to acquire, process, and extract information. The control subsystem interprets sensory information to identify appropriate navigation path to its destination and action plan to carry out tasks. Feedbacks are also elicited from the environment to improve upon its behavior. To increase sensing accuracy, autonomous vehicles are equipped with many sensors [light detection and ranging (LiDARs), infrared, sonar, inertial measurement units, etc.], as well as communication subsystem. Autonomous vehicles face several challenges such as unknown environments, blind spots (unseen views), non-line-of-sight scenarios, poor performance of sensors due to weather conditions, sensor errors, false alarms, limited energy, limited computational resources, algorithmic complexity, human-machine communications, size, and weight constraints. To tackle these problems, several algorithmic approaches have been implemented covering design of sensors, processing, control, and navigation. The review seeks to provide up-to-date information on the requirements, algorithms, and main challenges in the use of machine vision-based techniques for navigation and control in autonomous vehicles. An application using land-based vehicle as an Internet of Thing-enabled platform for pedestrian detection and tracking is also presented.

AB In this article, a distributed adaptive iterative learning control for a group of uncertain autonomous vehicles with a time-varying reference is presented, where the autonomous vehicles are underactuated with parametric uncertainties, the actuators are subject to faults, and the control gains are not fully known. A time-varying reference is adopted, the assumption that the trajectory of the leader is linearly parameterized with some known functions is relaxed, and the control inputs are smooth. To design distributed control scheme for each vehicle, a local compensatory variable is generated based on information collected from its neighbors. The composite energy function is used in stability analysis. It is shown that uniform convergence of consensus errors is guaranteed. An illustrative example is given to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed control scheme.

AB Within the next several years, there will be a high level of autonomous technology that will be available for widespread use, which will reduce labor costs, increase safety, save energy, enable difficult unmanned tasks in harsh environments, and eliminate human error. Compared to software development for other autonomous vehicles, maritime software development, especially in aging but still functional fleets, is described as being in a very early and emerging phase. This presents great challenges and opportunities for researchers and engineers to develop maritime autonomous systems. Recent progress in sensor and communication technology has introduced the use of autonomous surface vehicles (ASVs) in applications such as coastline surveillance, oceanographic observation, multi-vehicle cooperation, and search and rescue missions. Advanced artificial intelligence technology, especially deep learning (DL) methods that conduct nonlinear mapping with self-learning representations, has brought the concept of full autonomy one step closer to reality. This article reviews existing work on the implementation of DL methods in fields related to ASV. First, the scope of this work is described after reviewing surveys on ASV developments and technologies, which draws attention to the research gap between DL and maritime operations. Then, DL-based navigation, guidance, control (NGC) systems and cooperative operations are presented. Finally, this survey is completed by highlighting current challenges and future research directions.

AB Effectively detecting road boundaries in real time is critical to the applications of autonomous vehicles, such as vehicle localization, path planning, and environmental understanding. To precisely extract the irregular road boundaries or those blocked by obstructions on the road from the 3D LiDAR data, a dedicated algorithm consisting of four steps is proposed in this paper. The steps are as follows. First, the 3D LiDAR data is pre-processed, employing the vehicle position and attitude information, and many noise points are deleted. Second, the ground points are quickly separated from the pre-processed point cloud data to reduce the disturbance from the obstacles on the road; this greatly decreases the size of the points cloud to be processed. Third, the candidate points of the road boundaries are searched along the predicted trajectory of the autonomous vehicle and filtered using the unique features of the boundary points. Last, a spline fit model is applied to smoothen the road boundaries. An experiment to test the performance of the proposed algorithm was conducted on the "Xinda" autonomous vehicle under various road scenarios. The experimental results show that the average accuracy of the proposed algorithm exceeds 93%, and its average processing time is approximately 36.5 ms/frame, which outperforms most of the state-of-the-art methods. This indicates that the proposed algorithm can robustly extract the road boundary in real time even if there are many obstacles on the road. This algorithm has been tested on "Xinda" autonomous vehicle for over 1000 kilometers, and its performance was always stable.

AB In order to improve the tracking adaptability of autonomous vehicles under different vehicle speeds and road curvature, this paper develops a weight adaptive model prediction control system (AMPC) based on PSO-BP neural network, which consists of a dynamics-based model prediction controller (MPC) and an optimal weight adaptive regulator. Based on the application of MPC to achieve high-precision tracking control, the optimal weight under different operating conditions obtained by automated simulation is used to train the PSO-BP neural network offline to achieve online adjustment of MPC weight. The validation results of the Prescan-Carsim-Simulink joint simulation platform show that the adaptive control system has better tracking adaptation capability compared with the original classical MPC control. The control strategy was also verified on an autonomous vehicle test platform, and the test results showed that the adaptive control strategy improved tracking accuracy while meeting the vehicle's requirements for real-time control and lateral stability.

AB The effects of autonomous vehicles (AVs) on urban forms are modeled, calibrated, and analyzed. Vehicles are used for commute between peripheral home and central work, and require land for parking. An advantage of AVs is that they can optimize the location of day parking, relieving downtown land for other uses. They also reduce the per-kilometer cost of commute. Increased AV availability increases worker welfare, travel distances, and the city size. Land rents increase in the center but decrease in the periphery. Possible locations of AV daytime parking are analyzed. The effects of AV introduction on traffic and on mass transit coverage are discussed.

AB Unmanned Aerial Vehicles have undergone rapid developments in recent decades. This has made them very popular for various military and civilian applications allowing us to reach places that were previously hard to reach in addition to saving time and lives. A highly desirable direction when developing unmanned aerial vehicles is towards achieving fully autonomous missions and performing their dedicated tasks with minimum human interaction. Thus, this paper provides a survey of some of the recent developments in the field of unmanned aerial vehicles related to safe autonomous navigation, which is a very critical component in the whole system. A great part of this paper focus on advanced methods capable of producing three-dimensional avoidance maneuvers and safe trajectories. Research challenges related to unmanned aerial vehicle development are also highlighted.

AB Obstacle avoidance systems for autonomous driving vehicles have significant effects on driving safety. The performance of an obstacle avoidance system is affected by the obstacle avoidance path planning approach. To design an obstacle avoidance path planning method, firstly, by analyzing the obstacle avoidance behavior of a human driver, a safety model of obstacle avoidance is constructed. Then, based on the safety model, the artificial potential field method is improved and the repulsive field range of obstacles are rebuilt. Finally, based on the improved artificial potential field, a collision-free path for autonomous driving vehicles is generated. To verify the performance of the proposed algorithm, co-simulation and real vehicle tests are carried out. Results show that the generated path satisfies the constraints of roads, dynamics, and kinematics. The real time performance, effectiveness, and feasibility of the proposed path planning approach for obstacle avoidance scenarios are also verified.

AB This paper aims to explore the performance of Autonomous Mobility on-Demand (AMoD) systems under uncertain travel demands in an urban environment using a case study of Melbourne, Australia. The results of the simulation model developed in this study showed that an AMoD system could reduce the current fleet size by 84% while still meeting the same demand for travel. This, however, comes at a cost of more Vehicle-Kilometres Travelled (VKT). The increase in VKT is significant and amounts to around 77% for scenarios in which the vehicles are used in car-sharing systems, and 29% for the scenarios in which vehicles are used as ride-sharing systems. These findings show that the benefits reported in other studies have mainly been overestimated. The current study has also discovered a strong quadratic relationship between AMoD fleet size and VKT.

AB Advanced technology available in promising fully autonomous vehicles (AVs) will encourage people to travel more than they have up to now using their regular vehicles. It is believed that the disadvantages of manually driven vehicles, such as driving fatigue, stressful feelings, aging physical skills deterioration, and other unwanted effects, will vanish once AVs are employed. For this purpose, this study presents the results of a large questionnaire performed in Gyor, Hungary, about the public perception and acceptance of AVs. In addition, assessing the impact of using such technology on increasing travel demand when people can alter their mode of transport to an AV. The study demonstrates that respondents' prior knowledge of AVs plays a crucial role in generating a greater number of trips when they are able to use AVs. Furthermore, it has also been found that providing further awareness and education to the population about the meaning of the term autonomous vehicles and widening their insights about the new features provided by these vehicles will result in a higher number of trips. Eventually, this information will act as a considerable indicator to provide a prior understanding of the possible challenges that may impact the sustainability of future transport systems.

ID VEHICLE
AB Context
   As autonomous driving technology matures toward series production, it is necessary to take a deeper look at various aspects of electrical/electronic (E/E) architectures for autonomous driving.
   Objective
   This paper describes a functional reference architecture for autonomous driving, along with various considerations that influence such an architecture. The functionality is described at the logical level, without dependence on specific implementation technologies.
   Method
   Engineering design has been used as the research method, which focuses on creating solutions intended for practical application. The architecture has been refined and applied over a 5 year period to the construction of prototype autonomous vehicles in three different categories, with both academic and industrial stakeholders.
   Results
   The architectural components are divided into categories pertaining to (i) perception, (ii) decision and control, and (iii) vehicle platform manipulation. The architecture itself is divided into two layers comprising the vehicle platform and a cognitive driving intelligence. The distribution of components among the architectural layers considers two extremes: one where the vehicle platform is as "dumb" as possible, and the other, where the vehicle platform can be treated as an autonomous system with limited intelligence. We recommend a clean split between the driving intelligence and the vehicle platform. The architecture description includes identification of stakeholder concerns, which are grouped under the business and engineering categories. A comparison with similar architectures is also made, wherein we claim that the presence of explicit components for world modeling, semantic understanding, and vehicle platform abstraction seem unique to our architecture.
   Conclusion
   The concluding discussion examines the influences of implementation technologies on functional architectures and how an architecture is affected when a human driver is replaced by a computer. The discussion also proposes that reduction and acceleration of testing, verification, and validation processes is the key to incorporating continuous deployment processes. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

AB Autonomous vehicles are rapidly emerging as a crucial sector within the automotive industry. Several companies are investing in the development and enhancement of technologies, which presents challenging problems in the context of robotics and control. In particular, this work primarily focuses on the creation of an autonomous vehicle architecture utilizing the robotic operating system (ROS2) framework, accompanied by advanced control algorithms. In order to facilitate the development and implementation of lateral vehicle dynamics controllers, a reduced-size automated car available in GIPSA-Lab is used as an experimental platform. The objective is to design robust controllers capable of achieving optimal tracking and stability. Accordingly, this problem is tackled under different robust control syntheses, considering the H & INFIN; approach: using linear time-invariant (LTI) and linear parameter-varying (LPV) model representations. Several simulation and experimental results are included to demonstrate the efficiency of the controllers.

AB Avoiding collisions with other objects is one of the most basic safety tasks undertaken in the operation of floating vehicles. Addressing this challenge is essential, especially during unmanned vehicle navigation processes in autonomous missions. This paper provides an empirical analysis of the surface target detection possibilities in a water environment, which can be used for the future development of tracking and anti-collision systems for autonomous surface vehicles (ASV). The research focuses on identifying the detection ranges and the field of view for various surface targets. Typical objects that could be met in the water environment were analyzed, including a boat and floating objects. This study describes the challenges of implementing automotive radar sensors for anti-collision tasks in a water environment from the perspective of target detection with the application for small ASV performing tasks on the lake.

AB Autonomous vehicles, electrification, and ride-sharing appear to be the next big change in the field of mobility. It can lead to safer roads, less congestion, and reduced parking. In this research, we focus on real-life user experiences of a driverless shuttle bus. We are interested to know what kind of perceptions and feelings people have when they travel in an autonomous shuttle bus. Therefore, we apply Harry Triandis ' Theory of Interpersonal Behaviour (TIB), which recognizes that human behavior is not always rational. Human behaviour, and its change, is linked to the intention, the habitual responses, and the situational constraints and conditions. The qualitative data (n = 44) were collected in 2017 by semi-structured interviews in Espoo, Finland. The interviewees were passengers who travelled a predefined route in a driverless shuttle bus. We applied inductive content analysis. The findings were compared in the theoretical framework of TIB. According to the results, a lack of human driver was not a problem for the passengers. They were surprised how safe and secure they felt in the autonomous vehicle. More specifically, passengers ' perceptions were similar to when travelling by a metro or a tram, where a passenger rarely interacts with the driver, or even witnesses the existence of the driver. However, the results suggest that people are much more intolerant of accidents caused by autonomous vehicles than by humans. On a general level, positive attitudes towards autonomous vehicles can be supported by giving people possibilities to try autonomous vehicles in a safe, real-life environment. The decision whether to use a driverless shuttle bus or not correlates highly with the contextual factors. Route and flexibility are the most important reasons for behavioral changes.

AB There are two shortcomings in the application of traditional A* algorithm in the path planning of autonomous driving. One is that the vehicle environment description method suitable for the A* algorithm is not given; the other is that the vehicle contours and kinematic constraints are not considered. Therefore, according to the characteristics of unstructured environment, this paper presents an environment description method combining global navigation layer and local planning layer, and proposes a local motion planning algorithm based on the improved A* algorithm for autonomous driving vehicles in unstructured environment. In the improved algorithm, profile collision is avoided by setting redundant security space, and the cost of path curvature is considered in heuristic function design. Compared with the original algorithm, it can improve the smoothness of the path, so as to get a path more satisfied with vehicle motion constraints. Simulation results show that the improved algorithm can avoid vehicle contours collision and output a smoother path.

AB Autonomous obstacle avoidance and decision-making algorithms for intelligent connected vehicles in a complicated transportation environment are important studies on intelligent driving. However, it is difficult to adapt to a more complicated traffic environment based on safety distance and conventional potential field. Therefore, in this paper, a driving risk field model based on field theory is proposed involving transportation factors and vehicle conditions. A hidden Markov model was used to evaluate and determine the motion state of surrounding vehicles. A safe, feasible, and smooth collision-free path was planned by calculating the magnitude of the potential field forces on the longitudinal and lateral sides of the obstacle vehicles. The results showed that the method can effectively select a suitable path for obstacle avoidance in complex road conditions while satisfying safety and traffic laws.

AB This paper investigates the trajectory tracking control of an autonomous tracked vehicle. First, the desired linear and angular velocities are evaluated based on vehicle's kinematics. An optimized backstepping controller is proposed as the kinematic controller, whereas the controller gains are optimally obtained. Next, an integral sliding mode control (SMC) is exploited based on vehicle dynamics and slipping characteristics, to obtain the desired torques that drive the vehicle and converge its trajectory to the desired one. Moreover, stability analysis of the whole system is proven based on Lyapunov theory. Finally, simulations and real-time experiments based on robot operating system (ROS) implementation are conducted to validate the effectiveness of the proposed control algorithm and compared with a hybrid backstepping-modified PID dynamic controller.

AB The autonomous vehicle is profoundly changing the future of transportation safety. The reduction in collisions with different injury degrees and the savings of crash-related economic costs if nine autonomous vehicle technologies were promoted to be wildly available in China are evaluated. The quantitative analysis was divided into three main parts: (1) Calculate the technical effectiveness of nine autonomous vehicle technologies in collisions through a systematic literature review; (2) Apply the technical effectiveness to estimate the potential effects on avoiding collisions and saving crash-related economic costs in China if all vehicles had these technologies; and (3) Quantify the influence of current technical limitations in speed applicability, weather applicability, light applicability, and active rate on potential effects. Definitely, these technologies have different safety benefits in different countries. The framework developed and technical effective-ness calculated in this study can be applied to evaluate the safety impact of these technologies in other countries.

AB In order to drive safely in a dynamic environment, autonomous vehicles should be able to predict the future states of traffic participants nearby, especially surrounding vehicles, similar to the capability of predictive driving of human drivers. That is why researchers are devoted to the field of trajectory prediction and propose different methods. This paper is to provide a comprehensive and comparative review of trajectory-prediction methods proposed over the last two decades for autonomous driving. It starts with the problem formulation and algorithm classification. Then, the popular methods based on physics, classic machine learning, deep learning, and reinforcement learning are elaborately introduced and analyzed. Finally, this paper evaluates the performance of each kind of method and outlines potential research directions to guide readers.

AB Recent advances in autonomous vehicles and vehicular communications are envisioned to enable novel approaches to managing and controlling traffic intersections. In particular, with intersection controller units (ICUs), passing vehicles can be instructed to cross the intersection safely without traffic signals. Previous efforts on autonomous intersection control mainly focused on guaranteeing the safe passage of vehicles and improving intersection throughput, without considering the quality of the travel experience from the passengers' perspective. In this paper, we aim to design an enhanced autonomous intersection control mechanism, which not only ensures vehicle safety and enhances traffic efficiency but also cares about the travel experience of passengers. In particular, we design the metric of smoothness to quantitatively capture the quality of experience. In addition, we consider the travel time of individual vehicles when passing the intersection in scheduling to avoid a long delay of some vehicles, which not only helps with improving intersection throughput but also enhances the system's fairness. With the above considerations, we formulate the intersection control model and transform it into a convex optimization problem. On this basis, we propose a new algorithm to achieve an optimal solution with low overhead. Finally, we build the simulation model and implement the algorithm for performance evaluation. Comprehensive simulation results demonstrate the superiority of the proposed algorithm.

AB Color can be a useful feature in autonomous vehicle systems that are based on machine vision, for tasks such as obstacle detection, lane/road following, and recognition of miscellaneous scene objects. Unfortunately, few existing autonomous vehicle systems use color to its full extent, largely because color-based recognition in outdoor scenes is complicated, and existing color machine-vision techniques have not been shown to be effective in realistic outdoor images. This paper presents a technique for achieving effective real-time color recognition in outdoor scenes. The technique uses multivariate decision trees for piecewise linear non-parametric function approximation to learn the color of a target object from training samples, and then detects targets by classifying pixels based on the approximated function. The method has been successfully tested in several domains, such as autonomous highway navigation, off-road navigation and target detection for unmanned military vehicles, in projects such as the U.S. National Automated Highway System (AHS) and the U.S. Defense Advanced Project Agency - Unmanned Ground Vehicle (DARPA-UGV). MDT-based systems have been used in stand-alone mode, as well as in conjunction with systems based on other sensor configurations. (C) 1998 Published by Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

These vehicles can be programmed to prioritize the safety of passengers in an accident or prioritize the greater good to save more lives. The essay will explore various ethical questions such as evaluating the numbers game approach, analyzing the principles of benefi- cence correlated with social inequality, and interpreting the principle of autonomy in the context of autonomous vehicles. Additionally, the examination will consider the harm-benefit ratio.

AB Autonomous vehicles have a fundamental part to play in future transportation. In order to work, such vehicles need a way of determining their exact location. To date, two techniques have proved applicable: geolocation using GPS and 3D mapping. In the latter case, the creation of the 3D map is an essential step in preparing the software. This manuscript presents a novel method for creating a high-definition 3D map using a Velodyne sensor. The primary objective is to achieve deeper understanding of the map creation algorithm and to lay the groundwork for future autonomous vehicle architecture. In this manuscript, two high-definition mapping algorithms are applied: the graph simultaneous localization and mapping algorithm and the normal distributions transform algorithm. The results of both displayed different strengths and weaknesses upon creating a high-definition 3D map, which may help other researchers to select the best algorithm in future.

ID SOCIAL FORCE MODEL
AB Pedestrians and drivers interact closely in a wide range of environments. Autonomous vehicles (AVs) correspondingly face the need to predict pedestrians' future trajectories in these same environments. Traditional model-based prediction methods have been limited to making predictions in highly structured scenes with signalized intersections, marked crosswalks, or curbs. Deep learning methods have instead leveraged datasets to learn predictive features that generalize across scenes, at the cost of model interpretability. This letter aims to achieve both widely applicable and interpretable predictions by proposing a risk-based attention mechanism to learn when pedestrians yield, and a model of vehicle influence to learn how yielding affects motion. A novel probabilistic method, Off the Sidewalk Predictions (OSP), uses these to achieve accurate predictions in both shared spaces and traditional scenes. Experiments on urban datasets demonstrate that the realtime method achieves state-of-the-art performance.

ID DESIGN
AB This article aims to identify the roll channel parameters of an autonomous underwater vehicle. These parameters include hydrodynamic coefficients, motor torque, eccentricity, misalignments and mounting imperfections. In the proposed method, an approximation of the hydrodynamic coefficients is made at first via semi-empirical methods. In the next step, a proportional-integral-derivative controller is designed with respect to the approximated coefficients. Since the approximations can be very uncertain, the robustness of stability and performance of the proportional-integral-derivative controller is evaluated throughout mu -analysis. Finally, the unknown parameters are identified using the recorded data of on-board sensors during motion of the vehicle. The identification is based on minimization of the one-step prediction error. The minimization problem is nonlinear in unknown parameters, and particle swarm optimization is used to find an optimal solution. The performance of the proposed method is exhibited through a 6-degrees-of-freedom simulation of an autonomous underwater vehicle.

AB In this brief, the coordinated path-following control for multiple nonlinear autonomous vehicles connected by digital networks is studied. To compensate for the time delays of the network actively, a novel networked predictive control strategy is proposed. Compared with existing networked control strategies, the control strategy proposed in this brief admits advantages such as high computational efficiency, robustness to disturbances, and relaxed restriction on the communication topology. The theoretical analysis of the proposed method is given and the conditions to achieve the control objectives are derived. Finally, the experiments are implemented to validate the effectiveness of the proposed method.

AB This study presents a field-programmable gate array (FPGA)-based mechatronic design and real-time fuzzy control method with computational intelligence optimization for omni-Mecanum-wheeled autonomous vehicles. With the advantages of cuckoo search (CS), an evolutionary CS-based fuzzy system is proposed, called CS-fuzzy. The CS's computational intelligence was employed to optimize the structure of fuzzy systems. The proposed CS-fuzzy computing scheme was then applied to design an optimal real-time control method for omni-Mecanum-wheeled autonomous vehicles with four wheels. Both vehicle model and CS-fuzzy optimization are considered to achieve intelligent tracking control of Mecanum mobile vehicles. The control parameters of the Mecanum fuzzy controller are online-adjusted to provide real-time capability. This methodology outperforms the traditional offline-tuned controllers without computational intelligences in terms of real-time control, performance, intelligent control and evolutionary optimization. The mechatronic design of the experimental CS-fuzzy based autonomous mobile vehicle was developed using FPGA realization. Some experimental results and comparative analysis are discussed to examine the effectiveness, performance, and merit of the proposed methods against other existing approaches.

AB In this article, the problem of trajectory tracking control is studied for autonomous vehicle with consideration of the nonlinearity and coupling characteristics. To achieve accurately trajectory tracking in longitudinal and lateral motions simultaneously, a flatness disturbance-observer-based control scheme is developed to address the kinematic coupling issue of the vehicle, which can avoid extra modeling errors introduced by linearization. The main idea is that, derived from a suitable selection of flat outputs, the complex kinodynamic vehicle model is transformed into three fully-actuated subsystems with same structure, which will provide convenience for controller design. Then, in order to compensate the lumped disturbances caused by modeling and transformation, a disturbance-observer-based control strategy is designed via backstepping. Trajectory tracking control is accomplished through longitudinal, lateral and yaw motions simultaneously. The stability of the closed-loop dynamics is guaranteed in the framework of Lyapunov and input-to-state stability theories. Finally, the CarSim simulation tests demonstrate that the proposed integrated control method can successfully promote the trajectory tracking performance in different manoeuvres.

   Vulnerable road user; Vehicle -pedestrian conflict

AB Pedestrians are a vulnerable road user group, and their crashes are generally spread across the network rather than in a concentrated location. As such, understanding and modelling pedestrian crash risk at a corridor level becomes paramount. Studies on pedestrian crash risks, particularly with the traffic conflict data, are limited to single or multiple but scattered intersections. A lack of proper modelling techniques and the difficulties in capturing pedestrian interaction at the network or corridor level are two main challenges in this regard. With autonomous vehicles trialled on public roads generating massive (and unprecedented) datasets, utilising such rich information for corridor-wide safety analysis is somewhat limited where it appears to be most relevant. This study proposes an extreme value theory modelling framework to estimate corridor-wide pedestrian crash risk using autonomous vehicle sensor/probe data. Two types of models were developed in the Bayesian framework, including the block maxima sampling-based model corresponding to Generalised Extreme Value distribution and the peak over threshold sampling-based model corresponding to Generalised Pareto distribution. The proposed framework was applied to autonomous vehicle data from Argoverse-a Ford Motors subsidiary. This autonomous vehicle fleet of Agro AI (owner of Argoverse dataset) is equipped with two 64 beams synchronised LiDAR sensors, a cluster of seven high-resolution cameras, and a pair of stereo-vison high-resolution cameras to capture surrounding road users' information within a range of 200 meters. A subset of the Argoverse dataset, focussing on an arterial corridor in Miami, USA, was used to extract pedestrian and vehicle trajectories. From these trajectories, vehicle-pedestrian conflicts were identified and measured using post encroachment time. The non-stationarity of extremes was captured by vehicle volume, pedestrian volume, average vehicle speed, and average pedestrian speed in the extreme value model. Both block maxima and peak over threshold sampling-based models were found to provide a reasonable estimate of historical pedestrian crash frequencies. Notably, the block maxima sampling-based model was more accurate than the peak over threshold sampling-based model based on mean crash estimates and confidence intervals. This study demonstrates the potential of using autonomous vehicle sensor data for network-level safety, enabling an efficient identification of pedestrian crash risk zones in a transport network.

AB This article proposes a motion planning approach for autonomous electric vehicles to generate an appropriate planned path according to the time-varying surrounding information. This approach utilizes the proposed novel sine resistance network to mesh the road with the aim of improving the planned path smoothness, which has the capability of generating a continuous-curvature planned path that contributes to tracking and reducing the jerkiness. Meanwhile, considering that the classical artificial potential field (APF) method is only suitable for the static scenarios, a bias oval APF is constructed to predict the change of relative distance between the ego vehicle and each obstacle by taking the speed information into account. The proposed planning approach can ensure that the planned path is collision-free in dynamic environments and the generated path is smooth simultaneously. Cosimulation results in CarSim and MATLAB/Simulink are provided to prove the advantage and feasibility of the proposed motion planning approach for autonomous electric vehicles.

AB Autonomous vehicles (AVs) attract a lot of attention recently. They are expected to assist/replace the human drivers in maneuvering the vehicle, thereby reducing the likelihood of road accidents caused by human error, as a means to improve the road traffic safety. However, AVs have their inherent safety and security challenges, which have to be addressed before they are ready for wide adoption. This paper presents an overview of recent research on AV safety failures and security attacks, as well as the available safety and security countermeasures. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

AB This research is based on the adaptation and validation in French of the Pedestrian Receptivity Questionnaire for Fully Autonomous Vehicles (PRQF). Faced with the emergence of numerous issues related to interactions between pedestrians and fully autonomous vehicles (FAV), this questionnaire is a reliable and scientifically valid means of collecting pedestrian experiences when they cross a road in front of an autonomous vehicle. The translation methodology of the PRQF was based on a committee approach, which consisted of asking several bilingual experts to come to an agreement on a consensual translation. The validation of the French PRQF (F-PRQF) was based on the completion of 584 questionnaires. Different psychometric tests were carried out, including an accuracy analysis, a principal component factor analysis (PCA) and a confirmatory factor analysis (CFA). Our results show that the F-PQRF displays satisfactory psychometric qualities, in particular in terms of internal consistency (alpha = 0.932 and omega = 0.935). We also find a scale with five components, which confirms the theoretical model structure of the original scale. The F-PRQF showed good psychometric qualities, which should thus facilitate research in fully autonomous vehicles among French-speaking audiences.

AB Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) and autonomous vehicle (AV) technologies are gaining popularity due to their key benefits that include, but are not limited to, infrastructure independence, scalability, and autonomy. Although UAV and AV technologies are vertical; nevertheless, from the services and applications standpoint, these technologies handsomely complement each other. More precisely, the shortcomings faced by AV technology such as real-time navigation, visibility, mapping, content uploading, and maneuvering could be supported by UAV technology. Moreover, security plays a crucial role in the commercial deployment of AVs. This article focuses on the role of futuristic technologies in securing such a critical environment. Specifically, we focus on the data-related security for which blockchain is leveraged. The role of other enabling technologies, such as artificial intelligence, in providing security to the integrated UAV-AV has also been discussed. Finally, we identify the outstanding research and development challenges that will provide new research avenues for the research community.

AB A planar motion control system is proposed for autonomous vehicles not only to follow the lanes, but also to avoid collisions by braking, accelerating, and steering. The supervisor is designed first to determine the desired speed and the risk of the maneuvering due to road boundaries and obstacles. In order to allow lane changes on multi-lane roads, the model predictive controller is formulated based on the probabilistic non-convex optimization. The micro-genetic algorithm is applied to calculate the target speed and target steering angle in real time. A software-in-the-loop unit is constructed with the Rapid Control Prototyping device in the vehicle communication environment. The performance of the proposed system is verified for various collision avoidance scenarios and the simulation results demonstrate the safe and effective driving performance of autonomous vehicles with no collision on multi-lane road.

AB This paper describes a real-time motion planner based on the drivers' visual behavior-guided rapidly exploring random tree (RRT) approach, which is applicable to on-road driving of autonomous vehicles. The primary novelty is in the use of the guidance of drivers' visual search behavior in the framework of RRT motion planner. RRT is an incremental sampling-based method that is widely used to solve the robotic motion planning problems. However, RRT is often unreliable in a number of practical applications such as autonomous vehicles used for on-road driving because of the unnatural trajectory, useless sampling, and slow exploration. To address these problems, we present an interesting RRT algorithm that introduces an effective guided sampling strategy based on the drivers' visual search behavior on road and a continuous-curvature smooth method based on B-spline. The proposed algorithm is implemented on a real autonomous vehicle and verified against several different traffic scenarios. A large number of the experimental results demonstrate that our algorithm is feasible and efficient for on-road autonomous driving. Furthermore, the comparative test and statistical analyses illustrate that its excellent performance is superior to other previous algorithms.

TI Evaluating the Impacts of Optimization Horizon on the Shared Autonomous

AB With the development of technology, shared autonomous vehicles may become one of the main traffic modes in the future. Especially, shared autonomous vehicle reservation system, commuting, and other trips with fixed departure time mostly submit their travel requests in advance. Therefore, it is important to reasonably match shared autonomous vehicles and reservation demands. In this paper, reservation requests are divided into short-term and long-term requests by inputting requests in a more realistic way. An integer linear programming model considering operator scheduling cost and system service level is established. A detailed scheme considering rolling horizon continuity and ridesharing is used to improve the dispatching result. Based on traffic data in Delft, the Netherlands, 164 scenarios are tested in which the parking cost, fuel cost, ridesharing effect, service level, and network size are analyzed. The results show that a better relocation and ridesharing matching scheme can be obtained when the rolling horizon is small, while the overall effect is better when the rolling horizon is large. Moreover, the buffer time, distance, and travel time limit for vehicle relocation should be selected according to the request quantity and the calculation time requirement. The result can provide a suggestion for the dispatching of shared autonomous vehicle reservation system with ridesharing.

ID AUV NAVIGATION
AB In this paper, a distributed shell-space decomposition (DSSD) scheme is proposed for rendezvous trajectory planning of multiple autonomous marine vehicles (AMVs); this category of vehicle includes both autonomous underwater vehicles and autonomous surface vessels. The DSSD extends the concept of shell-space decomposition (SSD) by generating multiple sets of shells radiating out from the starting position of each vehicle to the rendezvous destination, enabling each vehicle to generate its trajectory within its own SSD subset. This scheme is combined with an optimized mass-center rendezvous-point selection scheme, together with a B-spline-based quantum particle swarm optimization technique to find optimal rendezvous trajectories for multiple AMVs with minimal travel time and simultaneous time of arrival for all the participating vehicles. The path planner identifies the optimal rendezvous location and generates the corresponding rendezvous trajectories based on the capabilities of each vehicle and the dynamics of the ocean environment. Simulation results show that the proposed DSSD method, combined with a novel optimized mass-center rendezvous-point selection scheme, is able to find trajectories for multiple AMVs that ensure that they reach their common destination simultaneously and with optimized time/energy consumption. A set of representative Monte Carlo simulations were run to analyze the performance of these path planners for multiple AMVs rendezvous. The results demonstrate the inherent robustness and superiority of the proposed planner based on the combined DSSD method and optimized mass-center rendezvous-point selection scheme, in comparison with other techniques.

AB Recent advances in the research of autonomous vehicles have showed a vast range of applications, such as exploration, surveillance and environmental monitoring. Considering the mining industry, it is possible to use such vehicles in the prospection of minerals of commercial interest beneath the ground. However, tasks such as geophysical surveys are highly dependent on specific sensors, which mostly are not designed to be used in these new range of autonomous vehicles. In this work, we propose a novel magnetic survey pipeline that aims to increase versatility, speed and robustness by using autonomous rotary-wing Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs). We also discuss the development of a state-of-the-art three-axis fluxgate, where our goal in this work was to refine and adjust the sensor topology and coupled electronics specifically for this type of vehicle and application. The sensor was built with two ring-cores using a specially developed stress-annealed CoFeSiB amorphous ribbon, in order to get sufficient resolution to detect concentrations of small ferrous minerals. Finally, we report on the results of experiments performed with a real UAV in an outdoor environment, showing the efficacy of the methodology in detecting an artificial ferrous anomaly.

AB With the likelihood of autonomous vehicle technologies in public transport and taxi systems increasing, their impact on commuting in real-world road networks is insufficiently studied. In this study, an agent-based model is developed to simulate how commuters travel by autonomous taxis (aTaxis) in real-world road networks. The model evaluates the travel costs and environmental implications of substituting conventional personal vehicle travel with aTaxi travel. The proposed model is applied to the city of Ann Arbor, Michigan, to demonstrate the effectiveness of aTaxis. The results indicate that to meet daily commute demand with wait times less than 3 min, the optimized autonomous taxi fleet size is only 20% of the conventional solo-commuting personal car fleet. Commuting cost decreases by 38%, and daily vehicle utilization increases from 14 to 92 min When using internal combustion engine aTaxis, energy consumption, greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, and SO2 emissions are respectively 16, 25, and 10% higher than conventional solo commuting, mainly because of unoccupied repositioning between trips. Given the emission intensity of the local electricity grid, the environmental impacts of electric aTaxis do not show significant improvement over conventional vehicles.

AB Visual-inertial odometry is a fundamental technology exploited by autonomous vehicles and mobile robots to determine their position in unknown environments. Indeed, many techniques have been proposed for monocular and stereo cameras. State-of-the-art autonomous vehicles, however, are equipped with multiple cameras covering the entire vehicle environment. We present here MIxture of eXperts Odometry (MIXO), a data-driven, machine learning-based technique that loosely combines odometry outputs from multiple cameras to obtain a more accurate and robust global estimate. It stems from the intuition that each camera provides an optimal vantage point in specific driving scenarios. In MIXO, each camera (or expert) is individually processed by a state-of-the-art visual odometry algorithm (e.g., ORB-SLAM2). Then, the odometry estimates are mixed by a gating network, which selects the locally optimal experts in the current operational conditions and weights their contributions accordingly. MIXO is a lightweight module that can be easily implemented on top of any visual odometry algorithm. Experimental results on real-life data from autonomous vehicles show that MIXO achieves more robust and accurate results than any single camera, reducing the absolute rotational and translation error by 38% and 15%, respectively.

AB This paper describes how Automated Mining Systems (AMS) is evolving the state-of-the-art in guidance systems for autonomous underground vehicles. The techniques, trade-offs, and lessons learned from these systems are described, including the safety regime that has been implemented.
   First generation autonomous guidance systems for underground vehicles relied on infrastructure for the vehicle to follow. However, there are additional costs associated with that approach.
   The current generation uses a pair of laser range finders as its only guidance sensors. This system uses a minimum of infrastructure, in the form of a redundant system of location referencing. Advanced steering and drive control algorithms are incorporated into this generation of system.
   The next generation of infrastructureless guidance systems will be based on a 3D vision sensor, which was originally developed for autonomous Mars rovers and is being adapted for underground mining use., Results of early underground field trials are presented, along with a description of this emerging technology.

ID DRIVER MODEL
AB With the rapid development of autonomous driving technology, both self-driven and human-driven vehicles will share roads in the future and complex information exchange among vehicles will be required. Therefore, autonomous vehicles need to behave as similar to human drivers as possible, to ensure that their behavior can be effectively understood by the drivers of other vehicles and be more in line with the cognition of humans on driving behavior. Therefore, this paper studies the evaluation function of human drivers, using the method of inverse reinforcement learning, aiming for the learned behavior to better imitate the behavior of human drivers. At the same time, this paper proposes a semi-Markov model, to extract the intentions of surrounding related vehicles and divides them into defensive and cooperative, leading the vehicle to adopt a reasonable response to different types of driving scenarios.

AB The traditional potential field-based path planning is likely to generate unexpected path by strictly following the minimum potential field, especially in the driving scenarios with multiple obstacles closely distributed. A hybrid path planning is proposed to avoid the unsatisfying path generation and to improve the performance of autonomous driving by combining the potential field with the sigmoid curve. The repulsive and attractive potential fields are redesigned by considering the safety and the feasibility. Based on the objective of the shortest path generation, the optimized trajectory is obtained to improve the vehicle stability and driving safety by considering the constraints of collision avoidance and vehicle dynamics. The effectiveness is examined by simulations in multiobstacle dynamic and static scenarios. The simulation results indicate that the proposed method shows better performance on vehicle stability and ride comfortability than that of the traditional potential field-based method in all the examined scenarios during the autonomous driving.

AB An open-source vehicle automation methodology, and platform for road vehicles (cars, and trucks) is presented. The platform hardware, and software, based on the Robot Operating System (ROS), are detailed. Two strategies are discussed for enabling the remote control of a vehicle (in this case, an electric 2013 Ford Focus). The first approach used digital filtering of Controller Area Network (CAN) messages. In the case of the test vehicle, this approach allowed for the control of acceleration from a tap-point on the CAN bus, and the OBD-II port. The second approach, based on the emulation of the analog output(s) of a vehicle's accelerator pedal, brake pedal, and steering torque sensors, is more generally applicable and, in the test vehicle, allowed for the full control vehicle acceleration, braking, and steering. To demonstrate the utility of the methodology, and platform for vehicle automation research, a very basic low-level velocity, and steering controllers are developed. Additionally a high level path following algorithm was developed. Finally, the system is validated experimentally.

AB Cooperative perception improves awareness for various traffic situations by connecting autonomous vehicles to each other as well as to the surrounding environment. Overcoming the line-of-sight challenge due to the limi-tations of vehicle's local sensors is of great importance. However, inefficient solutions can quickly lead to depletion of the limited communication resources. This is critical, especially that the dominant CV2X (Cellular Vehicle to Everything) technology witnesses unprecedented growth in the number and density of connected smart devices. To this end, this paper provides a new centralized cooperative perception approach using CV2X. The system uses vehicle trajectories to prioritize messages communicated messages. Through the basestation (BS), the system prioritizes message requests while being constrained by the available network resources. This system is then implemented and evaluated using 1000 different traffic scenarios. These scenarios are generated using both SUMO (Simulation of Urban MObility) traffic simulator and a new implemented camera simulator used to represent the vehicle's sensors' abilities to perceive the surrounding environment. Results show that the system, on average, can execute at least 95% of the total message values using only 100 physical resource blocks for CV2X regardless of the autonomous vehicle densities. This is very robust especially for congested networks as the number of messages requests executed varies between 65% to 95% given the different autonomous vehicle densities. To the best of our knowledge, this work is the first to use vehicle trajectories to jointly select messages for transmission and allocate RBs (Resource Blocks).

ID AUTOMATION
AB Autonomous vehicles technology is an emerging area and has attracted lots of recognition in recent times. Accidents-free driving has always been the focal point of autonomous vehicles. Autonomous vehicles have the potential to eliminate human errors while driving, which has been argued as the predominant cause of traffic accidents. In autonomous vehicles technologies, a variety of efforts have been made to eliminate human drivers. The full elimination of humans is not possible at this moment, but some of the tasks can be automated to facilitate the drivers. In this paper, we investigate the leading causes of accidents based on UK vehicle safety data of 2017-2018. We analyze the data and investigate the leading factors which cause traffic crashes. Based on the leading features in the dataset, we then run different prediction algorithms to predict the severity of accidents under a given input feature set. The accuracy of the model with Decision Tree classifier, Random Forest, and Logistic Regression are compared, and it has been found that Random Forest performs best among others with 95% accuracy. The trained random forest model is deployed on the Internet of Things server based on Arduino, and a lightweight application is developed to get the vital data from the driver. The data is applied to the trained model to predict the risk index of driving. This application is lightweight but yet provide a significant contribution in terms of safety in autonomous vehicles.

AB Information flow topology plays a crucial role in the control of connected autonomous vehicles. This paper proposes an approach to search for the Pareto optimal information flow topology off-line for the control of connected vehicles' platoon using a non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm. Based on the obtained Pareto optimal information flow topology, the platoon's overall performance in terms of three main performance indices: tracking index, acceleration standard deviation, and fuel consumption, are all improved. Numerical simulations are used to validate the effectiveness of the proposed approach. In the simulation, the impact of different information flow topologies on the performance of the connected autonomous vehicles platoon is firstly investigated. The results show that more communication links can lead to better tracking ability. The smoothness of the velocity profile is consistent with fuel economy, while velocity profile's smoothness, fuel economy and communication efficiency are in contrary to the tracking index. Then, five cases are discussed using the Pareto optimal information flow topology. The results indicate that while ensuring the platoon's stability, the obtained Pareto optimal information flow topology can improve the tracking ability by 33.67% to 49.35%, and fuel economy by 7.181% to 16.93% and driving comfort up to 14.9%.

AB This paper presents a sliding mode-based adaptive fault detection and emergency control algorithm for implementation in fail-safe systems of autonomous vehicles. The overall algorithm is comprised of a fault detection part and a fail-safe control part. For the former, sliding mode observer-based fault detection algorithms were developed for environment and chassis sensors, including LiDAR, Radar, and acceleration sensors. Unidentified fault signals from the sensors are reconstructed through the adaptive sliding mode observer. The reconstruction is based on the MIT rule through the use of an estimated sensitivity parameter. For the latter, a sliding mode control (SMC)-based emergency control method designed to respond to fault occurrences has been proposed to ensure the functional safety of autonomous vehicles. An adaptive gain parameter was designed, taking convergence time into consideration, to secure consistent and rapid responses from the controller. When the detection algorithm detects a fault, the appropriate control input is computed by a lower controller for the vehicle. This control input is calculated based on the last scene information obtained from an upper controller. The performance of the proposed fault detection and control algorithms has been evaluated through simulations and actual vehicle tests of various scenarios.

AB Companies developing automated driving system (ADS) technologies have spent heavily in recent years to conduct live testing of autonomous vehicles operating in real world environments to ensure their reliable and safe operations. However, the unexpected onset and ongoing resurgent effects of the Covid-19 pandemic starting in March 2020 has serve to halt, change, or delay the achievement of these new product development test objectives. This study draws on data obtained from the California automated vehicle test program to determine the extent that testing trends, test resumptions, and test environments have been affected by the pandemic. The importance of government policies to support and enable autonomous vehicles development during pandemic conditions is highlighted.

AB It appears clear that the future of road transport is going through enormous changes (intelligent transport systems), the main one being the Intelligent Vehicle (IV). Automated driving requires a huge research effort in multiple technological areas: sensing, control, and driving algorithms. We present a comprehensible and reliable platform for autonomous driving technology development as well as for testing purposes, developed in the Intelligent Vehicles Lab at the Technical University of Cartagena. We propose an open and modular architecture capable of easily integrating a wide variety of sensors and actuators which can be used for testing algorithms and control strategies. As a proof of concept, this paper presents a reliable and complete navigation application for a commercial vehicle (Renault Twizy). It comprises a complete perception system (2D LIDAR, 3D HD LIDAR, ToF cameras, Real-Time Kinematic (RTK) unit, Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU)), an automation of the driving elements of the vehicle (throttle, steering, brakes, and gearbox), a control system, and a decision-making system. Furthermore, two flexible and reliable algorithms are presented for carrying out global and local route planning on board autonomous vehicles.

ID ROUNDABOUTS
AB To control autonomous vehicles (AVs) in urban unsignalized intersections is a challenging problem, especially in a hybrid traffic environment where self-driving vehicles coexist with human driving vehicles. In this study, a coordinated control method with proximal policy optimization (PPO) in Vehicle-Road-Cloud Integration System (VRCIS) is proposed, where this control problem is formulated as a reinforcement learning (RL) problem. In this system, vehicles and everything (V2X) was used to keep communication between vehicles, and vehicle wireless technology can detect vehicles that use vehicles and infrastructure (V2I) wireless communication, thereby achieving a cost-efficient method. Then, the connected and autonomous vehicle (CAV) defined in the VRCIS learned a policy to adapt to human driving vehicles (HDVs) across the intersection safely by reinforcement learning (RL). We have developed a valid, scalable RL framework, which can communicate topologies that may be dynamic traffic. Then, state, action and reward of RL are designed according to urban unsignalized intersection problem. Finally, how to deploy within the RL framework was described, and several experiments with this framework were undertaken to verify the effectiveness of the proposed method.

AB This paper presented a novel adaptive cascade nonlinear trajectory tracking control scheme of over-actuated autonomous electric vehicles involving input saturation. First, a nonlinear vehicle dynamic model with input saturation is established, which can accurately describe the features of uncertainties and coupling of autonomous electric vehicles, and the hyperbolic tangent function is designed to estimate the saturation function for dealing with the input saturation problem. Then, a novel adaptive cascade trajectory tracking control scheme is designed. An adaptive neural network-based terminal sliding control law is proposed for producing the generalized force/moment in real-time, the asymptotic stability of this adaptive control system is proven by Lyapunov theory, and a quasi-newton distribution law is designed to determine the optimum tire forces that guarantee the actual generalized forces/moment are close to the desired values. Finally, simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed control scheme.

AB Autonomous Vehicles (AVs) have caught people's attention in recent years, not only from an academic or developmental viewpoint but also because of the wide range of applications that these vehicles may entail, such as intelligent mobility and logistics, as well as for industrial purposes, among others. The open literature contains a variety of works related to the subject. They employ a diversity of techniques ranging from probabilistic to ones based on Artificial Intelligence. The increase in computing capacity, well known to many, has opened plentiful opportunities for the algorithmic processing needed by these applications, making way for the development of autonomous navigation, in many cases with astounding results. The following paper presents a low-cost but high-performance minimal sensor open architecture implemented in a modular vehicle. It was developed in a short period of time, surpassing many of the currently available solutions found in the literature. Diverse experiments were carried out in the controlled and circumscribed environment of an autonomous circuit that demonstrates the efficiency of the applicability of the developed solution.

AB Computationally efficient design conceptualization models are proposed for automated unit load storage and retrieval systems based on autonomous vehicle technology. Vehicle and lift travel times and the probability distribution for 12 service scenarios occurring under realistic operating assumptions are formulated and used to generate expected transaction service times. Additional measures of system performance including transaction waiting time and vehicle utilization are formulated for systems using random storage and point-of-service-completion dwell point rules. The models provide a practical means of predicting key aspects of system performance based on five design variables that drive the majority of system costs. They are illustrated in the context of a conceptualization study adapted from an actual system installation. (c) 2006 Published by Elsevier Inc.

AB Autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) are unmanned marine robots that have been used for a broad range of oceanographic missions. They are programmed to perform at various levels of autonomy, including autonomous behaviours and intelligent behaviours. Adaptive sampling is one class of intelligent behaviour that allows the vehicle to autonomously make decisions during a mission in response to environment changes and vehicle state changes. Having a closed-loop control architecture, an AUV can perceive the environment, interpret the data and take follow-up measures. Thus, the mission plan can be modified, sampling criteria can be adjusted, and target features can be traced. This paper presents an overview of existing adaptive sampling techniques. Included are adaptive mission uses and underlying methods for perception, interpretation and reaction to underwater phenomena in AUV operations. The potential for future research in adaptive missions is discussed.

ID RANGE-FINDER; ROBOT; LOCALIZATION
AB During autonomous navigation, environmental information and map noises at different locations may have dissimilar influence on a vehicle's localization process. This implies that the vehicle's localizability, i.e., the ability to localize itself in an environment using laser range finder (LRF) readings, varies over a given map. It is essential to take this factor into consideration when planning a path to avoid large localization errors or placing the vehicle at risk of failure to perform localization. We propose a localizability constraint (LC)-based path planning method for autonomous vehicles which plans the navigation path according to LRF sensor model of the vehicle in an effort to maintain a satisfactory level of localizability throughout the path, as well as to reduce the overall localization error. Our method is not limited to any specific algorithm in the optimization stage. Paths planned with and without IC are compared, and the influence of the LRF sensor model on planning outcomes is discussed through simulations. By conducting comparative experiments on a "JiaoLong" intelligent wheelchair in both indoor and outdoor environments, we show that the proposed method effectively lowers the localization error along the planned paths.

AB Underwater vehicles coordination and formation have attracted increasingly attentions since their great potential on the real-world applications. However, usually such vehicles are underactuated and with very different environmental difficulties, which are different from those vehicles (robots) on the land. This study proposes a novel approach to integrate potential field and interval type-2 fuzzy learning algorithm for autonomous underwater vehicles formation control based on formation system framework. For the system nonlinearity and complicated environment, support vector machine has been applied to generate optimal rules for the type-2 fuzzy systems. This approach can generate optimal and reasonable formation rules on the face of different situations through classification. Furthermore, reinforcement learning has been combined with fuzzy systems to deal with limited communication state during formation. Therefore, autonomous underwater vehicles can not only execute actions through the evaluation, but also can avoid coupling character between communication state and potential field. Finally, simulations and experiments results have been extensively performed to validate the proposed methods.

AB Autonomous vehicle field of study has seen considerable researches within three decades. In the last decade particularly, interests in this field has undergone tremendous improvement. One of the main aspects in autonomous vehicle is the path tracking control, focusing on the vehicle control in lateral and longitudinal direction in order to follow a specified path or trajectory. In this paper, path tracking control is reviewed in terms of the basic vehicle model usually used; the control strategies usually employed in path tracking control, and the performance criteria used to evaluate the controller's performance. Vehicle model is categorised into several types depending on its linearity and the type of behaviour it simulates, while path tracking control is categorised depending on its approach. This paper provides critical review of each of these aspects in terms of its usage and disadvantages/advantages. Each aspect is summarised for better overall understanding. Based on the critical reviews, main challenges in the field of path tracking control is identified and future research direction is proposed. Several promising advancement is proposed with the main prospect is focused on adaptive geometric controller developed on a nonlinear vehicle model and tested with hardware-in-the-loop (HIL). It is hoped that this review can be treated as preliminary insight into the choice of controllers in path tracking control development for an autonomous ground vehicle.

AB Cooperative formation and control of autonomous vehicles (AVs) promise increased efficiency and safety on public roads. In single-lane mixed traffic consisting of AVs and human-driven vehicles (HDVs), the prevailing platooning of multiple AVs is not the only choice for cooperative formation. In this paper, we investigate how different formations of AVs impact traffic performance from a set-function optimization perspective. We first reveal a stability invariance property and a diminishing improvement property of noncooperative formation when AVs adopt an independently designed Adaptive Cruise Control (ACC) strategy. Then, we focus on the case of cooperative formation where AVs utilize a centralized optimal controller. We further investigate the corresponding optimal formation of multiple AVs using set-function optimization. Two predominant optimal formations, i.e., uniform distribution and platoon formation, emerge from extensive numerical experiments. Interestingly, platooning might have the least potential to improve traffic performance when HDVs have poor string stability behavior. These results suggest more opportunities for cooperative formation of AVs, beyond platooning, in practical mixed traffic flow.

AB Autonomous underwater vehicles can perform seabed surveys with a higher resolution and quality than from equivalent ship-mounted sensors. Although high-grade inertial navigation systems aided by Doppler velocity logs can operate without external position references for extended durations, this may still be required to meet survey specifications. This paper presents a trajectory planning algorithm for an autonomous surface vessel with the purpose of aiding the navigation of one or multiple underwater vehicles using ultra-short baseline acoustic positioning. The trajectory planning problem is formulated as a nonlinear program for the single-vehicle tracking scenario and mixed-integer nonlinear program for tracking of multiple vehicles. In the absence of external acoustic positioning, the horizontal uncertainties of all targets increase as functions of time and heading. The optimal placement of the surface vessel is calculated by considering the propagated acoustic measurement uncertainty, which varies according to the range and direction towards the target. The trajectories are generated by minimizing the uncertainty of all targets, while also considering penalties on the control inputs and obeying vessel kinematics. The approach is demonstrated through a series of simulations.

AB Driving is a combination of continuous mental risk assessment, sensory awareness, and judgment, all adapting to extremely variable surrounding conditions. Several research projects are working on autonomous vehicle to robotize this complex task. The work presented in this paper focuses on reactive local trajectory planning in uncertain environment. The environment uncertainty is one of the challenges that we face in trajectory planning. For autonomous vehicle, to be efficient, they need to be able to deal with this kind of uncertainty. In this paper, we show that the theory of belief functions with its ability to distinguish between different types of uncertainty is able to provide significant advantages in the context of trajectory planning. Using the belief functions, we build evidential grid that represents the surrounding environment. To plan a local trajectory, we generate a set of clothoid tentacles in the egocentred reference frame related to the ego-vehicle. Those tentacles represent possible trajectories that consider the current dynamical state of the vehicle and make a smooth variation in the vehicle dynamic variables. Once the representation of the environment and the possible trajectories are generated, an evaluation of each trajectory is carried out according to several criteria and the choice of the trajectory is made using the decision formalism of Markov decision process. To demonstrate the effectiveness of our evidential approach, we apply it to scenarios where ego-vehicle has to make decision in uncertain dynamical environments, using a driving simulator (SCANeR (TM) Studio).

TI Dense reinforcement learning for safety validation of autonomous
   vehicles
SO NATURE
LA English
DT Article
AB One critical bottleneck that impedes the development and deployment of autonomous vehicles is the prohibitively high economic and time costs required to validate their safety in a naturalistic driving environment, owing to the rarity of safety-critical events(1). Here we report the development of an intelligent testing environment, where artificial-intelligencebased background agents are trained to validate the safety performances of autonomous vehicles in an accelerated mode, without loss of unbiasedness. From naturalistic driving data, the background agents learn what adversarial manoeuvre to execute through a dense deep-reinforcement-learning (D2RL) approach, in which Markov decision processes are edited by removing non-safety-critical states and reconnecting critical ones so that the information in the training data is densified. D2RL enables neural networks to learn from densified information with safety-critical events and achieves tasks that are intractable for traditional deep-reinforcement-learning approaches. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach by testing a highly automated vehicle in both highway and urban test tracks with an augmented-reality environment, combining simulated background vehicles with physical road infrastructure and a real autonomous test vehicle. Our results show that the D2RL-trained agents can accelerate the evaluation process by multiple orders of magnitude (103 to 105 times faster). In addition, D2RL will enable accelerated testing and training with other safety-critical autonomous systems.

AB By enabling autonomous vehicles (AVs) to share data while driving, 5G vehicular communications allow AVs to collaborate on solving common autonomous driving tasks. AVs often rely on machine learning models to perform such tasks; as such, collaboration requires leveraging vehicular communications to improve the performance of machine learning algorithms. This paper provides a comprehensive literature survey of the intersection between machine learning for autonomous driving and vehicular communications. Throughout the paper, we explain how vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) and vehicle-to-everything (V2X) communications are used to improve machine learning in AVs, answering five major questions regarding such systems. These questions include: 1) How can AVs effectively transmit data wirelessly on the road? 2) How do AVs manage the shared data? 3) How do AVs use shared data to improve their perception of the environment? 4) How do AVs use shared data to drive more safely and efficiently? and 5) How can AVs protect the privacy of shared data and prevent cyberattacks? We also summarize data sources that may support research in this area and discuss the future research potential surrounding these five questions.

AB Autonomous vehicles are a family of complex systems permanently connected to the rest of the world and communicating autonomously with other systems. It has a certain on-board intelligence and good decision-making autonomy. Among the challenges faced by autonomous vehicles are the detection and tracking of multi-objects in the path of the vehicle in urban areas. In this type of complex environment, one of the major issues is the ability to distinguish pedestrians from the many other objects located on the roadway. Another essential point is to be able to follow them to plan their movements and thus, if necessary, avoid contact. To solve these problems, deep learning, in particular convolutional neural networks (CNN), are considered promising solutions and give the possibility of seeing everything artificially via one or more connected cameras. To become increasingly autonomous and ensure the safe movement of high-speed vehicles, the vehicle must better perceive its environment, to reliably detect and interpret the road, vehicles, pedestrians, and traffic signs. However, accurate and real-time detection of all objects on the road is highly recommended. In this context, the aim of this paper is to propose an intelligent computer vision system for multi-object detection, tracking, and counting. An improved one-stage YOLOv4 is proposed for accurate multi-object detection and real-time support. The deep simple online real time tracker (SORT) algorithm is adopted to track and count the detected object. Numerical results show that the proposed framework outperforms other works, proving its effectiveness as an intelligent vision-based system for autonomous vehicles.

AB As self-driving or autonomous vehicles proliferate in our society, there is a need for their computing vision systems to be able to identify objects accurately, no matter the weather condition. One major concern in computer vision is improving an autonomous car's capacity to discern between the components of its environment under challenging conditions. For instance, inclement weather like fog and rain can corrupt images which eventually affect how well autonomous vehicles navigate and localise themselves. To provide an efficient and effective approach for autonomous vehicles to accurately detect objects during adverse weather conditions. The study employed the combination of two deep learning approaches, namely YOLOv7 and ESRGAN. The use of ESRGAN is to first learn from a set of training data and adjust for the unfavourable weather conditions in the images before the YOLOv7 detector performs detection of objects. The use of the ESRGAN allowed for the adaptive enhancement of each image for improved detection performance by the YOLOv7. In both good and bad weather, the employed hybrid approach (YOLOv7 + ESRGAN) works well with about 80% accuracy in detecting all objects during adverse weather conditions. We would recommend further study on the methodology utilised in this paper to tackle the trolley-dilemma problem during inclement weather.

   FRAMEWORK
AB Self-driving vehicles will soon be a reality, as main automotive companies have announced that they will sell their driving automation modes in the 2020s. This technology raises relevant controversies, especially with recent deadly accidents. Nevertheless, autonomous vehicles are still popular and attractive thanks to the improvement they represent to people's way of life (safer and quicker transit, more accessible, comfortable, convenient, efficient, and environment-friendly). This paper presents a review of motion planning techniques over the last decade with a focus on highway planning. In the context of this article, motion planning denotes path generation and decision making. Highway situations limit the problem to high speed and small curvature roads, with specific driver rules, under a constrained environment framework. Lane change, obstacle avoidance, car following, and merging are the situations addressed in this paper. After a brief introduction to the context of autonomous ground vehicles, the detailed conditions for motion planning are described. The main algorithms in motion planning, their features, and their applications to highway driving are reviewed, along with current and future challenges and open issues.

AB Since the motion of autonomous underwater vehicles is affected by ambient flow, knowledge of an environmental flow field can be used to improve the navigation of autonomous underwater vehicles. Due to imperfect knowledge of flow, the actual trajectory of an autonomous underwater vehicle deviates from the predicted trajectory. The difference between the actual and predicted trajectories is referred to as the motion-integration error, providing information of flow along the vehicle trajectory. Inspired by computerized tomography, this paper proposes motion tomography, a tomographic method for creating a fine-grid spatial map of flow based on the motion-integration error. While typical computerized tomography is a linear problem, motion tomography is a nonlinear problem because of unknown nonlinear trajectories of autonomous underwater vehicles and the dependency of the trajectories on the flow field. Therefore, motion tomography employs an iterative process consisting of two alternating steps: Trajectory tracing and flow field estimation. Starting from an initial guess of the flow field, in the trajectory tracing step, unknown nonlinear vehicle trajectories are estimated. Then, using the estimated vehicle trajectories, a spatial map of flow is constructed through either the non-parametric or parametric flow field estimation. The error bound for trajectory tracing is computed and the convergence of both the non-parametric and parametric flow field estimation algorithms is proved. Simulation and experimental data are analyzed to evaluate the performance of motion tomography when subject to changing vehicle speed and flow variability.

AB The gradual commercialization of entirely autonomous vehicles is expected to bring numerous benefits, such as structural transformation in the industry. Specifically, in maritime transportation, automobile terminals that import and export finished autos are seen to transform their current loading system into a CAV (connected automated vehicle)-loading system to accommodate autonomous vehicles. In this study, the impact of introducing a CAV-loading system to a roll-on, roll-off (RORO) ports was investigated. Simulation models were developed to test the performance of the terminal with the CAV-loading system. Then, a cost model was developed to determine the economic benefits of the CAV-loading system. The results in this study revealed that operating costs were reduced by 90%, while terminal operations were significantly improved. In addition, the study revealed that using the CAV-loading system resulted in a 12% reduction in CO2 emissions compared to that using the current loading system. The originality of this study lies in its transformative potential for an industry that heavily relies on human labor and has limited mechanization and automation. This study provides significant implications for incorporating autonomous vehicles in planned automobile terminal operations.

AB Driving through dynamically changing traffic scenarios is a highly challenging task for autonomous vehicles, especially on urban roadways. Prediction of surrounding vehicles' driving behaviors plays a crucial role in autonomous vehicles. Most traditional driving behavior prediction models work only for a specific traffic scenario and cannot be adapted to different scenarios. In addition, priori driving knowledge was never considered sufficiently. This study proposes a novel scenario-adaptive approach to solve these problems. A novel ontology model was developed to model traffic scenarios. Continuous features of driving behavior were learned by Hidden Markov Models (HMMs). Then, a knowledge base was constructed to specify the model adaptation strategies and store priori probabilities based on the scenario's characteristics. Finally, the target vehicle's future behavior was predicted considering both a posteriori probabilities and a priori probabilities. The proposed approach was sufficiently evaluated with a real autonomous vehicle. The application scope of traditional models can be extended to a variety of scenarios, while the prediction performance can be improved by the consideration of priori knowledge. For lane-changing behaviors, the prediction time horizon can be extended by up to 56% (0.76 s) on average. Meanwhile, long-term prediction precision can be enhanced by over 26%.

AB In autonomous driving, environment perception is the fundamental task for intelligent vehicles which provides the necessary environment information for other applications. The main issues in existing environment perception can be categorized into two aspects. On the one hand, all sensors are prone to measurement errors and failures. On the other hand, in complex driving environments, vehicles may encounter a variety of blind spots caused by vehicle occlusions, overlaps, and harsh weather conditions, which will cause sensors to experience low-quality data or to miss crucial environmental information. To cope with these issues, a multivehicle and multisensor (MVMS) cooperative perception method is presented to construct the occupancy grid map (OGM) of vehicles in a global view for the environment perception of autonomous driving. Distinct from existing environment perception methods, our proposed MVMS-OGM not only provides continuous geographical information but also captures and fuses continuous information with soft occupancy probabilities, resulting in more comprehensive and raw environmental information. Simulations and real-world experiments demonstrate that the proposed approach not only expands the perception range in comparison with single-vehicle sensing but also better captures the uncertainty of sensor data by fusing the occupancy probabilities with soft information.

DE Autonomous underwater vehicles; Underwater intervention; Persistent

AB Intervention autonomous underwater vehicles (I-AUVs) have the potential to open new avenues for the maintenance and monitoring of offshore subsea facilities in a cost-effective way. However, this requires challenging intervention operations to be carried out persistently, thus minimizing human supervision and ensuring a reliable vehicle behaviour under unexpected perturbances and failures. This paper describes a system to perform autonomous intervention-in particular valve-turning-using the concept of persistent autonomy. To achieve this goal, we build a framework that integrates different disciplines, involving mechatronics, localization, control, machine learning and planning techniques, bearing in mind robustness in the implementation of all of them. We present experiments in a water tank, conducted with Girona 500 I-AUV in the context of a multiple intervention mission. Results show how the vehicle sets several valve panel configurations throughout the experiment while handling different errors, either spontaneous or induced. Finally, we report the insights gained from our experience and we discuss the main aspects that must be matured and refined in order to promote the future development of intervention autonomous vehicles that can operate, persistently, in subsea facilities.

AB This paper presents the design and experimental validation of grid-based and Linear Fractional Transformation (LFT) approaches for the lateral control of autonomous vehicles. These new methodological approaches are compared together with the classical polytopic approach from the theoretical design to the real implementation on a real automated Renault ZOE vehicle. A solution is proposed to deal with both lane change and lane tracking problems, using a single LPV controller, by adapting the look-ahead distance. Each LPV controller is designed based on LPV/ $H_{infinity}$ concept. Performance comparison includes computational costs, vehicle performance (i.e. lateral tracking error or control effort optimization) and on-board integration complexity.

AB In this paper, a double-hidden-layer output feedback neural network fast nonsingular terminal sliding mode control strategy is developed for path-tracking tasks of autonomous vehicles. First, a vehicle kinematic-and-dynamic model is established to describe the vehicle's fundamental lateral dynamics in path-tracking behavior. Afterwards, detailed design procedure of the proposed controller is shown, where the control system's stability is verified in the Lyapunov sense. Finally, MATLAB-Carsim co-simulations are executed for the aim of testing the control performance. Simulation results illustrate that the designed control algorithm possesses remarkable superiority reflected in higher tracking precision, faster convergence rate and firmer robustness in comparison with a conventional sliding mode controller and a nonsingular terminal sliding mode controller.

AB Safe integration of autonomous vehicles (AVs) into the current public road system may imply potential improvements to roadway infrastructure. However, the current research effort is lacking in one of the important infrastructure to vehicle (I2V) areas, that is, roadway conditions, especially pavement friction. Motivated by the fact that pavement friction plays a critical role in safe driving for conventional vehicles and the fact that rear-end crashes are the most common type of crashes involving autonomous vehicles, this paper presents a first-of-its-kind effort to evaluate the driving safety of AVs with respect to pavement friction. An explicit relation was derived between pavement friction and traffic safety in terms of the stopping sight distance. The statistical characteristics of pavement network friction were determined from field friction measurements. A typical scenario was created to define rear-end crashes involving self-driving vehicles. The probabilities of rear-end crashes were estimated using the Monte Carlo method, and their implications were discussed. It was found that there is no urgent need to increase pavement friction requirements with respect to rear-end crashes involving self-driving vehicles. The findings may also be used to improve the extent of AV operational domains (ODs) and facilitate highway agencies to assess the readiness of road infrastructure in the form of roadway condition to support autonomous driving.

ID HANDLING QUALITIES
AB There is a lack of quantitative flying qualities assessment requirements for unmanned combat aerial vehicles. The mission-oriented flying qualities evaluation approach can make up for the deficiencies of existing flying qualities specifications. Considering the control characteristics and mission requirements of autonomous control unmanned combat aerial vehicles, flying qualities assessment tasks are designed and performance standards are developed on the basis of manned aircraft flying qualities assessment tasks. Multiple sets of mathematical simulations are performed by varying the control law parameters to investigate the relationship between the control law parameter values, closed-loop aircraft system characteristics and flying qualities levels. The simulation results and closed-loop frequency domain analysis show that the existing flying qualities guidelines for manned aircraft are not fully applicable to the flying qualities assessment of autonomous control unmanned combat aerial vehicles. It is found that the combination of the bandwidth and the phase at the bandwidth frequency can define the flying qualities requirements of autonomous control unmanned aerial vehicles. The criterion boundaries of different levels are given, and the physical reasons for the formation of boundary are analysed. Our results can be applied to flying qualities assessment and design of flight control laws for autonomous control unmanned combat aerial vehicles.

AB Path planning and tracking control are the key technologies of autonomous vehicle. The planned path and tracking results affect driving stability and safety directly. In this paper, an improved local path planning method based on model predictive control is proposed to match the variation of vehicle speed and road adhesion coefficient. A two-layer model predictive control (MPC) path planning and tracking system is further designed to validate the method and the simulation results show that the proposed solution solves the problem of excessive avoidance and reduces the lateral deviation with the reference path.

In this article, we surveyed different 6G embracing technologies such as mobile edge computing, unmanned aerial vehicles, network function virtualization, software defined networking, and artificial intelligence that can enhance the Internet of Autonomous Vehicles (IoAV) network performance comparing to existing 5G enabled solutions. Then, we highlight the convergence path of 6G and IoAV to satisfy the next generation of CAV applications. Further, we propose 6G cellular communication to support the quality of next IoAV applications. Furthermore, the article attempts to study the serious challenges in the 6G-IoAV research field and propose potential future directions.
   With the commercial deployment of 5G mobile communication systems, research discussions on next generation mobile systems (i.e., 6G) is topical. On the other hand, vehicular technologies are rapidly increasing from connected vehicles as invented by vehicle to everything to the networks of connected autonomous vehicles (CAVs). The convergence path of 6G and CAVs areas is of great importance, which is the focus of this article.image

AB This paper provides a review of path tracking strategies used in autonomous vehicle control design. Several elements of modelling process and path tracking control are examined, including the vehicle model implemented, the path tracking control algorithms used, and the criteria for evaluating the controller's performance. Path tracking control is classified into several forms based on its methodology and linearity. Vehicle models are grouped into numerous types based on the linearity and the intended behaviour to be observed. This study explores each of these strategy in terms of the applicability and disadvantages/advantages. The main challenges in the field of path tracking control are defined and future research directions are offered based on the critical reviews. Based on the entire review, a model-based controller based on a linear vehicle model and assessed with hardware-in-the-loop (HIL) is suggested. This review is aimed to serve as a starting point for determining which controllers to use in path tracking control development for an autonomous tracked vehicle.

AB Intersections have attracted wide attention owing to their complexity and high rate of traffic accidents. In the process of developing L3-and-above autonomous-driving techniques, it is necessary to solve problems in autonomous driving decisions and control at intersections. In this article, a decision-and-control method based on reinforcement learning and speed prediction is proposed to manage the conjunction of straight and turning vehicles at two-way single-lane unsignalized intersections. The key position of collision avoidance in the process of confluence is determined by establishing a road-geometry model, and on this basis, the expected speed of the straight vehicle that ensures passing safety is calculated. Then, a reinforcement-learning algorithm is employed to solve the decision-control problem of the straight vehicle, and the expected speed is optimized to direct the agent to learn and converge to the planned decision. Simulations were conducted to verify the performance of the proposed method, and the results show that the proposed method can generate proper decisions for the straight vehicle to pass the intersection while guaranteeing preferable safety and traffic efficiency.

AB Understanding how a race car driver controls a vehicle at its friction limits can provide insights into the development of vehicle safety systems. In this paper, a race car driver's behaviour inspires the design of an autonomous racing controller. The resulting controller uses the vehicle's centre of percussion (COP) to design feedforward and feedback steering. At the COP, the effects of rotation and translation from the rear tire force cancel each other out; consequently, the feedforward steering command is robust to the disturbances from the rear tire force. Using the COP also simplifies the equations of motion, as the vehicle's lateral motion is decoupled from the vehicle's yaw motion and highlights the challenge of controlling a vehicle when the rear tires are highly saturated. The resulting dynamics can be controlled with a linear state feedback based on a lane-keeping system with additional yaw damping. Utilising Lyapunov theory, the closed-loop system is shown to remain stable even when the rear tires are highly saturated. The experimental results demonstrate that an autonomous vehicle can operate at its limits while maintaining a minimal lateral error.

ID SLIDING MODE CONTROL
AB The performance of the control systems of autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) in the presence of parameter variations was studied. With an AUV working at different operating speeds and in different ocean environments, the physical parameters such as speed, hydrodynamic coefficients, or inertias may be perturbed from their nominal values. The vehicle control systems can be modeled as systems with parameter uncertainty. An existing robust control method, which uses the robustness properties of polynomials, was used for this system to calculate the permissible ranges of variation in the parameters. The method was applied to the Naval Postgraduate School AUV II and the results were verified by simulating the motion control of the vehicle under the influence of parameter perturbations.

AB In this paper, we investigate formation tracking control of autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) with model parameter uncertainties and external disturbances. The external disturbances due to the wind, waves, and ocean currents are combined with the model parameter uncertainties as a compound disturbance. Then a disturbance observer (DO) is introduced to estimate the compound disturbance, which can be achieved within a finite time independent of the initial estimation error. Based on a DO, a novel fixed-time sliding control scheme is developed, by which the follower vehicle can track the leader vehicle with all the states globally stabilized within a given settling time. The effectiveness and performance of the method are demonstrated by numerical simulations.

AB The ever-increasing number of vehicles on the road puts pressure on car manufacturers to make their car fuel-efficient. With autonomous vehicles, we can find new strategies to optimize fuels. We propose a reinforcement learning algorithm that trains deep neural networks to generate a fuel-efficient velocity profile for autonomous vehicles given road altitude information for the planned trip. Using a highly accurate industry-accepted fuel economy simulation program, we train our deep neural network model. We developed a technique for adapting the heterogeneous simulation program on top of an open-source deep learning framework, and reduced dimension of the problem output with suitable parameterization to train the neural network much faster. The learned model combined with reinforcement learning-based strategy generation effectively generated the velocity profile so that autonomous vehicles can follow to control itself in a fuel efficient way. We evaluate our algorithm's performance using the fuel economy simulation program for various altitude profiles. We also demonstrate that our method can teach neural networks to generate useful strategies to increase fuel economy even on unseen roads. Our method improved fuel economy by 8% compared to a simple grid search approach.

TI Autonomous Vehicles: Disengagements, Accidents and Reaction Times
SO PLOS ONE
LA English
DT Article
AB Autonomous vehicles are being viewed with scepticism in their ability to improve safety and the driving experience. A critical issue with automated driving at this stage of its development is that it is not yet reliable and safe. When automated driving fails, or is limited, the autonomous mode disengages and the drivers are expected to resume manual driving. For this transition to occur safely, it is imperative that drivers react in an appropriate and timely manner. Recent data released from the California trials provide compelling insights into the current factors influencing disengagements of autonomous mode. Here we show that the number of accidents observed has a significantly high correlation with the autonomous miles travelled. The reaction times to take control of the vehicle in the event of a disengagement was found to have a stable distribution across different companies at 0.83 seconds on average. However, there were differences observed in reaction times based on the type of disengagements, type of roadway and autonomous miles travelled. Lack of trust caused by the exposure to automated disengagements was found to increase the likelihood to take control of the vehicle manually. Further, with increased vehicle miles travelled the reaction times were found to increase, which suggests an increased level of trust with more vehicle miles travelled. We believe that this research would provide insurers, planners, traffic management officials and engineers fundamental insights into trust and reaction times that would help them design and engineer their systems.

The integration of Linear Parameter-Varying (LPV) control and the results of the machine learning-based analysis on the big data of autonomous vehicles is proposed. The integration is achieved in two steps. First, an estimation method on the adhesion coefficient through decision trees is presented. The result of the estimation is incorporated in the robust LPV control through a scheduling variable. During the control design, the error of the machine-learning algorithm is incorporated. Second, an optimisation method of the longitudinal velocity on a predicted horizon is proposed, which is aided with the machine learning-based reachability set approximation of the steering intervention. The effectiveness of the control strategy is illustrated through CarSim simulations.

AB In this paper, an analysis of the effect of autonomous driving vehicles on traffic breakdown in mixed traffic flow consisting of randomly distributed human driving and autonomous driving vehicles is made. Autonomous vehicles based on classical (standard) adaptive cruise control (ACC) in a vehicle and on an ACC in the framework of three-phase traffic theory (TPACC - Three-traffic-Phase ACC) introduced recently [Phys. Rev. E 97 (2018) 042303] are considered. Due to the particular importance of characteristics of traffic breakdown (transition from free traffic flow to congested traffic) for almost all approaches to traffic control and management in traffic networks, the basis of this paper is a study of the effect of autonomous vehicles on the probability of traffic breakdown and on stochastic highway capacity in mixed traffic flow. We show that within a wide range of dynamic parameters of classical ACC, the ACC-vehicles can deteriorate the traffic system considerably while initiating traffic breakdown and reducing highway capacity at a bottleneck. Contrarily, in the same range of parameters of dynamic rules of TPACC, the TPACC-vehicles either do not effect on traffic characteristics or sometimes can even improve them. To understand physical reasons for the effect of classical ACC- and TPACC-vehicles on traffic breakdown, we introduce a model of ACC that can be considered a combination of dynamic features of classical ACC and TPACC. With the use of this model, we find how the amplitude of a local speed disturbance caused by the ACC in a vicinity of a bottleneck and the probability of traffic breakdown depends on the dynamic parameters of the ACC. To emphasize that the deterioration of the characteristics of mixed traffic flow through classical ACC-vehicles is not associated with a well-known effect of string instability of platoons of autonomous vehicles, we limit by a consideration of only such classical ACC-vehicles whose platoon satisfies condition for string stability.

AB In this paper, we propose an information-based approach to eliminate inefficiency in traffic systems in the era of autonomous vehicles. We build up theoretical models to coordinate vehicles through Waze, a pervasive crowdsourcing mapping app. We apply the idea of Bayesian persuasion (Kamenica and Gentzkow, 2011) in the basic model of a single vehicle and implement the unified information design framework (Bergemann and Morris, 2017) in the general model. Since the reliability of the information source (Waze) is crucial, we also incorporate queueing theory into the congestion model to obtain more accurate predictions of the traffic conditions. We demonstrate the significant efficiency improvement of implementing theoretical economic approach in the robotic area. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Terrestrial-aerial bimodal vehicles bloom in both academia and industry because they incorporate both the highmobility of aerial vehicles and the long endurance of ground vehicles. In this work, we present an autonomous and adaptive navigation framework to bring complete autonomy to this class of vehicles. The framework mainly includes 1) a hierarchical motion planner that generates safe and low-power terrestrial-aerial trajectories in unknown environments and 2) a unified motion controller which dynamically adjusts energy consumption in terrestrial locomotion. Extensive real-world experiments and benchmark comparisons are conducted on a customized robot platform to validate the proposed framework's robustness and performance. During the tests, the robot safely traverses complex environments with terrestrial-aerial integrated mobility, and achieves 7x energy savings in terrestrial locomotion. Finally, we will release our code and hardware configuration for the reference of the community.

ID RECOGNITION
AB Trajectory prediction of surrounding vehicles is a critical task for connected and autonomous vehicles (CAVs), helping them to realize potential dangers in the traffic environment and make the most appropriate decisions. In a practical traffic environment, vehicles may affect each other, and the trajectories may have multi-modality and uncertainty, which makes accurate trajectory prediction a challenge. In this paper, we propose an interactive network model based on long short-term memory (LSTM) and a convolutional neural network (CNN) with a trajectory correction mechanism, using our newly proposed probability forcing method. The model learns the interactions between vehicles and corrects their trajectories during the prediction process. The output is a multimodal distribution of predicted trajectories. In the experimental evaluation of the US-101 and I-80 Next-Generation Simulation (NGSIM) real highway datasets, our proposed method outperforms other contrast methods.

AB It is extremely important for autonomous vehicles to automatically complete refueling and various other tasks. However, most of the existing approaches are only suitable for conventional vehicles with large fuel tank, while the routing performance degrades, especially for electric vehicles and aerial vehicles that are constrained by small fuel capacity. This paper proposes a fuel-aware routing framework for autonomous vehicle that is employed for uninterruptedly visiting targets in logistics industry. By decoupling the topology representation and optimization process, the framework can express various optimization objectives, such as fuel consumption, trip delay and refueling cost, in a consistent way. For the fixed-path refueling problem, we propose an iterative method to improve the routing efficiency by minimizing unnecessary fuel reservation and design an efficient online solution to make trade off between routing efficiency and computation complexity. For the tour refueling problem, we propose a two-stage approach, which can simplify the routing calculation based on the solution to the fixed-path refueling problem. The simulation results demonstrate that the proposed scheme outperforms the alternative approaches in terms of both routing efficiency and computation complexity, while supporting for joint optimization of multiple objectives.

AB In this article, we introduce a learning-based vision dynamics approach to nonlinear model predictive control (NMPC) for autonomous vehicles, coined learning-based vision dynamics (LVD) NMPC. LVD-NMPC uses an a-priori process model and a learned vision dynamics model used to calculate the dynamics of the driving scene, the controlled system's desired state trajectory, and the weighting gains of the quadratic cost function optimized by a constrained predictive controller. The vision system is defined as a deep neural network designed to estimate the dynamics of the image scene. The input is based on historic sequences of sensory observations and vehicle states, integrated by an augmented memory component. Deep Q-learning is used to train the deep network, which once trained can also be used to calculate the desired trajectory of the vehicle. We evaluate LVD-NMPC against a baseline dynamic window approach (DWA) path planning executed using standard NMPC and against the PilotNet neural network. Performance is measured in our simulation environment GridSim, on a real-world 1:8 scaled model car as well as on a real size autonomous test vehicle and the nuScenes computer vision dataset.

AB This paper discusses dynamic control design for automated driving of vision-based autonomous vehicles, with a special focus on the coordinated steering and braking control in emergency obstacle avoidance. An autonomous vehicle is a complex multi-input and multi-output (MIMO) system, which possesses the features of parameter uncertainties and strong nonlinearities, and the coupled phenomena of longitudinal and lateral dynamics are evident in a combined cornering and braking maneuver. In this work, an effective coordinated control system for automated driving is proposed to deal with these coupled and nonlinear features and reject the disturbances. First, a vision algorithm is constructed to detect the reference path and provide the local location information between vehicles and reference path in real time. Then, a novel coordinated steering and braking control strategy is proposed based on the nonlinear backstepping control theory and the adaptive fuzzy sliding-mode control technique, and the asymptotic convergence of the proposed coordinated control system is proven by the Lyapunov theory. Finally, experimental tests manifest that the proposed control strategy possesses favorable tracking performance and enhances the riding comfort and stability of autonomous vehicles.

AB Safe path planning for obstacle avoidance in autonomous vehicles has been developed. Based on the Rapidly Exploring Random Trees (RRT) algorithm, an improved algorithm integrating path pruning, smoothing, and optimization with geometric collision detection is shown to improve planning efficiency. Path pruning, a prerequisite to path smoothing, is performed to remove the redundant points generated by the random trees for a new path, without colliding with the obstacles. Path smoothing is performed to modify the path so that it becomes continuously differentiable with curvature implementable by the vehicle. Optimization is performed to select a "near"-optimal path of the shortest distance among the feasible paths for motion efficiency. In the experimental verification, both a pure pursuit steering controller and a proportional-integral speed controller are applied to keep an autonomous vehicle tracking the planned path predicted by the improved RRT algorithm. It is shown that the vehicle can successfully track the path efficiently and reach the destination safely, with an average tracking control deviation of 5.2% of the vehicle width. The path planning is also applied to lane changes, and the average deviation from the lane during and after lane changes remains within 8.3% of the vehicle width.

AB In this article we present a trajectory generation method for autonomous overtaking of unexpected obstacles in a dynamic urban environment. In these settings, blind spots can arise from perception limitations. For example when overtaking unexpected objects on the vehicle's ego lane on a two-way street. In this case, a human driver would first make sure that the opposite lane is free and that there is enough room to successfully execute the maneuver, and then it would cut into the opposite lane in order to execute themaneuver successfully. We consider the practical problem of autonomous overtaking when the coverage of the perception system is impaired due to occlusion. Safe trajectories are generated by solving, in real-time, a non-linear constrained optimization, formulated as a receding horizon planner that maximizes the ego vehicle's visibility. The planner is complemented by a high-level behavior planner, which takes into account the occupancy of other traffic participants, the information from the vehicle's perception system, and the risk associated with the overtaking maneuver, to determine when the overtake maneuver should happen. The approach is validated in simulation and in experiments in real world traffic.

AB This article presents a complete kinematic and dynamic modeling and trajectory tracking control of an autonomous tracked vehicle. First, based on the vehicle's kinematics, the reference linear and angular velocities are evaluated. The kinematic controller is proposed as an integrated backstepping controller. Then, based on vehicle dynamics and slipping characteristics, an integral sliding mode control is utilized to get the desired vehicle drive torques and converge its trajectory to the desired one. Whereas the controller gains are optimally calculated. Furthermore, based on the Lyapunov stability, the proof of stability for proposed controllers is presented. Finally, simulation results are conducted to validate the effectiveness of the proposed control algorithm compared with a hybrid backstepping-modified proportional-integral-derivative dynamic controller and a nonlinear feedback acceleration controller.

AB In the Intelligent Transportation Systems Community, the research interest in intelligent and autonomous vehicles is increasing during the last few years. Accordingly, this paper presents the advances in the development of a ROS-based (Robot Operating System) software architecture for intelligent vehicles. The main contribution of the architecture is its powerfulness (in the aspect of complete architecture managing the navigation, synchronization, communication, cooperation, ground station, web server, sound system), flexibility (due to the fact that autonomous vehicles evolve exponentially where new sensors or algorithms emerge every day), and modularity (in the form of interchangeability and replaceability for new modules), which allow researchers to develop and test different algorithms easily and faster. The architecture has been tested on two real platforms such as the iCab (Intelligent Campus Automobile) and Ivvl 2.0 vehicle (Intelligent Vehicle based on Visual Information) The first one is a full y autonomous vehicle and the second one provides Advance Driver Assistance. Additionally, it is shown the use case for the iCab project where the scope is focused on the critical element of navigation. The use case exposed proves the benefits of using this architecture over a centralized one. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB This paper proposes an initial-rectification neuroadaptive finite-time control scheme to solve the surge motion tracking control problem of an autonomous underwater vehicle with input saturation. Compared to the mass of autonomous underwater vehicles, the input gain of control system is very small, which makes the control system designed based on traditional control strategies prone to overload. To remedy this difficulty, initial rectification approach of reference trajectory and anti-windup design strategy are adopted meanwhile in this work. A finite-time adaptive neural control law is derived by using backstepping adaptive control approach, which employs an adaptive neural network to approximate uncertainties, and constructs two finite-time differentiators to estimate the derivatives of virtual control signals for lowering the design difficulty. Unlike many existing adaptive control results, the proposed adaptive neural controller guarantees that the initial-rectification tracking error converges to a small neighbour of the origin during a finite time. The control performance is verified through a comparative numerical simulation.

DE docking; autonomous underwater vehicles; nonlinear control
AB This paper presents a novel integrated guidance and control strategy for docking of autonomous underwater vehicles. The approach to the base, and hence the control design, is divided in two steps: (i) in the first, at higher speed, the vehicle dynamics is assumed to be underactuated, and an appropriate control law is derived to steer the vehicle towards the final docking path, achieving convergence to zero of the appropriate error variables for almost all initial conditions; (ii) in the second stage, at low speed, the vehicle is assumed to be fully actuated, and a robust control law is designed that achieves convergence to zero of the appropriate error variables for all initial conditions, in the presence of parametric model uncertainty. Simulations are presented illustrating the performance of the proposed controllers, including model uncertainty and sensor noise. Copyright (c) 2014 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB Within the next decade, society will be revolutionized by the presence of almost completely autonomous vehicles on our roadways. The amount of traffic fatalities will decrease, road congestion will disappear, and people will be able to watch their favorite Netflix show while on the way to work. This Note critically analyzes the current regulatory gap in autonomous vehicle technology, with a focus on problems arising from a patchwork of state laws and the lack of federal regulation. At this critical juncture in time, consumers are distrustful and hesitant of the technology. This Note argues that the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration should pass new manufacturing and safety standards to fill the regulatory gap and assure consumers that autonomous vehicles are both viable and safe. Failure to create national regulation will see the dream of robotic cars filling the roads go up into smoke.

AB To address the problems of inefficient agricultural production and labor shortages, there has been active research to develop autonomously driven agricultural machines, using advanced sensors and ICT technology. Autonomously driven speed sprayers can also reduce accidents such as the pesticide poisoning of farmers, and vehicle overturn that frequently occur during spraying work in orchards. To develop a commercial, autonomously driven speed sprayer, we developed a prototype of an autonomously driven agricultural vehicle, and conducted performance evaluations in an orchard environment. A prototype of the agricultural vehicle was created using a rubber-tracked vehicle equipped with two AC motors. A prototype of the autonomous driving hardware consisted of a GNSS module, a motion sensor, an embedded board, and an LTE module, and it was made for less than $1000. Additional software, including a sensor fusion algorithm for positioning and a path-tracking algorithm for autonomous driving, were implemented. Then, the performance of the autonomous driving agricultural vehicle was evaluated based on two trajectories in an apple farm. The results of the field test determined the RMS, and the maximums of the path-following errors were 0.10 m, 0.34 m, respectively.

AB Ride-hailing with autonomous electric vehicles and shared autonomous electric vehicle (SAEV) systems are expected to become widely used within this decade. These electrified vehicles can be key enablers of the shift to intermittent renewable energy by providing electricity storage to the grid and offering demand flexibility. In order to accomplish this goal, practical smart charging strategies for fleets of SAEVs must be developed. In this work, we present a scalable, flexible, and practical approach to optimise the operation of SAEVs including smart charging based on dynamic electricity prices. Our approach integrates independent optimisation modules with a simulation model to overcome the complexity and scalability limitations of previous works. We tested our solution on real transport and electricity data over four weeks using a publicly available dataset of taxi trips from New York City. Our approach can significantly lower charging costs and carbon emissions when compared to an uncoordinated charging strategy, and can lead to beneficial synergies for fleet operators, passengers, and the power grid.

AB If connected and autonomous vehicles use highways under current lane management policy, only partial benefit can be reaped from the platooning of advanced vehicles. Agencies may have to update the existing policy in the near future because of the regular presence of connected and autonomous vehicles on the highways. The probable management approaches are likely to affect highway construction, rehabilitation, and fuel consumption cost. This paper studied a range of lane management approaches in terms of truck platooning and estimated construction and rehabilitation costs using existing models. It also developed a probabilistic approach of generating varying degrees of vehicle platooning to estimate fuel consumption in a simulated environment of highway segment. The results showed that, compared with a no-platoon approach, most of the approaches considered reduce construction cost but increase rehabilitation cost for a unit length of a highway. Fuel consumption cost decreases due to truck platooning with all possible approaches. If truck platooning is achieved by adding a separate truck-only lane, the fuel consumption benefits are considerably higher.

AB An integrated active steering control strategy for tractor and trailer unit of articulated vehicles is presented in order to achieve both autonomous and safe motion. The tractor and trailer controllers are designed to preview and follow the demanded path automatically and safely. Based on model predictive control (MPC) theory, the integrated active steering controller of the tractor and trailer is designed to minimise path-tracking deviation while taking lateral stability into account. The manoeuvrability and stability of the articulated vehicle under the proposed control strategy are verified by simulations at low speed and high speed, respectively. The results confirm that the proposed integrated active steering system is capable of keeping the articulated vehicle automatically following the demanded path with high stability. The lateral stability and path-tracking of both tractor and trailer are significantly improved.

AB We present a method for synthesizing animations of autonomous Space, water, and land-based vehicles in games or other interactive simulations. Controlling the motion of such vehicles to achieve a desirable behavior is difficult due to the constraints imposed by the system dynamics. We combine real-time path planning and a simplified physics model to automatically compute control actions to drive a vehicle from an input state to desirable output states based on a behavior cost function. Both offline trajectory preprocessing and online search are used to build an animation framework suitable for interactive vehicle simulations. We demonstrate synthesized animations of simulated spacecraft and automobiles performing a variety of autonomous behaviors, including Seek, Pursue, Avoid, Avoid Obstacle, and Flee. We also explore several enhancements to the basic planning algorithm and examine the resulting tradeoffs in runtime performance and quality of the generated motion. (c) 2005 Elsevier Inc.

AB This paper deals with the problem of autonomous navigation of an unmanned air vehicle towards a moving ship. The ship is moving in the horizontal plane; however, its motion is not a priori known to the air vehicle. The control laws for the flight path angle and the heading angle of the air vehicle are based on the relative kinematics equations between the vehicle and the moving ship. The goal of the control law is to drive the vertical line of sight angle to zero, while the horizontal line of sight angle tracks the heading angle of the ship. This results in a decreasing range in both the horizontal and vertical planes. The kinematics equations under the control law are derived and our results are rigorously proven. Simulation of various scenarios is carried out. (C) Koninklijke Brill NV, Leiden and The Robotics Society of Japan, 2008.

AB The emergence of connected and autonomous vehicles (CAV) is of great significance to the development of transportation systems. This paper proposes a multiple-factors aware car-following (MACF) model for CAVs with the consideration of multiple factors including vehicle co-optimization velocity, velocity difference of multiple PVs, and space headway of multiple PVs. The Next Generation Simulation (NGSIM) dataset and the genetic algorithm are used to calibrate the parameters of the model. The stability of the MACF model is first theoretically proved and then empirically verified via numerical simulation experiments. In addition, the VISSIM software is partially redeveloped based on the MACF model to analyze mixed traffic flows consisting of human-driven vehicles and CAVs. Results show that the integration of CAVs based on the MACF model effectively improves the average velocity and throughput of the system.

AB We present a combinatorial assignment algorithm for reserving space-time trajectories from origins to destinations given an ordered list of vehicles. Space-time trajectories include guaranteed arrival times at every node in the path, including at the destination. Traffic flows are modeled using the cell transmission model, a Godunov approximation to the kinematic wave model. Space-time trajectories are constructed to follow the cell transmission model constraints and first-in-first-out behavior. Reservation-based intersection control for connected autonomous vehicles, which determines intersection access and delays for individual vehicles, is used to ensure that reserved trajectories are followed. The algorithm is suitable for city networks. Results show that vehicles with higher priority tend to have much lower travel times. In addition, the trajectory reservation system reduced overall congestion in the network compared with dynamic user equilibrium assignments.

AB A stability control method for high-speed autonomous vehicles based on linear time-varying model predictive control (LTV-MPC) considering the impact of road environment is proposed. To ensure the accuracy of the prediction model and the driving stability of the vehicle, a yaw dynamics model is established considering the road curvature, lateral position deviation and tyre slip rate. In order to reduce the influence of the road environment on path following effect, the reference road is segmented by Bezier curve and the road curvature was extracted in real time. Through the analysis of the stable driving state of high-speed vehicles, the yaw stability envelope and the feasible road area envelope are established to ensure the handling stability and driving safety of vehicles.

AB Shared autonomous electric vehicle systems (SAEVS) combine autonomous driving technology with shared electric vehicle services to provide advantages over traditional shared vehicle systems, including autonomous vehicle relocation and rapid response to user needs. In this study, we seek to enhance the operational efficiency and profitability of SAEVS by considering trip selection and the potential opportunity cost associated with unmet user demands. An integer linear programming (ILP) model is developed using a spatio-temporal state network to optimize the system design planning (e.g., charging facility, vehicle fleet sizing and distribution) and operational decisions (e.g., vehicle operational relocation and trip selection strategy). To handle the computational complexities of this model, we propose a Lagrangian relaxation (LR) algorithm. The performance of the LR algorithm is evaluated through a case study. The results, along with a parameter sensitivity analysis, reveal several key findings: (i) Allocating vehicles to stations with concentrated early peak demand, distributing charging facilities to stations with high total demand throughout the day and implementing vehicle relocation after the early demand peak can mitigate uneven vehicle distribution; (ii) Implementing trip selection enhances SAEVS profitability; (iii) Increasing opportunity cost meets user demands but at the expense of reduced profit; (iv) It is recommended that SAEVS be equipped with charging facilities of suitable charging power based on operational conditions.

AB Driven by the improvements in a variety of domains, autonomous driving is becoming a reality and today, industry aims at moving toward fully autonomous vehicles. High-tech chip manufacturers are designing high-performance and energy-efficient platforms in accordance with safety standard requirements. However, the software used to implement advanced functionalities in autonomous vehicles challenges real-time constraints on those platforms. Hence, there is a clear need for industry-level autonomous driving benchmarks to evaluate platforms and systems. In this paper, we propose ADBench, a benchmarking approach and benchmark suite for state-of-the-art autonomous driving platforms, in accordance with the key modules, structural design and functions of AD systems, building on several industry-level autonomous driving systems. The use of standard benchmarks facilitates the design, verification and validation process of autonomous systems.

TI Active Disturbance Rejection Fuzzy Controller for Roll Stabilization of
   Autonomous Underwater Vehicle under Wave Disturbance
SO DISCRETE DYNAMICS IN NATURE AND SOCIETY
LA English
DT Article
AB Considering the case of autonomous underwater vehicle navigating with low speed near water surface, a new method for designing of roll motion controller is proposed in order to restrain wave disturbance effectively and improve roll stabilizing performance under different sea conditions. Active disturbance rejection fuzzy control is applied, which is based on nonlinear motion model of autonomous underwater vehicle and the principle of zero-speed fin stabilizer. Extended state observer is used for estimation of roll motion state and unknown wave disturbance. Wave moment is counteracted by introducing compensation terminto the roll control law which is founded on nonlinear feedback. Fuzzy reasoning is used for parameter adjustment of the controller online. Simulation experiments on roll motion are conducted under different sea conditions, and the results show better robustness improved by active disturbance rejection fuzzy controller of autonomous underwater vehicle navigating near water surface.

AB An autonomous braking system is designed using the prediction of the stopping distance. The stopping distance needs to be determined by considering several factors such as the desired deceleration and the speed of the hydraulic brake actuator. In particular, the actuator speed is very critical because it affects the shape of the deceleration response and it determines the accuracy of the predicted stopping distance. The autonomous braking control algorithm is designed based on the predicted stopping distance. The proposed autonomous braking system has been validated in autonomous vehicle tests and demonstrates that the subject vehicle can avoid the collision effectively.

AB The emergence of vehicle automation and its subsequent growth has led to new transport service offerings, generally known as Autonomous Mobility Services (AMS), that have the potential to replace human-operated vehicles. However, the functionalities of AMS are increasingly blurring the fine lines that currently distinguish different transport modes. For example, an autonomous shuttle bus, a form of autonomous transit, may serve a similar function as an autonomous taxi/robo-taxi, both coinciding with the concept of Shared Autonomous Mobility Services (SAMS). Even if the functionalities or operational principles are different, people may perceive sharing rides in any of these services as alike. Similarly, the absence of a human driver makes the concepts of autonomous carsharing and ridehailing similar. Hence, there is a need to review studies related to SAMS. However, few studies have attempted to perform a comprehensive review of public acceptance of SAMS. This study aims to fill this gap by reviewing studies related to public acceptability and acceptance, perception, intention to use, attitudes, mode choice and willingness constructs regarding SAMS. This review clearly distinguishes different types of SAMS while examining public's acceptability and acceptance of SAMS across five dimensions: perception about the services, intention to choose and use those over other modal alternatives, frequency of usage and willingness constructs. Overall, the results from our review indicate the presence of heterogeneity across sub-groups regarding the adoption of SAMS. Discussing the factors affecting SAMS acceptance in a detailed manner, our study serves to provide a stocktake of the progress in this genre of research.

AB Automatic text spotting can help unmanned vehicles read human texts, thus improving the safety and reliability of autonomous driving. Some existing text spotting models use inefficient region proposal networks or modules based on the recurrent neural network. Region proposal networks produce redundant anchors. Recurrent neural networks cannot perform parallel operations well. The existence of these inefficient modules prevents these models from applying in autonomous unmanned vehicles. In this paper, we propose an end-to-end two-stage text spotting model named Center TextSpotter, which is a convolution model that does not involve region proposal networks and recurrent neural network. Moreover, we develop a weakly supervised training method and a feature fusion module. The weakly supervised training method adjusts the loss by weighting the predicted labels to improve the performance of text recognition. The feature fusion module fuses the features of the proposal with the features of the proposal-context to enhance the overall performance. Our model follows the modular design principle. So it can be easily extended and modified. This paper presents an extension scheme based on graph neural network. By adding the graph neural network before the fully connected layer, the model learns better features. Experiments demonstrate that Center TextSpotter can complete the task of text spotting for autonomous unmanned vehicles commendably.

AB An important aspect of collision avoidance and driver assistance systems, as well as autonomous vehicles, is the tracking of vehicle taillights and the detection of alert signals (turns and brakes). In this paper, we present the design and implementation of a robust and computationally lightweight algorithm for a real-time vision system, capable of detecting and tracking vehicle taillights, recognizing common alert signals using a vehicle-mounted embedded smart camera, and counting the cars passing on both sides of the vehicle. The system is low-power and processes scenes entirely on the microprocessor of an embedded smart camera. In contrast to most existing work that addresses either daytime or nighttime detection, the presented system provides the ability to track vehicle taillights and detect alert signals regardless of lighting conditions. The mobile vision system has been tested in actual traffic scenes and the results obtained demonstrate the performance and the lightweight nature of the algorithm.

AB Trajectory planning and tracking control are two keys of collision avoidance for autonomous vehicles in critical traffic scenarios. It requires not only the system functionality, but also strong real-time. In this paper, we integrated trajectory planner and tracking controller for autonomous vehicle to implement trace planning and tracking for obstacle avoidance. The trajectory planner is based on the state lattice approach and the tracking controller is designed based on the model predictive control using the vehicle kinematics model. The simulation shows that the planner can generate smooth trajectories which could be selected as references for the controller. The maximum tracking error is less than 0.2 m when the vehicle speed is below 50 km/h. Additionally, the on field test shows that the test vehicle with this method is capable of following the reference path accurately, even at sharp corners.

AB Autonomous vehicles have the potential to improve link and intersection traffic behavior. Computer reaction times may admit reduced following headways and increase capacity and backwards wave speed. The degree of these improvements will depend on the proportion of autonomous vehicles in the network. To model arbitrary shared road scenarios, we develop a multiclass cell transmission model that admits variations in capacity and backwards wave speed in response to class proportions within each cell. The multiclass cell transmission model is shown to be consistent with the hydrodynamic theory. This paper then develops a car following model incorporating driver reaction time to predict capacity and backwards wave speed for multiclass scenarios. For intersection modeling, we adapt the legacy early method for intelligent traffic management (Bento et al., 2013) to general simulation-based dynamic traffic assignment models. Empirical results on a city network show that intersection controls are a major bottleneck in the model, and that the legacy early method improves over traffic signals when the autonomous vehicle proportion is sufficiently high.

AB Autonomous vehicles rely on sophisticated hardware and software technologies for acquiring holistic awareness of their immediate surroundings. Deep learning methods have effectively equipped modern self-driving cars with high levels of such awareness. However, their application requires high-end computational hardware, which makes utilization infeasible for the legacy vehicles that constitute most of today's automotive industry. Hence, it becomes inherently challenging to achieve high performance while at the same time maintaining adequate computational complexity. In this paper, a monocular vision and scalar sensor-based model car is designed and implemented to accomplish autonomous driving on a specified track by employing a lightweight deep learning model. It can identify various traffic signs based on a vision sensor as well as avoid obstacles by using an ultrasonic sensor. The developed car utilizes a single Raspberry Pi as its computational unit. In addition, our work investigates the behavior of economical hardware used to deploy deep learning models. In particular, we herein propose a novel, computationally efficient, and cost-effective approach. The designed system can serve as a platform to facilitate the development of economical technologies for autonomous vehicles that can be used as part of intelligent transportation or advanced driver assistance systems. The experimental results indicate that this model can achieve real-time response on a resource-constrained device without significant overheads, thus making it a suitable candidate for autonomous driving in current intelligent transportation systems.

AB Today, industrial robots are used in dangerous environments in all sectors, including the sustainable energy sector. Sensors and processors collect and transmit information and data from users as a result of the application of robot control systems and sensory feedback. This paper proposes that the estimation of a collaborative robot system's performance can be achieved by evaluating the mobility of robots. Scenarios have been determined in which an autonomous system has been used for intervention in crisis situations due to fire. The experimental model consists of three autonomous vehicles, two of which are ground vehicles and the other is an aerial vehicle. The conclusion of the research described in this paper highlights the fact that the integration of robotic systems made up of autonomous vehicles working in unstructured environments is difficult and at present there is no unitary analytical model.

AB Understanding public attitudes towards autonomous vehicles is an important starting point when designing and engineering future cities, both to ensure acceptance and to deliver social benefits. The GATEway project is a consortium of industry and academic organisations that are establishing a test bed for driverless vehicle technology within public streets in Greenwich, London. Each partner is using public trials to explore the potential for autonomous technology within a city transport network. The Royal College of Art (RCA) is exploring how public attitudes can be used to enhance social benefit. This paper shares the first findings from a series of workshops including people with additional needs, non-drivers, drivers, technology enthusiasts and professional stakeholders. The workshops delved into people's hopes and fears for driverless technologies and used co-design methods to explore how designers can respond when designing autonomous vehicles, the services they provide and the wider urban environment.

ID MODEL-PREDICTIVE CONTROL
AB Self-driving vehicles have experienced an increase in research interest in the last decades. Nevertheless, fully autonomous vehicles are still far from being a common means of transport. This paper presents the design and experimental validation of a processor-in-the-loop (PIL) architecture for an autonomous sports car. The considered vehicle is an all-wheel drive full-electric single-seater prototype. The retained PIL architecture includes all the modules required for autonomous driving at system level: environment perception, trajectory planning, and control. Specifically, the perception pipeline exploits obstacle detection algorithms based on Artificial Intelligence (AI), and the trajectory planning is based on a modified Rapidly-exploring Random Tree (RRT) algorithm based on Dubins curves, while the vehicle is controlled via a Model Predictive Control (MPC) strategy. The considered PIL layout is implemented firstly using a low-cost card-sized computer for fast code verification purposes. Furthermore, the proposed PIL architecture is compared in terms of performance to an alternative PIL using high-performance real-time target computing machine. Both PIL architectures exploit User Datagram Protocol (UDP) protocol to properly communicate with a personal computer. The latter PIL architecture is validated in real-time using experimental data. Moreover, they are also validated with respect to the general autonomous pipeline that runs in parallel on the personal computer during numerical simulation.

AB This paper presents a model to predict the market penetration of autonomous cars for passenger transportation, focussing on autonomous taxis without a steering wheel. For this, a discrete system dynamics model was created and evaluated where the input parameters have been taken from the literature and a survey. In this survey, user demands were investigated among 873 participants. It showed that gender, age, job situation, city size and monthly income have an impact on the trust in the technology of autonomous driving as well as on the willingness to use autonomous taxis. In contrast, no evidence of an impact was found for the respondent's education or the numbers of adults or children in the household.
   The results indicate that the majority of autonomous driving vehicles will be private and will have a steering wheel within the scope of this study, which covers the time frame until 2040. These are expected to reach 12.4 million units. At the same time, autonomous taxis will enter the market. These are expected to be mainly non-controllable (without a steering wheel), reaching a maximum of 2.4 million units by 2038. This maximum mainly depends on the trust in the technology as well as on people's willingness to give up their own car due to cost or usage factors. As an autonomous taxi supports more people on average, the total number of vehicles is expected to drop from 45.1 million to around 41.7 million by 2040. Furthermore, the percentage of people travelling primarily by taxis and public transport is expected to increase from today's 20.0% to about 32% in 2040. Then, about 19% will use autonomous taxis at least occasionally. Lastly, the vehicle miles travelled are expected to increase by 25% with people switching from public transport to autonomous taxis.

AB The new driving model of autonomous platoon has outlined the blueprint for developing the intelligent transportation of system since it can improve safe driving, alleviate traffic congestion and bring more comfortable experience. Vehicles in the platoon can communicate and share driving data with each other through vehicular network for cooperatively driving. Therefore, it is crucial to avoid some misbehavior vehicles which can eavesdrop or even tamper important data. In this paper, we propose a secure and privacy-preserving autonomous platoon setup and communication scheme, called SPSC, to help vehicles establish secure communication and avoid private information leakage. Specially, considering the dynamic and temporary characteristics of the autonomous platoon, the autonomous platoon communication can be divided into two scenarios, that is, intra-platoon communication and inter-platoon communication. In the intra-platoon communication, the SPSC can securely set up platoon and dynamically manage the platoon members with privacy preservation by using private set intersection and group key agreement techniques, respectively. In the inter-platoon communication, the SPSC can also achieve secure and anonymous communication by adopting certificateless ring signcyption technique. In addition, vehicle-out-platoon can trace the disputed or misbehavior platoon member with the assistance of Road Transportation Authority. The security analysis shows that SPSC can provide authentication, privacy protection, confidentiality and traceability. Finally, the performance of SPSC is comprehensively evaluated by simulation to demonstrate its efficiency in terms of the computation cost.

AB This paper presents an algorithm called epsilon*, for online coverage path planning of unknown environment. The algorithm is built upon the concept of an Exploratory Turing Machine (ETM), which acts as a supervisor to the autonomous vehicle to guide it with adaptive navigation commands. The ETM generates a coverage path online using Multiscale Adaptive Potential Surfaces (MAPS), which are hierarchically structured and dynamically updated based on sensor information. The epsilon*-algorithm is computationally efficient, guarantees complete coverage, and does not suffer from the local extrema problem. Its performance is validated by 1) high-fidelity simulations on Player/Stage and 2) actual experiments in a laboratory setting on autonomous vehicles.

AB Autonomous electric vehicles yields wide application prospects due to their inherent capacity of improving traffic safety, and reducing fuel consumption and environmental pollution. However, influenced by the over-actuated characteristic, uncertain nonlinearities and nonholonomic constraints, motion control is considered to be one of the toughest challenges in the exploitation of autonomous electric vehicles. In this study, a double-layer control framework is proposed to construct the coordinated lateral and longitudinal motion control for over-actuated autonomous electric vehicles, which are independently driven by four in-wheel motors. Firstly, a nonsingular terminal sliding mode controller is designed in the upper control layer to determine the desired resultant forces and moment, and the finite-time convergence is guaranteed by the Lyapunov theory. Then, in the lower control layer, a dynamic control allocation algorithm based on the sequential quadratic programming method is presented to optimally allocate the desired resultant forces and moment via coordinating and reconstructing the lateral and longitudinal tire forces. Finally, numerical simulation results show that the proposed control strategy possesses excellent tracking performance.

AB For autonomous vehicles driving in a low-speed road environment like complex campus, there are several peculiarities such as two-way lanes, break-in obstacles, smaller safety margin, etc. In this paper, a novel maneuver-based trajectory planning scheme is designed for autonomous vehicles driving in a low-speed environment with uncertain dynamic obstacles. First, a quintic polynomial is adopted to generate candidate trajectories and we develop a fast collision check algorithm to guarantee safety. In contrast to the existing methods, our collision check can reduce computation time with less conservatism. To balance the conflict between overtaking and lane-keeping, varying maneuvers are proposed to determine different weights in cost function for selecting the optimal trajectory. Simulations with uncertain low-speed obstacles are conducted to evaluate the performance of our proposed method.

ID ROUNDABOUTS
AB Autonomous shuttles have been used as end-mile solutions for smart mobility in smart cities. The urban driving conditions of smart cities with many other actors sharing the road and the presence of intersections have posed challenges to the use of autonomous shuttles. Round intersections are more challenging because it is more difficult to perceive the other vehicles in and near the intersection. Thus, this paper focuses on the decision-making of autonomous vehicles for handling round intersections. The round intersection is introduced first, followed by introductions of the Markov Decision Process (MDP), the Partially Observable Markov Decision Process (POMDP) and the Object-Oriented Partially Observable Markov Decision Process (OOPOMDP), which are used for decision-making with uncertain knowledge of the motion of the other vehicles. The Partially Observable Monte-Carlo Planning (POMCP) algorithm is used as the solution method and OOPOMDP is applied to the decision-making of autonomous vehicles in round intersections. Decision-making is formulated first as a POMDP problem, and the penalty function is formulated and set accordingly. This is followed by an improvement in decision-making with policy prediction. Augmented objective state and policy-based state transition are introduced, and simulations are used to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method for collision-free handling of round intersections by the ego vehicle.

AB This article studies the problem of event-triggered distributed adaptive bipartite consensus control for multiple autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) systems with a fixed topology. Different from the existing literature on multiple AUV systems, the competitive relationship among AUVs is taken into consideration. In this situation, the bipartite consensus control is implemented to complete the controller design. Furthermore, combing the relative threshold strategy and the backstepping method, an adaptive event-triggered control scheme is developed to decrease the updating frequency of control input. Through the Lyapunov analysis, the proposed protocol ensures that the position tracking error of the considered system converges to a small neighbourhood near the origin. Finally, a simulation example is given to show the effectiveness of the control scheme.

AB This paper presents a lane change decision algorithm for predictive decision-making for an autonomous vehicle using a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) with a Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory (Bi-LSTM) cell. The proposed decision-making algorithm was trained and validated by driving data collected by vision, laser scanners, and chassis sensors of autonomous vehicles. The input features for the Bi-LSTM based RNN consist of the clearance and relative velocity with the surrounding target vehicles, lane measurements, and the velocity of the autonomous vehicle. The output features are configured to generate the probability of three maneuvers, left lane change, right lane change, and lane-keeping. The Bi-LSTM based RNN is configured to decide in advance two seconds before lane changes by using two seconds of observation. The collected 20,108 datasets were accumulated in global coordinates. After processing and resampling the collected datasets, 1,120, 320, and 160 datasets were generated to train, validate, and test the Bi-LSTM based RNN. The proposed algorithm was evaluated by a case study and a driving data-based prediction accuracy analysis. The results of the predictive lane change decision by the proposed algorithm have been shown to be more accurate and similar to a driver than previous approaches.

AB Autonomous Underwater Vehicles (AUVs) are used in many applications such as the exploration of oceans, scientific and military missions, etc. Developing control schemes for AUVs is considered to be a very challenging task due to the complexity of the AUV model, the unmodeled dynamics, the uncertainties and the environmental disturbances. This paper develops a robust control scheme for the dynamic positioning and way-point tracking of underactuated autonomous underwater vehicles. In order to insure the robustness of the proposed controllers, the sliding mode control technique is adopted in the design process. Simulation results are given to validate the proposed controllers. Moreover, studies are presented to evaluate the robustness of the developed controllers with model uncertainties and under different types of disturbances including unknown currents.

AB This study presents the problem of tracking control for underactuated autonomous marine vehicle in condition to uncertainty dynamic and unavailable velocity. A robust controller for tracking control is designed by employing backstepping method, multi-layer neural network, and adaptive control technique. Moreover, the all error variables are guaranteed time-varying bounded based on Lyapunov synthesis. The biological dynamic model are employed to acquire the derivatives of virtual variables such that reduce explosion of complexity of traditional backstepping method. The designed control system does not acknowledge any priori parameters, which include hydrodynamic damping and model parameters. The nonlinear observer is designed to overcome the difficulty of unavailable velocity. Finally, the results of calculation and simulation indicate that proposed controller has better tracking performance for underactuated autonomous marine vehicle.

AB Intelligent path planning is one of the key techniques for autonomous underwater vehicles for the purpose of target detection, environmental survey and so on. In order to realize automatic motion plan, an intelligent cognitive architecture for autonomous underwater vehicle motion planning has been proposed to realize complicated target detection and mobile target following in the disturbance environment. A novel adaptive ant colony optimization and particle swarm optimization fusion-based fuzzy rules optimization algorithm has been proposed to generate optimized fuzzy rules. Through this optimization algorithm, the preliminary fuzzy rules can be optimized to realize intelligent motion planning for complicated operation tasks. Experiments of channel following for wall detection and mobile target following in the oceanic environment have verified the validity of path planning method in the implementation of detection and operation tasks.

AB Autonomous vehicles (AVs) have been made possible by advances in sensing and computing technologies. However, the high cost of AVs makes privatization take longer. Therefore, companies with autonomous vehicles can develop shared autonomous vehicle (SAV) projects. AVs with a high level of automation require high upgrade and use costs. In order to meet the needs of more customers and reduce the investment cost of the company, SAVs with different levels of automation may coexist for a long time. Faced with multiple travel modes (autonomous cars with different levels of automation, private cars, and buses), travelers' travel mode choices are worth studying. To further differentiate the types of travelers, this paper defines high-income travelers and low-income travelers. The difference between these two types of travelers is whether they have a private car. The differences in time value and willingness to pay of the two types of travelers are considered. Based on the above considerations, this paper establishes a multi-modal selection model with the goal of maximizing the total utility of all travelers and uses the imperial competition algorithm to solve it. The results show that low-income travelers are more likely to choose buses and autonomous vehicles with lower levels of automation, while high-income travelers tend to choose higher levels of automation due to their high value of travel time.

Application of ALV systems span relatively structured domains in mining, cargo handling, and agriculture, through potential application in very unstructured tasks such as bush fire fighting, forestry, and defence. In this paper, four key functional ALV technology areas are identified and discussed. These are mobility, localization, navigation, and planning. The essential conclusion of this paper is that the necessary sensors, algorithms, and methods already exist to develop, demonstrate, and commercialize ALVs in many applications.

   ANALYSIS; ATTITUDE
AB Autonomous underwater vehicles require a motion control system for performing underwater tasks such as exploring and developing marine resources. This study proposes a fractional-order proportional-integral (PI lambda) controller for autonomous underwater vehicles motion control that simultaneously guarantees frequency and time domain behaviour. First, a stabilisation process is presented for the controlled system, and a three-dimensional stable surface is obtained. Subsequently, the controller parameters can be tuned. Then, to guarantee frequency and time domain control performance simultaneously, the frequency domain behaviour is studied through a modified flat phase property, and the time domain behaviour is improved through parameter optimisation. The set-point regulation and noise suppression performances of the autonomous underwater vehicles motion control system indicate that the proposed PI lambda controller provides more flexibility in improving the system's robustness and transient performance.

DE agent; autonomous vehicle; biomimicry; control; foraging
AB Foraging theory is typically used to model animal decision making. We describe an agent such as an autonomous vehicle or software module as a forager searching for tasks. The prey model is used to predict which types of tasks an agent should choose to maximize its rate of reward, and the patch model is used to predict when an agent should leave a patch of tasks and how to choose within-patch search patterns. We expand and apply these concepts to fit an autonomous vehicle control problem and to provide insight into how to make high-level control decisions. We also discuss extensions of the basic models, showing how a risk-sensitive version can be used to alter policies when time or fuel is limited. Throughout the applications, we examine ways an agent can estimate environmental parameters when such parameters are not known.

AB This study provides an automated cooperative control method in multilane freeway merging areas within the connected and autonomous vehicle (CAV) technology. First, a lane-change model for a mainline vehicle considering the ramp traffic demand is proposed to determine which vehicles should change lanes from the outer lane to the inner lane of the upstream mainline in the merging area. Second, the time window of the on-ramp vehicles entering the mainline is defined based on the safe headway time and acceleration time. Then, a linear programming cooperative decision model is adopted for the merging vehicles in a given time window. A typical scene of a two-lane freeway merging area is analysed, and the results show that, compared with the non-cooperative control method, the proposed method can effectively decrease the total delay and number of stops and increase the outflow rate downstream of the merging bottleneck.

AB The U.S. Department of Transportation's Inclusive Design Challenge spurred innovative research promoting accessible technology for people with disabilities in the future of autonomous transportation. This paper presents the user-driven design of the Autonomous Vehicle Assistant (AVA), a winning project of the challenge focused on solutions for people who are blind and visually impaired. Results from an initial survey (n = 90) and series of user interviews (n = 12) informed AVA's novel feature set, which was evaluated through a formal navigation study (n = 10) and participatory design evaluations (n = 6). Aggregate findings suggest that AVA's sensor fusion approach combining computer vision, last-meter assistance, and multisensory alerts provide critical solutions for users poised to benefit most from this emerging transportation technology.

Independent movement in the horizontal and vertical planes is necessary to maximize manoeuvrability. This paper presents a comparison of different control strategies for independent depth control using both simulations and real experimental results. PID, sliding mode and a simplification of sliding mode (called 'bounded PD') are simulated using a MATLAB/SIMULINK model and are then compared to experimental results obtained when the controllers were implemented on a prototype mu AUV.

AB In recent years, autonomous vehicles have become more and more popular due to their broad influence over society, as they increase passenger safety and convenience, lower fuel consumption, reduce traffic blockage and accidents, save costs, and enhance reliability. However, autonomous vehicles suffer from some functionality errors which need to be minimized before they are completely deployed onto main roads. Pedestrian detection is one of the most considerable tasks (functionality errors) in autonomous vehicles to prevent accidents. However, accurate pedestrian detection is a very challenging task due to the following issues: (i) occlusion and deformation and (ii) low-quality and multi-spectral images. Recently, deep learning (DL) technologies have exhibited great potential for addressing the aforementioned pedestrian detection issues in autonomous vehicles. This survey paper provides an overview of pedestrian detection issues and the recent advances made in addressing them with the help of DL techniques. Informative discussions and future research works are also presented, with the aim of offering insights to the readers and motivating new research directions.

AB Simultaneous operation of multiple autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) can increase seafloor mapping efficiency. However, AUVs typically rely on support vessels with an operations crew for transport to sites of interest and supervision during their dives. This is costly and limits the scalability of AUV-based seafloor mapping. This paper describes a robotic system that can transport AUVs from shore and deploy them in a survey area located offshore, without the need for a crewed support vessel. We clarify the functional requirements for ship-free AUV operations and propose a concept that allows a single autonomous surface vehicle (ASV) to transport, release, and monitor multiple large and heterogeneous AUVs. The proposed system uses towing modules that can be connected in parallel and can accommodate a variety of pre-existing ASVs and AUVs. A full-scale system was developed and tested during sea trials in the Mediterranean Sea off Greece, to verify basic functionality and gather data on the impact of towing multiple AUVs on ASV endurance and range. Results of these trials and lessons learned are discussed.

ID ALGORITHM; STRATEGY
AB Decision-making for autonomous driving is challenging, considering the complex interactions among multiple traffic agents (including autonomous vehicles (AVs), human-driven vehicles, and pedestrians) and the computational load needed to evaluate these interactions. This paper develops two general potential game-based frameworks, namely, finite and continuous potential games, for decision-making in autonomous driving. The two frameworks account for the AVs' two types of action spaces, i.e., finite and continuous action spaces, respectively. The developed frameworks provide theoretical guarantees for the existence of pure-strategy Nash equilibria and for the convergence of the Nash equilibrium (NE) seeking algorithms. The scalability challenge is also addressed. In addition, we provide cost function shaping approaches such that the agents' cost functions not only reflect common driving objectives but also yield potential games. The performance of the developed algorithms is demonstrated in diverse traffic scenarios, including intersection-crossing and lane-changing scenarios. Statistical comparative studies, including 1) finite potential game vs. continuous potential game, 2) best response dynamics vs. potential function optimization, and 3) potential game vs. reinforcement learning (RL) vs. control barrier function (CBF), are conducted to compare the robustness against various surrounding vehicles' strategies and to compare the computational efficiency. It is shown that the developed potential game frameworks have better robustness than RL and than CBF if the surrounding vehicles are not safety-conscious, and are computationally feasible for real-time implementation.

ID MANAGEMENT
AB Roundabouts are a form of circular intersections adopted to secure road safety of the vehicles. However, collisions are not prevented entirely even when using roundabouts, since accidents may happen at specific intersection points leading to either traffic congestions or serious accidents. In this paper, a visible light communication (VLC)-based collision avoidance scheme is proposed to coordinate autonomous vehicles in traversing roundabouts, which has high effectiveness in vehicular environments. In particular, roadside units (RSUs) are deployed at the roundabout entrances to coordinate the vehicles in a vehicle-to-infrastructure (V2I) mode. By adopting the synchronization approach, vehicles can pass the roundabout simultaneously if their paths are concurrent with each other. Otherwise, vehicles are prioritized according to their arrival time and reasonable decelerations are applied to waive potential conflicts. Simulation results showed that our proposed approach satisfies the roundabout traffic demands in terms of concurrency, safety, and time utilization as vehicles are strongly recommended to decelerate in only 22% of the cases studied in different scenarios.

AB One of the unresolved challenges for autonomous vehicles is safe navigation among occluded pedestrians and vehicles. Previous approaches included generating phantom vehicles and assessing their risk, but they often made the ego vehicle overly conservative or could not conduct a real-time risk assessment in heavily occluded situations. We propose an efficient occlusion-aware risk assessment method using simplified reachability quantification that quantifies the reachability of phantom agents with a simple distribution model on phantom agents' state. Furthermore, we propose a driving strategy for safe and efficient navigation in occluded areas that sets the speed limit of an autonomous vehicle using the risk of phantom agents. Simulations were conducted to evaluate the performance of the proposed method in various occlusion scenarios involving other vehicles and obstacles. Compared with the baseline case of no occlusion-aware risk assessment, the proposed method increased the traversal time of an intersection by 1.48 times but decreased the average collision rate and discomfort score by up to 6.14 times and 5.03 times, respectively. The proposed method has shown the state-of-the-art level of time efficiency with constant time complexity and computational time of less than 5 ms.

AB Ethical decision-making during inevitable crashes, especially when humans involved, has become a big and sensitive roadblock for future mass adoption of autonomous vehicles. Towards addressing this challenge, this paper proposes a predictive control framework for ethical decision-making in autonomous driving using rational ethics. For flexibly implementing of ethical rules, the Lexicographic Optimization-based model predictive controller (LO-MPC) has been designed, in which obstacles and constraints are prioritized. Simulation environment is set up in PreScan, with different edge cases. The results show that the proposed LO-MPC approach has the capability to deal with the ethical decision-making during inevitable crashes by avoiding the obstacles with the assumed priority orders compared with traditional decision-making algorithm.

AB Steering an autonomous vehicle requires the permanent adaptation of behavior in relation to the various situations the vehicle is in. This paper describes a research which implements such adaptation and optimization based on Reinforcement Learning (RL) which in detail purely learns from evaluative feedback in contrast to instructive feedback. Convergence of the learning process has been achieved at various experimental results revealing the impact of the different RL parameters. While using RL for autonomous steering is in itself already a novelty, additional attention has been given to new proposals for post-processing and interpreting the experimental data.

AB Public perception of the next generation of vehicles will affect their design, deployment, and ultimately their use. As the engineering terms of self-driving, driverless, fully automated, and autonomous were introduced to the social sciences and the public at large, the subtle differences among these terms have been lost. However, using them as synonyms even though they may not be interchangeable is problematic. To explore the semantics of different future vehicle terms we surveyed 963 Michigan residents on their understanding of "autonomous" and "self-driving." We found significant differences in perceptions between the terms autonomous and self-driving vehicles. While the former invokes many more uncertain responses, the latter is laden with concerns. These results suggest that the language used to describe the next generation of vehicles may shape public reaction and acceptance. As new mobility options are introduced to the public, our understanding of them will be shaped, in part, by the language used to name and explain the technology. Far from being inconsequential, word choice plays a major, yet underappreciated, role in shaping public opinion.

AB Autonomous vehicles (AVs) will profoundly modify our travel habits. The collective impact of AVs will differ according to the autonomous mode choice. In this paper, we apply a simultaneous-equation model to a database from an original 2017 survey of French mobility users to analyse their acceptance of two forms of autonomous transport mode: autonomous shuttles and robotaxis (N = 3,297). Our results show that the intention to use autonomous shuttles is on average greater than robotaxis. Gender and age influence autonomous mode choice, as well as the current transport mode. In addition, location and urban representations play a central role.

ID AUTOMATION
AB Autonomous mobility technologies may have applications to manned vehicle convoy operations-they have the ability to enhance both system performance and operator capability. This effort examines the potential impact of introducing semi-autonomous mobility [Convoy Active Safety Technologies (CAST)] into manned vehicles. Twelve civilians with experience driving military vehicles in convoy-type operations participated in this experiment. For the experiment, they were tasked with following a lead vehicle while completing a concurrent security task (scanning the local environment for targets). The control of the manned vehicle was varied between CAST and manual control at several different speed levels. Several objective speed and accuracy variables along with subjective operator assessment variables were examined for each task. The results support the potential benefits of incorporating semi-autonomous mobility technologies into manned vehicle convoy operations. The semi-autonomous mobility system was associated with significantly better performance in several aspects of operator situational awareness and convoy integrity, including enhanced target identification, improved maintenance of following distance, and improved performance for unanticipated stops. This experiment also highlighted a critical human factors issue associated with the incorporation Of autonomy in real-world applications: participants felt that, overall, they outperformed the semi-autonomous system on the simulated convoy operation. The operator's perception of the system's performance could potentially affect his or her willingness to use the system in real-world applications. This experiment demonstrated that enhancements to overall system performance in real-world applications are achieved by considering both technological and human factors solutions.

AB This paper presents a sliding mode control (SMC)-based path-tracking algorithm for autonomous vehicles by considering model-free adaptive feedback actions. In autonomous vehicles, safe path tracking requires adaptive and robust control algorithms because driving environment and vehicle conditions vary in real time. In this study, the SMC was adopted as a robust control method to adjust the switching gain, taking into account the sliding surface and unknown uncertainty to make the control error zero. The sliding surface can be designed mathematically, but it is difficult to express the unknown uncertainty mathematically. Information of priori bounded uncertainties is needed to obtain closed-loop stability of the control system, and the unknown uncertainty can vary with changes in internal and external factors. In the literature, ongoing efforts have been made to overcome the limitation of losing control stability due to unknown uncertainty. This study proposes an integrated method of adaptive feedback control (AFC) and SMC that can adjust a bounded uncertainty. Some illustrative and representative examples, such as autonomous driving scenarios, are also provided to show the main properties of the designed integrated controller. The examples show superior control performance, and it is expected that the integrated controller could be widely used for the path-tracking algorithms of autonomous vehicles.

ID FLOCKING; SYSTEMS; MODEL
AB In this paper, we design decentralized control strategies for the two-dimensional movement of autonomous vehicles on lane-free roads. The behavior of the autonomous vehicles resembles that of self-driven particles that individually produce their driving force and steering, while interacting with each other, giving rise to an emerging particle traffic flow. The bicycle kinematic model is used to model the dynamics of the vehicles, and each vehicle determines its control input based only on its own state and on the relative displacement vector from other (adjacent) vehicles and the boundary of the road. The resulting control system is nonlinear and evolves on a specific open set. Therefore, the feedback design is challenging and is accomplished by means of a control Lyapunov function methodology. Potential functions and Barbdlat's lemma are employed to prove the following properties, which are ensured by the proposed nonlinear controller: (i) the vehicles do not collide with each other or with the boundary of the road; (ii) the speeds of all vehicles are always positive, i.e., no vehicle moves backwards at any time; (iii) the speed of all vehicles remain below a given speed limit; (iv) all vehicle speeds converge to a given longitudinal speed set-point; and (v) the accelerations, lateral speeds, and orientations of all vehicles tend to zero. The efficiency of the proposed 2-D cruise controllers is illustrated by means of numerical examples. (C) 2022 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Human activity recognition (HAR) is a wide research topic in a field of computer science. Improving HAR can lead to massive breakthrough in humanoid robotics, robots used in medicine and in the field of autonomous vehicles. The system that is able to recognise human and its activity without any errors and anomalies would lead to safer and more empathetic autonomous systems. During this research work, multiple neural networks models, with different complexity, are being investigated. Each model is re-trained on the proposed unique data set, gathered on automated guided vehicle (AGV) with the latest and the modest sensors used commonly on autonomous vehicles. The best model is picked out based on the final accuracy for action recognition. Best models pipeline is fused with YOLOv3, to enhance the human detection. In addition to pipeline improvement, multiple action direction estimation methods are proposed.

AB This paper contributes to the intersection of operations research and machine learning in the context of autonomous ridesharing. In this work, autonomous ridesharing operations are reproduced through an event-based simulation approach and are modeled as a sequence of static subproblems to be optimized. The optimization framework consists of a novel data -driven metaheuristic within a two phase approach. The first phase consists of a greedy insertion heuristic that assigns new online requests to vehicles. The second phase consists of a local-search based metaheuristic that iteratively revisits previously-made vehicle-trip assignments through intra-and inter-vehicle route exchanges. These exchanges are performed by selecting from a pool of destroy-repair operators using a machine learning approach that is trained offline on a large dataset composed of more than one and a half million examples of previously-solved autonomous ridesharing subproblems.Computational results are performed on multiple dynamic instances extracted from real ridesharing data published by Uber Technologies Inc. Results show that the proposed machine learning-based optimization approach outperforms benchmark state-of-the-art data-driven meta -heuristics by up to about nine percent, on average. Managerial insights highlight the correlation between selected vehicle routing features and the performance of the metaheuristics in the context of autonomous ridesharing operations.

ID SIMULTANEOUS LOCALIZATION
AB This paper addresses an autonomous navigation method for the autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) C-Ranger applying information-filter-based simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM), and its sea trial experiments in Tuandao Bay (Shangdong Province, P. R. China). Weak links in the information matrix in an extended information filter (EIF) can be pruned to achieve an efficient approach-sparse EIF algorithm (SEIF-SLAM). All the basic update formulae can be implemented in constant time irrespective of the size of the map; hence the computational complexity is significantly reduced. The mechanical scanning imaging sonar is chosen as the active sensing device for the underwater vehicle, and a compensation method based on feedback of the AUV pose is presented to overcome distortion of the acoustic images due to the vehicle motion. In order to verify the feasibility of the navigation methods proposed for the C-Ranger, a sea trial was conducted in Tuandao Bay. Experimental results and analysis show that the proposed navigation approach based on SEIF-SLAM improves the accuracy of the navigation compared with conventional method; moreover the algorithm has a low computational cost when compared with EKF-SLAM.

AB Consideration was given to the control of motion of the autonomous underwater vehicle performing automatic measurements and mapping of the oceanic physical fields. In the general case, it is required to set up a control maintaining motion along the field isolines relying on the trajectory measurements of the level and field gradient components and identification and contouring of the anomalies by the characteristic points and generalized reference points. A practical example based on the experience of bathymetrical and hydrophysical measurements in the Arctic region using an autonomous underwater vehicle was discussed.

AB Autonomous Underwater Vehicles are very valuable tools in a great variety of marine related sectors that demand new capacities and improvements. These improvements go through increasing their endurance and, in this sense, the use of Direct Methanol Fuel Cells can be very interesting with an adequate CO2 Treatment Method. This work investigates four CO2 Treatment Methods for their application onboard Autonomous Underwater Vehicles powered by a Direct Methanol Fuel Cell-based power plant. The evaluation was carried out considering different working conditions defined by the fuel cell power, navigation depth and endurance. To rank the treatment methods, three Multi Criteria Decision Methods and eight selection criteria were used. The results show that direct disposal of CO2 ejecting it outside the Autonomous Underwater Vehicle is the most adequate method for navigation depths up to 50 m. For deeper waters CO2 storage embedded in an adsorbent material and CO2 stored as a pressurized gas seem to be the best choices. In all cases, the results present a good stability against changes in the criteria weights vector.

AB This paper addresses the development of a nonlinear H diving control algorithm for an autonomous underwater vehicle. It employs both state and output feedback control techniques in designing a nonlinear H controller such that the autonomous underwater vehicle tracks the desired depth profile. The diving control problem is formulated as a disturbance attenuation problem, in view of achieving the desired performance by attenuating the internal as well as the external disturbances by ensuring internal stability and robustness. Two Hamilton-Jacobi-Isaacs inequalities have been formulated in the form of a Taylor series technique to determine solutions to the control algorithms. The solution of the first Hamilton-Jacobi-Isaacs inequality renders a state feedback control law whereas the second inequality is exploited to design a nonlinear observer for estimating the autonomous underwater vehicle states in order to realize an output feedback controller. These control algorithms are implemented firstly using the MATLAB/Simulink environment and then, the experimental validation of the developed control algorithm has been performed in order to ensure the effectiveness of the control scheme.

AB The sensing coverage and accuracy of vehicles are vital for autonomous driving. However, the current sensing capability of a single autonomous vehicle is quite limited in the complicated road traffic environment, which leads to many sensing dead zones or frequent misdetection. In this paper, we propose to develop a Vehicular Fog Computing (VFC) architecture to implement cooperative sensing among multiple adjacent vehicles driving in the form of a platoon. Based on our VFC architecture greedy and Support Vector Machine (SVM) algorithms are adopted respectively to enhance the sensing coverage and accuracy in the platoon. Furthermore, the distributed deep learning is processed for trajectory prediction by applying the Light Gated Recurrent Unit (Li-GRU) neural network algorithm. Simulation results based on real-world traffic datasets indicate the sensing coverage and accuracy by the proposed algorithms can be significantly improved with low computational complexity.

AB Driving safety is the most important element that needs to be considered for autonomous vehicles (AVs). To ensure driving safety, we proposed a lane change decision-making framework based on deep reinforcement learning to find a risk-aware driving decision strategy with the minimum expected risk for autonomous driving. Firstly, a probabilistic-model based risk assessment method was proposed to assess the driving risk using position uncertainty and distance-based safety metrics. Then, a risk aware decision making algorithm was proposed to find a strategy with the minimum expected risk using deep reinforcement learning. Finally, our proposed methods were evaluated in CARLA in two scenarios (one with static obstacles and one with dynamically moving vehicles). The results show that our proposed methods can generate robust safe driving strategies and achieve better driving performances than previous methods.

ID SYSTEMS
AB In the autonomous vehicle, the reference lane is continually detected by machine vision system. And then the vehicle is steered to follow the reference yaw rates which are generated by the deviations of lateral distance and the yaw angle between a vehicle and the reference lane. To cope with the steering delay and the side-slip of vehicle, PI controller is introduced by yaw rate feedback and tuned from the simulation where the vehicle is modeled as 2 DOF and 79 DOF and verified by the results of an actual vehicle test. The lateral control algorithm by yaw rate feedback has good performances of lane tracking and passenger comfort.

ID TRACKING
AB With high-definition sensors and sophisticated machine vision algorithms, the visual perception capability of autonomous vehicle (AV) has largely advanced. However, the visual perception performance of AVs may still be unstable in complex traffic environment. To improve the robustness and capability of risk detection of AV visual perception system, this work proposes a framework to fuse human gaze and the object detection results from vehicle vision based on the Laplacian Pyramid algorithm. We evaluate the proposed method on a level-2 AV to perceive the interactive vehicles at unsignalized intersections. Using Extended Kalman Filter, the trajectory of the human driversgaze and the anchor boxes from AV object detection are fused. Results reveal that with human-vehicle visual fusion, the actual trajectory of interactive vehicles can be predicted more accurately than separately using human gaze or object detection algorithm. The findings show that human-vehicle visual fusion improves the perception accuracy and robustness of interactive objects in complex traffic environment. The method has the potential to enhance the attention mechanism of AV vision.

AB Moving towards autonomy, unmanned vehicles rely heavily on state-of-the-art collision avoidance systems (CAS). A lot of work is being done to make the CAS as safe and reliable as possible, necessitating a comparative study of the recent work in this important area. The paper provides a comprehensive review of collision avoidance strategies used for unmanned vehicles, with the main emphasis on unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV). It is an in-depth survey of different collision avoidance techniques that are categorically explained along with a comparative analysis of the considered approaches w.r.t. different scenarios and technical aspects. This also includes a discussion on the use of different types of sensors for collision avoidance in the context of UAVs.

AB Reliable detection and tracking of surrounding objects are indispensable for comprehensive motion prediction and planning of autonomous vehicles. Due to the limitations of individual sensors, the fusion of multiple sensor modalities is required to improve the overall detection capabilities. Additionally, robust motion tracking is essential for reducing the effect of sensor noise and improving state estimation accuracy. The reliability of the autonomous vehicle software becomes even more relevant in complex, adversarial high-speed scenarios at the vehicle handling limits in autonomous racing. In this paper, we present a modular multi-modal sensor fusion and tracking method for high-speed applications. The method is based on the Extended Kalman Filter (EKF) and is capable of fusing heterogeneous detection inputs to track surrounding objects consistently. A novel delay compensation approach enables to reduce the influence of the perception software latency and to output an updated object list. It is the first fusion and tracking method validated in high-speed real-world scenarios at the Indy Autonomous Challenge 2021 and the Autonomous Challenge at CES (AC@CES) 2022, proving its robustness and computational efficiency on embedded systems. It does not require any labeled data and achieves position tracking residuals below 0.1 m.

AB The agriculture sector is currently facing the problems of aging and decreasing skilled labor, meaning that the future direction of agriculture will be a transition to automation and mechanization that can maximize efficiency and decrease costs. Moreover, interest in the development of autonomous agricultural vehicles is increasing due to advances in sensor technology and information and communication technology (ICT). Therefore, an autonomous driving control algorithm using a low-cost global navigation satellite system (GNSS)-real-time kinematic (RTK) module and a low-cost motion sensor module was developed to commercialize an autonomous driving system for a crawler-type agricultural vehicle. Moreover, an autonomous driving control algorithm, including the GNSS-RTK/motion sensor integration algorithm and the path-tracking control algorithm, was proposed. Then, the performance of the proposed algorithm was evaluated based on three trajectories. The Root Mean Square Errors (RMSEs) of the path-following of each trajectory are calculated to be 9, 7, and 7 cm, respectively, and the maximum error is smaller than 30 cm. Thus, it is expected that the proposed algorithm could be used to conduct autonomous driving with about a 10 cm-level of accuracy.

AB CDue to the complex driving conditions confronted by an autonomous vehicle, it is significant for the vehicle to possess a robust control system to achieve effective collision-avoidance performance. This paper proposes a neural network-based adaptive integral terminal sliding mode (NNAITSM) control scheme for the collision-avoidance steering control of an autonomous vehicle. In order to describe the vehicle's lateral dynamics and path tracking characteristics, a two-degrees-of-freedom (2DOF) dynamic model and a kinematic model are adopted. Then, an NNAITSM controller is designed, where a radial basis function neural network (RBFNN) scheme is utilized to online approximate the optimal upper bound of lumped system uncertainties such that prior knowledge about the uncertainties is not required. The stability of the control system is proved via Lyapunov, and the selection guideline of control parameters is provided. Last, Matlab-Carsim co-simulations are executed to test the performance of the designed controller under different road conditions and vehicle velocities. Simulation results show that compared with conventional sliding mode (CSM) and nonsingular terminal sliding mode (NTSM) control, the proposed NNAITSM control scheme owns evident superiority in not only higher tracking precision but also stronger robustness against various road surfaces and vehicle velocities.

AB Simulation can be an important tool in evaluating autonomous vehicle performance. In a virtual proving ground, challenging and highly unlikely scenarios can be created and novel control algorithms can be tested with no safety concerns and relatively little cost. A critical component of any virtual proving ground is sensor simulation; i.e., the ability to produce realistic sensor information inside the simulated environment. This paper overviews several models and methods for generating, through simulation, GPS, IMU, and lidar data. While the current models can account for some sensor noise, significant work remains to be done in order to produce simulated data that is realistic and can be used to confidently test and evaluate autonomous agents in virtual proving grounds.

AB Waiting in a long queue at traffic lights not only wastes valuable time but also pollutes the environment. With the advances in autonomous vehicles and 5G networks, the previous jamming scenarios at intersections may be turned into non-stop weaving traffic flows. Toward this vision, we propose a highly efficient traffic planning system, namely DASHX, which enables connected autonomous vehicles to cross multi-way intersections without a stop. Specifically, DASHX has a comprehensive model to represent intersections and vehicle status. It can constantly process large volumes of vehicle information, resolve scheduling conflicts, and generate optimal travel plans for all vehicles coming toward the intersection in real time. Unlike existing works that are limited to certain types of intersections and lack considerations of practicability, DASHX is universal for any type of 3D intersection and yields the near-maximum throughput while still ensuring riding comfort. To better evaluate the effectiveness of traffic scheduling systems in real-world scenarios, we developed a sophisticated open source 3D traffic simulation platform (DASHX-SIM) that can handle complicated 3D road layouts and simulate vehicles' networking and decision-making processes. We have conducted extensive experiments, and the experimental results demonstrate the practicality, effectiveness, and efficiency of the DASHX system and the simulator.

AB Autonomous driving is considered one of the revolutionary technologies shaping humanity's future mobility and quality of life. However, safety remains a critical hurdle in the way of commercialization and widespread deployment of autonomous vehicles on public roads. Safety concerns require the autonomous driving system to handle uncertainties from multiple sources that are either preexisting, e.g., the stochastic behavior of traffic participants or scenario occlusion, or introduced as a result of processing, e.g., the application of neural networks. Thus, it is crucial to analyze the sources of uncertainties and quantify the risks associated with them, including the propagated risks that accumulate in the decision-making system. In this context, this paper provides an overview of uncertainty challenges and state-of-the-art techniques for mitigating these challenges. We argue that the uncertainties mainly originate from two aspects: 1) the external traffic environment, and 2) the internal autonomous driving system. Specifically, this paper first analyzes the safety challenges caused by the uncertainties and summarizes their sources. In addition, the corresponding techniques that mitigate and quantify the risk of uncertainties are presented. Finally, research perspectives are highlighted to facilitate future studies for guaranteeing the safety of autonomous vehicles.

ID DESIGN
AB Fully autonomous vehicles are not yet available for consumers to experience; however, as experts predict they will be ready for the consumer market in the not-too-distant future, it is important to consider the spatial design of such vehicles. As the interior of a vehicle is a confined space, it is important to design a flexible layout in different aspects of the overall space. Therefore, this study aimed to analyze the relationships among various elements related to the use of space in a face-to-face seating arrangement. Using mock-up, observational surveys, questionnaires, and the think-aloud research method within an ethnographic observation framework, we conducted experiments on three study participants who were aware of the changing concept of autonomous vehicles. One of the key findings of our analysis is that various activities and actions can occur in a face-to-face seating arrangement. It is important to recognize that face-to-face seating arrangements are not just to facilitate conversation but can be seen as an environment in which each passenger can conduct other in-vehicle activities individually. Based on these findings, we recommend that needs for activities be considered when designing spatial components in a face-to-face seating arrangement.

SO JOURNAL OF AEROSPACE INFORMATION SYSTEMS

DT Article
AB The last 15 years have seen a large uptick in the use of unmanned aircraft. However, the current safety of flight clearances for unmanned aircraft requires a qualified operator who can make decisions and ultimately bear the responsibly for the safe operations of the vehicle. The future of aviation is unmanned, and ultimately autonomous. Yet, a clear path for certifying an autonomous vehicle to make decisions currently reserved for qualified pilots does not exist. This paper presents a preliminary approach for certifying an autonomous controller to select an appropriate landing site for a large rotorcraft in an unprepared landing zone. In particular, this paper will decompose the steps currently used by qualified pilots to the basic requirements to define an envelope where the vehicle will be allowed to operate autonomously while landing. These requirements are the basis for a specification that we examine to ensure it met the requirements. A protocol is developed based on the analyzed specification that will ensure what the vehicle "will not do" while operating autonomously. Finally, we describe how this protocol can be used as the safety of flight evidence, and eventually for clearing an autonomous controller to complete a task reserved for qualified pilots.

AB Purpose
   This paper aims to investigate the autonomous performance optimization of a research-based hybrid unmanned aerial vehicle (i.e. HUAV) manufactured at Iskenderun Technical University.
   Design/methodology/approach
   To maximize the autonomous performance of this HUAV, longitudinal and lateral dynamics were initially obtained. Then, the optimum magnitudes of the autopilot system parameters were estimated by considering the vehicle's dynamic model and autopilot parameters.
   Findings
   After determining the optimum values of the longitudinal and lateral autopilots, an improved design for the autonomously controlled (AC) HUAV was achieved in terms of real-time flight.
   Originality/value
   In this paper, the autopilot systems (i.e. longitudinal and lateral) of an HUAV are for the first time simultaneously designed in the literature. This helps the simultaneous improvement of the longitudinal and lateral flight trajectory tracking performances.

AB Researchers have become interested in autonomous underwater vehicles equipped with various kinds of sonar systems that can perform many of underwater tasks, which is encouraged by the potential benefits of cost reduction and flexible deployment. This paper proposes an approach to three-dimensional passive source localisation with the flank array of an autonomous underwater vehicle in shallow water. The approach is developed based on matched-field processing for the likelihood of passive source localisation in the shallow water environment. Inter-position processing is also used for the improved localisation performance and the enhanced stability of the estimation process against the lack of spatial gain due to the small physical size of the flank array. The proposed approach is presented and validated through simulation and experimental data. The results illustrate the localisation performance at different signal-to-noise ratios and demonstrate the build up over time of the positional parameters of the estimated source as the autonomous underwater vehicle cruises at a low speed along a straight line at a constant depth.

AB This paper developed a data processing procedure for detection and tracking of multi-lane multi-vehicle trajectories with a roadside Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) sensor. Different from the existing perception methods for the autonomous vehicle system, this procedure was explicitly developed to extract trajectories from a roadside LiDAR sensor. The proposed procedure includes five main steps: region of interest (ROI) selection, ground surface filtering, point clustering, vehicle/non-vehicle classification, and geometrical vehicle tracking. The case study showed that the trajectories of vehicles can be generated with the proposed method. This paper is the start of the new-generation connected infrastructures serving connected/autonomous vehicles with the roadside LiDAR sensors. It will accelerate the deployment of connected-vehicle technologies to improve traffic safety, mobility, and fuel efficiency.

AB This work presents an Autonomous Surface Vehicle (ASV) with tracking capability. The ASV is able to follow after an Autonomous Underwater Vehicle (AUV) without prior knowledge of the AUV's actual position. Tracking an AUV can significantly increase the communication range and bandwidth of the transferred data, which means that the AUV can operate without nearby operators. Mathematical models to represent ASV's kinematics and kinetics were developed as well as a controller that takes into account sea wave effects. Simulations of the ASV with a ranger interrogator system was developed to test the tracking algorithm. The proposed method allows computing the possible location of the AUV, which can be used to reduce the navigation error of the AUV. This method was tested both in a simulation environment and at sea trials in the Red Sea. In both cases, the algorithm performed well and precise tracking was achieved.

This paper presents a control algorithm developed for a tracked vehicle to autonomously climb obstacles by varying its front and back track orientations. A reactive controller computes a desired geometric configuration based on terrain information. A reinforcement learning algorithm enhances vehicle mobility by finding effective exit strategies in deadlock situations. It is capable of incorporating complex information including terrain and vehicle dynamics through learned experiences. Experiments illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach for climbing various obstacles. Crown Copyright (C) 2011 Published by Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB In this article, a motion planning framework for autonomous driving is explored to achieve unmanned last-mile delivery vehicle application in complicated urban scenario. This approach can dramatically improve the intelligence, driving safety, driving robustness, and scalability of autonomous vehicles. In this framework, a specific High-Definition (HD) map representation was proposed for last-mile delivery applications, and a Route Planning layer generates a kinematically feasible reference line with smoothness condition based on Routing and HD Map components. Then a Scenario Planning layer considers routing results and both static and dynamic obstacles into account to select a corresponding scenario to execute, such as cruise on-road scenario, cross intersection scenario, parking scenario, and so forth. Finally, a Trajectory Planning layer which is classified with trajectory generation and optimization modules is described. In the trajectory generation part, a rough path-speed profile and corresponding decisions, such as nudge, stop, yield, and so forth, are generated. Then, the rough path-speed profile is postprocessed by optimization algorithms in the trajectory optimization part. On the basis of the real road test results from thousands of times for JD.com's real autonomous delivery vehicle operations and approximate 115,475 km of fully autonomous driving mode in an urban scenario, the proposed motion planning framework demonstrates the efficiency of autonomous driving, improves the driving quality and reduces the manual intervention.

AB Devising planning algorithms for autonomous driving is non-trivial due to the presence of complex and uncertain interaction dynamics between road users. In this paper, we introduce a planning framework encompassing multiple action policies that are learned jointly from episodes of human-human interactions in naturalistic driving. The policy model is composed of encoder-decoder recurrent neural networks for modeling the sequential nature of interactions and mixture density networks for characterizing the probability distributions over driver actions. The model is used to simultaneously generate a finite set of context-dependent candidate plans for an autonomous car and to anticipate the probable future plans of human drivers. This is followed by an evaluation stage to select the plan with the highest expected utility for execution. Our approach leverages rapid sampling of action distributions in parallel on a graphic processing unit, offering fast computation even when modeling the interactions among multiple vehicles and over several time steps. We present ablation experiments and comparison with two existing baseline methods to highlight several design choices that we found to be essential to our model's success. We test the proposed planning approach in a simulated highway driving environment, showing that by using the model, the autonomous car can plan actions that mimic the interactive behavior of humans.

   avoidance; risk assessment; motion planning
ID SENSOR FUSION
AB Despite development efforts toward autonomous vehicle technologies, the number of collisions and driver interventions of autonomous vehicles tested in California seems to be reaching a plateau. One of the main reasons for this is the lack of defensive driving functionality; i.e. emergency collision avoidance when other human drivers make mistakes. In this paper, a collision avoidance/mitigation system (CAMS) is proposed to rapidly evaluate risks associated with all surrounding vehicles and to maneuver the vehicle into a safer region when faced with critically dangerous situations. First, a risk assessment module, namely, predictive occupancy map (POM), is proposed to compute potential risks associated with surrounding vehicles based on relative position, velocity, and acceleration. Then, the safest trajectory with the lowest risk level is selected among the 12 local trajectories through the POM. To ensure stable and successful collision avoidance of the ego-vehicle, the lateral and longitudinal acceleration profiles are planned while considering the vehicle stability limit. The performance of the proposed algorithm is validated based on side and rear-end collision scenarios, which are difficult to predict and to monitor. The simulation results show that the proposed CAMS via POM detect a collision risk 1.4 s before the crash, and avoids the collision successfully.

AB Homing behavior for autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) is vital for autonomous docking and indispensable for recovery of vehicles in logistically difficult or hazardous conditions. Homing to a single acoustic beacon is a low-logistics solution to this engineering challenge. A homing application has been developed in C++ that applies a multilateration-based localization algorithm to estimate transponder location for homing. Mission oriented operating suite interval programming (MOOS-IvP) was implemented as a backseat driver on a Teledyne Gavia AUV to enhance the AUV with adaptive maneuvering capabilities; thus, enabling mission waypoints to be dynamically updated by the homing application (pHomeToBeacon) through the MOOS database and a developed iGavia crewmember. To demonstrate MOOS-IvP-GAVIA and homing capabilities using this first-principles approach to localization, field trials were undertaken in Kopavogur, Iceland, in June 2015 and proved consistent homing to a single beacon within 15 m accuracy. These trials were an industry-first of deploying a user-developed application on MOOS-IvP-GAVIA and of having a Gavia enhanced with adaptive maneuvering capabilities for homing. This new capability enables Gavia AUV to be used as a platform for future developer-led autonomy and applications. Ultimately, pHomeToBeacon will enable any AUV enhanced with MOOS-IvP to use acoustics to home to a surface vessel (stationary or underway) in preparation for autonomous subsea docking and recovery.

AB Every revolution promises a spirit of optimism and significant changes. Connected and automated vehicles (CAVs) are coming to our roadways. CAVs have a crucial role to play in the future of transportation. These emerging technologies will provide a safe travel mode by eliminating the human driving error. The CAVs are never distracted or fired. In the last five years, autonomous driving has gone from "may be possible" to "inevitable". Beyond safer and more enjoyable routes for passengers, the autonomous car also represents a significant step forward in terms of sustainable development. However, many questions remaining under investigations, when will autonomous cars be available? What should be improved first, vehicles or infrastructures? What are the requirements that must be satisfied by Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS) in smart and sustainable cities? How will these modern technologies impact our transportation systems and the social world? What and how the leading technologies can be used in autonomous cars? What type of sensors and embedded devices to be used? In this paper, we address those issues and to try to provide some suggestions for these technologies that are currently emerging.

AB Motivated by the need for simulation tools for testing, verification and validation of autonomous driving systems that operate in traffic consisting of both autonomous and human-driven vehicles, we propose a game-theoretic framework for modeling the interactive behavior of vehicles at uncontrolled intersections. The proposed vehicle interaction model is based on a novel formulation of dynamic games with multiple concurrent leader-follower pairs, induced from common traffic rules. Based on simulation results for various intersection scenarios, we show that the model exhibits reasonable behavior expected in traffic, including the capability of reproducing scenarios extracted from real-world traffic data and reasonable performance in resolving traffic conflicts. The model is further validated based on the level-of-service traffic quality rating system and demonstrates manageable computational complexity compared to traditional multi-player game-theoretic models.

AB Shared Autonomous Vehicles (SAVs) are expected to be used for regular and pre-planned trips. Such trips are suitable for reservation-based services, wherein the customer needs to book for a trip in advance. Systems enabling reservation of trips can allow for better planning of routes and schedules, and if optimally designed, enable higher efficiency. The primary objective of this research is to model the effects of such a system, by formulating and solving the combined Dynamic User Equilibrium and Shared autonomous vehicle Chain Formation (DUESCF) problem. The problem is formulated as a bilevel model based on game theory, involving road users and SAV service operator. Given a situation where conventional private and shared autonomous vehicles co-exist, road users select paths and departure times to maximize a perceived utility (commonly treated as minimizing a disutility) by forming a DUE (fixed point problem), and the SAV service operator tries to maximize the performance by forming appropriate SAV chains (combinatorial problem). The final objective of this bilevel model is a traffic assignment that includes SAV chain formation, such that both road users and SAV service operator obtain optimal solutions by reaching a Nash equilibrium, where no player is better off by unilaterally changing their decisions. A solution approach, based on Iterative Optimization and Assignment (IOA) method, is proposed with path flow and SAV performance changes as convergence criteria. Furthermore, the solution approach is tested for its robustness, and a scenario analysis is carried out to evaluate the impacts of reservation-based SAV services. The results show that a ridesharing SAV system is better compared to a carsharing and a mixed system consisting of both, in terms of total system travel time, congestion levels, total vehicle kilometres travelled and vehicle requirements.

DT Article
DE automated driving and intelligent vehicles; learning (artificial
   intelligence); non-linear control systems
ID ROAD
AB Controlling an autonomous vehicle's unprotected left turn at an intersection is a challenging task. Traditional rule-based autonomous driving decision and control algorithms struggle to construct accurate and trustworthy mathematical models for such circumstances, owing to their considerable uncertainty and unpredictability. To overcome this problem, a rule-constrained reinforcement learning (RCRL) control method is proposed in this work for autonomous driving. To train a reinforcement learning controller with rule constraints, outcomes of the path planning module are used as a goal condition in the reinforcement learning framework. Since they include vehicle dynamics, the proposed approach is safer and more reliable compared to end-to-end learning, thereby ensuring that the generated trajectories are locally optimal while adjusting to unpredictable situations. In the experiments, a highly randomized two-way four-lane intersection is established based on the CARLA simulator to verify the effectiveness of the proposed RCRL control method. Accordingly, the results show that the proposed method can provide real-time safe planning and ensure high passing efficiency for autonomous vehicles in the unprotected left turn task.

AB This paper proposes an algorithm to model and process streams of LiDAR data under an autonomous vehicle framework. LiDAR is assumed to be an exteroceptive sensor that allows the vehicle to have dynamic 3D scene perception of its surroundings. We employ an encoder-decoder architecture based on 3D-Convolutional layers called 3D Convolution Encoder-Decoder (3D-CED), together with a transfer learning strategy to extract a set of features from point clouds, which are relevant in the context of autonomous driving. The resulting features allow to make inferences of the future point cloud data and detect multiple abstraction level anomalies in controlled scenarios by utilizing a probabilistic switching dynamic model called High Dimensional Markov Jump Particle Filter (HD-MJPF). Moreover, a comparison is provided between piecewise linear, piecewise nonlinear, and nonlinear predictive models for anomaly detection at multiple abstraction levels. Our approach is evaluated with data collected from the LiDAR sensors of the autonomous vehicle while performing certain tasks in a controlled environment.

AB Self-driving technologies introduced new challenges to the control engineering community. Autonomous vehicles with limited automation capabilities require constant human supervision, and human drivers have to be able to take back control at any time, which is called handover. This is a critical process in terms of safety, thus appropriate handover modeling is fundamental in design, simulation and education related to self-driving cars. This article reviews the literature of handover processes, situation awareness and control-oriented human driver models. It unifies the psychological and physiological control theory models to create a parameterized engineering tool to quantify the handover processes.

AB Emerging connected autonomous vehicles (CAV) technologies provide an opportunity to the detailed vehicle trajectory control to reduce adverse impacts of stop-and-go traffic imposed by freeway bottlenecks. This study proposes a CAV-based trajectory-smoothing concept to harmonize traffic, improve fuel-efficiency and reduce environmental impacts. The presented algorithm is applicable to mixed-traffic environments with human-driven vehicles (HVs), connected vehicles (CVs), and CAVs. This algorithm controls CAVs so that they smoothly hedge against the backward deceleration waves and gradually merge into the downstream traffic with a reasonable speed. This model addresses the full spectrum of CV and CAV market penetration rates and various traffic conditions. Numerical experiments are performed to assess the algorithm performance with different traffic conditions and CV and CAV market penetration rates. The results show significant improvements in dampening traffic oscillation and reducing fuel consumption and emissions.

AB In this paper, a dynamic model of vertical take-off and landing (VTOL) aerial vehicles, having lateral and longitudinal rotor tilting mechanism, is first developed using a Newton-Euler formulation. Then an integral backstepping (IB) control technique is proposed to improve the pitch, yaw, and roll stability of the vehicle. Such control mechanisms enables the UAV to perform complex tasks that no other Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) can execute such as hover pitched. This control tactic allows the vehicle under investigation, eVader, to use the full potential of its flying characteristics enabled by the novel dual-axis oblique active tilting (OAT) mechanism, which enables it to maneuver inside obstructed environments. The potential of the eVader as a small UAV and its model are verified and then used to for autonomous take-off and landing as well as stabilizing the vehicle's attitude. Finally, diverse simulation scenarios on attitude and position control, stabilization and autonomous take off and landing are presented.

AB Due to the important role of hydrodynamic coefficients in the control and guidance of an autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV), sensitivity analysis is proposed here, as a preliminary step to motion control design. Taking the standard maneuvers, including turning circle and horizontal and vertical zigzag, the sensitivity of various hydrodynamic coefficients with respect to velocities and position is determined. Such analyses are then used to classify the model parameters into three categories, as non-sensitive coefficients, coefficients with low influence on the motion and more sensitive coefficients.

AB Employing vehicle communication and automated control technologies, autonomous vehicles (AVs) can safely drive closer together than human-driven vehicles (HVs), thereby potentially improving traffic efficiency. Separation between AV and HV traffic through the deployment of dedicated AV lanes is foreseen as an effective method of amplifying the benefits of AVs and promoting their adoption. However, it is important to consider mixed AV and HV traffic in a transportation network. On the one hand, it may be impractical to deploy dedicated AV lanes throughout the network, while on the other hand, dedicated AV lanes may even reduce the total traffic efficiency of a road segment when the AV flow rate is low. In this study, we considered a new form of managed lanes for AVs, designated as autonomous vehicle/toll (AVT) lanes, which grant free access to AVs while allowing HVs to access the lanes by paying a toll. We investigated the optimal deployment of dedicated AV lanes and AVT lanes in transportation networks with mixed AV and HV flows. The user equilibrium (UE) problem in a transportation network with mixed flows of AVs and HVs is first explored. We formulated the UE problem as a link-based variational inequality (VI) and identified that, with different impacts of AVs on road capacity, the UE problem can have unique or non-unique flow patterns. Considering that the UE problem may have non-unique flow distributions, we proposed a robust optimal deployment model, which is a generalized semi-infinite min-max program, to deploy the dedicated AV lanes and AVT lanes so that the system performance under the worst-case flow distributions is optimized. We proposed effective solution algorithms to solve these models and presented numerical studies to demonstrate the models and the solution algorithms. The results show that the system performance can be significantly improved through the deployment of dedicated AV lanes and AVT lanes.

AB The research presented in this paper aims to bridge the gap between the latest scientific advances in autonomous vehicle localization and the industrial state of the art in autonomous warehousing. Notwithstanding great scientific progress in the past decades, industrial autonomous warehousing systems still rely on external infrastructure for obtaining their precise location. This approach increases warehouse installation costs and decreases system reliability, as it is sensitive to measurement outliers and the external localization infrastructure can get dirty or damaged. Several approaches, well studied in scientific literature, are capable of determining vehicle position based only on information provided by on board sensors, most commonly wheel encoders and laser scanners. However, scientific results published to date either do not provide sufficient accuracy for industrial applications, or have not been extensively tested in realistic, industrial-like operating conditions. In this paper, we combine several well established algorithms into a high-precision localization pipeline, capable of computing the pose of an autonomous forklift to sub-centimeter precision. The algorithms use only odometry information from wheel encoders and range readings from an on board laser scanner. The effectiveness of the proposed solution is evaluated by an extensive experiment that lasted for several days, and was performed in a realistic industrial-like environment. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

AB The second edition of the grand cooperative driving challenge (GCDC2016) was held in The Netherlands in May 2016. Ten international teams participated in the two competition scenarios designed for GCDC2016: platoon merging and intersection. This paper describes the design and development of DRIVERTIVE, a DRIVERless cooperaTIve VEhicle, which aims to advance cooperative automation. The purpose of this paper is to give a general overview of the different designs used to adapt a factory vehicle, with no access to low-level control systems, into a fully-automated cooperative vehicle fit to compete in GCDC2016. The approach taken was pragmatic: different pre-existing techniques for control, state estimation, data fusion, communication, and data degradation were combined and experimentally validated in real-world scenarios, together with other vehicles with different implementations. Our main conclusion is that cooperative autonomous driving is feasible among very different implementations of the communication protocols and using completely different autonomous vehicles.

AB Drifting - operating a vehicle at a high sideslip angle - offers intriguing possibilities for controlling autonomous vehicles in critical situations. While drifting is a very dynamic process, occurring in a region of the state space with saturated tires and unstable equilibria, autonomous vehicles have been successfully controlled in this region. Previous control approaches to path tracking while drifting have relied on nonlinear vehicle models. In this paper, however, we demonstrate that linearized models capture the necessary dynamics for control in a large region surrounding a drift equilibrium. Using this linearized model, we develop a controller based on a linear quadratic regulator. This controller uses steering, throttle, and brakes to track both a desired path and a desired speed profile, making the system fully actuated. We demonstrate the fidelity of this linearized model and the utility of this controller by implementing this controller on MARTY, an electric DMC DeLorean, and accurately tracking equilibrium and quasi-equilibrium paths with centimeter-level accuracy that exceeds prior work.

AB Collision-free navigation of autonomous vehicles by means of convex quadratic programming (CQP) based model predictive control (MPC) is considered in this paper. A new collision-free navigation function is designed for real-time collision avoidance of an autonomous vehicle in both static and dynamic environments. Furthermore, vehicle shape is taken into consideration during trajectory generation as a convex polygonal region defined by linear constraints rather than a single point. Then, the MPC optimization problem with the vehicle shape is solved as a CQP-based MPC scheme in the sense of path planning. Compared to the previous MPC, which can only be reduced to a nonlinear programming problem, the control sequences of CQP-based MPC can be obtained quickly with improved real-time system performance. Simulations in diverse scenarios, including a real vehicle dataset, show the validity of the proposed approach.

TI Making Bertha Drive-An Autonomous Journey on a Historic Route

DT Article
ID STEREO; VISION
AB 125 years after Bertha Benz completed the first overland journey in automotive history, the Mercedes Benz S-Class S 500 INTELLIGENT DRIVE followed the same route from Mannheim to Pforzheim, Germany, in fully autonomous manner. The autonomous vehicle was equipped with close-to-production sensor hardware and relied solely on vision and radar sensors in combination with accurate digital maps to obtain a comprehensive understanding of complex traffic situations. The historic Bertha Benz Memorial Route is particularly challenging for autonomous driving. The course taken by the autonomous vehicle had a length of 103 km and covered rural roads, 23 small villages and major cities (e.g. downtown Mannheim and Heidelberg). The route posed a large variety of difficult traffic scenarios including intersections with and without traffic lights, roundabouts, and narrow passages with oncoming traffic. This paper gives an overview of the autonomous vehicle and presents details on vision and radar-based perception, digital road maps and video-based self-localization, as well as motion planning in complex urban scenarios.

AB Autonomous electric vehicles (AEVs) provide unique opportunities to cope with the uncertainties of distributed energy generation in distribution networks. But the effects are limited by both inherent radial topology and the behaviors of decentralized AEVs. We investigate the potential benefits of dynamic distribution network reconfiguration (DDNR), taking into account AEVs' spatial-temporal availability and their charging demand. We propose a mixed integer programming model to optimally coordinate the charging/discharging of AEVs with DDNR, while satisfying AEVs' original travel plan. Numerical studies based on a test system overlaying the IEEE 33-node test feeder and Sioux Falls transportation network show that DDNR and AEV complement each other, which improves the operation of the distribution system. We also conduct sensitivity analyses on inputs including renewable fluctuation and AEVs penetration level.

The TARP is a constrained version of the Pickup and Delivery Problem with Time Windows (PDPTW). In our former study, a cooperative algorithm, called the triple loop method, with autonomous distributed agents has been proposed. The Improving initial Task Assignment and Avoiding Deadlock method (ITAAD) is a faster algorithm than the triple loop method. In this paper, we propose a new vehicle routing method for the ITAAD. Results of computational experiments show effectiveness of the proposed routing method.

AB This paper addresses the leaderless and leader-follower rendezvous problems of multiple autonomous surface vehicles subject to dynamical uncertainties and ocean disturbances. Distributed robust rendezvous controllers, based on the information of neighboring vehicles, are proposed by employing neural networks, backstepping and graph theory. Lyapunov stability analysis demonstrates that all signals in the closed-loop network are uniformly ultimately bounded. Furthermore, this result is extended to the output feedback case where only the position information can be measured. Neural network-based adaptive observers are developed to estimate the unmeasured velocity of each vehicle, and distributed observer-based rendezvous controllers are proposed. It is proved that, for both cases, rendezvous among vehicles can be reached over any connected undirected communication graphs without requiring the accurate model of each vehicle. An example is given to validate the efficacy of the proposed methods. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB This article deals with trajectory tracking for autonomous cars during evasive maneuvers and in the presence of steering actuator nonlinearities. This article develops an LPV MISO H-infinity controller based on the feedback of the lateral error at the center of gravity and the look-ahead distance. The controller architecture offers a way to cope with the effect of the steering nonlinearities, by scheduling one of the control weighting functions. A detailed experimental validation on three different maneuvers (straight driving, wide bend, and a double-lane change) shows the effectiveness of the proposed LPV solution.

AB Autonomous vehicle (AV) is considered a promising mode of transport that has been tested and deployed in various cities worldwide. However, research on how AVs will transform the field of transportation has been hindered by the heavy reliance on attitude measurements and the need for responses from the public who can better represent the future. This study investigates the autonomous taxi market in Huangpu District, Guangzhou, China, where paid and publicly available autonomous taxi service has been in operation for more than a year. This study analyzes 1,158 responses from pioneering and prospective users of autonomous taxi service. Latent class analysis is used to segment autonomous taxi users into classes to reveal the differences in their views on the potential uses of AVs. This study identifies three latent classes: neutral and diverse travelers, conservative and strict travelers, and open and enjoying travelers. Results show that sociodemographic characteristics, household characteristics, and current travel behavior affect the class membership in various means. In addition, users' perceptions of the benefits and risks of autonomous driving vary across different latent classes. Findings from this study will help improve the quality of autonomous taxi service by enabling customized service based on mobility propensities. This study will also provide insights to help with future vehicle design and transportation policy making.

AB This article focuses on the development of a stable pedestrian crash avoidance mitigation system for autonomous vehicles (AVs). Previous works have only used simple AV-pedestrian models, which do not reflect the actual interaction and risk status of intelligent intersections with manual vehicles. The paper presents a model that simulates the interaction between automatic driving vehicles and pedestrians on unsignalized crosswalks using the multi-agent deep deterministic policy gradient (MADDPG) algorithm. The MADDPG algorithm optimizes the PCAM strategy through the continuous interaction of multiple independent agents and effectively captures the inherent uncertainty in continuous learning and human behavior. Experimental results show that the MADDPG model can fully mitigate collisions in different scenarios and outperforms the DDPG and DRL algorithms.

AB Operators of offshore production units (OPUs) employ risk-based assessment (RBA) techniques in order to minimise inspection expenses while maintaining risks at an acceptable level. However, when human divers and workers are involved in inspections conducted at high heights, the operational risks can be significant. Recently, there has been a growing trend towards the use of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), autonomous surface vehicles (ASVs), remotely operated vehicles (ROVs), and autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) for inspections of offshore structures as a means to reduce exposure to human risk. This article provides an analysis of these vehicle inspection capabilities and their potential to enhance robustness and safety within the oil and gas industry. The review assesses both the advantages and the drawbacks associated with these innovative systems, providing valuable comparisons and assessments on their potential use as viable alternatives to conventional inspection methods.

AB The development and applications of mobile communication technologies in intelligent autonomous transportation systems have led to an extraordinary rise in the mount of connected and autonomous vehicles (CAVs). Ensuring the security of in-vehicle communication data is the basis for the safety of cooperative transportation systems. An in-vehicle controller area network (CAN) bus is an important issue in in-vehicle security, and some hackers have mastered remote vehicle control methods through the CAN bus network. This paper proposes an improved isolation forest method with data mass (MS-iForest) for data tampering attack detection, in which we use data mass instead of the number of divisions and give an anomaly score ranking to quantify the degree of anomalies. This method is promising to be used as part of the intrusion detection system, like a security component in the onboard gateway, which can effectively avoid the data tampering attacks. We compare the proposed method with other anomaly detection schemes based on the data collected from an in-vehicle simulated dataset and two standard datasets. The experiment results show that the proposed method performs better than the other anomaly detection schemes in terms of the area under the receiver operating curve (AUC).

AB As a crucial technology of air-to-air confrontation, autonomous maneuver decision has attracted wide attention in recent years. This article proposes an improved pigeon-inspired optimization method to realize autonomous maneuver decision for unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) rapidly and accurately in an aerial combat engagement. The maneuver library is designed, including some advanced offensive and defensive maneuvers. A dependent set of trial maneuvers is generated to help UAVs make decisions in any tactical situation, and a future engagement state of the opponent UAV is predicted for each trial maneuver. The core of the decision-making process is that the objective function to be optimized is designed using the game mixed strategy, and the optimal mixed strategy is obtained by the improved pigeon-inspired optimization. A comparative analysis with other classical optimization algorithms highlights the advantage of the proposed algorithm. The simulation tests are conducted under four different initial conditions, namely, neutral, offensive, opposite, and defensive conditions. The simulation results verify the effectiveness of the proposed autonomous maneuver decision method.

AB Advocates of autonomous driving predict that the occupation of taxi driver could be made obsolete by shared autonomous vehicles (SAV) in the long term. Conducting interviews with German taxi drivers, we investigate how they perceive the changes caused by advancing automation for the future of their business. Our study contributes insights into how the work of taxi drivers could change given the advent of autonomous driving: While the task of driving could be taken over by SAVs for standard trips, taxi drivers are certain that other areas of their work such as providing supplementary services and assistance to passengers would constitute a limit to such forms of automation, but probably involving a shifting role for the taxi drivers, one which focuses on the sociality of the work. Our findings illustrate how taxi drivers see the future of their work, suggesting design implications for tools that take various forms of assistance into account, and demonstrating how important it is to consider taxi drivers in the co-design of future taxis and SAV services.

AB Smart Autonomous Vehicles (AVSs) are networks of Cyber-Physical Systems (CPSs) in which they wirelessly communicate with other CPSs sub-systems (e.g., smart -vehicles and smart-devices) to efficiently and securely plan safe travel. Due to unreliable wireless communication among them, such vehicles are an easy target of malware attacks that may compromise vehicles' autonomy, increase inter-vehicle communication latency, and drain vehicles' power. Such compromises may result in traffic congestion, threaten the safety of passengers, and can result in financial loss. Therefore, real-time detection of such attacks is key to the safe smart transportation and Intelligent Transport Systems (ITSs). Current approaches either employ static analysis or dynamic analysis techniques to detect such attacks. However, these approaches may not detect malware in real-time because of zero-day attacks and huge computational resources. Therefore, we introduce a hybrid approach that combines the strength of both analyses to efficiently detect malware for the privacy of smart-cities.

ID AUTOMATIC GUIDANCE; SYSTEMS; ACCURACY
AB A control method for autonomous vehicles was developed to steer the vehicle to a given target point. Since four-wheeled vehicles have constraints known as nonholonomic constraints, a nonlinear control theory was applied to generate a trajectory that would permit a vehicle to run from a starting point to its goal within these constraints by tracking it. The method was extended to turns exceeding 90degrees by deriving a trajectory generation method using polar coordinates. The accuracy of the control was examined by simulation and field experiments. This accurate trajectory-tracing technology can be used to fully automate agricultural operations. Since the proposed control algorithm was an open-loop control, disturbances such as wheel slippage caused navigation error. To minimize error, feedback terms were added by linearizing the vehicle's kinematic equations around a nominal trajectory generated with the-open-loop algorithm.

AB In emerging autonomous vehicles, perception of the environment around the vehicle depends not only on the quality and choice of sensor type, but more importantly also on the instrumented location and orientation of each of the sensors. This article explores the synthesis of heterogeneous sensor configurations toward achieving vehicle autonomy goals. We propose a novel optimization framework called VESPA that explores the design space of the sensor placement locations and orientations to find the optimal sensor configuration for a vehicle. We demonstrate how our framework can obtain optimal sensor configurations for heterogeneous sensors deployed across two contemporary real vehicles.

AB Transport researchers and practitioners have long been seeking capable solutions to deal with the traffic oscillations caused by freeway merging. Although existing approaches based on ramp metering have improved the overall efficiency of on-ramps, their performance is still far below the theoretical capacity. The recently proposed detecting technology of autonomous vehicles (AVs) provides an alternative for maximizing the merging efficiency by developing and using appropriate controllers for AVs. In this paper, we develop a cooperative intelligent driver model in order to examine the system performance under different proportions of AVs. The results show that, with a proper vehicle-to-vehicle controlling mechanism, an increasing percentage of AVs will reduce the total travel time and smooth traffic oscillations.

AB RGB cameras are one of the most relevant sensors for autonomous driving applications. It is undeniable that failures of vehicle cameras may compromise the autonomous driving task, possibly leading to unsafe behaviors when images that are subsequently processed by the driving system are altered. To support the definition of safe and robust vehicle architectures and intelligent systems, in this paper we define the failure modes of a vehicle camera, together with an analysis of effects and known mitigations. Further, we build a software library for the generation of the corresponding failed images, and we feed them to six object detectors for mono and stereo cameras and to the self-driving agent of an autonomous driving simulator. The resulting misbehaviors with respect to operating with clean images allow a better understanding of failures effects and the related safety risks in image-based applications.

AB A dock for an autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) allows the vehicle to be left on station ready for deployment. However, it represents a significant engineering challenge, as docking requires an accurate navigation system so that the vehicle can rind the dock, and complex mechanics to make the required underwater power and data connections. This paper describes the docking system built for the REMUS AUV. It outlines the basis for the design decisions, the as-built configuration, and its performance once deployed. It also delineates the lessons learned from the deployments, and the refinements in the vehicle that have been made since that time, that will improve the system's utility and reliability.

AB There is a need for in-depth studies of autonomous vehicle safety that evaluate the effectiveness of safety functions and different "atomic" technology combinations for vehicles and roads. In this paper, we provide a crash avoidance effectiveness evaluation model for autonomous vehicles enabled with different sensor combinations based on multiple variables of 14 different "atomic" sensing technologies on the vehicle side and road side, 52 safety functions, and 14 accident types. Meanwhile, a cost-sharing model is developed based on the traveled distance during the life cycle of vehicles and based on the traffic flow over the life cycle of roads to evaluate the unit cost per km of different "atomic" technology combinations. The results clearly show that the cost increases with the addition of "atomic" sensing technologies on the vehicle side, while an increase in crash avoidance effectiveness decreases. It is necessary to switch to V2X and to introduce roadside "atomic" technology combinations to realize better safety effectiveness at a lower cost for vehicles. In addition, a map that covers the safety effectiveness and cost per kilometer of all "atomic" technology combinations is calculated for decision-makers to select combinations under the preconditions of cost and safety.

AB The occurring growth in e-commerce comes along with an increasing number of first-time delivery failures due to the customer's absence at the delivery location. Failed deliveries result in rework, causing a significant impact on the carriers' delivery cost. Hence, the last mile is the portion of a journey that involves moving people and commodities from a transportation hub to a final destination, which should be an efficient process. The above-mentioned concept is used in supply chain management and transportation planning. The paper at hand is a position paper that aims to scrutinize the concept of driverless last-mile delivery, with autonomous vehicles, in order to highlight and stress the challenges and limitations in the existing technology that hinder level five autonomous driving. Specifically, this work documents the current capabilities of the existing autonomous vehicles' perception and cognition system and outlines their future skills towards addressing complete autonomous last-mile delivery, as well as efficient robotic process automation in logistics from warehouse/distribution center to hub's delivery.

ID SLIDING MODE CONTROL; THRUSTER DYNAMICS
AB This paper presents a six-degrees-of-freedom controller for autonomous underwater vehicles. The control algorithm is adaptive in the dynamic parameters that are poorly known and time-varying in the underwater environment. Moreover, the proposed control law adopts quaternions to represent attitude errors, and thus avoids representation singularities that occur when using instead Euler angles description of the orientation. The adaptive controller has been successfully implemented and experimentally validated on onmi-directional intelligent navigator (ODIN), an autonomous underwater vehicle that has been designed and built at the University of Hawaii. The experimental results demonstrate the good performance of the proposed controller within the constraints of the sensory system.

SO IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON SOFTWARE ENGINEERING

ID DEEP; VISION
AB Adversarial test generation techniques aim to produce input perturbations that cause a DNN to compute incorrect outputs. For autonomous vehicles driven by a DNN, however, the effect of such perturbations are attenuated by other parts of the system and are less effective as vehicle state evolves. In this work we argue that for adversarial testing perturbations to be effective on autonomous vehicles, they must account for the subtle interplay between the DNN and vehicle states. Building on that insight, we develop DeepManeuver, an automated framework that interleaves adversarial test generation with vehicle trajectory physics simulation. Thus, as the vehicle moves along a trajectory, DeepManeuver enables the refinement of candidate perturbations to: (1) account for changes in the state of the vehicle that may affect how the perturbation is perceived by the system; (2) retain the effect of the perturbation on previous states so that the current state is still reachable and past trajectory is preserved; and (3) result in multi-target maneuvers that require fulfillment of vehicle state sequences (e.g. reaching locations in a road to navigate a tight turn). Our assessment reveals that DeepManeuver can generate perturbations to force maneuvers more effectively and consistently than state-of-the-art techniques by 20.7 percentage points on average. We also show DeepManeuver's effectiveness at disrupting vehicle behavior to achieve multi-target maneuvers with a minimum 52% rate of success.

AB Focusing on a freeway lane running with mixed semi-autonomous vehicles (semi-AVs) and fully -autonomous vehicles (fully-AVs), this study aims to investigate the heterogeneous platooning effect of the two types of autonomous vehicles (AVs) on the travel efficiency of the mixed traffic. Such impact in the mixed semi-/fully-AV traffic, to the best of our knowledge, has not been well addressed in the literature as the existing mixed traffic studies on platooning effect typically focused on the traffic scenes with only human-driven vehicles (HVs) and fully-AVs. The existence of semi-AVs, which are optionally controlled by human drivers and semi-autonomous driving systems, and their significant difference in platooning behavior from the fully-AVs have received very limited attention. To fill the gap, we first characterize the semi-and fully-AVs' difference in connection ability and willingness to platoon in the vehicle platooning process, and derive the heterogeneous platooning probabilities of semi-and fully-AVs. To formulate the platooned traffic after vehicle platooning process, we proceed to develop a novel Markov chain model to determine the probability distributions of vehicular platoon size and headway type among the mixed semi-/fully-AV traffic analytically. Furthermore, with the probability distributions, we derive the fundamental diagram (FD) and the capacity of the freeway lane for the mixed semi-/fully-AV traffic, and are thus able to investigate impact of platooning on the travel efficiency numerically. The developed models and unveiled insights in this study will help researchers and practitioners better understand the role, potential and prospect of automated transport system in the transitional stage with semi-AVs, which will be useful for guiding the mixed AV traffic management and control in near future.

AB This paper focuses on the development of Bayesian-based domain search strategies using distributed multiple autonomous vehicles with intermittent communications. Multi-sensor fusion based on observations from neighboring vehicles is implemented via binary Bayesian filtering. We prove theoretically that, under appropriate sensor models, the belief of whether there exists an object at every discretized cell in the domain will converge to the true state. An uncertainty map representing the entropies associated with these probabilities is constructed to guide the vehicles' motion for domain exploration. Under the proposed strategies, all objects in the search domain will be detected. Different motion control schemes are numerically tested to confirm the effectiveness of the proposed search strategies.

AB Connected and Autonomous Vehicles (CAVs) are becoming a reality and are progressively penetrating the markets level by level. CAVs are a promising solution for traffic safety. However, robust studies are needed to explore and assess the expected behavior. This study attempts to evaluate traffic safety resulting from a near-real introduction of CAVs with different levels of automation (from Level 1 to Level 4). The investigation consisted of modeling different CAV levels using Gipps' model, followed by the simulation of nine mixed fleets at a motorway segment. Subsequently, the Surrogate Safety Assessment Model was used for safety analysis. According to the results: (1) the gradual penetration of CAV levels led to a progressive reduction in traffic conflicts, ranging from 18.9% when the penetration of high levels of automation (Level 3 and Level 4 vehicles) is 5%, to 94.1% when all the vehicles on the traffic flow are Level 4; (2) human-driven vehicles and vehicles with low levels of automation (Level 1 and Level 2 vehicles) are more frequently involved in conflicts (as follower vehicles) than vehicles with high automation levels. E.g. human-driven vehicles are involved in conflicts from 8% to 122% more, while vehicles with high automation levels are involved in conflicts from 80% to 18% less than their sharing percentages, respectively, depending on different mixed fleets. This study confirms the theory and conclusions from previous literature that indicate a safety gain due to CAV penetration. Moreover, it provides a broader perspective and support for the introduction of CAVs levels.

AB Accidents are continuously reported for autonomous driving vehicles including those with advanced sensors installed. Some of accidents are usually caused by bad weather, poor lighting conditions and non-line-of-sight obstacles. Cellular Vehicle-to-Everything (C-V2X) radio technology can significantly improve those weak spots for autonomous driving. This paper describes one of the C-V2X system solutions: Vulnerable Road User Collision Warning (VRUCW) for autonomous driving. The paper provides the system architecture, design logic, network topology, message flow, artificial intelligence (AI) and network security feature. As a reference it also includes a commercial project with its test results.

AB Human-machine interaction is an active area of research due to the rapid development of autonomous systems and the need for communication. This review provides further insight into the specific issue of the information flow between pedestrians and automated vehicles by evaluating recent advances in external human-machine interfaces (eHMI), which enable the transmission of state and intent information from the vehicle to the rest of the traffic participants. Recent developments will be explored and studies analyzing their effectiveness based on pedestrian feedback data will be presented and contextualized. As a result, we aim to draw a broad perspective on the current status and recent techniques for eHMI and some guidelines that will encourage future research and development of these systems.

AB (Light Detection And Ranging) sensors have been widely used in autonomous vehicles as the main sensors. According to the specification details of the widely used 3D products in the market, the distribution of vertical beam channels is set according to a uniform angular resolution, which is not ideally efficient for specific autonomous tasks. In this paper, we propose a novel approach to find the optimized angular distribution of the vertical beam channels for different application scenarios and installation configurations. The experimental results in a study case suggest that concerning the vehicle detection task, the optimized perform almost two times better than the ones with the same number of channels in terms of the detection range, and have perception performances close to the with double channels in the long distance.

ID SHIPMENT SIZE; OPPORTUNITIES; CHOICE
AB This paper examines how vehicle size and multi-drop deliveries may change as a result of the removal of the driver cost for autonomous goods vehicles. Analysis is conducted by combining parameters derived from transport economics and vehicle engineering for a series of increasingly complex applications, ultimately incorporating a unique vehicle routing problem formulation for two multi-destination applications. It is concluded that while the removal of the driver cost produced the greatest savings, the use of smaller vehicles and fewer deliveries per journey could produce incremental savings, dependent on the application. The incremental savings and po-tential change in vehicle sizes and number of deliveries was greatest for applications: 1) where the human driver would otherwise constitute a greater proportion of overall cost (such as urban deliveries), 2) where there is greater dispersion of delivery locations relative to the origin depot, 3) where the value of the cargo time is higher. For a UK customer deliveries case study currently using 3.5 t vans, a shift to smaller 2.1 t vans performing 40-60% fewer stops per route could lead to an additional 7-16% of cost savings, or up to 75% savings when combined with the direct driver cost savings. By contrast, for a UK supermarket distribution case study using 44 t articu-lated trucks, the introduction of some 26 t rigids serving fewer stops per route indicated effec-tively negligible potential savings compared to the 22-32% of savings due to the removal of the driver. Conclusions are conditional on treating a number of aspects of the logistics system as fixed in order to isolate factors of interest. Realistically, such aspects may be subject to change in future scenarios under the combined impact of autonomous freight vehicles and other trends.

AB Traditional nonintrusive object inspection methods are complex or extremely expensive to apply in certain cases, such as inspection of enormous objects, underwater or maritime inspection, an unobtrusive inspection of a crowded place, etc. With the latest advances in robotics, autonomous self-driving vehicles could be applied for this task. The present study is devoted to a review of the existing and novel technologies and methods of using autonomous self-driving vehicles for nonintrusive object inspection. Both terrestrial and maritime self-driving vehicles, their typical construction, sets of sensors, and software algorithms used for implementing self-driving motion were analyzed. The standard types of sensors used for nonintrusive object inspection in security checks at the control points, which could be successfully implemented at self-driving vehicles, along with typical areas of implementation of such vehicles, were reviewed, analyzed, and classified.

ID MODEL
AB In this study, to explore the demand characteristics of autonomous coaches in mixed traffic flow, two sections of an expressway were selected for vehicle experiments. With personification as the goal, sensors of the ego-vehicle were used to collect naturalistic car-following behavior data of surrounding coaches. After analyzing the naturalistic car-following data, car-driving behavior characteristics of the coach drivers were acquired. The analysis results indicate that the overall car-following processes of coaches tend to be relatively stable, and most of the car-following processes are in the conditions of higher velocity, smaller acceleration, and smaller relative velocity than the front vehicle. The expected following spacing and time headway of the coach drivers increase with the increase of velocity. By analysis and comparison with existing safe following models, it is found that while the safety and the warning rate based on the car-following coach safety distance model are higher, the warning rate of the car-following time headway model at the relatively higher velocity is lower. The coach safety distance model established in this study considers the car-following risk and the acceptance rate of the drivers to the warning system. This model conforms to the driver & x2019;s car-following characteristics and fulfills the requirements of collision avoidance. Applying the safety distance model to the autonomous coach would effectively improve the anthropopathic behavior characteristics of the autonomous coach. Additionally, the abnormality caused by the interference of other vehicles in mixed traffic flow of autonomous and human vehicles is successfully avoided under the premise of ensuring the safe driving of the autonomous coach.

AB In this paper, we examine potential methods for autonomously tracking and landing multi-rotor unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), a complex yet essential problem. Autonomous tracking and landing control technology utilizes visual navigation, relying solely on vision and landmarks to track targets and achieve autonomous landing. This technology improves the UAV's environment perception and autonomous flight capabilities in GPS-free scenarios. In particular, we are researching tracking and landing as a cohesive unit, devising a switching plan for various UAV tracking and landing modes, and creating a flight controller that has an inner and outer loop structure based on relative position estimation. The inner and outer nested markers aid in the autonomous tracking and landing of UAVs. Optimal parameters are determined via optimized experiments on the measurements of the inner and outer markers. An indoor experimental platform for tracking and landing UAVs was established. Tracking performance was verified by tracking three trajectories of an unmanned ground vehicle (UGV) at varying speeds, and landing accuracy was confirmed through static and dynamic landing experiments. The experimental results show that the proposed scheme has good dynamic tracking and landing performance.

AB The expectation of spreading autonomous vehicles lies in the hope of significantly decreasing the 1,3 million death toll accidents worldwide, which are caused by human factor 90% of the time. In policies of insurance companies the reaction time of a human realizing any dangerous situation, reacting to it and putting the breaks into action is two seconds. The reaction time would be reduced by the power of AI that can process the huge amount of data coming from sensors and with the information regarding the situation could make decision much faster than men. The aim of the research is to denote several situations and possibilities that are capable of deceiving, diverting, capturing a self-driving car or even turning it against the other vehicles by influencing the decision-making of the artificial intelligence. In this paper I will discuss several situations that might be able to confuse the artificial intelligence of the autonomous vehicles or to make them come to an inadequate decision. You can see that safe decision-making depends on the teaching method of the artificial intelligence as well as the correctness of the data uploaded. The other aim of the research is to demonstrate how could work a Manchurian Artificial Intelligence in autonomous vehicles. I will introduce the idea of Manchurian artificial intelligence which can be activated by a certain event and can pose a threat to the passengers of the vehicles. If it is present in the software of several vehicles, a chain of worldwide accidents can be induced at a certain time.

AB This paper describes an autonomous Intelligent Controller (IC) architecture directly applicable to the design of unmanned autonomous vehicles and develops metrics associated with their collaborative abilities. The vehicles may operate independently or cooperate to carry out complex missions involving disparate sensors or payload packages. The IC technology has been demonstrated in prototype designs of actual, autonomous, unmanned, intelligently controlled vehicles. An approach to measure the performance achieved when collaboration is allowed between vehicles is also presented, including the gain obtained over the base capability of the vehicles operating independently. Simulation results are provided to demonstrate the use of the metrics and performance attainable. Although this paper briefly presents one particular intelligent control architecture, the goal of the paper is to provide metrics that are applicable to a broader class of control architectures as developed by the research community.

AB Abundant cheap non-renewable fossil fuels have underpinned rapid growth in the global tourism industry. In the future, the need to combat climate change and to move the global economy into a low-carbon production model will force the transport system to switch to low or no-carbon motive power and to adopt new forms of mobility organisation. This paper comments on the potential impact of autonomous vehicles (AVs) on the global tourism system. The discussion is framed against the broader questions of how global society will respond to the impact of climate change and how this response will affect future tourism mobility.

AB Autonomous vehicles demand a continuous path to provide the passengers with physical ease and relaxation. Smooth experience in autonomous vehicles is very essential and can be accomplished by having good trajectories. The trajectory generated by the interpolation algorithm for Geometric Hermite is provided in this paper. The proposed algorithm calculates a path based on a set of geometric Hermite data that consists of predefined points including prescribed tangent angles and curvature values. The generated path has the potential to determine the maximum speed allowed for safe autonomous driving on roads by providing curvature information. It describes an alternative way to estimate design speed permitted on the road for autonomous lane change systems. (C) 2021 THE AUTHORS.

AB This paper develops a two-stage nonlinear nonconvex control approach for autonomous vehicle driving during highway cruise conditions. The goal of the controller is to track the centerline of the roadway while avoiding obstacles. An outer-loop nonlinear model predictive control is adopted for generating the collision-free trajectory with the resultant input based on a simplified vehicle model. The optimization is solved through the generalized minimal residual method augmented with a continuation method. A sufficient condition to overcome limitations associated with continuation methods is introduced. The inner loop is a simple linear feedback controller based on an optimal preview distance. Simulation results illustrate the effectiveness of the approach. These are bolstered by scaled-vehicle experimental results.

AB This paper addresses the formation control problem for fleets of autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs). The solution is based on the virtual leader approach, with the main goal of designing a control system to cope with the inter-vehicle communication problems, especially significant in underwater environments. The use of kinematic relations allows the linearization of the AUV dynamics maintaining its turning capacities. The control strategy consists of a feedback H-2/H-infinity controller in combination with a feedforward controller, which makes it possible to deal with delays and packets dropouts while ensuring a good formation control performance.

AB This paper presents a reference generator for ground vehicles, based on potential fields adapted to the case of vehicular dynamics. The reference generator generates signals to be tracked by the vehicle, corresponding to a trajectory avoiding collisions with obstacles. This generator integrates artificial forces of potential fields of the object surrounding the vehicle. The reference generator is used with a controller to ensure the tracking of the accident-free reference. This approach can be used for vehicle autonomous driving or for active control of manned vehicles. Simulation results, presented for the autonomous driving, consider a scenario inspired by the so-called moose (or elk) test, with the presence of other collaborative vehicles.

The approach focuses on the formal modeling of CAVs by means of timed automata, allowing a formal and exhaustive analysis of the behaviors of vehicles. VerifCar supports a parametric modeling of CAV systems as a network of timed automata tailored for verification and limiting the well-known state space explosion. As an illustration, VerifCar is applied to check robustness and efficiency, as well as to asses the impact of communication delays on the decision algorithms of CAVs, on well chosen case studies representing real-life critical situations.

First the velocity and position control of the single vehicle is studied based on internal model compensator. And then the platooning problem on multiple vehicles is solved in the light of multiagent concept. Moreover, the platoon condition is derived for the corresponding scheme. Further we analyze the influence of controller parameters on the whole system, and propose the guidance for parameter design. Finally some simulations are used to verify the effectiveness of the proposed IDC scheme with an analysis on controller parameters. (C) 2019 ISA. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The continuous flow of autonomous vehicle-based data could revolutionize current map updating procedures and allow completely new types of mapping applications. Therefore, in this article, we demonstrate the feasibility of using perception data of autonomous vehicles to replace traditionally conducted mobile mapping surveys with a case study focusing on updating a register of roadside city trees. In our experiment, we drove along a 1.3-km-long road in Helsinki to collect laser scanner data using our autonomous car platform ARVO, which is based on a Ford Mondeo hybrid passenger vehicle equipped with a Velodyne VLS-128 Alpha Prime scanner and other high-grade sensors for autonomous perception. For comparison, laser scanner data from the same region were also collected with a specially-planned high-grade mobile mapping laser scanning system. Based on our results, the diameter at breast height, one of the key parameters of city tree registers, could be estimated with a lower root-mean-square error from the perception data of the autonomous car than from the specially-planned mobile laser scanning survey, provided that time-based filtering was included in the post-processing of the autonomous perception data to mitigate distortions in the obtained point cloud. Therefore, appropriately performed post-processing of the autonomous perception data can be regarded as a viable option for keeping maps updated in road environments. However, point cloud-processing algorithms may need to be adapted for the post-processing of autonomous perception data due to the differences in the sensors and their arrangements compared to designated mobile mapping systems. We also emphasize that time-based filtering may be required in the post-processing of autonomous perception data due to point cloud distortions around objects seen at multiple times. This highlights the importance of saving the time stamp for each data point in the autonomous perception data or saving the temporal order of the data points.

TI Safety of active pre-collision seat rotation strategies for autonomous
   vehicles: injury risk evaluation of occupant's neck
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF CRASHWORTHINESS
LA English
DT Article
DE Occupant safety; neck injury evaluation; active seat rotation strategy;
   impact force; restraint system; autonomous vehicle
AB The development of autonomous driving technology has engendered new requirements for the safety of the occupants of autonomous vehicles. Different variants of seat configurations, including face-to-face rides and rotating seats, have been implemented in autonomous vehicles. Furthermore, pre-collision active seat rotation strategies have been proposed for the safety of the occupants of autonomous vehicles. However, further evaluations are required to determine whether the active seat rotation strategy could cause injuries to the occupants during a significantly rapid rotation process. In this study, two types of multi-rigid body seat-occupant models and a finite element model of the occupant's cervical spine were designed. The validity of the multi-rigid body model for the seat occupant was verified through a frontal collision simulation test. Considering the influence of different seat types and rotation directions on the risk of neck injuries to the occupants, four simulations were conducted based on the condition that the seat rotated by 90 degrees in 200 ms. The kinematic and biomechanical aspects of the risk of injuries to the occupant's cervical spine during the active seat rotation strategy were assessed, and the essential causes of these injuries were discussed. The results indicate that, in the absence of leg baffles and foot supports, seat rotation toward the diagonal line of the seatbelt poses different degrees of risk of injuries to the cervical spine, platysma, sternocleidomastoid, common carotid artery, external jugular vein, and internal jugular vein. Therefore, the seats of highly or fully autonomous vehicles should be designed to prevent this scenario.

AB The design of a Martian autonomous rotary wing vehicle (MARV) is described. MARV is a 50-kg gross takeoff mass; coaxial helicopter designed for Mars exploration. Powered by a fuel cell system, it carries a payload of 10.8 kg over a range of 25 km with an endurance of 39 min including hover capability for 1 min. MARV is designed in response to the Request For Proposal from NASA/Sikorsky for the Year 2000 American Helicopter Society student design competition. The design covers aerodynamic and structural design of rotor blades, vehicle power plant, fuselage and landing gear, control system, transmission, and vehicle lander communications. A detailed mechanism for autonomous deployment of the vehicle from the lander is also described. This preliminary design study indicates that controlled vertical flight on Mars is feasible with existing technology.

AB Autonomous driving is becoming one of the most popular applications of AI. Meanwhile, the advances in deep learning have promoted the rapid development of the voice controllable systems (VCSs), which have almost reached the maturity stage. Before autonomous driving cars reach the highest level of automation, intelligent voice interaction remains the primary approach for human-vehicle interaction. Recent works show that such intelligent systems are vulnerable to hidden voice commands that are unnoticed or unintelligible to humans. In particular, an adversary utilizing hidden voice commands is able to control autonomous driving cars. For example, malicious voice commands embedded into the sound of online shared videos can stealthily control the vehicle when people watch the videos in the car. In this article, we investigate the potential perniciousness of hidden voice commands on the VCS of autonomous driving cars, and then discuss feasible defense strategies. We finally propose a pop-noisebased general defense strategy that can resist various kinds of attacks.

ID AUTOMATED VEHICLES
AB Using results from a design-research studio analysing rail station access in Melbourne, this article considers how differing Autonomous Vehicle (AV) deployment models might fit into a suburban landscape. The results challenge assumptions about AV deployment. If AVs are low occupancy, peak demands may require station carparks to be used entirely as pick-up/drop off zones. This suggests little opportunity to re-purpose car parks for non-transport uses. Further, with AVs uncoupling station demand from existing feeder bus and park-and-ride provision, a re-distribution of demand along rail corridors may occur. The work has broad applicability to the policy challenges of an AV future.

AB Self-driving cars constantly assess their environment to choose routes, comply with traffic regulations, and avoid hazards. To that aim, such vehicles are equipped with wireless communications transceivers as well as multiple sensors, including automotive radars. The fact that autonomous vehicles implement both radar and communications motivates designing these functionalities in a joint manner. Such dualfunction radar-communications (DFRC) designs are the focus of a large body of recent work. These approaches can lead to substantial gains in size, cost, power consumption, robustness, and performance, especially when both radar and communications operate in the same range, which is the case in vehicular applications.

TI LOCALIZATION AND NAVIGATION IN AUTONOMOUS DRIVING: ThREATS AND
   COUNTERMEASURES
SO IEEE WIRELESS COMMUNICATIONS
LA English
DT Article
AB With the growing number of research studies on autonomous driving, a lot of new technologies for self-driving cars are also constantly emerging. While significantly promoting the development of autonomous vehicles, these emerging technologies also have potential vulnerabilities, which may bring up some nonnegligible security threats. Loopholes existing in localization and navigation technologies, which are the key elements of route planning and navigation, could be utilized by adversaries to manipulate autonomous driving navigation by hijacking valuable vehicles, goods, or even target characters. Toward this end, we provide in this article a basic guide summarizing the security threats and attack schemes, and we propose countermeasures specifically for localization and navigation technologies in autonomous vehicles. After that, we present a novel route spoofing attack that could also be implemented against future autonomous driving navigation. With such implementation, we demonstrate that effectively, routes of targeted drivers can be usurped and hence mislead drivers to take a wrong route, go by a malicious place, and even be tracked in real time.

AB The use of robotic systems, especially multi-rotor aerial vehicles, in the documentation of historical buildings and cultural heritage monuments has become common in recent years. However, the teleoperated robotic systems have significant limitations encouraging the ongoing development of autonomous unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs). The autonomous robotic platforms provide a more accurate and safe measurement in distant and difficult to access areas than their teleoperated counterpart. Through the use of autonomous aerial robotic systems, access to such places by humans and building of external infrastructures like scaffolding for documentation purposes is no longer necessary. In this work, we aim to present a novel autonomous unmanned aerial vehicle designed for the documentation of hardly attainable areas of historical buildings. The prototype of this robot was tested in several historical monuments comprising scanned objects located in dark and hardly accessible areas in the upper parts of tall naves. This manuscript presents the results from two specific places: the Church of St. Anne and St. Jacob the Great in Stara Voda, and St. Maurice Church in Olomouc, both in the Czech Republic. Finally, we also compare the three-dimensional map obtained with the measurements made by the 3D laser scanner carried onboard UAV against the ones performed by a 3D terrestrial laser scanner.

AB Traffic management challenges in peak seasons for popular destinations such as Madinah city have accelerated the need for and introduction of autonomous vehicles and Vehicular ad hoc networks (VANETs) to assist in communication and alleviation of traffic congestions. The primary goal of this study is to evaluate the performance of communication routing protocols in VANETs between autonomous and human-driven vehicles in Madinah city in varying traffic conditions. A simulation of assorted traffic distributions and densities were modeled in an extracted map of Madinah city and then tested in two application scenarios with three ad hoc routing protocols using a combination of traffic and network simulation tools working in tandem. The results measured for the average trip time show that opting for a fully autonomous vehicle scenario reduces the trip time of vehicles by approximately 7.1% in high traffic densities and that the reactive ad hoc routing protocols induce the least delay for network packets to reach neighboring VANET vehicles. From these observations, it can be asserted that autonomous vehicles provide a significant reduction in travel time and that either of the two reactive ad hoc routing protocols could be implemented for the VANET implementation in Madinah city. Furthermore, we perform an ANOVA test to examine the effects of the factors that are considered in our study on the variation of the results.

AB We consider an autonomous vehicle-target assignment problem where a group of vehicles are expected to optimally assign themselves to a set of targets. We introduce a game-theoretical formulation of the problem in which the vehicles are viewed as self-interested decision makers, Thus, we seek the optimization of a global utility function through autonomous vehicles that ore capable of making individually rational decisions to optimize their own utility functions. The first important aspect of the problem is to choose the utility functions of the vehicles in such a way that the objectives of the vehicles are localized to each vehicle yet aligned with a global utility function. The second important aspect of the problem is to equip the vehicles with an appropriate negotiation mechanism by which each vehicle pursues the optimization of its own utility function. We present several design procedures and accompanying caveats for vehicle utility, design. We present two new negotiation mechanisms, namely, "generalized regret monitoring with fading memory and inertia" and "selective spatial adaptive play," and provide accompanying proofs of their convergence. Finally, we present simulations that illustrate how vehicle negotiations can consistently lead to near-optimal assignments provided that the utilities of the vehicles are designed appropriately.

AB Pedestrian tracking is an important aspect of autonomous vehicles environment perception in a vehicle running environment. The performance of the existing pedestrian tracking algorithms is limited by the complex traffic environment, the changeable appearance characteristics of pedestrians and the frequent occlusion interaction, which leads to the insufficient accuracy and stability of tracking. Therefore, this paper proposes a detector-tracker integration framework for autonomous vehicle pedestrian tracking. Firstly, a pedestrian objects detector based on the improved YOLOv7 network was established. Space-to-Depth convolution layer was adopted to improve the backbone network of YOLOv7. Then, a novel appearance feature extraction network is proposed, which integrates the convolutional structural re-parameterization idea to construct a full-scale feature extraction block, which is the optimized DeepSORT tracker. Finally, experiments were carried out on MOT17 and MOT20 public datasets and driving video sequences, and the tracking performance of the proposed framework was evaluated by comparing it with the most advanced multi-object tracking algorithms. Quantitative analysis results show that the framework has high tracking accuracy. Compared with DeepSORT, MOTA improves by 2.3% in the MOT17 dataset and MOTA improves by 4.2% in the MOT20 dataset. Through qualitative evaluation on real driving video sequences, the framework proposed in this paper is robust in a variety of climate environments, and can be effectively applied to the pedestrian tracking of autonomous vehicles.

AB Robotic structures that couple autonomous surface vehicles and unmanned underwater vehicles in integrated systems with various levels of cooperation provide interesting solutions to the problem of developing efficient, versatile and cost effective tools for exploration, monitoring and exploitation of the underwater environment. In this paper we describe the development and preliminary field testing of an autonomous surface vehichle that can automatically track, deploy and recover a small remotely operated vehicle, which is guided from a shore-ground station. This goal is achieved by exploiting two-ways transmission of data and commands through the umbilical and a wireless link with a shore-ground station. In this way, pilots can experiment telepresence in the underwater environment, avoiding the need of expensive and logistically demanding manned supply vessel. The vehicle is a small aluminum hull boat, equipped with a steering outboard electric motor. A multi-agent system in the ROS framework is proposed for the robotic structure. The use of commercial-off-the-shelf components and the choice of a multi-agent ROS architecture are a mean to reduce costs and to assure performances, modularity and versatility. Field tests in both supervised and autonomous guidance mode have been performed in order to assess the basic functionalities of the system and their results are illustrated and discussed.

AB Reinforcement learning has demonstrated its potential in a series of challenging domains. However, many real-world decision making tasks involve unpredictable environmental changes or unavoidable perception errors that are often enough to mislead an agent into making suboptimal decisions and even cause catastrophic failures. In light of these potential risks, reinforcement learning with application in safety-critical autonomous driving domain remains tricky without ensuring robustness against environmental uncertainties (e.g., road adhesion changes or measurement noises). Therefore, this paper proposes a novel constrained adversarial reinforcement learning approach for robust decision making of autonomous vehicles at highway on-ramps. Environmental disturbance is modelled as an adversarial agent that can learn an optimal adversarial policy to thwart the autonomous driving agent. Meanwhile, observation perturbation is approximated to maximize the variation of the perturbed policy through a white-box adversarial attack technique. Furthermore, a constrained adversarial actor-critic algorithm is presented to optimize an on-ramp merging policy while keeping the variations of the attacked driving policy and action-value function within bounds. Finally, the proposed robust highway on-ramp merging decision making method of autonomous vehicles is evaluated in three stochastic mixed traffic flows with different densities, and its effectiveness is demonstrated in comparison with the competitive baselines.

AB Standard-sized autonomous vehicles have rapidly improved thanks to the breakthroughs of deep learning. However, scaling autonomous driving to mini-vehicles poses several challenges due to their limited on-board storage and computing capabilities. Moreover, autonomous systems lack robustness when deployed in dynamic environments where the underlying distribution is different from the distribution learned during training. To address these challenges, we propose a closed-loop learning flow for autonomous driving mini-vehicles that includes the target deployment environment in-the-loop. We leverage a family of compact and high-throughput tinyCNNs to control the mini-vehicle that learn by imitating a computer vision algorithm, i.e., the expert, in the target environment. Thus, the tinyCNNs, having only access to an on-board fast-rate linear camera, gain robustness to lighting conditions and improve over time. Moreover, we introduce an online predictor that can choose between different tinyCNN models at runtime-trading accuracy and latency-which minimises the inference's energy consumption by up to 3.2x. Finally, we leverage GAP8, a parallel ultra-low-power RISC-V-based micro-controller unit (MCU), to meet the real-time inference requirements. When running the family of tinyCNNs, our solution running on GAP8 outperforms any other implementation on the STM32L4 and NXP k64f (traditional single-core MCUs), reducing the latency by over 13x and the energy consumption by 92%.

AB Objective: Auditory displays could be essential to helping drivers maintain situation awareness in autonomous vehicles, but to date, few or no studies have examined the effectiveness of different types of auditory displays for this application scenario.
   Background: Recent advances in the development of autonomous vehicles (i.e., self-driving cars) have suggested that widespread automation of driving may be tenable in the near future. Drivers may be required to monitor the status of automation programs and vehicle conditions as they engage in secondary leisure or work tasks (entertainment, communication, etc.) in autonomous vehicles.
   Method: An experiment compared memory for alerted eventsa component of Level 1 situation awarenessusing speech alerts, auditory icons, and a visual control condition during a video-simulated self-driving car ride with a visual secondary task. The alerts gave information about the vehicle's operating status and the driving scenario.
   Results: Speech alerts resulted in better memory for alerted events. Both auditory display types resulted in less perceived effort devoted toward the study tasks but also greater perceived annoyance with the alerts.
   Conclusion: Speech auditory displays promoted Level 1 situation awareness during a simulation of a ride in a self-driving vehicle under routine conditions, but annoyance remains a concern with auditory displays.
   Application: Speech auditory displays showed promise as a means of increasing Level 1 situation awareness of routine scenarios during an autonomous vehicle ride with an unrelated secondary task.

AB An increase in functionality of semi-autonomous vehicles (SAV) through the implementation of intelligent distributed control and smart sensing techniques is presented. In combination with a modular design approach, this facilitates system modification and improvement, combined with faster customisation of the platform. A distributed and reactive behavioural control architecture is used to realise local autonomous navigation capabilities; improved operator interaction; self protection and safer operation. A virtual engineering environment based on a computer-aided-graphics platform is used (1) for modelling the vehicle and the environment in which it can operate; (2) developing preemptive learning and training of responses/behaviours, and (3) for evaluation of vehicle functionality as part of an integrated materials handling system.

AB Platooning, the early stage of autonomous driving, has already proved the possibility through actual driving experiments. However, to successfully use the platoon in real world, various algorithms related to the formation, maintenance, and release of platooning need to be investigated. In this study, the various systemic elements are examined with the situation of forming a platoon.
   To investigate the behavior of vehicles with various systemic elements when they form a platoon, a mathematical model-based optimization technique is applied with four different objective functions. The numerical example and sensitivity tests are performed to verify the effects of systemic elements for the behavior of the autonomous vehicles during the platoon forming stage.
   The operation trends of the autonomous vehicles can be categorized as three cases - i) stable situation, ii) complex situation and iii) impossible situation when they form a platoon. In case of stable situation, a rule-based simple method can be applied while a sophisticated control algorithm is significantly required for complex situation.
   This study proves the necessity of the sophisticated control algorithm for controlling of each autonomous vehicle separately and carefully by each time unit to achieve the platooning velocity and space for forming a platoon. The result of this study can be applied directly to develop a sophisticated control algorithm for further research.

AB Autonomous vehicles are latency-sensitive systems. The planning phase is a critical component of such systems, during which the in-vehicle compute platform is responsible for determining the future maneuvers that the vehicle will follow. In this letter, we present a GPU-accelerated optimized implementation of the Frenet Path Planner, a widely known path planning algorithm. Unlike the current state of the art, our implementation accelerates the entire algorithm, including the path generation and collision avoidance phases. We measure the execution time of our implementation and demonstrate dramatic speedups compared to the CPU baseline implementation. Additionally, we evaluate the impact of different precision types (double, float, and half) on trajectory errors to investigate the tradeoff between completion latencies and computation precision.

AB Major challenges are presented when managing a large number of heterogeneous vehicles that have to communicate underwater in order to complete a global mission in a cooperative manner. In this kind of application domain, sending data through the environment presents issues that surpass the ones found in other overwater, distributed, cyber-physical systems (i.e., low bandwidth, unreliable transport medium, data representation and hardware high heterogeneity). This manuscript presents a Publish/Subscribe-based semantic middleware solution for unreliable scenarios and vehicle interoperability across cooperative and heterogeneous autonomous vehicles. The middleware relies on different iterations of the Data Distribution Service (DDS) software standard and their combined work between autonomous maritime vehicles and a control entity. It also uses several components with different functionalities deemed as mandatory for a semantic middleware architecture oriented to maritime operations (device and service registration, context awareness, access to the application layer) where other technologies are also interweaved with middleware (wireless communications, acoustic networks). Implementation details and test results, both in a laboratory and a deployment scenario, have been provided as a way to assess the quality of the system and its satisfactory performance.

AB Thanks to the recent evolution in science and technology, road transport is going to change radically. In the near future connected and automated vehicles will appear on the road in multiple transport modes to improve road safety. Higher vehicle automation levels rely on disruptive technologies that simply cannot be tested and approved in the currently used sustaining technologies format. As validation processes become more complicated they require a more specific and ever-changing test environment. While current autonomous vehicle test environments are developed around activities that mostly concentrate on an urban test area, every single element of the new Hungarian automotive proving ground is dedicated to the testing and validation of connected and automated vehicles (CAVs). This paper will discuss the design concept, illustrating the unique points that differentiate the new Hungarian test facility from that of a conventional vehicle test track as well as from other current autonomous vehicle testing areas.

AB Autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) are playing an ever-growing role in modern subocean operations, generating a demand for faster, more manoeuvrable designs capable of deployments of increasingly longer durations. In order to meet these demands, vehicle developers have been looking to biological aquatic animals for inspiration. After evolving for millions of years, fish and cetaceans have developed fast efficient locomotion techniques, with levels of manoeuvrability that far outperform conventional engineered marine locomotion systems. This paper aims to give a brief introduction into some of the biologically inspired propulsion mechanisms that have been developed, to explain their strengths, their weaknesses, and the motivation behind them, and then finally to predict future trends in bio-mimetic AUV propulsion design.

AB During the last few decades, the mining industry has increasingly turned to autonomous systems in its efforts to modernize and advance mining methods and techniques. Vehicle automation in such complex working environments can play a critical role in improving worker safety and mine productivity. Moreover, as the global demand for minerals continues to increase, such technologies will enable access to deeper and more difficult to mine orebodies. The research reported in this article seeks to demonstrate the feasibility of autonomous batch haulage vehicles in the underground coal mining production cycle. By introducing autonomous shuttle cars, the operator can be removed from dusty, noisy, and potentially dangerous conditions and be placed in a relatively safe location, while supervising the machine rather than operating it. This article presents an overview of the approach taken, a description of a lab-scale model and mock mine environment, and preliminary results for autonomous navigation of the prototype shuttle car.

ID ALGORITHM; VEHICLE
AB Perception, planning, and control are three enabling technologies to achieve autonomy in autonomous driving. In particular, planning provides vehicles with a safe and collision-free path towards their destinations, accounting for vehicle dynamics, maneuvering capabilities in the presence of obstacles, traffic rules, and road boundaries. Existing path planning algorithms can be divided into two stages: global planning and local planning. In the global planning stage, global routes and the vehicle states are determined from a digital map and the localization system. In the local planning stage, a local path can be achieved based on a global route and surrounding information obtained from sensors such as cameras and LiDARs. In this paper, we present a new local path planning method, which incorporates a vehicle's time-to-rollover model for off-road autonomous driving on different road profiles for a given predefined global route. The proposed local path planning algorithm uses a 3D occupancy grid and generates a series of 3D path candidates in the s-p coordinate system. The optimal path is then selected considering the total cost of safety, including obstacle avoidance, vehicle rollover prevention, and comfortability in terms of path smoothness and continuity with road unevenness. The simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed path planning method for various types of roads, indicating its wide practical applications to off-road autonomous driving.

AB Simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) is the crucial prerequisite for mobile robots to accomplish autonomy. In this paper, PSO-UFastSLAM based on the unscented-FastSLAM (UFastSLAM) and the particle swarm optimization (PSO) is proposed. The UFastSLAM combines unscented particle filter (UPF) and unscented Kalman filter (UKF) to estimate the robot poses and features. Furthermore, to prevent the particles degeneracy and impoverishment, PSO is adapted to optimize particles. The proposed method is applied on our own research platform, autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV), through sea trials in Tuandao Bay. The results of simulation and sea trial reveal that PSO-UFastSLAM has better accuracy and effectiveness in terms of estimation of robot and features while compared with UFastSLAM and standard FastSLAM.

AB Advances in autonomous vehicular technology facilitate the development of intelligent traffic regulation systems. Such a system aims to configure and regulate vehicular mobility patterns to enhance in-road transportation safety and efficiency. To effectively function, the autonomous system must enable high-rate communications and rapid dissemination of vehicle-to-vehicle messaging flows. Instead of applying classical mobility models to capture human driver behaviors, the use of autonomously controlled driverless vehicles brings up another design dimensionality: the regulation and shaping of vehicular flows. The induced joint impact of the vehicular flow process on the message communications networking system, on the vehicular throughput rate, and on on-ramp waiting times for highway systems, has not been addressed by the existing studies. In this paper, we investigate the integrated design of these aspects. We synthesize and study methods that are used to optimally group autonomously controlled vehicles to travel along a highway in platoons. Vehicular formations are structured to yield effective autonomous mobility operation and to realize high-performance multihop dissemination of multiclass messaging flows. We then investigate an on-ramp traffic flow control mechanism that serves to regulate the admission of vehicles into the highway. We characterize the tradeoffs available to the system's designer in attaining high message communication throughput rates, accounting for time delays experienced by onramp waiting vehicles, while also striving to enhance the highway's capacity for accommodating high vehicular flow rate levels.

AB In this paper, the autonomous control problem of a quadrotor UAV (unmanned aerial vehicle) in GPS-denied unknown environments is addressed. The quadrotor UAV is equipped with a minature laser range finder as the main onboard sensor. A new localization methodology based on the PLICP (iterative closest/corresponding point based on point to linemetric) algorithm is proposed to provide accurate position estimation of the vehicle. The autonomous hovering and trajectory tracking control are achieved via onboard sensor and processors. Real-time flight tests are implemented under different scenarios including indoor hovering and trajectory tracking between buildings. These experiments results show that safe autonomous fight control is achieved for the quadrotor when it is flying in an unknown environment where the GPS signals are very weak or absent.

AB An accurate fault detection and diagnosis system is of great importance for autonomous vehicles to prevent the potential hazardous situations. In this paper, we propose a fault detection and diagnosis system based on hybrid approaches. First, to detect the state faults of the autonomous vehicle, One-Class Support Vector Machine (SVM) method is adopted to train the boundary curve which separates the safe domain and unsafe domain. Meanwhile, a Kalman filter observer is designed based on the linear kinematic vehicle bicycle model to predict the current position of the vehicle, and after obtaining the residuals between prediction and measurement, Jarque-Bera test is applied to check the normality of the residuals probability distribution to monitor whether the trajectory deviates. Furthermore, we design a fuzzy system to distinguish the types of the detected faults based on a modified neutral network, in which a membership function layer is added after the input layer. With the strong self-learning ability of neutral network, the initial membership function of the fuzzy system is updated through black box test and can indicate the probability of each fault type. Experiments on the real autonomous vehicle platform 'Xinda' and performance comparison with other fault detectors validate the effectiveness of these methods and the usability of the fault detection and diagnosis system.

AB Considering its unique operational characteristics, the autonomous mobility-on-demand (AMoD) system is playing a more and more critical role in the future transportation system. In this article, we consider a joint planning problem of autonomous fleet (i.e., vehicle type and fleet size) and charging infrastructure (i.e., the size of charging piles with various charging rates, distributed renewable resources) while accounting for the spatial-temporal demand-side flexibility of the AMoD system. We adopt an augmented network flow model to capture the autonomous fleet's charging, order serving, and rebalancing decisions. The proposed planning problem is modeled as a two-stage stochastic program and solved by multicut Benders decomposition techniques. Simulation experiments based on real-world data are performed to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed planning scheme.

AB Planning appropriate driving trajectory for route following is an important function for autonomous driving. Behavioral cloning, which allows automatic trajectory learning and improvement, has been effectively used in driving trajectory planning. However, existing behavioral cloning methods always rely on large scales of time-consuming, laborious, and reliable labels. To address this problem, this paper proposes a new off-policy imitation learning method for autonomous driving using task knowledge distillation. This novel method clones human driving behavior and effectively transfers the driving strategies to domain shift scenarios. The experiment results indicate that our method can lead to satisfactory route-following performance in realistic urban driving scenes and can transfer the driving strategies to new unknown scenes under various illumination and weather scenarios for autonomous driving.

AB This paper addresses an emergency alert broadcast for autonomous vehicles in indoor environments. For a rapid alert broadcast, a novel cluster diversity is proposed. Using the cluster diversity, the alert broadcast can significantly reduce the number of rebroadcasts. This leads to the rapid delivery of emergency alerts. The cluster diversity consists of clustering and diversity combining. For the clustering, the cluster diversity technique utilizes the location information of autonomous vehicles. Using the location information, a cluster head is selected in each cluster. The cluster head rebroadcasts the emergency alert to the autonomous vehicles. Therefore, the clustering can lessen the number of rebroadcasts. In order to further reduce the number of rebroadcasts, a diversity combining technique is proposed in this paper. The diversity approach is based on the clustering. For the diversity, the emergency alert packet is repeated in the transmitted OFDM block. For each cluster, the emergency alert packet can orthogonally be allocated to the corresponding frequency sub-band in the OFDM block. In the received OFDM block, the autonomous vehicle utilizes the emergency alert packet with the maximum power in order to achieve a diversity. The experimental results exhibit that the proposed cluster diversity can considerably reduce the number of rebroadcasts in indoor environments. The results also show that the presented approach substantially outperforms the conventional technique in terms of the number of outage vehicles in the cases of rebroadcasts under indoor environments.

AB The way in which autonomous transport will be adopted is likely to determine the net social benefits delivered by the technology and the sustainability of the transport system. Autonomous vehicles (AVs) will change travel behavior due to reduction in the effort needed for humans to drive a vehicle, the need for them to find a parking space, and the costs related to vehicle operation. The AVs' benefits are likely to increase their adoption compared to conventional human-driven vehicles, possibly leading to more vehicle kilometers travelled (VKT) and consequently weakening their benefits in large cities particularly if they are used in competition with public transport (PT). This paper evaluates the interplay between AVs and PT, and how road network pricing can be used to influence behavioral changes when personal autonomous vehicles (PAVs) are highly available. An agent-based demand model framework is proposed to estimate the mode share of PAVs and PT based on their perceived travelling costs on a real transport network in Melbourne, Australia. The modelling results suggest that convenient and affordable PAVs could compete with traditional PT and reduce overall PT patronage by up to 10%. However, through considering road network pricing schemes, the role of PAVs could be shifted from competing with PT to a complementary first-and-last-mile service that increases PT share by almost 17%. The results also show that road pricing policies can be used as effective interventions to manage PAV operations by reducing empty vehicle trips by 20%.

AB An overwhelmed number of vehicles has wrecked the current system of transportation due to rapid growth in population. Smart cities are the novel innovation that is inevitable to curb the problems of traffic jams, unorganized traffic, environmental pollution, and slow response rate to emergency situations. The intelligent transportation system (ITS) is an integral part of smart cities allowing communications and interaction among vehicles. An autonomous vehicle is the key element of ITS and the mass implementation of this emerging technology is the solution to traffic problems linked to the current transportation system. Autonomous vehicles lead to the need for efficient and reliable external vehicular communications particularly through vehicular ad hoc networks (VANET). However, utilizing a suitable routing protocol to provide stable routing and efficient performance for vehicular communications in autonomous vehicles is a key factor. Routing protocols are particularly important for establishing vehicular to vehicular and vehicular to infrastructure (V2X) communication, which is incredibly challenging due to the movement of nodes. The quality of inter-vehicular communications is widely affected by numerous factors such as routing protocols, traffic environment, and traffic density. This article presents a detailed evaluation of three commonly used protocols, i.e., Ad-hoc On-demand Distance Vector Routing (AODV), Dynamic Source Routing (DSR), and Destination-Sequenced Distance-Vector Routing (DSDV) under three different traffic environments. To investigate the performance of these routing protocols under diverse environments, simulations are extended further by using the varying density of vehicles. This study aims at finding the best routing protocol for efficient and reliable packet dissemination among vehicles under different scenarios.

AB Vehicle mass is crucial to autonomous vehicles control. Affected by the nonlinearity of vehicle dynamics between vehicle states, it is still a tough issue to estimate vehicle mass precisely and stably. The transformer aided adaptive extended Kalman filter is proposed to further improve the accuracy and stability of estimation. Firstly, the transformer-based estimator is introduced to provide an accurate pre-estimation of vehicle mass, with the nonlinear dynamics among vehicle states being learned. Secondly, on the basis of comparing the real-time input and training data of neural network, the weight adjustment module is designed to present an adaptive law. Finally, the adaptive extended Kalman filter is proposed to meet the demand of accuracy and stability, where the pre-estimation of transformer-based estimator is integrated with the adaptive law. Dataset is collected by conducting heavy-duty vehicle simulation. The mean absolute percentage error, mean absolute error, root mean square error and convergence rate averaged over simulation tests are 0.90%, 256.47 kg, 357.01 kg and 184 steps, respectively. The results show the outperformance of the proposed method in terms of accuracy and stability.

ID IDENTIFICATION
AB Since the large-scale application of fully autonomous vehicles is difficult to be commercialized in the short term, human-vehicle shared control (HVSC) is a promising technique. To implement the control authority allocation and observe the driver characteristic, it is essential to develop an efficient HVSC dynamic model with the driver's neuromuscular characteristic (NMS). To further our previous research, a simplified HVSC dynamic model is proposed in this paper. This model simplifies the non-critical NMS parameters such as muscle spindle feedback, which has no significant feedback effect while retaining essential NMS characteristics such as stretch reflection and intrinsic properties. The model consists of a model predictive controller (MPC) coupled with a driver NMS model and a 2 DOF vehicle model. The stability is proved by Lyapunov stability theory. Moreover, a field experiment was conducted for validation of the model. The V-Box is utilized to measure the vehicle's state signals, such as steering wheel angle and pedal stroke. Subsequently, the adaptive genetic algorithm (AGA) is employed to identify the model parameters based on the experimental results. The comparison between the experiment and the model output shows that the proposed model can accurately represent the driver's NMS characteristics and vehicle dynamic parameters. This paper will serve as a theoretical basis for the control authority allocation for L3 class autonomous vehicles.

ID RATIO
AB A worldwide increase in the number of vehicles on the road has led to an increase in the frequency of serious traffic accidents, causing loss of life and property. Autonomous vehicles could be part of the solution, but their safe operation is dependent on the onboard LiDAR (light detection and ranging) systems used for the detection of the environment outside the vehicle. Unfortunately, problems with the application of LiDAR in autonomous vehicles remain, for example, the weakening of the echo detection capability in adverse weather conditions. The signal is also affected, even drowned out, by sensory noise outside the vehicles, and the problem can become so severe that the autonomous vehicle cannot move. Clearly, the accuracy of the stereo images sensed by the LiDAR must be improved. In this study, we developed a method to improve the acquisition of LiDAR data in adverse weather by using a combination of a Kalman filter and nearby point cloud denoising. The overall LiDAR framework was tested in experiments in a space 2 m in length and width and 0.6 m high. Normal weather and three kinds of adverse weather conditions (rain, thick smoke, and rain and thick smoke) were simulated. The results show that this system can be used to recover normal weather data from data measured by LiDAR even in adverse weather conditions. The results showed an effective improvement of 10% to 30% in the LiDAR stereo images. This method can be developed and widely applied in the future.

AB Advanced Driver Assistance Systems (ADAS) and Automated and Autonomous Vehicles (AV) are cooperative systems and processes that use: artificial intelligence, cognitive methods, cloud technolo-gies, cooperative vehicle-to-everything-communications (V2X), software-hardware platforms, sensor platforms and incipient intelligent transport infrastructures, to get self-driving systems and smart connected mobility services. This paper, to support automated driving systems (assisted, semi-autonomous and fully autonomous vehicles), introduces a cognitive layer called Associated Reality to enhance the involved information, knowledge and communication processes. The architecture defined includes an augmented Local Dynamic Map, with complementary layers, and an augmented Graph Database, with complementary semantic-cognitive relations, for the considered purpose, in cooperative human- machine and machine-machine systems. Virtual augmented landmarks are defined to improve the connectivity and intelligence of the involved spatial-information systems. Different structure landmarks and sequence landmarks (which includes regular, repetitive and periodic landmarks) are defined, categorized and used in diverse visual localization and mapping scenarios, for autonomous driving. In this paper, it is also shown, as a proof-of-concept for vehicle localization and mapping in road tunnels, the visual detection of different sequences of periodic luminaires, using YOLO v3 for the corresponding LED lights detection, or a specific alternative procedure developed with very low computational cost.

AB This paper presents a modified lateral control method for an autonomous vehicle with both look-ahead and look-down sensing systems. To cope with sensor noise and modeling uncertainty in the lateral control of the vehicle, a modified LMI-based H lateral controller was proposed, which uses the look-ahead information of the lateral offset error measured at the front of vehicle and the look-down information of the vehicle yaw angle error between the reference lane and the centerline of the vehicle. To verify the safety and the performance of the lateral control, a scaled-down vehicle was developed, and the positioning of the vehicle was estimated with USAT. The proposed controller, which uses both look-ahead and look-down information, was tested for lane changing and reference lane tracking with both simulation and experiment. The simulation and experimental results show that the proposed controller has better tracking and handling performance compared with a controller that uses only the look-ahead information of the target heading angle error.

AB Advances in information technologies and vehicle automation have birthed new transportation services, including shared autonomous vehicles (SAVs). Shared autonomous vehicles are on-demand self-driving taxis, with flexible routes and schedules, able to replace personal vehicles for many trips in the near future. The siting and density of pick-up and drop-off (PUDO) points for SAVs, much like bus stops, can be key in planning SAV fleet operations, since PUDOs impact SAV demand, route choices, passenger wait times, and network congestion. Unlike traditional human-driven taxis and ride-hailing vehicles like Lyft and Uber, SAVs are unlikely to engage in quasi-legal procedures, like double parking or fire hydrant pick-ups. In congested settings, like central business districts (CBD) or airport curbs, SAVs and others will not be allowed to pick up and drop off passengers wherever they like. This paper uses an agent-based simulation to model the impact of different PUDO locations and densities in the Austin, Texas CBD, where land values are highest and curb spaces are coveted. In this paper 18 scenarios were tested, varying PUDO density, fleet size and fare price. The results show that for a given fare price and fleet size, PUDO spacing (e.g., one block vs. three blocks) has significant impact on ridership, vehicle-miles travelled, vehicle occupancy, and revenue. A good fleet size to serve the region's 80 core square miles is 4000 SAVs, charging a $1 fare per mile of travel distance, and with PUDOs spaced three blocks of distance apart from each other in the CBD.

AB The positive buoyancy diving autonomous vehicle combines the features of an Unmanned Surface Vessel (USV) and an Autonomous Underwater Vehicle (AUV) for marine measurement and monitoring. It can also be used to study reasonable and efficient positive buoyancy diving techniques for underwater robots. In order to study the optimization of low power consumption and high efficiency cruise motion of the positive buoyancy diving vehicle, its dynamic modeling has been established. The optimal cruising speed for low energy consumption of the positive buoyancy diving vehicle is determined by numerical simulation. The Linear Quadratic Regulator (LQR) controller is designed to optimize the dynamic error and the actuator energy consumption of the vehicle in order to achieve the optimal fixed depth tracking control of the positive buoyancy diving vehicle. The results demonstrate that the LQR controller has better performance than PID, and the system adjustment time of the LQR controller is reduced by approximately 56% relative to PID. The motion optimization control method proposed can improve the endurance of the positive buoyancy diving vehicle, and has a certain application value.

AB This paper reports on an exact, real-time solution for server-client cooperative localization over a faulty and extremely bandwidth-limited underwater communication channel. Our algorithm, termed the origin state method, enables a 'server' vehicle to broadcast its navigation information to multiple 'client' vehicles over a bandwidth-limited and faulty communication channel. The server's broadcasted pose-graph can be used in conjunction with an estimator on the client to exactly reproduce the corresponding server-client centralized estimate. We present an evaluation over an extensive real-time field implementation of the proposed algorithm for a multi-agent autonomous underwater vehicle network using underwater acoustic modems to communicate in a synchronous-clock transmission framework.

AB Vehicle automation requires new onboard sensors, communication equipment, and/or data processing units, and may encourage modifications to existing onboard components (such as the steering wheel). These changes impact the vehicle's mass, auxiliary load, coefficient of drag, and frontal area, which then change vehicle performance. This paper uses the powertrain simulation model FASTSim to quantify the impact of autonomy-related design changes on a vehicle's fuel consumption. Levels 0, 2, and 5 autonomous vehicles are modeled for two battery-electric vehicles (2017 Chevrolet Bolt and 2017 Nissan Leaf) and a gasoline powered vehicle (2017 Toyota Corolla). Additionally, a level 5 vehicle is divided into pessimistic and optimistic scenarios which assume different electronic equipment integration format. The results show that 4-8% reductions in energy economy can be achieved in a L5 optimistic scenario and an 10-15% increase in energy economy will be the result in a L5 pessimistic scenario. When looking at impacts on different power demand sources, inertial power is the major power demand in urban driving conditions and aerodynamic power demand is the major demand in highway driving conditions.

AB This paper presents a motion planning, guidance, and control system for an autonomous surface vessel in a practical maritime environment. The motion planning algorithm is based on the angle-guidance fast-marching square method (AFMS), and the guidance system is based on the line-of-sight (LOS) trajectory tracking algorithm. To validate the motion planning algorithm, numerical simulations were carried out to compute the optimal path in a static environment including various obstacles. The guidance and control system were tested with an autonomous surface vehicle (ASV) tracking a preestablished trajectory including static obstacles. The autonomous surface vehicle is a self-propelled scaled ship model of 2.5 m equipped with sensors and actuators, inertial measurement unit (IMU), global positioning system (GPS), propulsion direct current (DC) motors, and wireless communication. From the experiments and numerical simulations, a good agreement was found.

AB Most existing studies on autonomous intersection management (AIM) primarily focus on modeling and resolving conflicts between vehicles within an intersection, assuming predetermined routes of the autonomous vehicles (AVs) as exogenous inputs. Additionally, these studies presume scenarios in which AVs traverse the intersection at a constant speed without stopping. However, such scenarios are difficult to realize under heavy traffic demand. To address this issue, this study first discretized the intersection into numerous grids and proposed formulations to calculate the time at which the vehicles enter and exit a given grid at different speeds and accelerations based on the outer-boundary-projection dimension-reduction method. Thereafter, a bi-level programming model was established to optimize the route choices and traffic control schemes. The upper-level model aimed to minimize the conflicts within the intersection zones, considering the lane options for vehicles entering and exiting the intersection as the decision variable to optimize the AV routes. In addition, the lower-level model strived to minimize the delay for all upcoming vehicles. The time when a vehicle enters an intersection and whether it stops are utilized as decision variables. Based on the sliding time-window technique, the proposed model was transformed into a mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) problem, which is compiled by a mathematical programming language (AMPL) and solved by CPLEX. The numerical analysis shows that the proposed models significantly reduced the conflicts between the vehicles, and consequently, improved the space utilization of the intersection, reduced vehicle delays, and saved a significant amount of energy.

DE drivable road region detection; autonomous vehicles; map-fusion image;
   FCNs
AB Environment perception is one of the major issues in autonomous driving systems. In particular, effective and robust drivable road region detection still remains a challenge to be addressed for autonomous vehicles in multi-lane roads, intersections and unstructured road environments. In this paper, a computer vision and neural networks-based drivable road region detection approach is proposed for fixed-route autonomous vehicles (e.g., shuttles, buses and other vehicles operating on fixed routes), using a vehicle-mounted camera, route map and real-time vehicle location. The key idea of the proposed approach is to fuse an image with its corresponding local route map to obtain the map-fusion image (MFI) where the information of the image and route map act as complementary to each other. The information of the image can be utilized in road regions with rich features, while local route map acts as critical heuristics that enable robust drivable road region detection in areas without clear lane marking or borders. A neural network model constructed upon the Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), namely FCN-VGG16, is utilized to extract the drivable road region from the fused MFI. The proposed approach is validated using real-world driving scenario videos captured by an industrial camera mounted on a testing vehicle. Experiments demonstrate that the proposed approach outperforms the conventional approach which uses non-fused images in terms of detection accuracy and robustness, and it achieves desirable robustness against undesirable illumination conditions and pavement appearance, as well as projection and map-fusion errors.

AB Emerging autonomous driving technologies are claimed to create new opportunities for realizing smart and sustainable urban mobility initiatives. In this perspective, some studies identified shared autonomous vehicles (SAVs) as being a crucial element of on-demand mobility services. There is, however, limited evidence from practice on what roles SAVs play in delivering smart urban mobility. In other words, SAV in the context of smart urban mobility is an understudied area of research with limited review studies. To bridge this gap in the literature, this study aims to investigate and map out the service attributes and impacts of SAVs on urban mobility, infrastructure and land use, travel behavior, and the environment. As the methodological approach, the paper adopts the systematic literature review technique. The study findings reveal that: (a) Providing dynamic ridesharing services could result in significant reduction of SAV fleet size, congestion, travel cost, parking demand, vehicle ownership, and emissions; (b) Positive environmental outcomes could be enhanced with full electrification of SAV fleet through renewable energy charging; (c) Integration of SAV, as a smart urban mobility system with dynamic ridesharing services, could promote sustainability and social and transportation equity, and their adoption. In the light of the findings, this study advocates the consolidation of urban/transport policy to achieve desired urban mobility outcomes.

AB The rapid development of autonomous vehicle technology has brought a new experience to people's daily travel. However, if a traffic accident involving autonomous vehicles occurs, it will face difficulties in vehicle accident forensic-preservation, leakage of vehicle owner's privacy, and identifying legal liabilities. This article proposes an accident responsibility identification model for the Internet of Vehicles based on lightweight blockchain to solve the above problems. This model uses Car Forensics Master to collect evidence from the accident vehicle, and at the same time collects evidence from maintenance service providers, automobile manufacturers, transportation management departments, insurance companies, and other vehicle accident related parties and stores them in the preservation chain. We also use VPKI to protect the autonomous vehicle identity privacy. In order to improve the efficiency of the model and set up authorized access to related entities, the identification of accident liability is jointly completed by the preservation chain and the accident identification chain. In addition, we prove that the protocol proposed in the model has ideal security properties. Finally, we implement the smart contracts in the model through the Solidity language, and evaluate its performance.

AB Recent developments in sensor technologies such as Global Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSS), Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU), Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR), radar, and camera have led to emerging state-of-the-art autonomous systems, such as driverless vehicles or UAS (Unmanned Airborne Systems) swarms. These technologies necessitate the use of accurate object space information about the physical environment around the platform. This information can be generally provided by the suitable selection of the sensors, including sensor types and capabilities, the number of sensors, and their spatial arrangement. Since all these sensor technologies have different error sources and characteristics, rigorous sensor modeling is needed to eliminate/mitigate errors to obtain an accurate, reliable, and robust integrated solution. Mobile mapping systems are very similar to autonomous vehicles in terms of being able to reconstruct the environment around the platforms. However, they differ a lot in operations and objectives. Mobile mapping vehicles use professional grade sensors, such as geodetic grade GNSS, tactical grade IMU, mobile LiDAR, and metric cameras, and the solution is created in post-processing. In contrast, autonomous vehicles use simple/inexpensive sensors, require real-time operations, and are primarily interested in identifying and tracking moving objects. In this study, the main objective was to assess the performance potential of autonomous vehicle sensor systems to obtain high-definition maps based on only using Velodyne sensor data for creating accurate point clouds. In other words, no other sensor data were considered in this investigation. The results have confirmed that cm-level accuracy can be achieved.

The POMDP model utilizes driving scenar-ios, condensed into graphs, as inputs. More specifically, an input graph contains information on the history trajectory of the subject vehicle, predicted trajectories of other agents in the scene (e.g., other vehicles, pedestrians, and cyclists), as well as predicted risk levels posed by surrounding vehicles to devise safe, comfortable, and energy-efficient trajectories for the subject vehicle to follow. In order to obtain sufficient driving scenarios to use as training data, we propose a simulation framework to generate socially acceptable driving scenarios using a real world autonomous vehicle dataset. The simulation framework utilizes Bayesian Gaussian mixture models to learn trajectory patterns of different agent types, and Gibbs sampling to ensure that the distribution of simulated scenarios matches that of the real-world dataset collected by an autonomous fleet. We evaluate the proposed work in two complex urban driving environments: a non-signalized T-junction and a non-signalized lane merge intersection. Both environments provide vastly more complex driving scenarios compared to a highway driving environment, which has been mostly the focus of previous studies. The framework demonstrates promising performance for planning horizons as long as five seconds. We compare safety, comfort, and energy efficiency of the planned trajectories against human-driven trajectories in both experimental driving environments, and demonstrate that it outperforms human-driven trajectories in a statistically significant fashion in all aspects.

AB Rough pavements cause ride discomfort and energy inefficiency for road vehicles. Existing methods to address these problems are time-consuming and not adaptive to changing driving conditions on rough pavements. With the development of sensor and communication technologies, crowdsourced road and dynamic traffic information become available for enhancing driving performance, particularly addressing the discomfort and inefficiency issues by controlling driving speeds. This study proposes a speed control framework on rough pavements, envisioning the operation of autonomous vehicles based on the crowdsourced data. We suggest the concept of 'maximum comfortable speed' for representing the vertical ride comfort of oncoming roads. A deep reinforcement learning (DRL) algorithm is designed to learn comfortable and energyefficient speed control strategies. The DRL-based speed control model is trained using realworld rough pavement data in Shanghai, China. The experimental results show that the vertical ride comfort, energy efficiency, and computation efficiency increase by 8.22%, 24.37%, and 94.38%, respectively, compared to an optimization-based speed control model. The results indicate that the proposed framework is effective for real-time speed controls of autonomous vehicles on rough pavements.

AB This paper addresses the lane changing problem of autonomous vehicles when there is no road infrastructure Support. The autonomous vehicle should drive from the current lane to the adjacent lane in the absence of a reference path to guide the vehicle to the new lane. We suggest an algorithm that incorporates a virtual road curvature with bicycle model for lane change guidance. As the name suggests, the virtual road curvature does not physically exist. It is a user assigned radius of a curved path which connects the current lane to the adjacent lane. Since the lateral sensor readings during lane changing maneuver are erroneous, the steering angle along with the virtual curvature is fed into a bicycle model to estimate the lateral position during the transition to the next lane. Details of the algorithm and the virtual road curvature determination are presented in the paper. In contrast to other lane changing methods, controller switching is not required and the same controller is for both lane keeping and lane changing. The algorithm is verified experimentally and the results are comparable with lane changing with physical transition lane.

AB Navigating, guiding, and controlling autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) are challenging and difficult tasks compared to the autonomous surface-level operations. Controlling the motion of such vehicles require the estimation of unknown hydrodynamic forces and moments and disturbances acting on these vehicles in the underwater environment. In this paper, a one-layer neural-network (NN) controller with preprocessed input signals is designed to control the vehicle track along a desired trajectory, which is specified in terms of desired position and attitude. In the absence of unknown disturbances and modeling errors, it is shown that the tracking error system is asymptotically stable. In the presence of any bounded ocean currents or wave disturbances, the uniformly ultimately boundedness of the tracking error and NN weight estimates are given. The NN does not require an initial offline training phase and weight initialization is straightforward. Simulation results are shown by using a scaled version of the Naval Post-Graduate School's AUV. Results indicate the superior performance of the NN controller over conventional controllers. Providing offline NN training may improve the transient performance.

AB Scenario vehicles are an important part of the dynamic environment utilized in autonomous-driving simulations. They are required to meet the demands of traffic-scenario diversity and form a larger coverage scale in the road network. However, the current motion planning of scenario vehicles either adheres to the classical microscopic traffic-flow model or follows a predefined path; thus, interacting with the vehicle under test in a dynamic bidirectional fashion is difficult. This study researches a motion-planning method for a broader category of unmanned vehicles and proposes a motion-planning method for scenario vehicles based on Pontryagin's minimal principle, used in optimal control theory and the closed-form solution of the minimum snap method. The study reclassifies actions received from the behavior layer according to the boundary conditions and final times and derives an analytical solution for each of them. The analytical solution is then experimentally verified. The proposed method not only accomplishes efficient motion planning but also exhibits variant driving styles, which provides a practical solution for the motion planning of scenario vehicles in simulations.

AB Ocean monitoring is an expensive and time consuming endeavor, but it can be made more efficient through the use of teams of autonomous robots. In this paper, we present a system for the autonomous identification and tracking of ocean fronts by coordinating the sampling efforts of a heterogeneous team of autonomous surface vehicles (ASVs) and autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs). The primary contributions of this study are (1) our algorithm for performing autonomous coordination using general autonomy principles: Sequential Allocation Monte Carlo Tree Search (SA-MCTS) which incorporates domain knowledge into the environmental estimation through both augmenting a standard Gaussian process with a nearest neighbors prior and planning in a drifting reference frame, (2) our decision support user interface to help human operators oversee the autonomous system, and (3) the demonstration of the system's operation in a 2-week long deployment in the Gulf of Mexico using a heterogeneous team of four Slocum gliders and two robotic ocean surface samplers. With these contributions, we aim to bridge the gap between state of the art autonomy algorithms and marine vehicle planning methods that have been tested in large-scale field trials. This paper presents the first deployment of a general, heuristic-based, multi-robot coordination algorithm for an extended sampling mission.

AB Integration of advanced signal processing, image processing, deep learning, edge computing, and the Internet of Things (IoT) into vehicles allows intelligent automated vehicles to navigate autonomously in different environments. It is crucial for reliable and safe driving that an autonomous vehicle can accurately, effectively, and efficiently recognize, perceive, and observe the surrounding environments. Autonomous vehicles comprise advanced sensor technologies such as RGB cameras and LiDaR that produce an extensive data set in the form of RGB images and 3D measurement points, also recognized as a point cloud. It is necessary to understand and interpret collected data information efficiently and to identify other road users, such as pedestrians and vehicles. Thus, we introduced a smart IoT-enabled deep learning based end-to-end 3D object detection system that works in real-time, emphasizing autonomous driving situations. The detection model is based on YOLOv3; firstly, the model is utilized for 2D object detection and then modified for 3D object detection purposes. The presented model uses point cloud, and RGB image data as input and outputs detected bounding boxes with confidence scores and class labels. Experiments are carried out on the Lyft data set; results reveal that the YOLOv3 model achieves high accuracy and outperforms from other state-of-the-art detection models in terms of effectiveness and accuracy. The overall accuracy of the model is 96% and 97% for 2D and 3D object detection, respectively.

AB Autonomous underwater vehicles operating near the sea surface are subject to wave disturbances in their motion, which can affect severely the data acquisition during the vehicle motion. Bathymetric maps, for example, may suffer a big loss in quality due to such kind of disturbances that can impose oscillations in the vehicle depth and attitude. This article describes a controller structure for compensating the wave disturbances in the vertical plane for a torpedo-like autonomous underwater vehicle, based on a modified version of the linear quadratic Gaussian with loop transfer recovery control combined with a wave filter. The proposed methodology uses additional to the classic linear quadratic Gaussian with loop transfer recovery design the measurement of non-controlled states, such as the pitch rate and heave velocity, in the control action. The wave disturbances were filtered away by a shaping filter fitted to the sea spectrum, and the sensor signals were integrated by an extended Kalman filter. The proposed control methodology was tested against the classical linear quadratic Gaussian with loop transfer recovery controller in a 6-degree-of-freedom non-linear autonomous underwater vehicle simulator, producing a better performance in most demanding conditions such high wave crests. The tests also revealed the impact of the hydroplane geometry on the controller performance, which should not be underestimated by the autopilot designer.

ID CHALLENGE; ENTRY
AB A tactical-level lane-driving and decision-making model that considers multisource information in a complex and dynamic urban environment is critical for the development of autonomous vehicles. A key challenge in operating an autonomous vehicle robustly in the real world is to deal with dynamic and uncertain information. In the real world, drivers are capable of making accurate and timely decisions that should also be required of autonomous vehicles. In this work, the authors describe the development of an algorithm for autonomous lane change functions in which information was extracted from the decision-making process of human drivers to support the decision making of autonomous vehicles. First, a virtual urban traffic environment was built with PreScan, which is a simulation environment for the development of advanced driver assistant systems and intelligent vehicle systems. The vehicle dynamics were simulated by a dynamic model, with 6 degrees of freedom, based on Simulink, and driver decision rules were extracted through the concept of rough set theory. After that, an algorithm was presented for lane-driving decision making at the tactical level when velocity control operation was desirable and feasible. The development of the algorithm was based on driver experience, safety thresholds, and acceptable gap theory. The algorithm was proved to provide satisfactory velocity control actions as well as to safely decide whether to change lanes in a real urban environment. Finally, the reliability and effectiveness of the model was validated by both simulations and real road experiments.

ID AUTONOMOUS EMERGENCY BRAKING
AB Objective: Advanced driver assistance systems (ADAS) are a class of vehicle technologies designed to increase safety by providing drivers with timely warnings and autonomously intervening to avoid hazardous situations. Though laboratory testing suggests that ADAS technologies will greatly impact crash involvement rates, real-world evidence that characterizes their effectiveness is still limited. This study evaluates and quantifies the association of ADAS technologies with the likelihood of a moderate or severe crash for new-model BMWs in the United States.
   Methods: Vehicle ADAS option information for the cohort of model year 2014 and later BMW passenger vehicles sold after January 1, 2014 (n = 1,063,503), was coded using VIN-identified options data. ADAS technologies of interest include frontal collision warning with autonomous emergency braking, lane departure warning, and blind spot detection. BMW Automated Crash Notification system data (from January 2014 to November 2017) were merged with vehicle data by VIN to identify crashed vehicles (n = 15,507), including date, crash severity (delta V), and area of impact. Using Cox proportional hazards regression modeling, the study calculates the adjusted hazard ratio for crashing among BMW passenger vehicles with versus without ADAS technologies. The adjusted percentage reduction in moderate and severe crashes associated with ADAS is interpreted as one minus the hazard ratio.
   Results: Vehicles equipped with both autonomous emergency braking and lane departure warning were 23% less likely to crash than those not equipped (hazard ratio [HR] = 0.77; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.73-0.81), controlling for model year, vehicle size and body type. Autonomous emergency braking and lane departure warning generally occur together, making it difficult to tease apart their individual effects. Blind spot detection was associated with a 14% reduction in crashes after controlling for the presence of autonomous emergency braking and lane departure warning (HR = 0.86; 95% CI, 0.744-0.99). Differences were observed by vehicle type and crash type. The combined effect of autonomous emergency braking and lane departure warning was greater in newer model vehicles: Equipped vehicles were 13% less likely to crash (HR = 0.87; 95% CI, 0.79-0.95) among 2014 model year vehicles versus 34% less likely to crash (HR = 0.66; 95% CI, 0.57-0.77) among 2017 model year vehicles.
   Conclusion: This robust cohort study contributes to the growing evidence on the effectiveness of ADAS technologies.

ID MECHANICS
AB The lack of autonomous take-off and landing capabilities of bird-like flapping-wing aerial vehicles (BFAVs) seriously restricts their further development and application. Thus, combined with the current research results on the autonomous take-off and landing technology of unmanned aerial vehicles, four types of technologies are studied, including jumping take-off and landing technology, taxiing take-off and landing technology, gliding take-off and landing technology, and vertical take-off and landing (VTOL) technology. Based on the analytic hierarchy process (AHP)-comprehensive evaluation method, a fuzzy comprehensive evaluation model for the autonomous take-off and landing scheme of a BFAV is established, and four schemes are evaluated concretely. The results show that under the existing technical conditions, the hybrid layout VTOL scheme is the best. Furthermore, the detailed design and development of the prototype of a BFAV with a four-rotor hybrid layout are carried out, and the vehicle performance is tested. The results prove that through the four-rotor hybrid layout design, the BFAV has good autonomous take-off and landing abilities. The power consumption analysis shows that for a fixed-point reconnaissance mission, when the mission radius is less than 3.38 km, the VTOL type exhibits longer mission duration than the hand-launched type.

AB Existing studies on autonomous driving methods focus on the fusion of onboard sensor data. However, the driving behavior might be unsteady because of the uncertainties of environments. In this article, an expectation line is proposed to quantify the driving behavior motivated by the driving continuity of human drivers. Furthermore, the smooth driving could be achieved by predicting the future trajectory of the expectation line. First, a convolutional neural network-based method is applied to detect lanes in images sampled from driving video. Second, the expectation line is defined to model driving behavior of an autonomous vehicle. Finally, the long short-term memory-based method is applied to the expectation line so that the future trajectory of the vehicle could be predicted. By incorporating convolutional neural network- and long short-term memory-based methods, the autonomous vehicles could smoothly drive because of the prior information. The proposed method is evaluated using driving video data, and the experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms methods without trajectory predictions.

AB This paper presents a vehicle speed planning system called the energy-optimal deceleration planning system (EDPS), which aims to maximize energy recuperation of regenerative braking of connected and autonomous electrified vehicles. A recuperation energy-optimal speed profile is computed based on the impending deceleration requirements for turning or stopping at an intersection. This is computed to maximize the regenerative braking energy while satisfying the physical limits of an electrified powertrain. To obtain smooth optimal deceleration speed profiles, optimal deceleration commands are determined by a parameterized polynomial-based deceleration model that is obtained by regression analyses with real vehicle driving test data. The design parameters are dependent on preview information such as residual time and distance as well as target speed. The key design parameter is deceleration time, which determines the deceleration speed profile to satisfy the residual time and distance constraints as well as the target speed requirement. The time-varying bounds of deceleration commands corresponding to the physical limits of the powertrain are deduced from realistic deceleration test driving. For validation and comparisons of the EDPS with different preview distances, driving simulation tests with a virtual road environment and vehicle-to-infrastructure connectivity are presented. It is shown that the longer preview distance in the EDPS, the more energy-recuperation. In comparison with driver-in-the-loop simulation tests, EDPS-based autonomous driving shows improvements in energy recuperation and reduction in trip time.

AB With the aims of safe, smart and sustainable future mobility, a personalized approach of trajectory planning and control based on user preferences is developed for lane-change of autonomous vehicles in this paper. First, a safe area during the lane change process is identified by using constraint Delaunay triangulation. Then, an improved rapidly-exploring Random Trees (i-RRT) is developed with B-spline to generate the feasible trajectory cluster, which is subject to the safe area boundaries and the vehicle dynamics. To extract a personalized trajectory from this cluster, we firstly adopt the fuzzy linguistic preference relation (FLPR) method to identify users' preferences on driving, which can be reflected by their subjective objectives including driving safety, ride comfort and vehicle stability. Then, the technique for order preference by similarity to ideal situation (TOPSIS) is utilized to solve the multi-objective optimisation problem formulated by considering the user preferences. The algorithms proposed above are integrated, and both simulation and experimental validation are conducted under lane-change scenarios of autonomous driving. Simulation and experiment results show that proposed approach is able to successfully realize personalized trajectory planning and lane-change control, satisfying users' various preferences and simultaneously ensure vehicle safety, demonstrating its feasibility and effectiveness.

AB A model that includes the mechanical response of a vehicle to a demanded change in acceleration is analyzed to determine the string stability of a platoon of autonomous vehicles. The response is characterized by a first-order time constant tau and an explicit delay t(d). The minimum value of the acceleration feedback control gain is found from calculations of the velocity of vehicles following a lead vehicle that decelerates sharply from high speed to low speed. Larger values of xi (in the stable range) give larger values of deceleration for vehicles in the platoon. Optimal operation is attained close to the minimum value of xi for stability. Small oscillations are found after the main peak in deceleration for xi in the stable region but near the transition to instability. A theory for predicting the frequency and amplitude of the oscillations is presented. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB To enhance the safety and stability of autonomous vehicles, we present a deep learning platooning-based video information-sharing Internet of Things framework in this study. The proposed Internet of Things framework incorporates concepts and mechanisms from several domains of computer science, such as computer vision, artificial intelligence, sensor technology, and communication technology. The information captured by camera, such as road edges, traffic lights, and zebra lines, is highlighted using computer vision. The semantics of highlighted information is recognized by artificial intelligence. Sensors provide information on the direction and distance of obstacles, as well as their speed and moving direction. The communication technology is applied to share the information among the vehicles. Since vehicles have high probability to encounter accidents in congested locations, the proposed system enables vehicles to perform self-positioning with other vehicles in a certain range to reinforce their safety and stability. The empirical evaluation shows the viability and efficacy of the proposed system in such situations. Moreover, the collision time is decreased considerably compared with that when using traditional systems.

AB An autonomous vehicle or a self-guided vehicle (SGV) is a vehicle (robot) that performs the desired tasks in an unstructured environment without continuous human guidance. Almost all applications of an SGV require a vehicle that is capable of moving accurately and repeatedly to a particular location within its environment while executing a specific task. The accuracy and robustness in performing a specific task are therefore very important for the SGV to achieve a high level of performance. This paper introduces a new spherical velocity motion model and a new spherical odometry-inertia motion model for 3-D local landmark-based autonomous navigation. These new models are high accuracy and low-cost models. As modeling the contents of the immediate environment is fundamental, estimation of the position of the vehicle with respect to the external world is fundamental as well. Hence, using the most powerful tools of estimation theory, i.e., the extended Kalman filter (EKF) and the unscented Kalman filter (UKF), which give the best estimations in noisy environments, will prove the accuracy and robustness of these 3-D models.

AB Connected and autonomous vehicles (CAVs) are poised to revolutionize the conventional transportation industry. In this article, we first introduce the vision of vehicle computing in the autonomous driving era and highlight that CAVs are the perfect computation platforms, so connected devices/things with limited computation capacities may rely on surrounding CAVs to perform complex computational tasks. Next, we depict several reasons why vehicle computing is essential and emerging, followed by four case studies, including in-vehicle delivery, in-vehicle meeting, in-vehicle entertainment, and in-vehicle augmented reality, to further illustrate vehicle computing. Finally, we conclude this article by listing several technical challenges related to vehicular communication, open APIs, computation hardware, energy consumption, computation offloading, as well as security and privacy.

ID MANAGEMENT
AB Current autonomous intersection control strategies are facing issues, such as lack of foresight, frequent occurrence of deadlock, and low control system efficiency. To address these issues, a vehicle-road cooperative autonomous intersection control strategy based on reducing vehicle conflict relationships is proposed in this study. First, a conflict relationship graph that can describe the driving conflict relationship between vehicles is constructed. Second, the complement of the maximum clique in the conflict relationship graph is solved to determine the set of accepted vehicle reservation requests, enabling more vehicle reservation requests to be successfully processed in unit time while ensuring safe driving at the intersection and improving intersection throughput efficiency. Third, based on the maximum clique method, a taboo search method is used to search the neighborhood, thus improving the quality of the final solution with a smaller search cost. Simulation results show that compared to other control strategies, such as the FCFS (First Come First Served) strategy, the traffic signal control strategy (Traffic-Light), and the control strategy based on greedy algorithm search (Batch-Light), the proposed strategy can considerably reduce the average vehicle waiting time by 42%, 19%, and 10%, respectively, as well as increasing the number of vehicles passing through the intersection per unit of time by 35%, 20%, and 12%, respectively. These results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed strategy in improving the throughput of the intersection and reducing the average vehicle waiting time.

AB It is anticipated that passengers in autonomous vehicles will be more occupied with in-vehicle activities. Loss of the authority on driving and engaging in non-driving tasks could cause lower predictability of car motions. This decrease in predictability is expected to increase the sensitivity to carsickness. It appears that it is crucial to develop controllers for autonomous driving with the capability of improving passenger comfort by reducing carsickness. In this regard, it can be asked how the motion variables can be used for the minimization of a carsickness-related measure, while the vehicle is required to follow a given path. In this study, an optimal control approach is being proposed to minimize a quantitative measure of carsickness. In order to address carsickness during autonomous maneuvers, the well-known motion sickness dose value formulation in ISO 2631-1 is augmented with horizontal direction motion components to define a performance measure. The performance measure includes the motion sensed in vestibular system rather than the motion occurring in the vehicle itself. Therefore, mathematical model of the vestibular system is included in the design of controller. Effects of acceleration and jerk are included in performance measure simultaneously. Control oriented linear parameter varying vehicle model is developed to design the path following controller. By means of simulation studies in which path following control is implemented, motion sickness dose values of the controlled vehicle are examined. It is shown by a regular lane change test at various speeds that the proposed controller, which seeks the minimization of the motion sickness dose value, achieves a reduction of the acceleration and jerk felt by a passenger, while the vehicle follows the given path.

AB Convoying or platooning with a fleet of autonomous vehicles, which is denoted as autonomous convoying in this paper, has attracted increasing attention from the research communities, governments, and private sectors in recent years. Autonomous convoying offers immense opportunities due to its potential in enhancing logistical efficiency as well as reducing road incidents/accidents by eliminating human errors due to stress and fatigue. While humans can make complex decisions, involving humans in decision-making processes often causes delays as compared with those of automated machines. Indeed, human errors cause approximately 90% of road accidents and fatalities. Efficient platooning techniques can also reduce fuel consumption and carbon footprints. This paper presents a concise survey on current research and development initiatives in autonomous convoying while critically discussing the underlying techniques and technologies developed in this domain. Implications of autonomous convoying toward different industries are also analyzed and discussed.

AB This study proposes a new integrated approach to the motion control of autonomous vehicles, which differs from the conventional method of treating planning and tracking tasks as separate or hierarchical components. By means of the proposed approach we can reduce the side effects on the performance of autonomous vehicles under challenging driving circumstances. To this end, our approach processes both of the aforementioned tasks asynchronously and simultaneously utilizes a multi-threaded architecture to enhance control performance. Meanwhile, the behavior planning feature is integrated into the path-tracking module. Then, a linear parameter-varying model predictive control is deployed for trajectory tracking of autonomous vehicles and compared with the linear model predictive control method. Finally, the control performance of the proposed approach was evaluated through simulation trials on urban roads with placed obstacles. The outcomes revealed that the suggested framework satisfies the processing rate and high-precision criteria, while safely avoiding obstacles, indicating that it is a promising control strategy for real-world applications.

The power slide driving technique was employed as a maneuver to overcome sharp corners at high speed. To develop a proper control strategy for autonomous race cars, the experimental scale car trajectories when driven by a human driver were analyzed. The side slip angle and the turn rate during sharp cornering were used as reference values for the developed autonomous control method that has a hierarchical architecture. The slip-based control method was employed as a high-level controller to stabilize the vehicle state when turning sharp corners. The performance of the developed control strategy was experimentally verified using a real-time environmental 1:43-scale car.

TI Lane scheduling around crossroads for edge computing based autonomous

AB Autonomous driving, which can free our hands and feet, is of increasing importance in our daily lives. However, the capacity of onboard computation and communication limits the rapid development of autonomous driving. To address this issue, this paper proposes a novel model named the edge computing-based lanes scheduling system (ECLSS) to study lane scheduling for each vehicle around crossroads with real-time edge devices. There are several edge computing devices (ECD) deployed around crossroads in ECLSS that can collect information from vehicles and road conditions with short-range wired/wireless transmissions. Based on the strong computing power of ECDs and their real-time transmission performance, we propose two centralized management lane scheduling methods: the searching for efficient switching algorithm (SESA) and special vehicles lane switching algorithm (SVLSA). These edge computing-based autonomous driving methods aim to achieve high speed passing through crossroads and guarantee that special vehicles can pass through crossroads within a certain time. Extensive simulations are conducted, and the simulation results demonstrate the superiority of the proposed approaches over competing schemes in typical lane switching scenarios.

AB To prevent traffic accidents, even autonomous vehicles, as well as connected cars, need to know the driving situation of other vehicles in the vicinity. In particular, in emergency situations, messages' transmission among vehicles can face many problems such as the broadcast storm, message flooding, or message contention. Therefore, this paper proposes a topological sequence recognition mechanism that calculates the driving direction of vehicles, the geographical location and relative position associated with the driving direction, and the relative safety distance for each vehicle in connected subgroups of connected cars using the Connected Mobile Virtual Fence (CMVF) system. Thus, the proposed mechanism can alleviate issues with message dissemination as a vehicle will know the driving situations of other nearby vehicles. In addition, the proposed mechanism is found to be very effective, particularly in preventing secondary accidents due to traffic accidents in front of the vehicle so that emergency messages can be disseminated to the trailing vehicles. Finally, it is expected that the proposed mechanism will be reflected in the technology of connected cars and autonomous vehicles.

AB Micro aerial vehicles, such as multirotors, are particularly well suited for the autonomous monitoring, inspection, and surveillance of buildings, e.g., for maintenance or disaster management. Key prerequisites for the fully autonomous operation of micro aerial vehicles are real-time obstacle detection and planning of collision-free trajectories. In this article, we propose a complete system with a multimodal sensor setup for omnidirectional obstacle perception consisting of a three-dimensional (3D) laser scanner, two stereo camera pairs, and ultrasonic distance sensors. Detected obstacles are aggregated in egocentric local multiresolution grid maps. Local maps are efficiently merged in order to simultaneously build global maps of the environment and localize in these. For autonomous navigation, we generate trajectories in a multilayered approach: from mission planning over global and local trajectory planning to reactive obstacle avoidance. We evaluate our approach and the involved components in simulation and with the real autonomous micro aerial vehicle. Finally, we present the results of a complete mission for autonomously mapping a building and its surroundings. (C) 2015 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

AB Behaviour prediction function of an autonomous vehicle predicts the future states of the nearby vehicles based on the current and past observations of the surrounding environment. This helps enhance their awareness of the imminent hazards. However, conventional behavior prediction solutions are applicable in simple driving scenarios that require short prediction horizons. Most recently, deep learning-based approaches have become popular due to their promising performance in more complex environments compared to the conventional approaches. Motivated by this increased popularity, we provide a comprehensive review of the state-of-the-art of deep learning-based approaches for vehicle behavior prediction in this article. We firstly give an overview of the generic problem of vehicle behavior prediction and discuss its challenges, followed by classification and review of the most recent deep learning-based solutions based on three criteria: input representation, output type, and prediction method. The article also discusses the performance of several well-known solutions, identifies the research gaps in the literature and outlines potential new research directions.

ID CAPACITY
AB The number of Autonomous Vehicles (AVs) coexisting with conventional human-driven vehicles is expected to increase significantly in the coming years. This coexistence will last decades before full AV adoption is achieved worldwide. However, the cautious nature of AVs and the aggressive behavior of some human drivers could create unprecedentedly challenging scenarios for AVs, such as being stuck on merge lanes and blocked by human-driven vehicles. On the other hand, the cooperative behavior of other human drivers could assist AVs in avoiding deadlock situations. In this paper, we propose to leverage AVs to tally the cooperative driving behavior of human-driven vehicles. To this end, we model cooperative driving behavior in a "highway merge" scenario, which tends to be challenging for AVs. We vary the percentage of cooperative human-driven vehicles and estimate the percentage of AVs required to tally cooperative acts. Results show that when fifty percent of the human drivers cooperate, cooperation leads to statistically significant reductions of up to 68%, 46%, 38%, and 5% in stop delay, number of stops, vehicle delay, and travel time, respectively. Finally, we demonstrate that a 30% penetration of AVs is sufficient to tally up to 78% of cooperative behavior in highway scenarios. To promote cooperation across the population, our future work revolves around the construction of vehicular profiles based on their cooperative behavior. These profiles will be regularly updated and disseminated among AVs to aid their cooperative decisions toward human-driven vehicles in the upcoming interactions.

AB Connected and autonomous vehicles are expected to revolutionize transportation systems in the near future. Nevertheless, full autonomy still requires further development that will only be achieved through a high level of cooperation and coordination among vehicles. For the safe execution of several autonomous functions, vehicles will need to frequently communicate their current location to the Road Side Units (RSUs). However, due to information aging, it is expected that the delays from the time a message is generated until the location of the vehicle is updated will induce a tracking error. Thus, there is a tradeoff between the frequency of location updates and tracking error. Further, in order to reduce the queue-induced delays present in the system, the number of messages can be reduced by employing an event-triggered communication scheme. In this work, a family of optimization problems is proposed, utilizing the event-triggered algorithm, in order to determine the optimal triggering threshold. Both single and multiple RSU cases are considered in several simulation scenarios, demonstrating that the proposed optimization framework derives the optimal tracking accuracy. In the case of multiple RSUs, results are further optimized by assigning roads (and in turn vehicles) to RSUs if coverage areas of multiple RSUs overlap.

AB A positioning method using a simple laser sensor was developed and employed for navigation to a target. The laser sensor scans existing reflectors and measures their directions and positions using a triangulation method. After calibration, the accuracy of distance measurement was around 10 cm. A control system that steers an autonomous vehicle following a human-operated tractor was also developed. Experiments regarding the application of the laser sensor confirmed-that an experimental autonomous tractor could follow a leading human-operated tractor without collision:, However, the autonomous tractor tended to take shortcuts due to feedback.
   Automatic fertilizer refilling experiments were conducted using an autonomous vehicle equipped with a broadcast fertilizer distributor. The laser positioning method was used to locate the fertilizer supplier. Results of the field experiment showed that the trajectory control algorithm proposed in Part 1 could guide the vehicle with satisfactory accuracy for refilling. The main factor contributing to navigation error was the limit of the steering angle of the front wheels.

AB A new model-based predictive control algorithm for vehicle trajectory control is proposed by using vehicle velocity and sideslip angle. Based on the error function combined with vehicle velocity and side slip of a bicycle model, a predictive control method has been proven to be useful on low velocity. Thus, it could be applied for an autonomous vehicle without a driver. Although an autonomous robot is not necessary to be driven with a high velocity, a commercial vehicle has to be driven at high velocity. Thus the previous predictive control formulation is not enough for a commercial driving system. This study is proposed to enhance the capacity of the predictive controller for rather high speed vehicles.

AB Automated and autonomous vehicles are in an intensive development phase. It is a phase that requires a lot of modelling and experimental research. Experimental research into these vehicles is in its initial state. There is a lack of findings and standardized recommendations for the organization and creation of research scenarios. There are also many difficulties in creating research scenarios. The main difficulties are the large number of systems for simultaneous checking. Additionally, the vehicles have a very complicated structure. A review of current publications allowed for systematization of the research scenarios of vehicles and their components as well as the measurement systems used. These include perception systems, automated response to threats, and critical situations in the area of road safety. The scenarios analyzed ensure that the planned research tasks can be carried out, including the investigation of systems that enable autonomous driving. This study uses passenger cars equipped with highly sophisticated sensor systems and localization devices. Perception systems are the necessary equipment during the conducted study. They provide recognition of the environment, mainly through vision sensors (cameras) and lidars. The research tasks include autonomous driving along a detected road lane on a curvilinear track. The effective maintenance of the vehicle in this lane is assessed. The location used in the study is a set of specialized research tracks on which stationary or moving obstacles are often placed.

AB Submarine inspections and surveys require underwater vehicles to operate in deep waters efficiently, safely and reliably. Autonomous Underwater Vehicles employing advanced navigation and control systems present several advantages. Robust control algorithms and novel improvements in positioning and navigation are needed to optimize underwater operations. This paper proposes a new general formulation of this problem together with a basic approach for the management of deep underwater operations. This approach considers the field of view and the operational requirements as a fundamental input in the development of the trajectory in the autonomous guidance system. The constraints and involved variables are also defined, providing more accurate modelling compared with traditional formulations of the positioning system. Different case studies are presented based on commercial underwater cameras/sonars, analysing the influence of the main variables in the measurement process to obtain optimal resolution results. The application of this approach in autonomous underwater operations ensures suitable data acquisition processes according to the payload installed onboard.

The distance-view transformation is newly proposed to overcome the low density of top-view data of lidar. In addition, a dilated convolution structure is proposed to expand the receptive field of a convolutional neural network. The proposed network improves the accuracy of segmentation.

AB Given that the rapidly exploring random tree algorithm (RRT) and its variants cannot efficiently solve problems of path planning of autonomous vehicles, this paper proposes a new, adaptive improved RRT algorithm. Firstly, an adaptive directional sampling strategy is introduced to avoid excessive search by reducing the randomness of sampling points. Secondly, a reasonable node selection strategy is used to improve the smoothness of the path by utilizing a comprehensive criterion that combines angle and distance. Thirdly, an adaptive node expansion strategy is utilized to avoid invalid expansion and make the generated path more reasonable. Finally, the expanded ellipse is used to realize vehicle obstacle avoidance in advance, and the post-processing strategy removes redundant line segments of the initial path to improve its quality. The simulation results show that the quality of the planned path is significantly improved. This path followed successfully has good trajectory stability, which shows the proposed algorithm's effectiveness and practicability in autonomous vehicles' local path planning.

TI Cost-based analysis of autonomous mobility services
SO TRANSPORT POLICY
LA English
DT Article
AB Fast advances in autonomous driving technology trigger the question of suitable operational models for future autonomous vehicles. A key determinant of such operational models' viability is the competitiveness of their cost structures. Using a comprehensive analysis of the respective cost structures, this research shows that public transportation (in its current form) will only remain economically competitive where demand can be bundled to larger units. In particular, this applies to dense urban areas, where public transportation can be offered at lower prices than autonomous taxis (even if pooled) and private cars. Wherever substantial bundling is not possible, shared and pooled vehicles serve travel demand more efficiently. Yet, in contrast to current wisdom, shared fleets may not be the most efficient alternative. Higher costs and more effort for vehicle cleaning could change the equation. Moreover, the results suggest that a substantial share of vehicles may remain in private possession and use due to their low variable costs. Even more than today, high fixed costs of private vehicles will continue to be accepted, given the various benefits of a private mobility robot.

AB This paper advocates the need for infrastructure planning to adapt to and further promote the deployment of autonomous vehicle (AV) technology. It is envisioned that in the future government agencies will dedicate certain areas of road networks to AVs only to facilitate the formulation of vehicle platoons to improve throughput and hopefully improve the performance of the whole network. This paper aims to present a mathematical framework for the optimal design of AV zones in a general network. With the presence of AV zones, AVs may apply different routing principles outside of and within the AV zones. A novel network equilibrium model (we refer to it as the "mixed routing equilibrium model") is thus firstly proposed to capture such mixed-routing behaviors. We then proceed to formulate a mixed-integer bi-level programming model to optimize the deployment plan of AV zones. Numerical examples are presented to demonstrate the performance of the proposed models. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Widespread development of driverless vehicles has led to the formation of autonomous racing, where technological development is accelerated by the high speeds and competitive environment of motorsport. A particular challenge for an autonomous vehicle is that of identifying a target trajectory - or, in the case of a competition vehicle, the racing line. Many existing approaches to finding the racing line are either not time-optimal solutions, or are computationally expensive - rendering them unsuitable for real-time application using on-board processing hardware. This study describes a machine learning approach to generating an accurate prediction of the racing line in real-time on desktop processing hardware. The proposed algorithm is a feed-forward neural network, trained using a dataset comprising racing lines for a large number of circuits calculated via traditional optimal control lap time simulation. The network predicts the racing line with a mean absolute error of +/- 0.27 m, and just +/- 0.11 m at corner apex - comparable to human drivers, and autonomous vehicle control subsystems. The approach generates predictions within 33 ms, making it over 9000 times faster than traditional methods of finding the optimal trajectory. Results suggest that for certain applications data-driven approaches to find near-optimal racing lines may be favourable to traditional computational methods.

AB At present, autonomous driving vehicles are designed in an ego-vehicle manner. The vehicles gather information from their on-board sensors, build an environment model from it and plan their movement based on this model. Mobile network connections are used for non-mission-critical tasks and maintenance only. In this paper, we propose a connected autonomous driving system, where self-driving vehicles exchange data with a so-called road supervisor. All vehicles under supervision provide their current position, velocity and other valuable data. Using the received information, the supervisor provides a recommended trajectory for every vehicle, coordinated with all other vehicles. Since the supervisor has a much better overview of the situation on the road, more elaborate decisions, compared to each individual autonomous vehicle planning for itself, are possible. Experiments show that our approach works efficiently and safely when running our road supervisor on top of a popular traffic simulator. Furthermore, we show the feasibility of offloading the trajectory planning task into the network when using ultra-low-latency 5G networks.

AB Minimum energy expense and maximum safety with some comfort characterizes the definition of ideal human mobility. Recent technological advances in the autonomous vehicle driving systems not only enhance the safety and/or comfort levels but also present a significant opportunity for automated eco-driving. In this regard, a longitudinal controller for a smart and green autonomous vehicle (SAGA) is investigated. In principle, it is an eco-adaptive cruise control which aims at minimizing energy expenditure and maximizing energy regeneration. This paper presents detailed energy and powertrain analysis through the simulation of specific SAGA application concepts such as, dynamic programming-based offline acceleration optimization for a battery electric vehicle, or SAGA as a supervisory controller in combination with equivalent consumption minimization strategy for a hybrid electric vehicle. The main focus is on the evaluation of a vehicle energy manager which autonomously controls the longitudinal motion while actively balancing efficiency and safety. The comfort is not directly addressed in the conception but regarded as a quality criterion.

AB Intersections in the urban network are potential sources of traffic flow inefficiency. Existing intersection control mostly adopts the "cross" flow pattern model, while the use of the roundabout circular flow pattern is rather sparse. Connected and autonomous vehicle (CAV) technologies can enable roundabouts to better compete with traditional intersection designs in terms of performance. This study proposes a roundabout control strategy for CAVs to enhance intersection performance while ensuring vehicle safety. A hierarchical framework is developed to decouple the flow-level performance objective and vehicle-level safety constraints to achieve computational tractability for real-time applications. It entails developing a roundabout flow control model to optimize merge-in flows, a merge-in decision model to generate vehicle passing sequence from the optimal flows, and a virtual platoon control model to achieve safe and stable vehicle operations in a circular roundabout platoon. The performance of the proposed roundabout control strategy is illustrated through numerical studies and compared to existing intersection control methods. Its stability and safety characteristics are also demonstrated.

AB Autonomous driving is a technological innovation that involves the use of Artificial Intelligence (AI) in the automotive area, representing the future of transport and whose applications will influence the concept of driving and many other features of modern society. Indeed, the introduction of Autonomous Vehicles (AVs) on the market, along with the development of related technologies, will have a potential impact not only on the automotive industry but also on urban transport systems. New mobility-related businesses will emerge, whereas existing ones will have to adapt to changes. There are various aspects that affect urban transport systems: in this work, we highlight how road markings, intersections, and pavement design upgradings have a key role for AVs operation. This work aims to describe how contemporary society will be influenced by Autonomous Vehicles' spread in regard to urban transport systems. A comprehensive analysis of the expected developments within urban transport systems is hereby presented, and some crucial issues concerning benefits and drawbacks are also discussed. From our studies, it emerges that the detection performed by vehicles is mainly affected by road markings characteristics, especially at intersections. Indeed, the need for a new cross-sections type arise, since vehicles wandering phenomena will be reduced due to AVs position-keeping systems.

AB The fast evolution of artificial intelligence (AI) and the IoT gained more interest in the development of autonomous vehicles. The main challenges faced by autonomous car manufacturers are high computation costs and the lag of intelligent task management systems. The accident rates created by autonomous vehicles are increasing rapidly due to their unrestrained traffic, inaccurate location, and mapping methods. So, secure driving becomes the main concern in self-driving vehicle design. Moreover, the inadequate battery life and computation power made the system complex to minimize execution time as well as resource computation. Therefore, to handle all these complications, an intelligent task-managing system for autonomous vehicles is proposed in this paper. In this, each task is optimally executed by invoking the supervised resource predictor kernel data adaptive support vector machine-based multimodal bacterial foraging (KDASVM-MBF) method. The KDASVM-MBF intelligent task scheduling method is proposed to distribute all the tasks to the suitable processor based on central processing unit (CPU) usage and emergency. The proposed model is implemented in Python IDE-version 3.8 and examined using two multicore processors (Nvidia and AIIoT). The potential capability of the introduced type is evaluated by computing the performance methods such as response time, resource utilization, CPU utilization, execution time, prediction accuracy, and task miss rate. The experimental results reveal that the established KDASVM-MBF method accomplishes prediction accuracy of about 97% and 98% for Nvidia and AIIoT processors respectively with minimum task miss rate and execution time.

AB The current technological world is growing rapidly and each aspect of life is being transformed toward automation for human comfort and reliability. With autonomous vehicle technology, the communication gap between the driver and the traditional vehicle is being reduced through multiple technologies and methods. In this regard, state-of-the-art methods have proposed several approaches for advanced driver assistance systems (ADAS) to meet the requirement of a level-5 autonomous vehicle. Consequently, this work explores the role of textual cues present in the outer environment for finding the desired locations and assisting the driver where to stop. Firstly, the driver inputs the keywords of the desired location to assist the proposed system. Secondly, the system will start sensing the textual cues present in the outer environment through natural language processing techniques. Thirdly, the system keeps matching the similar keywords input by the driver and the outer environment using similarity learning. Whenever the system finds a location having any similar keyword in the outer environment, the system informs the driver, slows down, and applies the brake to stop. The experimental results on four benchmark datasets show the efficiency and accuracy of the proposed system for finding the desired locations by sensing textual cues in autonomous vehicles.

AB Before reaching full autonomy, vehicles will gradually be equipped with more and more advanced driver assistance systems (ADAS), effectively rendering them semi-autonomous. However, current ADAS technologies seem unable to handle complex traffic situations, notably when dealing with vehicles arriving from the sides, either at intersections or when merging on highways. The high rate of accidents in these settings proves that they constitute difficult driving situations. Moreover, intersections and merging lanes are often the source of important traffic congestion and, sometimes, deadlocks. In this paper, we propose a cooperative framework to safely coordinate semi-autonomous vehicles in such settings, removing the risk of collision or deadlocks while remaining compatible with human driving. More specifically, we present a supervised coordination scheme that overrides control inputs from human drivers when they would result in an unsafe or blocked situation. To avoid unnecessary intervention and remain compatible with human driving, overriding only occurs when collisions or deadlocks are imminent. In this case, safe overriding controls are chosen while ensuring they deviate minimally from those originally requested by the drivers. Simulation results based on a realistic physics simulator show that our approach is scalable to real-world scenarios, and computations can be performed in real time on a standard computer for up to a dozen simultaneous vehicles.

ID IMPEDANCE CONTROL
AB A unified force control scheme for an autonomous underwater robotic system is proposed in this paper. This robotic system is composed of a six degree-of-freedom autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) and a robotic arm that is mounted on the AUV. A unified force control approach, which combines impedance control with hybrid position/force control by means of fuzzy switching to perform autonomous underwater manipulation, is presented in this paper. This controller requires a dynamic model of the underwater vehicle-manipulator system. However, it does not require any model of the environment and therefore will have the potential to be useful in underwater tasks where the environment is generally unknown. The proposed approach combines the advantages of impedance control with hybrid control so that both smooth contact transition and force trajectory tracking can be achieved. In the absence of any functional autonomous underwater vehicle-manipulator system that can be used to verify the proposed controller, extensive computer simulations are performed and the results are presented in the paper.

AB Continuous developments in automotive technology brought about the reality of having an increasing number of autonomous vehicles (AV) on roadways soon. However, this advancement comes with the uncertainty of how the interaction between the autonomous and non-autonomous (non-AV) vehicles will play out. Using traffic simulators to model both AVs and non-AVs, and studying the effect of AVs on roadway mobility can help researchers in learning what to expect in real life. In this paper, an open-source simulator called Simulation of Urban Mobility (SUMO) was used to develop AVs by modifying Intelligent Driver Model (IDM) car following and LC2013 lane changing models. Then, three actual roadways in Columbus, Ohio were modeled, and 40 simulations were run for each traffic network. The first set of simulations focused on the impacts that AVs have on vehicle roadway mobility with non-AVs when all the AVs have the same autonomy level. The second set of simulations had mixed AV autonomy levels (SAE Level 2, 3 and 4) with mixed AV and non-AV traffic. The analysis revealed that mobility of AVs and non-AVs increased generally as autonomy level increased. When the AV autonomy levels were mixed, the non-AVs experienced lower average speeds and decreased roadway mobility.

AB This paper presents self-adaptive motion prediction-based proactive motion planning for autonomous driving in urban environments. In order to achieve fully autonomous driving in urban environments, the proposed algorithm predicts the future behavior of moving vehicles and considers the potential risk of objects appearing suddenly from occluded regions. A self-adaptive motion predictor was used to predict the probabilistic future states of vehicles and estimate the uncertainty of prediction simultaneously. Then, a free space boundary and drivable corridor were defined to determine the desired longitudinal acceleration and path. Based on these two boundary definitions, the proposed proactive motion planner decided the desired longitudinal motion by considering the risk potential of objects, such as the appearance of vulnerable road users from the free space boundary. The desired path is determined within the drivable corridor by the proposed motion planner with an integrated motion optimizer. The performance of the proposed algorithm has been validated via vehicle tests. The test results demonstrated that the proposed algorithm proactively determined lateral and longitudinal motion to minimize risks caused by detected and possible objects simultaneously on complex narrow roads to ensure safety.

AB We report the results of a first implementation demonstrating the use of an ontology to support reasoning about obstacles to improve the capabilities and performance of on-board route planning for autonomous vehicles. This is part of an overall effort to evaluate the performance of ontologies in different components of an autonomous vehicle within the 4D/RCS system architecture developed at NIST. Our initial focus has been on simple roadway driving scenarios where the controlled vehicle encounters potential obstacles in its path. As reported elsewhere [C. Schlenoff, S. Balakirsky, M. Uschold, R. Provine, S. Smith, Using ontologies to aid navigation planning in autonomous vehicles, Knowledge Engineering Review 18 (3) (2004) 243-255], our approach is to develop an ontology of objects in the environment, in conjunction with rules for estimating the damage that would be incurred by collisions with different objects in different situations. Automated reasoning is used to estimate collision damage; this information is fed to the route planner to help it decide whether to plan to avoid the object. We describe the results of the first implementation that integrates the ontology, the reasoner and the planner. We describe our insights and lessons learned and discuss resulting changes to our approach. (C) 2004 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB This study looks into how psychological and socioeconomic factors interact to affect people's propensity to purchase autonomous vehicles (AVs). Inspired by the Technology Acceptance Model, six psychological variables-social influence, convenience, perceived utility, perceived ease of use, perceived risk, and usage attitude-are proposed. Twenty-two measurement variables are introduced because it is difficult to measure these latent factors directly. To understand the link between the latent variables and calculate their factor scores, a structural equation model is created. The latent variables, along with observable socioeconomic attributes, are included as explanatory variables in a mixed logit model to estimate the purchase likelihood for AVs on different levels. A stated preference survey is conducted for data collection. We obtained 302 effective samples. The experiment results demonstrate that perceived usefulness has the most significant positive impact on purchase likelihood, followed by social influence and perceived ease of use. However, perceived risk has a significant negative impact on the purchase likelihood. Individuals with less driving experience and those without a motor vehicle driving license are more inclined to adopt autonomous vehicles. Additionally, there is a substantial correlation between the frequency of car use and the propensity to support the deployment of autonomous vehicles.

AB This paper proposes a mode switching supervisory controller for autonomous vehicles. The supervisory controller selects the most appropriate controller based on safety constraints and on the vehicle location with respect to junctions. Autonomous steering, throttle and deceleration control inputs are used to perform variable speed lane keeping assist, standard or emergency braking and to manage junctions, including roundabouts. Adaptive model predictive control with lane keeping assist is performed on the main roads and a linear pure pursuit inspired controller is applied using waypoints at road junctions where lane keeping assist sensors present a safety risk. A multi-stage rule based autonomous braking algorithm performs stop, restart and emergency braking maneuvers. The controllers are implemented in MATLAB(R) and Simulink (TM) and are demonstrated using the Automatic Driving Toolbox (TM) environment. Numerical simulations of autonomous driving scenarios demonstrate the efficiency of the lane keeping assist mode on roads with curvature and the ability to accurately track waypoints at cross intersections and roundabouts using a simpler pure pursuit inspired mode. The ego vehicle also autonomously stops in time at signaled intersections or to avoid collision with other road users.

AB We propose a software layered architecture for autonomous vehicles whose efficiency is driven by pull-based acquisition of sensor data. This multi process software architecture, to be embedded into the control loop of these vehicles, includes a Belief-Desire-Intention agent that can consistently assist the achievement of intentions. Since driving on roads implies huge dynamic considerations, we tackle both reactivity and context awareness considerations on the execution loop of the vehicle. While the proposed architecture gradually offers 4 levels of reactivity, from arch-reflex to the deep modification of the previously built execution plan, the obser-vation module concurrently exploits noise filtering and introduces frequency control to allow symbolic feature extraction while both fuzzy and first order logic manage-ment are used to enforce consistency and certainty over the context information properties. The presented use-case, the daily delivery of a network of pharmacy offices by an autonomous vehicle taking into account contextual (spatio-temp oral) traffic features, shows the efficiency and the modularity of the architecture, as well as the scalability of the reaction levels.

AB With the development and deployment of lightweight vehicles to the market, inclusive of autonomous pods, a review of advanced crashworthy structures and the design methodology has been conducted as it is thought that super-lightweight vehicles may pose significant risk to the occupants if they are involved in a crash. It is suggested that tests should include oblique and multiple velocity impacts to cater for the effects of assisted driving systems of future vehicles. A review of current crash structures and design methodologies revealed that the most recent research do not cater to multiple crash scenarios, nor a shorter crush allowance, therefore resulting in poor crashworthiness performance. In addition, the arbitrary seat positioning shown in autonomous pods' concepts vastly increases the risk to occupants. Greater enhancements to passive crashworthiness are imperative. To this end, functionally graded vehicle structures should be designed as it has been found that these can provide optimized solutions. Research into nonlinear optimization methods for computationally expensive problems will become central to this.

AB This paper presents a general force allocation strategy for over-actuated vehicles, utilising technologies where tyre forces can be more freely controlled than in conventional vehicles. For the purpose of illustration, this strategy has been applied and evaluated using a design proposal of an autonomous corner module (ACM) chassis during a transient open-loop response test. In this work, the vehicle has been forced to follow a trajectory, identical to the performance of a conventional front-steered vehicle during the manoeuvre studied. An optimisation process of tyre force allocation has been adopted along with tyre force constraints and cost functions to favour a desired solution. The vehicle response has been evaluated as open-loop, where tyre forces are shown to be allocated in a different manner than in conventional front-steered vehicles. A suggested approach for a control scheme of steering actuators is presented, where the actuator limitation is related to the lateral force possible. Finally, the force allocation strategy involves the ability to control vehicle slip independently from vehicle yaw rate. This opportunity has been adapted in the ACM vehicle in order to relax vehicle slip from the original trajectory description. In such circumstances, the ACMs demonstrate better utilisation of the adhesion potential.

AB Lateral stability and rollover stability are two most crucial concerns for path tracking of an autonomous vehicle under handling limit conditions. To improve path tracking accuracy and ensure vehicle stability under handling limit conditions, this paper proposes a force-driven switched MPC path tracking control strategy that coordinates active front-wheel steering with an external yaw moment. Firstly, a linear time-varying tire model is modelled using the affine approximate linearisation method to describe rear tire dymamics. And vehicle dynamics is modelled to predict vehicle states in the prediction horizon. Then, a force-driven switched MPC control strategy is proposed based on the system prediction model. The vehicle lateral stability and rollover stability are restricted using maximum tire lateral force and the zero-point moment method, respectively. Finally, according to the simulation results under normal speed and limiting speed conditions, a force-driven switched MPC control strategy can improve control accuracy and ensure vehicle stability.

AB Autonomous vehicles (AVs) are moving from test areas to the streets, which is one of the key components of smart cities and the future of mobility as a service (MaaS). In 2020, two AV services were operated in Tallinn. This paper focuses on one of these services, and its set-up process. The pilot project took place in ulemiste City, a tech park with 10 000 people working daily in the area, and it connected the offices with the airport and a shopping centre. The autonomous shuttle iseAuto, created first at TalTech, was used for the service (on streets with heavy traffic, including some complex crossings). Our findings associated with the ulemiste experiment are presented in the context of legal requirements set upon autonomous vehicles to be street legal. Some events that occurred during the operation (including an accident) are addressed and a summary of the feedback from clients is presented. Further studies should focus on the extended concept of smart cities with a roadmap for the nearest future.

AB State-of-the-art radio frequency identification (RFID)-based indoor autonomous vehicles localization methods are mostly based on received signal strength indicator (RSSI) measurements. However, the accuracy of these methods is not high enough for real-world scenarios. To overcome this problem, a novel dual-frequency phase difference of arrival (PDOA) ranging-based indoor autonomous vehicle localization and tracking scheme was developed. Firstly, the method gets the distance between the RFID reader and the tag by dual-frequency PDOA ranging. Then, a maximum likelihood estimation and semi-definite programming (SDP)-based localization algorithm is utilized to calculate the position of the autonomous vehicles, which can mitigate the multipath ranging error and obtain a more accurate positioning result. Finally, vehicle traveling information and the position achieved by RFID localization are fused with a Kalman filter (KF). The proposed method can work in a low-density tag deployment environment. Simulation experiment results showed that the proposed vehicle localization and tracking method achieves centimeter-level mean tracking accuracy.

AB In the field of autonomous driving, cameras are crucial sensors for providing information about a vehicle's environment. Image quality refers to a camera system's ability to capture, process, and display signals to form an image. Historically, "good quality" in this context refers to images that have been processed by an Image Signal Processor (ISP) designed with the goal of providing the optimal experience for human consumption. However, image quality perceived by humans may not always result in optimal conditions for computer vision. In the context of human consumption, image quality is well documented and understood. Image quality for computer vision applications, such as those in the autonomous vehicle industry, requires more research. Fully autonomous vehicles inevitably encounter constraints concerning data storage, transmission speed, and energy consumption. This is a result of enormous amounts of data being generated by the vehicle from suites made up of multiple different sensors. We propose a potential optimization along the computer vision pipeline, by completely bypassing the ISP block for a class of applications. We demonstrate that doing so has a negligible impact on the performance of Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) object detectors. The results also highlight the benefits of using raw pre-ISP data, in the context of computation and energy savings achieved by removing the ISP.

AB One of the recent news headlines is that a pedestrian was killed by an autonomous vehicle because safety features in this vehicle did not detect an object on a road correctly. Due to this accident, some global automobile companies announced plans to postpone development of an autonomous vehicle. Furthermore, there is no doubt about the importance of safety features for autonomous vehicles. For this reason, our research goal is the development of a very safe and lightweight camera-based blind spot detection system, which can be applied to future autonomous vehicles. The blind spot detection system was implemented in open source software. Approximately 2000 vehicle images and 9000 non-vehicle images were adopted for training the Fully Connected Network (FCN) model. Other data processing concepts such as the Histogram of Oriented Gradients (HOG), heat map, and thresholding were also employed. We achieved 99.43% training accuracy and 98.99% testing accuracy of the FCN model, respectively. Source codes with respect to all the methodologies were then deployed to an off-the-shelf embedded board for actual testing on a road. Actual testing was conducted with consideration of various factors, and we confirmed 93.75% average detection accuracy with three false positives.

AB With consideration of tire force saturation in vehicle motions, a novel path-following controller is developed for autonomous vehicles with unknown-bound disturbances and unknown actuator parameters. An adaptive sliding-mode fault-tolerant control (ASM-FTC) strategy is designed to stabilize the path-following errors without any information of disturbance boundaries, actuator fault boundaries and steering ratio from the steering wheel to the front wheels. By selecting the distance from the center of gravity to the center of percussion as the preview length, the effects of the lateral rear-tire force are decoupled and cancelled out, and then the preview error, which represents the path-following performance, can be only commanded by the front-tire force. To further address the issue of unknown tire-road friction limits, a modified ASM-FTC strategy is presented to improve the path-following performance as the lateral tire force is saturated. Simulation results show that the modified ASM-FTC controller demonstrates superior tracking performance over the normal ASM-FTC while the autonomous vehicle follows desired paths.

AB A single anti-collision trajectory generation problem for an "own" vessel only is significantly different from the challenge of generating a whole set of safe trajectories for multi-surface vehicle encounter situations in the open sea. Effective solutions for such problems are needed these days, as we are entering the era of autonomous ships. The article specifies the problem of anti-collision trajectory planning in many-to-many encounter situations. The proposed original multi-surface vehicle beam search algorithm (MBSA), based on the beam search strategy, solves the problem. The general idea of the MBSA involves the application of a solution for one-to-many encounter situations (using the beam search algorithm, BSA), which was tested on real automated radar plotting aid (ARPA) and automatic identification system (AIS) data. The test results for the MBSA were from simulated data, which are discussed in the final part. The article specifies the problem of anti-collision trajectory planning in many-to-many encounter situations involving moving autonomous surface vehicles, excluding Collision Regulations (COLREGs) and vehicle dynamics.

AB We perform a simulation based experimental design for automated unit-load (UL) storage and retrieval systems based on autonomous vehicle technology to identify factors affecting their performance. First, we select the best combination of numbers of lifts and vehicles from pre-defined scenarios that are the key components of the system. Then, we apply design of experiment (DOE) for a system with this combination of lifts and vehicles and for various arrival rates. The factors considered in the DOE include: dwell point policy, scheduling rule, input/output (I/O) locations and interleaving rule. Three different responses, the average cycle time for storage and retrieval transactions, average vehicle utilization, and average lift utilization, are considered. However, because the ANOVA assumptions are not met for the average cycle time response, an inverse transformation method is applied on this response. The results show that there is three-way interaction effect on each response at a 95% confidence level. After determining the main and the interaction effects, a Tukey's test analysis is completed on the responses. We utilize data from a warehouse in France that utilizes the autonomous vehicle storage and retrieval system. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI Evasion planning for autonomous intersection control based on an

SO JOURNAL OF TRANSPORTATION SAFETY & SECURITY
LA English
DT Article
DE Autonomous intersection management; evasion planning; detection time
ID TRAFFIC MANAGEMENT; VEHICLES; AVOIDANCE
AB Autonomous intersection management (AIM) has been widely researched, but previous studies assume that vehicles will follow assigned trajectories precisely. The purpose of this paper is to investigate the safety buffers needed between intersecting vehicles to avoid a collision if a vehicle malfunctions. We optimize vehicle trajectories by deciding the arrival times at each conflict point (point of possible intersection with other vehicles) along each vehicle's trajectory. Because intersecting vehicles rely on the intersection manager (IM) to detect and communicate malfunctions, the reaction time from the IM determines the minimum safety buffer needed. Although a smaller reaction time reduces the safety buffer, it increases the probability that the IM falsely detects a malfunction, instructing vehicles to stop and creating unnecessary delays. This paper develops a mathematical safety buffer for intersecting vehicles, linearizes this time separation, and constructs a combined mixed-integer linear program. A complete protocol is presented and simulated for normal circumstances, emergency circumstances, and recovery circumstances. Sensitivity analyses on various reaction times show the tradeoff between low reaction times (more false positives) and high reaction times (greater safety buffer).

AB Reducing emissions and energy consumption of autonomous vehicles is critical in the modern era. This paper presents an intelligent energy management system based on Reinforcement Learning (RL) for conventional autonomous vehicles. Furthermore, in order to improve the efficiency, a new exploration strategy is proposed to replace the traditional decayed epsilon-greedy strategy in the Q-learning algorithm associated with RL. Unlike tradi-tional Q-learning algorithms, the proposed self-adaptive Q-learning (SAQ-learning) can be applied in real-time. The learning capability of the controllers can help the vehicle deal with unknown situations in real-time. Nu-merical simulations show that compared to other controllers, Q-learning and SAQ-learning controllers can generate the desired engine torque based on the vehicle road power demand and control the air/fuel ratio by changing the throttle angle efficiently in real-time. Also, the proposed real-time SAQ-learning is shown to improve the operational time by 23% compared to standard Q-learning. Our simulations reveal the effectiveness of the proposed control system compared to other methods, namely dynamic programming and fuzzy logic methods.

AB This paper investigates computing resource scheduling for real-time applications in autonomous driving, such as localization and obstacle avoidance. In our considered scenario, autonomous vehicles periodically sense the environment, offload sensor data to an edge server for processing, and receive computing results from the server. Due to mobility and computing latency, a vehicle travels some distance in the duration between the instant of offloading its sensor data and the instant of receiving the computing result. Our objective is finding a scheduling scheme for the edge sever to minimize the above traveled distance of vehicles. The approach is to determine the processing order according to individual vehicle mobility and computing capability of the edge server. We formulate a restless multi-arm bandit (RMAB) problem, design a Whittle index based stochastic scheduling scheme, and determine the index using a deep reinforcement learning (DRL) method. The proposed scheduling scheme avoids the time-consuming policy exploration common in DRL scheduling approaches and makes effectual decisions with low complexity. Extensive simulation results demonstrate that the proposed indexed-based scheme can deliver computing results to the vehicles promptly while adapting to time-variant vehicle mobility.

AB To fully realize the potential of autonomous aerial vehicles, a reliable, robust, and accurate navigation system is required. Current technologies composing such a system include stand-alone and augmented global navigation satellite systems (GNSS), as well as visual, inertial, and signals-of-opportunity (SOPs) approaches. However, as it is well understood that no single alternative can meet the requirements for full autonomy, a combination of technologies is required to address alternative application scenarios. In this work, an online technique for relative positioning of autonomous unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) is proposed that capitalizes on SOPs in conjunction with inertial measurements for localization and navigation when GNSS signals are not readily available. The proposed system uses the signals' characteristics over a large part of the frequency spectrum, in conjunction with an optimal learning (OL) technique, to adaptively choose a sequence of frequencies that provide location estimates in real-time. Subsequently, inertial measurements, which are provided by an onboard unit, are employed to improve on the tracking accuracy. Field experiments, using an autonomous unmanned aerial vehicle, demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed solution under various parameter settings.

   FRAMEWORK
AB Trajectory tracking and stability control are two essential functions of autonomous vehicles, and there is inevitable mutual interference between them, especially under extreme conditions. Towards addressing this challenge, this paper proposes a novel cooperative strategy of trajectory tracking and stability control for four-wheel independent drive (4WID) autonomous vehicles. An adaptive trajectory tracking controller is designed based on the model predictive control (MPC) theory, in which the tire cornering stiffness is modified in real-time leverages the lateral force estimated by the square-root cubature Kalman filter (SCKF). Then, the vehicle stability controller is designed based on the sliding mode control (SMC), in which the tire force saturation constraint and the relative weight of yaw rate and sideslip angle are considered. Furthermore, a weight adaptive criterion with normalized stability index is defined to develop the cooperative strategy of trajectory tracking and stability control. The feasibility and adaptability of the proposed method to different extreme conditions are verified by hardware-in-the-loop (HIL) test and CarSim-Simulink co-simulation. Finally, an experimental case is presented to demonstrate the realizability of the proposed method.

ID TRAJECTORY PREDICTION
AB In a realistic traffic scenario involving intelligent vehicles, the interaction between autonomous vehicles and pedestrians is important. It is crucial to safe autonomous driving and advanced driver assistance systems to accurately predict the intentions of pedestrians. Specifically, when an autonomous vehicle is driving in complex environments, such as urban intersection, it will reduce the likelihood of a collision and increase the driving comfort if it can accurately and promptly distinguish the pedestrian's intention. This paper proposes a competitive framework for predicting pedestrian crossing intentions using only video sequences obtained from the RGB camera mounted on the vehicle in natural traffic scenes. In the proposed framework, it firstly detects the pedestrian and tracks them, then predicts whether they will cross or not by the attention-based LSTM (CA-LSTM) with some contextual and dynamical features. This proposed model achieves an accuracy score of 89.68% which is competitive compared to many other related works. Extensive experiments on the JAAD datasets demonstrate that the performance of our model is superior to that of related works, with an accuracy score of 89.68%.

   Design and analysis of an optimal trajectory
SO IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON AUTOMATIC CONTROL

DT Article
DE autonomous vehicles; nonlinear optimization; obstacle avoidance
AB Over the past few years, there has been much research on various aspects of control of autonomous vehicles. However, it seems that the problem of overtaking a slower moving vehicle has been somewhat neglected. This note deals with the three-phase overtaking maneuver and with designing a smooth and ergonomic optimal lane-change trajectory to be used under normal conditions. It is shown that the absolute shape, size, and time of the first-phase trajectory do not depend on the velocity of the leading, slower moving vehicle. Only the absolute point for initiating the diversion is affected. The relatively simple mathematical model for each lane-change trajectory is based on minimizing the total kinetic energy during the maneuver, superimposed on a "minimum-jerk trajectory." For, high enough initial velocities, explicit formulas are obtained for the. optimal distance and the optimal time of the maneuver. It is also shown that the total time is bounded from above and below, regardless of the velocity. By, using the results of the suggested model, an autonomous vehicle, equipped with appropriate sensors, can estimate the best time and place to begin and end the overtaking and its total time and distance. This may help to make a decision whether to overtake or not.

AB Underwater navigation performance of Autonomous Underwater Vehicles (AUVs) strongly affects the quality of the collected data. Scientific literature extensively addresses the AUV tracking and self-localisation problems. However, no standard evaluation methods for vehicle navigation exist. Therefore. the authors' visionary perspective is to develop and implement an Underwater Test Range (UTR) to certify the vehicle compliance with long-term underwater navigation. This paper describes a first step along this research path represented by an in field validation of such conceived measurement network. Experiments are soundly based on extensive simulation analysis presented in previous works. In particular, an underwater network composed of acoustic modems with Ultra Short BaseLine capabilities is deployed as measurement rig. This setup, through bearing-only measurements, allows the tracking of an Autonomous Surface Vehicle (ASV) equipped with Differential GPS as position ground truth. Results show how the proposed methodology performs in a real marine scenario with challenging conditions due to shallow waters and magnetically noisy environment. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

AB Docking is an important and difficult task in ship navigation that has traditionally required excessive time and expert piloting. In this study, an autonomous docking system based on symbol recognition was developed for autonomous surface vehicles (ASVs). The docking process is divided into an approaching phase for approaching the docking port and a docking phase for guiding an ASV into the target docking port. In the docking phase, the desired heading of the ASV is determined considering the centering and lead angles. The centering angle is used for pure tracking, and the lead angle is used for guiding the ASV into the safety zone. Each angle is determined according to the ASV's relative heading angle and position, which are estimated by detecting the dock and symbols using a camera and LiDAR. Docking tests based on Turtlebot and ASV were conducted to verify the performance of the proposed docking algorithm. The performance of the developed autonomous docking system was verified by participating in the docking mission at the Korea Autonomous BOAT competition 2021.

AB The focus of car-following models is to analyze the microscopic characteristics of traffic flows, with particular attention given to the interaction between adjacent vehicles. This paper presents a systematic review of existing studies on car-following models, with an emphasis on the behavior of both human-driven vehicles (HDVs) and autonomous vehicles (AVs). We classify car-following models based on their applicable background and structure. By considering driving behavior and specific model parameters, we identify the advantages and limitations of each microscopic simulation model in terms of accuracy and continuity. We also discuss model calibration methods, stability analysis, and the impact of complex traffic environments on the car-following process. Finally, we present detailed discussions of each model's features and provide recommendations based on reviewed works and development trends for future research, including mixed traffic flow composed of AVs and HDVs.

AB This study proposes an autonomous vehicle incentive program design (AV-IPD) problem for a local government, which aims to promote the adoption of autonomous vehicles (AVs) by deploying AV lanes and subsidizing the purchase of AVs with the objective of system optimum subject to a fixed budget. As it is difficult to anticipate the changing AV market conditions in the future, we take into account the uncertainty in AV purchase price. For the AV-IPD problem, we firstly decide which regular lanes should be converted into exclusive AV lanes. Secondly, we determine the AV purchase subsidy for each realization of AV purchase price with a given AV lane deployment scheme. A binary logit model is applied to characterize the vehicle choice behavior of users. The AV-IPD problem is formulated as a two-stage stochastic programming model with equilibrium constraints. To solve the AV-IPD problem, we develop a solution method based on linear approximation techniques and duality theories. Numerical experiments are conducted to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed model and solution method.

AB In recent years, vehicle detectors built on deep convolutional neural network (DCNN) have been widely used in autonomous driving. Under the complex conditions of road traffic, the detector is expected to run in high speed and high accuracy. However, due to the limited computing power and storage space on the autonomous vehicle, the deployment of advanced DCNN detectors is often restricted. The design of lightweight and powerful detectors is in a great desire. Recently, group convolution, as a novel convolution algorithm, has been proposed to reduce the floating-point operations and make the detection network lighter and faster. However, in practice, it is found that the increase of group number does not always boost the detection speed, but sometimes leads to the performance degradation. In addition, the existing guidelines for network design do not indicate how to choose the group number in the group convolution in order to maximize the overall detection speed. To this end, in this paper, we propose three new guidelines to determine the valid range of the group number, and design a lightweight detection network-DenseLightNet-based on these new design criteria. The proposed detector runs at a speed of three times faster than the current real-time detector YoloV3, while holding a much smaller model size.

AB In the context of global suburbanization and population aging, a low-speed, automated vehicle (LSAV) system provides essential mobility services in suburban residential areas. Although extensive studies on shared autonomous vehicle (SAV) services have been conducted, quantitative investigations on the operation of suburban LSAV systems are limited. Based on a demonstration pilot project of an autonomous vehicle called "Slocal Automated Driving", we investigated the performance of an SAV system considering several scenarios in Kozoji Newtown, a suburban commuter town in Japan. The agent-based simulation results revealed that 40 LSAVs can satisfy the demands of 2263 daily trips with an average wait time of 15 min. However, in the case of a high-speed scenario, the same fleet size improved the level of service (LOS) by reducing the average wait time to two and a half minutes and halving the in-vehicle time. By contrast, the wait time in terms of the average and 95th percentile of the no-sharing ride scenario drastically deteriorated to an unacceptable level. Based on the fluctuations of hourly share rates, wait times, and the number of vacant vehicles, we determined that preparing for the potential fleet insufficiency periods from 7:00-13:00 and 15:00-18:00 can improve the LOS.

AB The recent advances in collision avoidance technologies for unmanned vehicles such as UAVs, AUVs, AGVs, and USVs have greatly advanced the industry. Their lower cost and acceptability of high-risk missions have enabled the development of collision avoidance controllers for autonomous vehicles. These low-maintenance gadgets are also portable, need low maintenance, and enable continuous monitoring to occur near real-time. This may be said; however it would be incorrect, because collision avoidance controllers have been related with compromises that affect data dependability. Research on collision avoidance controls is quickly developing; therefore it is distributed throughout multiple papers, projects, and grey literature. This report critically reviews the recent relevant research on creating collision avoidance systems for autonomous vehicles. Typically, the assessment measures are dependent on the algorithm's use case and the platform's capabilities. The full evaluation of the benefits and drawbacks of the most prevalent approaches in the present state of the art is provided based on 7 metrics which are complexity, communication dependence, pre-mission planning, robustness, 3D compatibility, real-time performance and escape trajectories.

AB Autonomous navigation in narrow indoor environments such as indoor factory, warehouse and laboratory environments, and so on requires higher flexibility and navigation accuracy of the vehicle. This article presents an autonomous navigation method for four-wheel steering vehicle which combines extended Kalman filtering (EKF) and rapidly-exploring random tree (RRT) to improve the precision and flexibility of autonomous navigation of the vehicle in narrow indoor environments. The four-wheel steering model was established by the key parameters such as shape size and minimum angle of rotation of the experimental vehicle. Considering the problem that the uncertainty of pose estimation increases with time during autonomous navigation, an error model is schemed by adding noise to the output terminal of the analog odometer sensor. In order to suppress the accumulation of the uncertainty and keep it stable for a long time, the prediction and update steps of Kalman filter are introduced to filter the error. Then, the simultaneous positioning and mapping are established. Based on accurate positioning, a set of driving paths to reach the target is generated by RRT sampling algorithm. The simulation results show that positioning uncertainty remains stable over time, which verifies the effectiveness of the method. The overall positioning percentage error is 0.21%. Compared with traditional dead reckoning algorithm, the positioning accuracy is improved by 73.1% and the vehicle flexibility is increased by 68.6%. The four-wheel steering vehicle can find an ideal trajectory in narrow indoor environments, which assures the efficiency of the autonomous navigation and the traveling quality of the navigation route. Finally, the experimental results are consistent with the simulation results, which further verifies the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm.

AB This article introduces an efficient and high-precision estimation framework for four-wheel independently actuated (FWIA) autonomous vehicles based on a novel tire model and adaptive square-root cubature Kalman filter (SCKF) estimation strategy. Firstly, a reliable and concise tire model that considers the tire's nonlinear mechanics characteristics under combined conditions through the piecewise affine (PWA) identification method is established to improve the accuracy of the lateral dynamics model of FWIA autonomous vehicles. On this basis, the longitudinal relaxation length of each tire is integrated into the lateral dynamics modeling of FWIA autonomous vehicle. A novel nonlinear state function, including the PWA tire model, is proposed in this paper. To reduce the impact of the uncertainty of noise statistics on the estimation accuracy, an adaptive SCKF estimation algorithm based on the maximum a posteriori (MAP) criterion is proposed in the estimation framework. Finally, the estimation accuracy and stability of the adaptive SCKF algorithm are verified by the co-simulation of CarSim and Simulink. The simulation results show that when the statistical characteristics of noise are unknown and the target state changes suddenly under critical maneuvers, the estimation framework proposed in this paper still maintains high accuracy and stability.

AB Reinforcement learning with safety constraints is promising for autonomous vehicles, of which various failures may result in disastrous losses. In general, a safe policy is trained by constrained optimization algorithms, in which the average constraint return as a function of states and actions should be lower than a predefined bound. However, most existing safe learning-based algorithms capture states via multiple high-precision sensors, which complicates the hardware systems and is power-consuming. This article is focused on safe motion planning with the stability guarantee for autonomous vehicles with limited size and power. To this end, the risk-identification method and the Lyapunov function are integrated with the well-known soft actor-critic (SAC) algorithm. By borrowing the concept of Lyapunov functions in the control theory, the learned policy can theoretically guarantee that the state trajectory always stays in a safe area. A novel risk-sensitive learning-based algorithm with the stability guarantee is proposed to train policies for the motion planning of autonomous vehicles. The learned policy is implemented on a differential drive vehicle in a simulation environment. The experimental results show that the proposed algorithm achieves a higher success rate than the SAC.

AB In this research, the flow around the autonomous underwater vehicles with symmetrical bodies is numerically investigated. Increasing the drag force in autonomous underwater vehicles increases the energy consumption and decreases the duration of underwater exploration and operations. Therefore, the main objective of this research is to decrease drag force with the change in geometry to reduce energy consumption. In this study, the decreasing or increasing trends of the drag force of axisymmetric bare hulls have been studied by making alterations in the curve equations and creating the optimal geometric shapes in terms of hydrodynamics for the noses and tails of autonomous underwater vehicles. The incompressible, three-dimensional, and steady Navier-Stokes equations have been used to simulate the flow. Also, k-epsilon Realizable with enhanced wall treatment was used for turbulence modeling. Validation results were acceptable with respect to the 3.6% and 1.4% difference with numerical and experimental results. The results showed that all the autonomous underwater vehicle hulls designed in this study, at an attack angle of 0 degrees, had a lower drag force than the autonomous underwater vehicle hull used for validation except geometry no. 1. In addition, nose no. 3 has been selected as the best nose according to the lowest value of stagnation pressure, and also tail no. 3 has been chosen as the best tail due to the production of the lowest vortex. Therefore, geometry no. 5 has been designed using nose and tail no. 3. The comparison made here showed that the maximum drag reduction in geometry no. 5 was equal to 26%, and therefore, it has been selected as the best bare hull in terms of hydrodynamics.

AB Point cloud registration is a vital prerequisite for many autonomous vehicle tasks. However, balancing the accuracy and computational complexity is very challenging for existing point cloud registration algorithms. This paper proposes a fast coarse-to-fine point cloud registration approach for autonomous vehicles. Our method uses nearest neighbor sample consensus optical flow pairwise matching resulting from a 2D bird's eye view to initialize the coarse registration. It provides an initial 2D guess matrix for the fine registration and effectively reduces the computational complexity. In two-stage registration, our approach eliminates outliers by utilizing our self-correction module, which improves the robustness without using global positioning system (GPS) information. Point cloud registration experiments show that only our approach can process in real-time (71 ms, on average) while achieving state-of-the-art accuracy on the KITTI Odometry dataset, achieving a mean relative rotation error of 0.125(& LCIRC;) and a mean relative translation error of 0.038 m. In addition, real-road vehicle-to-vehicle point cloud registration experiments verify that the proposed algorithm can effectively align two vehicles' point cloud when the GPS is not synchronized.

AB Autonomous vehicles (AVs) have been a rapidly emerging phenomenon in recent years, with some automated features already available in vehicles. AVs are expected to potentially revolutionize the existing inefficient state of urban transportation and be a step closer to environmental sustainability. This study focuses on simulation modeling in assessing the potential effects of autonomous vehicles (AVs) and on mobility and safety by developing a framework model based on traffic microsimulation for a real network located in Al-Madinah, Saudi Arabia. The market penetration rates (MPRs) will not reach 100% in the near future; instead, penetration will progressively increase. As a result, in our study, we investigated the potential effect of AV technology in five different AV market penetration rates: 0% (baseline), 25%, 50%, 75%, and 100%. The results suggest that Avs significantly improve the network's safety and operational performance at high penetration rates. Specifically, estimated vehicle delays decreased by 26%, 34.4%, 63.7%, and 74.2% for 25%, 50%, 75%, and 100% AV penetration rates, respectively. Finally, we think this study will help decisionmakers over in the long-term in their attempts to achieve sustainable development through the optimal integration of innovative and novel technologies.

DE Autonomous vehicles; vehicle dynamics control; trajectory tracking;

AB In order to avoid collisions in emergency conditions, the autonomous vehicle may be necessitated to maneuvers up to their handling limits. In these scenarios, the vehicle must be able to react quickly although the longitudinal and lateral coupled and nonlinear dynamics are significantly enhanced. To improve the accuracy of trajectory tracking and vehicle stability at the handling limits, this paper presents a hierarchical motion control framework that prioritizing lateral response. For lateral motion control, a nested architecture that consists of lateral deviation control and yaw rate control is designed considering parameter uncertainties. In longitudinal motion controller, the constraints of longitudinal tire forces are calculated on the premise of meeting steering demand. On this basis, an active load transfer strategy is proposed to optimize the steering response, which increasing the lateral stiffness of the front wheels through load transfer generated by active braking. Meanwhile, a longitudinal speed control algorithm considering the longitudinal acceleration demand is developed based on conditional integral method, to cope with the contradiction between fast tracking and small overshoot. Finally, experimental results in different scenarios demonstrate that the autonomous vehicle with the proposed control scheme can track the desired trajectory stably and accurately at the handling limits.

AB Connected and autonomous vehicles have recently emerged as promising technological solutions to optimize traffic congestion, prevent accidents, and enhance driving safety and efficiency. Since such vehicles are equipped with various embedded components connected through different communication technologies, their security has become a vital concern. Therefore, Misbehavior Detection plays a major role in enabling vehicles to quickly identify the security risks and adopt effective immediate countermeasures. In this paper, we present an in-depth study of misbehavior detection in connected and autonomous vehicles. We first develop a new definition of misbehavior based on a comprehensive analysis of the existing work related to both intentional (criminal) and unintentional misbehavior. The new definition lays a foundation to accommodate, characterize, and understand novel misbehaviors. We then extensively investigate the state-of-the-art solutions and provide a detailed taxonomy for a large family of machine learning algorithms used for misbehavior detection in the literature. We carefully review the available tools and datasets for misbehavior detection. Finally, we present open research directions and challenges. (c) 2023 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Introducing autonomous vehicles (AVs) reduces generalized transportation costs and encourages people to relocate. Understanding the subsequent changes in urban structure can help predict the future development of urban economies and policies. Transportation connects multiple zones in cities, and by improving traffic flow and ease directly impacts the economies of various markets. Each direct impact then also indirectly affects related markets. Therefore, a spatial computable general equilibrium model that connects multiple zones via a transportation network is suitable for analyzing the impact of a new transport system. This study constructs a model to simulate the effects of AVs on residential location choice. The results show that increased prevalence of AVs steers people toward suburbs with poor public transportation. Thus, high-income workers react more to technological progress, while low-income workers react more to lowered ownership costs. Consumers' location choices and budgets also affect residential zones' development. Therefore, regional policy goals must be clarified and appropriate target consumer groups set when introducing AVs.

AB A key research area in autonomous driving is how to model the driver's decision-making behavior, due to the fact it is significant for a self-driving vehicles considering their traffic safety and efficiency. However, the uncertain characteristics of vehicle and pedestrian trajectories affect urban roads, which poses severe challenges to the cognitive understanding and decision-making of autonomous vehicle systems in terms of accuracy and robustness. To overcome the abovementioned problems, this paper proposes a Bayesian driver agent (BDA) model which is a vision-based autonomous vehicle system with learning and inference methods inspired by human driver's cognitive psychology. Different from the end-to-end learning method and traditional rule-based methods, our approach breaks the driving system up into a scene recognition module and a decision inference module. The perception module, which is based on a multi-task learning neural network (CNN), takes a driver's-view image as its input and predicts the traffic scene's feature values. The decision module based on dynamic Bayesian network (DBN) then makes an inferred decision using the traffic scene's feature values. To explore the validity of the Bayesian driver agent model, we performed experiments on a driving simulation platform. The BDA model can extract the scene feature values effectively and predict the probability distribution of the human driver's decision-making process accurately based on inference. We take the lane changing scenario as an example to verify the model, the intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) correlation between the BDA model and human driver's decision process reached 0.984. This work suggests a research in scene perception and autonomous decision-making that may apply to autonomous vehicle system.

AB Most autonomous driving solutions require some method of localization within their environment. Typically, onboard sensors are used to localize the vehicle precisely in a previously recorded map. However, these solutions are sensitive to ambient lighting conditions such as darkness and inclement weather. Additionally, the maps can become outdated in a rapidly changing environment and require continuous updating. While LiDAR systems don't require visible light, they are sensitive to weather such as fog or snow, which can interfere with localization. In this letter, we utilize a Ground Penetrating Radar (GPR) to obtain precise vehicle localization. By mapping and localizing using features beneath the ground, we obtain features that are both stable over time, and maintain their appearance during changing ambient weather and lighting conditions. We incorporate this solution into a full-scale autonomous vehicle and evaluate the performance on over 17 km of testing data in a variety of challenging weather conditions. We find that this novel sensing modality is capable of providing precise localization for autonomous navigation without using cameras or LiDAR sensors.

AB Connected and Autonomous Vehicles (CAVs) expect to dramatically improve road safety and efficiency of the transportation system. However, CAVs can be vulnerable to attacks at different levels, e.g., attacks on intra-vehicle networks and inter-vehicle networks. Those malicious attacks not only result in loss of confidentiality and user privacy but also lead to more serious consequences such as bodily injury and loss of life. An intrusion detection system (IDS) is one of the most effective ways to monitor the operations of vehicles and networks, detect different types of attacks, and provide essential information to mitigate and remedy the effects of attacks. To ensure the safety of CAVs, it is extremely important to detect various attacks accurately in a timely fashion. The purpose of this survey is to provide a comprehensive review of available machine learning (ML) based IDS for intra-vehicle and inter-vehicle networks. Additionally, this paper discusses publicly available datasets for CAV and offers a summary of the many current testbeds and future research trends for connected vehicle environments.

AB This paper presents a modelling and simulation method for sensor-guided autonomous driving. A generic model of range sensing and object detection in 3D space is discussed first that represents their high-level functions. The low-level physical characteristics of range sensing and object detection are further investigated based on Frequency Modulated Continuous Wave (FMCW) radar which is gaining wide popularity in automotive applications. These are the enablers to modelling and simulation of vehicle interactions with one another under traffic and with surrounding environment. A closed-loop adaptive cruise control is then used as an example to demonstrate the vehicle limited autonomous driving with the proposed model and method that has been shown to be valid, effective and numerically efficient.

AB This paper studies an optimal dynamic lane reversal and traffic control (DLRTC) strategy in the presence of autonomous vehicles (AVs). A centralized controller is set to change lane directions dynamically and regulate traffic flow on a motorway network. Through vehicle to infrastructure (V2I) communication, the roadside sensors can send lane reversal information and flow control actions to the AVs which can perform lane-changing behaviors and adjust travel speed. To model the traffic dynamics under DLRTC, we propose a novel multi-lane cell transmission model (CTM). A logit model is used to characterize the lane-changing behaviors under uncontrolled cases. A mixed integer linear programming model (MILP) is formulated for DLRTC, and optimal control actions are implemented in a framework of model predictive control (MPC). The numerical experiments based on the Ayer Rajah Expressway (AYE) in Singapore are conducted to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed methods. The results show that the DLRTC strategy can effectively reduce road congestion and achieve better system performance compared to the benchmark method.

AB Planning and decision-making technology at intersections is a comprehensive research problem in intelligent transportation systems due to the uncertainties caused by a variety of traffic participants. As wireless communication advances, vehicle infrastructure integrated algorithms designed for intersection planning and decision-making have received increasing attention. In this paper, the recent studies on the planning and decision-making technologies at intersections are primarily overviewed. The general planning and decision-making approaches are presented, which include graph-based approach, prediction base approach, optimization-based approach and machine learning based approach. Since connected autonomous vehicles (CAVs) is the future direction for the automated driving area, we summarized the evolving planning and decision-making methods based on vehicle infrastructure cooperative technologies. Both four-way signalized and unsignalized intersection(s) are investigated under purely automated driving traffic and mixed traffic. The study benefit from current strategies, protocols, and simulation tools to help researchers identify the presented approaches' challenges and determine the research gaps, and several remaining possible research problems that need to be solved in the future.

AB Real-time object detection and ranging of multiple objects on the road are the essential tasks in the field of autonomous driving. In this paper, we introduce a system for simultaneous detection and ranging of vehicles, people, non-motor vehicles and lanes based on RGB-D images. Among them, the detection of vehicles, people and non-motor vehicles belongs to general detection task and the lane detection belongs to segmentation task. In order to improve the accuracy and speed, we use two networks to complete these two tasks. We propose a real-time synchronization method with multi-GPU, which achieves separate training and simultaneous detection of lane detectior and vehicle, people and non-motor vehicle detector. We also propose a center-selective ranging module based on binocular ranging technology to distance the detected object. The system reaches nearly 15 FPS with four 1080Ti GPUs. We construct datasets about these problems including daytime and night in which the system achieves high accuracy. A real-time test of the system on the streets of Tianjin, China has been conducted by us, it has proved that the system can be applied to actual driving.

AB This research investigates the utilization of human driving models in autonomous vehicles, particularly in scenarios with minimal or no interactions with other vehicles. Human driving models provide valuable insights into driver behavior and play a crucial role in shaping the behavior of autonomous vehicles, enhancing their performance and user experience. The primary focus of this study is the creation of a planning model for autonomous vehicles when navigating roundabouts in the absence of traffic. This model seeks to emulate human driving behavior, ensuring predictability, safety, the optimization of traffic flow, and adaptation to various roundabout geometries. To achieve this, the research introduces a trajectory model that takes into account geometric attributes and speed variations within roundabouts. The model is calibrated using empirical data and generalizes parameters through statistical regression methodologies. In particular, speed profile modeling is evaluated for its consistency in creating plans that faithfully replicate human driving behavior in roundabouts. While the study presents a promising approach, it acknowledges limitations related to the model's reliance on geometric attributes and its inability to account for external factors like weather conditions. This research underscores the importance of bridging the gap between theoretical research and practical application, with the aim of enhancing safety and the overall user experience in real-world driving scenarios.

AB In this study, an integrated path tracking control framework is proposed for the independent-driven autonomous electric vehicles. The proposed control scheme includes three parts: the non-linear model predictive path tracking controller, the lateral stability controller, and the optimal torque vectoring controller. Firstly, the upper bound speed limit is regulated based on the known curvature and adhesion coefficient of the road to prevent the tyre saturation. The model predictive controller generates the steering angle and the desired longitudinal force for path tracking. Simultaneously, the lateral stability controller calculates the desired yaw moment to balance the vehicle stability and motility under different situations. Finally, the optimal torque vectoring controller distributes the wheel torques to generate the desired longitudinal force and yaw moment. Three test cases are designed and verified based on a Carsim/Simulink platform to evaluate the control performance. The test results illustrate that the proposed control framework has satisfactory path tracking performance, and the desired balance between vehicle mobility and stability is achieved under different road conditions.

AB Safe and efficient decision-making and path planning is a challenging problem for autonomous driving in highway because of numerous dynamic vehicles around the ego-vehicle. For ego-vehicle driving on structured roads, behavioral decisions tend to pay more attention to the relative distribution of its surrounding vehicles, while path planning based on the decision requires more detailed consideration of vehicle model and lane curvature. Therefore, these two modules are separated in our article and executed successively in different coordinate systems. Specifically, we create a decision topology for lane changing or following decision based on spatio-temporal lane-change gaps in relative moving coordinate, which consists of the node representing the gap and the edges representing the connectivity between two gaps. Combining the decision topology with the behaviors of surrounding dynamic vehicles, a local cost map is generated and the target decision gap is selected. Once the decision is done, a smooth and safe trajectory from the ego-vehicle to the target decision gap, that satisfies the constraints of acceleration and curvature, is obtained in the geodetic coordinate through polynomial trajectory generation. The real-time performance and effectiveness of this method were verified in the dynamic high-speed interaction scenarios.

AB In this article, the design of a rational decision support system (RDSS) for a connected and autonomous vehicle charging infrastructure (CAV-CI) is studied. In the considered CAV-CI, the distribution system operator (DSO) deploys electric vehicle supply equipment (EVSE) to provide an electrical vehicle (EV) charging facility for human-driven connected vehicles (CVs) and AVs. The charging request by the human-driven EV becomes irrational when it demands more energy and charging period than its actual need. Therefore, the scheduling policy of each EVSE must be adaptively accumulated the irrational charging request to satisfy the charging demand of both CVs and autonomous vehicles (AVs). To tackle this, we formulate an RDSS problem for the DSO, where the objective is to maximize the charging capacity utilization by satisfying the laxity risk of the DSO. Thus, we devise a rational reward maximization problem to adapt the irrational behavior by CVs in a data-informed manner. We propose a novel risk adversarial multiagent learning system (RAMALS) for CAV-CI to solve the formulated RDSS problem. In RAMALS, the DSO acts as a centralized risk adversarial agent (RAA) for informing the laxity risk to each EVSE. Subsequently, each EVSE plays the role of a self-learner agent to adaptively schedule its own EV sessions by coping advice from RAA. The experiment results show that the proposed RAMALS affords around 46.6% improvement in charging rate, about 28.6% improvement in the EVSE's active charging time, and at least 33.3% more energy utilization, as compared to a currently deployed ACN EVSE system, and other baselines.

AB Planning the path of an autonomous, agile vehicle in a dynamic environment is a very complex problem, especially when the vehicle is required to use its full maneuvering capabilities. Recent efforts aimed at using randomized algorithms for planning the path of kinematic and dynamic vehicles have demonstrated considerable potential for implementation on future autonomous platforms. This paper builds upon these efforts by proposing a randomized path planning architecture for dynamical systems in the presence of fixed and moving obstacles. This architecture addresses the dynamic constraints on the vehicle's motion, and it provides at the same time a consistent decoupling between low-level control and motion planning. The path planning algorithm retains the convergence properties of its kinematic counterparts. System safety is also addressed in the face of finite computation times by analyzing the behavior of the algorithm when the available onboard computation resources are limited, and the planning must be performed in real time. The proposed algorithm can be applied to vehicles whose dynamics are described either by ordinary differential equations or by higher-level, hybrid representations. Simulation examples involving a ground robot and a small autonomous helicopter are presented and discussed.

AB Several mobility-related issues persist in and around urban areas. Autonomous vehicles promise substantial environmental, safety, and economic benefits but may also cause unintended adverse effects that stem from single-passenger mobility becoming more affordable and accessible. While using them for public transport (i.e., autonomous shuttles) can help avoid such downsides, there are many challenges to their adoption, particularly ones that are related to citizen acceptance and economic aspects. Based on a novel survey of Brussels' citizens, we provide insights from user opinions on last-mile autonomous shuttle services and analyze the effect of various attitudinal and socio-demographic factors affecting such acceptance. Our respondents exhibit an overall positive acceptance albeit with a limited willingness to pay for it. In addition, based on expert interviews, we provide a discussion on appropriate business models and policy recommendations to help ensure the timely adoption of AVs in Belgium that adapts to mobility needs and policy goals.

AB Although recent studies of autonomous taxis (ATs) have begun to explore potential environmental implications of fleet deployment, little is known about their impacts over the long term. We present a life-cycle assessment framework that incorporates both direct and indirect effects of ATs at the subsystem, vehicle, and mobility-system levels. Eco-driving and intersection connectivity are the direct effects analyzed along with indirect effects that include empty kilometers, parking, charging infrastructure, powertrain rightsizing, electric vehicle adoption, ride-sharing, and fleet-turnover rates. A case study of an AT fleet in Austin, Texas from 2020 to 2050 with constant travel demand indicates the strategic deployment of an electrified AT fleet can reduce cumulative energy and greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions by 60% in the base case, with a majority of this benefit resulting from electrified powertrains. Further reductions up to 87% can be achieved with accelerated electrical grid decarbonization, dynamic ride-share, longer vehicle lifetime, more energy efficient computer systems, and faster fuel efficiency improvements for new vehicles. We highlight the major opportunities for maximizing the environmental performance of AT fleets over the long term.

AB Interest from industry and policy makers on the use of autonomous goods vehicles (AGVs) for commercial use, has increased rapidly as the underlying technology has developed. This study looks at the potential impact of autonomous road haulage on logistics operations and barriers for commercial implementation in the UK. The research focuses on large goods vehicles, capable of automated driving, where the driver is not required for some or all of the journey, for logistics operations between suppliers, manufacturing plant, and retailer. The data is collected through semi-structured interviews and scoring questionnaires. All 76 participants had experience working in the logistics industry, from various parts of the operations process. The data was analysed using thematic analysis followed with the results subsequently ranked by participants to identify the importance and perceived impact. Results revealed a near-term barrier for adoption of autonomous technology, is the lack of standardisation, as technology is progressing in many different directions, with little consultation on what features are needed or how they will be implemented. The findings show the main impact of commercialisation of autonomous road haulage are overall maintenance cost reduction, due to less wear and tear, and operational cost reduction, especially for long-haul journeys, as vehicles can operate for longer hours. Moreover, despite barriers in the short term, such as public acceptance and transition costs, these will likely be outweighed by improvements in efficiency and utilisation. Based on findings from the study, we present six key considerations for the introduction of commercial autonomous road haulage, which can be used as a guide for policy makers, insurance companies, transport planning authorities, and vehicle manufacturers.

AB The navigation of autonomous vehicles around pedestrians is a key challenge when driving in urban environments. It is essential to test the proposed navigation system using simulation before moving to real-life implementation and testing. Evaluating the performance of the system requires the design of a diverse set of tests which spans the targeted working scenarios and conditions. These tests can then undergo a process of evaluation using a set of adapted performance metrics. This work addresses the problem of performance evaluation for an autonomous vehicle in a shared space with pedestrians. The methodology for designing the test simulations is discussed. Moreover, a group of performance metrics is proposed to evaluate the different aspects of the navigation: the motion safety, the quality of the generated trajectory and the comfort of the pedestrians surrounding the vehicle. Furthermore, the success/fail criterion for each metric is discussed. The implementation of the proposed evaluation method is illustrated by evaluating the performance of a pre-designed proactive navigation system using a shared space crowd simulator under Robot Operating System (ROS).

AB The development of electric vehicles (EVs) and autonomous vehicles (AVs) has made great progress and been expected to play an important role in a future transport system. Some researchers have explored the potential impacts of autonomous electric vehicles (AEVs), while few have focused on the public attitude towards AEVs. This paper aims to understand the public acceptance of AEVs through the application of Technology Acceptance Model. Considering the potential environmental benefits of AEVs, this study concentrates on how environmental concern affects AEVs acceptance. Data is collected from an online survey in China and analyzed by a structural model. The results indicate that green perceived usefulness, perceived ease of use and environmental concern have a positive relationship with people's intentions to use AEVs. Environmental concern poses a powerful indirect effect on using intention through mediating effects. Implications for improving the public acceptance of AEVs and suggestions for further research are given correspondingly in this study. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Transportation system is facing a sharp disruption since the Connected Autonomous Vehicles (CAVs) can free people from driving and provide good driving experience with the aid of Vehicle-to-Vehicle (V2V) communications. Although CAVs bring benefits in terms of driving safety, vehicle string stability, and road traffic throughput, most existing work aims at improving only one of these performance metrics. However, these metrics may be mutually competitive, as they share the same communication and computing resource in a road segment. From the perspective of joint optimizing driving safety, vehicle string stability, and road traffic throughput, there is a big research gap to be filled on the resource management for connected autonomous driving. In this paper, we first explore the joint optimization on driving safety, vehicle string stability, and road traffic throughput by leveraging on the consensus Alternating Directions Method of Multipliers algorithm (ADMM). However, the limited communication bandwidth and on-board processing capacity incur the resource competition in CAVs. We next analyze the multiple tasks competition in the contention based medium access to attain the upper bound delay of V2V-related application offloading. An efficient sleeping multi-armed bandit tree-based algorithm is proposed to address the resource assignment problem. A series of simulation experiments are carried out to validate the performance of the proposed algorithms.

AB This article investigates the three-dimensional formation tracking control problem of leader-follower autonomous underwater vehicles with input saturation under uncertain nonlinearities. For this purpose, a saturated formation tracking controller is developed by using the generalized saturation functions. This technique can effectively prevent actuators saturation and improve the transient performance of the presented control system. A nonlinear velocity observer is also designed to estimate the velocity signals of followers. Then, an estimation model based on the neural adaptive robust techniques is proposed to deal with the uncertain nonlinearities, such as unknown model dynamics, environmental disturbances, and approximation errors. A Lyapunov-based stability analysis is provided to guarantee that all signals of the closed-loop system are uniformly ultimately bounded. Finally, the reliability and robustness of the presented controller are demonstrated through simulations.

AB Different driving styles should be considered in path planning for autonomous vehicles that are travelling alongside other traditional vehicles in the same traffic scene. Based on the drivers' characteristics and artificial potential field (APF), an improved local path planning algorithm is proposed in this paper. A large amount of driver data are collected through tests and classified by the K-means algorithm. A Keras neural network model is trained by using the above data. APF is combined with driver characteristic identification. The distances between the vehicle and obstacle are normalized. The repulsive potential field functions are designed according to different driver characteristics and road boundaries. The designed local path planning method can adapt to different surrounding manual driving vehicles. The proposed human-like decision path planning method is compared with the traditional APF planning method. Simulation tests of an individual driver and various drivers with different characteristics in overtaking scenes are carried out. The simulation results show that the curves of human-like decision-making path planning method are more reasonable than those of the traditional APF path planning method; the proposed method can carry out more effective path planning for autonomous vehicles according to the different driving styles of surrounding manual vehicles.

AB Self-driving cars do not sound like a part of science fiction movies anymore. With most of the automobile giants committed to launching their autonomous cars as soon as possible, it is expected that self-driving cars will hit the road in a very short time. Increasing the penetration factor of autonomous vehicles will need algorithms to control them in an efficient way in different scenarios. One such scenario is intersection management (IM). We propose an intuitive heuristic to resolve space-time conflicts in vehicle's trip, enabling vehicles to cross the intersection safely, and with minimum delay. The intersection is modeled as a group of conflict points where intersecting internal links cross each other. For safe and efficient scheduling of vehicles, heuristics are proposed separately for: 1) entering in approach lane; 2) safe traversal in the approach lane; 3) safe and efficient crossing of intersection; and (4) safe departure along depart lane. Vehicle scheduling is done using a three-leveled heuristic in which each level serves a distinct purpose and together guarantee collision-free passing of vehicles. Performance evaluation of the proposed scheme is done in Simulation of Urban MObility simulator and a comparative analysis is done with three other IM schemes. Experiments show that the proposed scheme gives a smaller average trip delay of vehicles compared with other IM schemes.

AB The solar-powered autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) may have unlimited autonomous capability in time and be an efficient tool to explore the ocean. The performances of solar powered AUV, evidently, depend on available solar energy. The low efficiency of industrially produced solar panels (10-16%) affords sufficient amounts of energy at low latitudes, but does not at hi-h latitudes of about 60degrees and more. On the contrary, available wave energy distribution increases with latitude. A similar relation of solar and wave energies occurs regarding their seasonal variations. Hence, the combination of solar and wave energies promises more efficient use of the vehicle at all latitudes over the whole year. Converters of wave energy to electrical energy are usually cumbersome mechanical structures unsuitable for installation on an AUV. In this sense, it is more reasonable to use wave energy to aid the vehicle's motion. In this case a very fortunate situation occurs. It was shown that the best shape for a solar vehicle is a wing. At the same time it is possible to transform wave oscillations to forward movement using three wings, fixed on the hull of the vehicle. In this way, the demands of efficient solar-powered and wave-driven vehicles fully coincide. These relationships are considered in the paper and some resulting data are given.

AB Optimization problems for trajectory planning in autonomous vehicle racing are characterized by their nonlinearity and nonconvexity. Instead of solving these optimization problems, usually a convex approximation is solved instead to achieve a high update rate. We present a real-time-capable model predictive control (MPC) trajectory planner based on a nonlinear single-track vehicle model and Pacejka's magic tire formula for autonomous vehicle racing. After formulating the general nonconvex trajectory optimization problem, we form a convex approximation using sequential convex programming (SCP). The state of the art convexifies track constraints using sequential linearization (SL), which is a method of relaxing the constraints. Solutions to the relaxed optimization problem are not guaranteed to be feasible in the nonconvex optimization problem. We propose sequential convex restriction (SCR) as a method to convexify track constraints. SCR guarantees that resulting solutions are feasible in the nonconvex optimization problem. We show recursive feasibility of solutions to the restricted optimization problem. The MPC is evaluated on a scaled version of the Hockenheimring racing track in simulation. The results show that MPC using SCR yields faster lap times than MPC using SL, while still being real-time capable.

AB The development of autonomous driving cars is a complex activity, which poses challenges about ethics, safety, cybersecurity, and social acceptance. The latter, in particular, poses new problems since passengers are used to manually driven vehicles; hence, they need to move their trust from a person to a computer. To smooth the transition towards autonomous vehicles, a delicate calibration of the driving functions should be performed, making the automation decision closest to the passengers' expectations. The complexity of this calibration lies in the presence of a person in the loop: different settings of a given algorithm should be evaluated by assessing the human reaction to the vehicle decisions. With this work, we for an objective method to classify the people's reaction to vehicle decisions. By adopting machine learning techniques, it is possible to analyze the passengers' emotions while driving with alternative vehicle calibrations. Through the analysis of these emotions, it is possible to obtain an objective metric about the comfort feeling of the passengers. As a result, we developed a proof-of-concept implementation of a simple, yet effective, emotions recognition system. It can be deployed either into real vehicles or simulators, during the driving functions calibration.

AB Model predictive controller (MPC) has demonstrated its competency in controlling autonomous vehicles. But to apply the current MPC-based schemes, it has to be formulated into certain formats and meet all prerequisites in order to fit the optimization solvers. To eliminate the gaps, in this paper, we propose a nonlinear MPC controller which controls the vehicle velocity and steering simultaneously. The optimization solver is based on genetic algorithms (GA). As compared to other solvers, using GA in the optimization enables a more flexible structure for MPC formulation. The cost function and constraints can be designed in a more accurate, meaningful, and direct way. Both simulation and on-field test results showed that the vehicle under the control of the proposed nonlinear MPC is able to follow the road center line accurately and consistently, even at sharp corners. Moreover, the results also showed that passengers' safety and comfort can be well taken care of under the proposed MPC scheme as both the vehicle movement acceleration and steering acceleration are well confined within a safety range. The promising results indicate that the proposed GA-based nonlinear MPC can be a suitable solution to autonomous vehicle control.

AB To improve the stability of the autonomous vehicle for high speed tracking, a vehicle estimator scheme integrated into a path-tracking system has been proposed in this paper. Vehicle stability is related to road condition (low road adhesion, high road adhesion, and changing road adhesion) and vehicle state, thus a state observer has been preferred in this paper to estimate vehicle state and tire-road friction as a means of judging vehicle stabilization. For the approach to the estimation, an unscented Kalman filter (UKF) employing a three degrees-of-freedom vehicle model combined with a Magic Formula (MF) tire model was designed. As a widely used model control method, the multi-constraints model predictive control (MMPC) was proposed and that was then used to calculate the desired front steering angle for tracking the planned path. The performance of the MMPC controller, with the estimator, was evaluated by the vehicle simulation software CARSIM and Matlab/Simulink. The simulation results show that the designed MMPC controller with the estimator successfully performs path-tracking at high speed for the intelligent vehicle.

AB Road traffic signals and traffic infrastructure have a significant impact on the behaviour of highly automated or autonomous vehicles. However, the increase in automation does not always mean an advantage. Generally, highly automated vehicles strictly follow the traffic rules resulting in near-accident situations, although their goal is to avoid and reduce them. Malfunctions of the automated functions might cause surprising interventions while the vehicle is in motion, drivers cannot react in time and well. This paper highlights the potential danger and uncertainty of highly automated or autonomous vehicles in the context of the current conventional traffic infrastructure system. In the future, special consideration shall be given to the vehicle industry and traffic regulation makers on how the infrastructure should be adapted to automated vehicle functions to have a seamless shift towards automated driving. The paper sums up many problematic situations with two critical problems with sensitivity analysis. The first situation: the speed assist system (based on speed limit sign recognition) conflicts with the traffic infrastructure. The second situation is shown: the ACC (Adaptive Cruise Control) and LKA (Lane Assist) contradicts with the traffic infrastructure. These critical situations were investigated by using an high-fidelity automotive simulation software as proof of concept and were examined by accident reconstruction analysis software.

AB Autonomous vehicles are nowadays one of the most important technologies that will be incorporated to every day life in the next few years. One of the most promising kind of vehicles in terms of efficiency and sustainability are those known as Wing-in-Ground crafts, or WIG crafts, a family of vehicles that seize the proximity of ground to achieve a flight with low drag and high lift. However, this kind of crafts lacks of a sound theory of flight that can lead to robust control solutions that guarantees safe autonomous operation in all the cruising phases.In this paper we address the problem of controlling a WIG craft in different scenarios and using different control strategies in order to compare their performance. The tested scenarios include obstacle avoidance by fly over and recovering from a random disturbance in vehicle attitude. MPC (Model Predictive Control) is tested on the complete nonlinear model, while PID, used as baseline controller, LQR (Linear Quadratic Regulator) and adaptive LQR are tested on top of a partial feedback linearization. Results show that LQR has got the best overall performance, although it is seen that different design specifications could lead to the selection of one controller or another.

AB This paper proposes a framework for uncertainty prediction in complex fusion networks, where signals become available sporadically. Assuming there is no information of the sensor characteristics available, a surrogated model of the sensor uncertainty is yielded directly from data through artificial neural networks. The strategy developed is applied to autonomous vehicle localization through odometry sensors (speed and orientation), so as to determine the location uncertainty in the trajectory. The results obtained allow for fusion of autonomous vehicle location measurements, and effective correction of the accumulated odometry error in most scenarios. The neural networks applicability and generalization capacity are proven, evidencing the suitability of the presented methodology for uncertainty estimation in non-linear and intractable processes.

ID SECURITY
AB Driverless parking, an influential application of Mobility as a Service (MaaS) model, is one of the clear early benefits for autonomous vehicles, given often narrow spaces and multiple potential hazards (such as pedestrians stepping out from in between other vehicles). In recent years, real momentum has been building up for designing automated parking models for vehicles. However, in such an autonomous parking design, location privacy and identity privacy issues are always overlapping due to the improper sharing of data. Most existing studies barely investigate and poorly address such privacy issues. Motivated by this, we develop (and evaluate) an experience-driven, secure and privacy-aware framework of parking reservations for automated cars. Our idea of using differential privacy with zero-knowledge proof provides both security and privacy guarantees to users. Furthermore, the performance of the developed model is enhanced by exploiting reinforcement learning approach such that the utility of the system and the parking reservation rate can be maximized. Extensive evaluation demonstrates the superiority of the proposed model.

ID INTERSECTION MANAGEMENT
AB When Connected Autonomous Vehicles (CAVs) request routing in a driving environment with Autonomous Intersection Management (AIM) systems, a routing planner collects the demands and optimizes the routes in a coordinated manner to reduce the overall travel times. In practice, however, the routing demands are massive, especially in a large-scale traffic network. As a result, the centralized routing planner fails to scale out to accommodate the growing requests, causing a severe scalability issue. This paper presents a holistic solution for scalable CAV routing by enabling hierarchical cooperation and load balancing in the Multi-Access Edge Computing (MEC) environment. The proposed system cooperatively plans CAV routes and dynamically balances loads in MECs to handle massive requests. According to the experiments, our system has a 15.68X higher routing capacity than the centralized routing system, and load balancing reduces 14.51% computation time of routing. The experiments show that our system is scalable for massive autonomous vehicle routing.

AB Vehicle-to-Everything (V2X) communication enhances the capability of autonomous driving through better safety, efficiency, and comfort. In particular, sensor data sharing, known as cooperative perception, is a crucial technique to accommodate vulnerable road users in a cooperative intelligent transport system (ITS). In this paper, we describe a roadside perception unit (RSPU) that combines sensors and roadside units (RSUs) for infrastructure-based cooperative perception. We propose a software called AutoC2X that we designed to realize cooperative perception for RSPUs and vehicles. We also propose the concept of networked RSPUs, which is the inter-connection of RSPUs along a road over a wired network, and helps realize broader cooperative perception. We evaluated the RSPU system and the networked RSPUs through a field test, numerical analysis, and simulation experiments. Field evaluation showed that, even in the worst case, our RSPU system can deliver messages to an autonomous vehicle within 100 ms. The simulation result shows that the proposed priority algorithm achieves a wide perception range with a high delivery ratio and low latency, especially under heavy road traffic conditions.

TI Design and Lyapunov Stability Analysis of a Fuzzy Logic Controller for
   Autonomous Road Following
SO MATHEMATICAL PROBLEMS IN ENGINEERING
LA English
DT Article
ID VISION
AB Autonomous road following is one of the major goals in intelligent vehicle applications. The development of an autonomous road following embedded system for intelligent vehicles is the focus of this paper. A fuzzy logic controller (FLC) is designed for vision-based autonomous road following. The stability analysis of this control system is addressed. Lyapunov's direct method is utilized to formulate a class of control laws that guarantee the convergence of the steering error. Certain requirements for the control laws are presented for designers to choose a suitable rule base for the fuzzy controller in order to make the system stable. Stability of the proposed fuzzy controller is guaranteed theoretically and also demonstrated by simulation studies and experiments. Simulations using the model of the four degree of freedom nonholonomic robotic vehicle are conducted to investigate the performance of the fuzzy controller. The proposed fuzzy controller can achieve the desired steering angle and make the robotic vehicle follow the road successfully. Experiments show that the developed intelligent vehicle is able to follow a mocked road autonomously.

AB The autonomous vehicle is regarded as a promising technology with the potential to reshape mobility and solve many traffic issues, such as accessibility, efficiency, convenience, and especially safety. Many previous studies on driving strategies mainly focused on the low-level detailed driving behaviors or specific traffic scenarios but lacked the high-level driving strategy studies. Though researchers showed increasing interest in driving strategies, there still has no comprehensive answer on how to proactively implement safe driving. After analyzing several representative driving strategies, we propose three characteristic dimensions that are important to measure driving strategies: preferred objective, risk appetite, and collaborative manner. According to these three characteristic dimensions, we categorize existing driving strategies of autonomous vehicles into four kinds: defensive driving strategies, competitive driving strategies, negotiated driving strategies, and cooperative driving strategies. This paper provides a timely comparative review of these four strategies and highlights the possible directions for improving the high-level driving strategy design.

AB Underwater localization using acoustic signals is one of the main components in a navigation system for an autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) as a more accurate alternative to dead-reckoning techniques. Although different methods based on the idea of multiple beacons have been studied, other approaches use only one beacon, which reduces the system's costs and deployment complexity. The inverse approach for single-beacon navigation is to use this method for target localization by an underwater or surface vehicle. In this paper, a method of range-only target localization using a Wave Glider is presented, for which simulations and sea tests have been conducted to determine optimal parameters to minimize acoustic energy use and search time, and to maximize location accuracy and precision. Finally, a field mission is presented, where a Benthic Rover (an autonomous seafloor vehicle) is localized and tracked using minimal human intervention. This mission shows, as an example, the power of using autonomous vehicles in collaboration for oceanographic research.

AB Autonomous driving technologies are advancing rapidly, and determining when consumers ride in driverless vehicles on a daily basis is becoming essential. Using choice experiments, first, we elicit consumers' willingness to pay (WTP) for autonomous driving systems in Japan along with their WTP for hybrid and electric engines. We found in this study that the Japanese consumers' WTP is, on average, lower than the estimates for the US market and is not sufficient to enable autonomous vehicles (AVs) to capture a meaningful share of the existing car market. Second, compared with a previous study in the US, we propose and discuss an expected social dilemma caused by the ethical problems that AVs will face, known as the Trolley Problems. We find that social dilemma may occur because people tend not want to buy "moral" AVs. Third, we explored the determinants of the WTP and social dilemma to find that the credibility of AVs is determined to be a critical factor for the social dilemma.

AB Autonomous vehicles are revolutionizing transport and next-generation autonomous mobility. Such vehicles are promising to increase road safety, improve traffic efficiency, reduce vehicle emission, and improve mobility. However, for these vehicles to live up to their full potentials, there are significant research, technological and urgent organizational issues that need to be addressed to reach the highest level of automation, i.e., level 5. Sensors, communication, mobile edge computing, machine learning, data analytic, distributed learning, and so on, are examples of the building blocks technologies and concepts constituting the end-to-end solution. This survey discusses these technologies and concepts and maps their roles to the end-to-end solution. It highlights the challenges for each technology. Moreover, this survey provides an analysis of different solution approaches proposed by relevant stakeholders, utilizing these technologies aiming to achieve level-5 autonomy. Finally, the article details two use cases to present the interplay of the building blocks technologies.

AB Path planning research plays a vital role in terms of safety and comfort in autonomous driving systems. This paper focuses on safe driving and comfort riding through path planning in autonomous driving applications and proposes autonomous driving path planning through an optimal controller integrating obstacle-dependent Gaussian (ODG) and model prediction control (MPC). The ODG algorithm integrates the information from the sensors and calculates the risk factors in the driving environment. The MPC function finds vehicle control signals close to the objective function under limited conditions, such as the structural shape of the vehicle and road driving conditions. The proposed method provides safe control and minimizes vehicle shaking due to the tendency to respond to avoid obstacles quickly. We conducted an experiment using mobile robots, similar to an actual vehicle, to verify the proposed algorithm performance. The experimental results show that the average safety metric is 72.34%, a higher ISO-2631 comport score than others, while the average processing time is approximately 14.2 ms/frame.

AB Automated Driving Systems (ADSs) require robust and scalable control systems in order to achieve a safe, efficient and comfortable driving experience. Most global planners for autonomous vehicles provide as output a sequence of waypoints to be followed. This paper proposes a modular and scalable waypoint tracking controller for Robot Operating System (ROS)-based autonomous guided vehicles. The proposed controller performs a smooth interpolation of the waypoints and uses optimal control techniques to ensure robust trajectory tracking even at high speeds in urban environments (up to 50 km/h). The delays in the localization system and actuators are compensated in the control loop to stabilize the system. Forward velocity is adapted to path characteristics using a velocity profiler. The controller has been implemented as an ROS package providing scalability and exportability to the system in order to be used with a wide variety of simulators and real vehicles. We show the results of this controller using the novel and hyper realistic CARLA Simulator and carrying out a comparison with other standard and state-of-art trajectory tracking controllers.

AB In this letter, we present a learning-based control approach for autonomous racing with an application to the AMZ Driverless race car gotthard. One major issue in autonomous racing is that accurate vehicle models that cover the entire performance envelope of a race car are highly nonlinear, complex, and complicated to identify, rendering them impractical for control. To address this issue, we employ a relatively simple nominal vehicle model, which is improved based on measurement data and tools from machine learning.The resulting formulation is an online learning data-driven model predictive controller, which uses Gaussian processes regression to take residual model uncertainty into account and achieve safe driving behavior. To improve the vehicle model online, we select from a constant in-flow of data points according to a criterion reflecting the information gain, and maintain a small dictionary of 300 data points. The framework is tested on the full-size AMZ Driverless race car, where it is able to improve the vehicle model and reduce lap times by 10% while maintaining safety of the vehicle.

AB This paper focusses on the hydrodynamic performance of an unmanned vehicle system, consisting of a remotely operated underwater vehicle (ROV) that has to be launched and recovered autonomously from an Autonomous Surface Vehicles (ASV). The hydrodynamic model of the ASV/ROV coupled system is described in detail and solved numerically. The paper seeks to assess the overall performance of the ASV/ROV system, including the stability of the ASV, the ROV tidal current capacity and the required power of the launch and recovery winch system. The results demonstrate that this ASV/ROV system can complete the launch, holding and recovery tasks meeting stability for the given winch power requirements. The tidal current capacity of the ROV decreases with a larger target water depth. The maximum ROV umbilical tension is observed during steep wave instances when the ROV is in proximity to the ASV. A down-control force is demonstrated to be a suitable solution to limit the maximum tension within the umbilical rated force limits. This paper presents the methods and considerations for working towards a fully autonomous ASV/ROV system capable of autonomous inspection and maintenance missions. The work will be useful for practitioners and researcher working on autonomous offshore systems.

TI Safe Autonomy Under Perception Uncertainty Using Chance-Constrained
   Temporal Logic
SO JOURNAL OF AUTOMATED REASONING
LA English

DE Autonomy; Temporal logic; Safe Control
ID VEHICLES; SYSTEMS
AB Autonomous vehicles have found wide-ranging adoption in aerospace, terrestrial as well as marine use. These systems often operate in uncertain environments and in the presence of noisy sensors, and use machine learning and statistical sensor fusion algorithms to form an internal model of the world that is inherently probabilistic. Autonomous vehicles need to operate using this uncertain world-model, and hence, their correctness cannot be deterministically specified. Even once probabilistic correctness is specified, proving that an autonomous vehicle will operate correctly is a challenging problem. In this paper, we address these challenges by proposing a correct-by-synthesis approach to autonomous vehicle control. We propose a probabilistic extension of temporal logic, named Chance Constrained Temporal Logic (C2TL), that can be used to specify correctness requirements in presence of uncertainty. C2TL extends temporal logic by including chance constraints as predicates in the formula which allows modeling of perception uncertainty while retaining its ease of reasoning. We present a novel automated synthesis technique that compiles C2TL specification into mixed integer constraints, and uses second-order (quadratic) cone programming to synthesize optimal control of autonomous vehicles subject to the C2TL specification. We also present a risk distribution approach that enables synthesis of plans with lower cost without increasing the overall risk. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach on a diverse set of illustrative examples.

AB Due to the rapidly growing number of autonomous vehicles, establishing an intelligent transportation system (ITS) supported by the Internet-of-Vehicles (IoV) technology is important. The need for IoV technology is emphasized even more because recent accidents relating to autonomous vehicles show that there are limitations in the reliability of autonomous vehicles only using vehicle onboard sensors. In addition, a highly reliable support system for many vehicular applications is in strong demand, which is why there is a need for advanced vehicle-to-everything (V2X) technology. The two major types of V2X technology are dedicated short-range communication (DSRC) and cellular-V2X (C-V2X). Many vehicles are already equipped with DSRC; however, the use of C-V2X is highly supported by many mobile communication companies and the 5GAA, which is why C-V2X is expected to be very widely used. In this article, a hybrid V2X (H-V2X) scheme is proposed, which adaptively controls C-V2X to satisfy the key-performance indicator (KPI) requirements as much as possible, and uses DSRC transmission when the C-V2X required performance cannot be reliably supported. The performance analysis graphs show that the gain in performance of the proposed H-V2X scheme can provide an improved performance compared to other V2X schemes, which makes it more suitable to support reliable autonomous vehicles.

AB Due to the complexity of underwater environment, the navigation of autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) is affected by current. Although some traditional methods can plan the non-collision path for AUV to reach the destination, it cannot overcome the influence of current on AUV navigation. In order to solve this problem, a velocity vector synthesis method combining belief function (BF) method is proposed. Among them, the BF method is used to dynamically plan the non-collision path. The velocity vector synthesis method is used to adjust the AUVs movement direction to offset the effect of time-varying current. The simulation results show that the proposed algorithm is effective and can overcome the problem of 'current influence'. At the same time, compared with other methods, the proposed algorithm can guide AUV to achieve more efficient and adaptive path planning.

AB The usage of the Internet of Things (IoT) in the field of transportation appears to have immense potential. Intelligent vehicle systems can exchange seamless information to assist cars to ensure better traffic control and road safety. The dynamic topology of this network, connecting a large number of vehicles, makes it vulnerable to several threats like authentication, data integrity, confidentiality, etc. These threats jeopardize the safety of vehicles, riders, and the entire system. Researchers are developing several approaches to combat security threats in connected and autonomous vehicles. Artificial Intelligence is being used by both scientists and hackers for protecting and attacking the networks, respectively. Nevertheless, wirelessly coupled cars on the network are in constant peril. This motivated us to develop an intrusion detection model that can be run in low-end devices with low processing and memory capacity and can prevent security threats and protect the connected vehicle network. This research paper presents an Attention-enabled Hierarchical Deep Neural Network (AHDNN) as a solution to detect intrusion and ensure autonomous vehicles' security both at the nodes and at the network level. The proposed AHDNN framework has a very low false negative rate of 0.012 ensuring a very low rate of missing an intrusion in normal communication. This enables enhanced security in vehicular networks.

AB This paper deals with the trajectory following control problem of a class of autonomous vehicles with parametric uncertainties, external disturbances, and over-actuated features. A novel adaptive hierarchical control framework is proposed to supervise the lateral motion of autonomous four-wheel independent drive electric vehicles. First, an adaptive sliding mode high-level control law with the linear matrix inequality-based switching surface is designed to produce a vector of front steering angle and external yaw moment, in which the uncertain term and the switching control gain are adaptively regulated by the fuzzy logic technique, to further moderate the chattering phenomenon, an adaptive boundary layer is introduced. Second, a pseudoinverse low-level control allocation algorithm is presented to optimally allocate the external yaw moment via coordinating and reconstructing the tire longitudinal forces. Finally, numerical simulation and experimental results demonstrate that the proposed adaptive control approach has outstanding tracking performance.

TI SOTIF-Oriented Perception Evaluation Method for Forward Obstacle
   Detection of Autonomous Vehicles

   ability; safety of the intended functionality (SOTIF)
ID WIRELESS SENSOR NETWORKS; CALIBRATION; DEPLOYMENT
AB The inclusion of autonomous vehicles into our society requires not only mature automated technologies but also adequate confidence in safety guarantees. Safety of the intended functionality (SOTIF) is an incipient important field that focuses on risk led by performance limitations rather than faults. There are still plenty of gaps in addressing it, especially when concerning perception ability. This article introduces a method to evaluate SOTIF-oriented perception effectiveness for forward obstacle detection of autonomous vehicles. Both inevitable existence uncertainty and state uncertainty in perception results are taken into account, and a formal SOTIF requirement specification is defined. Based on the safety distance model, we further deduce the minimum required perception area and the perception error requirements under a given driving situation to refine the SOTIF requirement specification. Then, a SOTIF-oriented unified sensing model is established by combining sensing space and ability characteristics. The system-level perception ability of an autonomous vehicle is subsequently deduced with the assumption that every available sensor is described in the form of our proposed sensing model. Evaluation can be executed according to the above methods that support determining the SOTIF requirements and the system-level perception ability, and the entire evaluation process is presented as an algorithm in this article. Finally, a practical case generated according to a well-known autonomous vehicle prototype is used to prove the effectiveness of the method. Evaluation results can serve as suggestions to improve the overall SOTIF level for perception.

AB When designing a controller for the autonomous vehicle system, safety and trajectory tracking performance are two major concerns. This letter proposes a novel control design for an autonomous vehicle system with nonaffine control inputs that can track the desired trajectories while considering the safety constraint. First, the vehicle dynamics is modeled using the differential flatness approach. The dynamic inversion method is then employed for the trajectory tracking of a nonaffine-in control system, and a control barrier function (CBF) approach is utilized to enforce the safety constraint. The trajectory tracking control is handled as a least-squares optimization problem, while the CBF is considered as a constraint. By relaxing the CBF constraint to the cost function, the novel control design is derived via a dynamic inversion. The safety and the stability of the closed-loop system are analyzed using a singular perturbation method. The proposed method is validated using numerical simulation and the high-fidelity car simulator under realistic driving scenarios.

ID RESOURCES
AB This study describes and presents preliminary experimental results from a novel prototype energy scavenging system installed in a model 2m cylindrical autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV). The system, which is based on control moment gyroscope principles, utilises the gyroscopic response of a gimballed flywheel mounted within an AUV body to generate energy from the wave induced rotational motions of the vehicle. This method, using the reaction of a spinning wheel under an input torque to provide an output torque of greater magnitude, orthogonal to the input torque axis and the spin axis provides a means to harvest energy in-situ, without external appendages and additional hydrodynamic drag. The system promises to extend AUV mission durations indefinitely and reduce support vessel time currently required for periodical recharging and redeployment. A description of the system operation, design and experimental results from a series of regular wave tests conducted at zero speed in a towing tank are presented in this study. The results show that the system can harvest energy, with the greatest power generation around resonance, tailing off as the frequency increases and typically non-linear in nature. The system could potentially be applied to any rotationally excited platform e.g. autonomous surface vessels, buoys or boats

AB The paper describes the possibilities of enhancing the performance of autonomous vehicles by interacting with the surrounding environment. Benefits and drawbacks of the use of different sensors and strategies for integrating the acquired knowledge are examined in an example case of a 'through partly closed door' navigation task for an AGV. This illustrates the increased ability of sensors to acquire knowledge by actively doing explorative actions. A combined mechanical actuation and probing device accentuates the sense-act paradigm.
   The theory and algorithms used are described in detail, and extensive experiments with an implementation of the 'through door' navigation algorithm on our nonholonomic test-bed Autonomous Guided Vehicle are documented.

AB The DARPA Urban Challenge was a competition to develop autonomous vehicles capable of safely, reliably, and robustly driving in traffic. hi this article we introduce Boss, the autonomous vehicle that won the challenge. Boss is a complex artificially intelligent software system embodied hi a 2007 Chevy Tahoe. To navigate safely, the vehicle builds a model of the world around it in real time. This model is used to generate safe routes a;id motion plans both on roads and in unstructured zones. An essential part of Boss's success stems from its ability to safely handle both abnormal situations and system glitches.

AB This study examines the potential changes in residential location choice in a scenario where shared autonomous vehicles (SAVs) are a popular mode of travel in the Atlanta metropolitan area. This hypothetical study is based on an agent-based simulation approach, which integrates residential location choice models with a SAV simulation model. The coupled model simulates future home location choices given current home location preferences and real estate development patterns. The results indicate that commuters may relocate to neighborhoods with better public schools and more amenities due to reductions in commute costs.

AB The ability to land on the seafloor expands the envelope of tasks that underwater vehicles can carry out during survey and inspection. However, even though remotely operated vehicles routinely land during their operations, autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) lack the sensing and data processing capabilities needed to identify safe, stable landing sites. Here, an algorithm is developed that uses millimeter-resolution (mm-resolution) bathymetry to detect regions where an AUV of known geometry can safely and stably land on the seafloor. The algorithm uses physical models that consider vehicle geometry, seafloor slope, roughness, friction, and currents. It can identify the most suitable of multiple candidate sites based on a landing cost function. The performance of the algorithm is evaluated using seafloor bathymetry data that was obtained using an AUV equipped with a high-resolution laser mapping system on the slopes of the Takuyo Daigo seamount in the Northwest Pacific. The algorithm successfully identified multiple landing sites along a 500-m transect on the slopes of the surveyed seamount. The study demonstrates that safe, reliable AUV landing operation is feasible in actual seafloor environments.

AB People with disabilities face many travel barriers. Autonomous vehicles and services may be one solution. The purpose of this project was to conduct a systematic review of the grey and scientific literature on autonomous vehicles for people with disabilities. Scientific evidence (n = 35) was limited to four observational studies with a very low level of evidence, qualitative studies, reviews, design and model reports, and policy proposals. Literature on older adults was most prevalent. Grey literature (n = 37) spanned a variety of media and sources and focuses on a variety of disability and impairment types. Results highlight opportunities and barriers to accessible and usable AVs and services, outline research gaps to set a future research agenda, and identify implications for policy and knowledge translation. People with disabilities are a diverse group, and accessible and usable design solutions will therefore need to be tailored to each group's needs, circumstances, and preferences. Future research in diverse disability groups should include more participatory action design and engineering studies and higher quality, prospective experimental studies to evaluate outcomes of accessible and usable AV technology. Studies will need to address not only all vehicle features but also the entire travel journey.

AB Connected and autonomous vehicle (CAV) technologies are likely to be gradually implemented over time. In this paper, an adaptive cruise control, named Smart Driver Model (SDM), is proposed to describe the autonomous vehicles flow. The stability criteria is proposed for SDM to judge the stability of homogeneous traffic flow. Numerical simulations were conducted to verify the results of the theoretical analysis. Single-lane vehicle dynamics in a traffic stream with connected and autonomous vehicles are simulated by varying model parameters. Simulation results are consistent with the results of linear stability analysis. As a result, a set of parameters is proposed to investigate the stabilization effect of the proposed model on homogeneous traffic flow considering realistic driving cycle and cut-in condition. By simulating a platoon with a lead vehicle which follows the Urban Dynamometer Driving Schedule (UDDS), we find out that the proposed model can stabilize the traffic flow with proposed parameters. The results from simulation and linear stability analysis show that SDM outperforms the IDM-ACC and the ACC proposed by Milanes and Shladover in terms of stabilization effect on homogeneous traffic flow. The simulation result shows that the SDM-equipped vehicles are able to stabilize the homogeneous traffic flow under cut-in condition.

AB Autonomous vehicles (AVs) allow new ways of regulating the traffic flow on road networks. Most of available results in this direction are based on microscopic approaches, where ODEs describe the evolution of regular cars and AVs. In this paper, we propose a multiscale approach, based on recently developed models for moving bottlenecks. Our main result is the proof of existence of solutions for time-varying bottleneck speed, which corresponds to open-loop controls with bounded variation. (C) 2020 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

Fractional split multinomial logit and system dynamics modeling approaches are integrated to create a novel hybrid simulation model to process data from 929 metro/micropolitan areas in the U.S. for transportation mode choice behavior. The results show that the adoption of autonomous electric vehicles can reduce greenhouse gas emissions by up to 34% of the total emissions from transportation by 2050. This study has revealed that transportation-related impacts can only be reduced with a paradigm shift in the current practices of today's transportation industry, with disruptive reforms of automation, electrification, and shared transport.

TI Coherent detection-based photonic radar for autonomous vehicles under

ID COMMUNICATION-SYSTEMS
AB Autonomous vehicles are regarded as future transport mechanisms that drive the vehicles without the need of drivers. The photonic-based radar technology is a promising candidate for delivering attractive applications to autonomous vehicles such as self-parking assistance, navigation, recognition of traffic environment, etc. Alternatively, microwave radars are not able to meet the demand of next-generation autonomous vehicles due to its limited bandwidth availability. Moreover, the performance of microwave radars is limited by atmospheric fluctuation which causes severe attenuation at higher frequencies. In this work, we have developed coherent-based frequency-modulated photonic radar to detect target locations with longer distance. Furthermore, the performance of the proposed photonic radar is investigated under the impact of various atmospheric weather conditions, particularly fog and rain. The reported results show the achievement of significant signal to noise ratio (SNR) and received power of reflected echoes from the target for the proposed photonic radar under the influence of bad weather conditions. Moreover, a conventional radar is designed to establish the effectiveness of the proposed photonic radar by considering similar parameters such as frequency and sweep time.

AB Car-sharing, electrification, and autonomous driving are greatly revolutionizing the future of the transportation system. This study proposes a location routing problem for the car-sharing system with autonomous electric vehicles to determine optimal station location and vehicle routing, where each station is both a depot and a charging station. A mathematical model is formulated and then extended to three variants, while simultaneously considering different recharging and service options. The proposed mixed-integer nonlinear models are separately solved by general algebraic modeling system (GAMS) and genetic algorithm (GA), and the efficiency of the GA is demonstrated. The comparative experimental results of instances are presented, and the benefits of allowing partial recharge are obtained. More significant savings in cost can be achieved if partial service is simultaneously allowed. Furthermore, the trade-off between the operator's interests and the interests of users, as well as the operator's immediate profits and future profits, are explored through sensitivity analysis.

AB Autonomous driving is undergoing huge developments nowadays. It is expected that its implementation will bring many benefits. Autonomous cars must deal with tasks at different levels. Although some of them are currently solved, and perception systems provide quite an accurate and complete description of the environment, high-level decisions are hard to obtain in challenging scenarios. Moreover, they must comply with safety, reliability and predictability requirements, road user acceptance, and comfort specifications. This paper presents a path planning algorithm based on potential fields. Potential models are adjusted so that their behavior is appropriate to the environment and the dynamics of the vehicle and they can face almost any unexpected scenarios. The response of the system considers the road characteristics (e.g., maximum speed, lane line curvature, etc.) and the presence of obstacles and other users. The algorithm has been tested on an automated vehicle equipped with a GPS receiver, an inertial measurement unit and a computer vision system in real environments with satisfactory results.

The structural conditions of fault detectability and isolability are obtained directly from the bond graph using the properties of the bicausality and the causal path. It is shown that the monitorability analysis using bond graph is automatically deduced using this unified tool, with respect to the detectability and isolability conditions. A real mechatronic system application of intelligent autonomous vehicle is given to show the efficiency and the simplicity analysis of the proposed approach.

AB Path planning technology is an important guarantee for the safe navigation of autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) in water, and it is also an important indicator of the intelligence of autonomous underwater vehicle. Aiming at the path planning problem of AUV in complex environments, this article presents a reinforcement learning-based tuna swarm optimization algorithm called the QLTSO. In this algorithm, individuals are independent of each other, and the choice of each individual strategy is decided by reinforcement learning. Four strategies are set for each individual in the algorithm: spiral foraging, parabolic foraging, optimization adjustment and ESOS strategy. Finally, the cubic B-spline curve is used to smooth the path so that the autonomous underwater vehicle can better track the path. To verify the superiority of the QLTSO algorithm, the algorithm is compared with other advanced optimization algorithms. The simulation results show that the QLTSO algorithm can plan safe and effective AUV navigation paths in a variety of two-dimensional and three-dimensional complex environments with better convergence and robustness, and the planning success rate is up to 100%, which is an effective AUV path planning algorithm.(c) 2023 International Association for Mathematics and Computers in Simulation (IMACS).

AB Intelligent transportation systems (ITS) enable transportation participants to communicate with each other by sending and receiving messages, so that they can be aware of their surroundings and facilitate efficient transportation through better decision making. As an important part of ITS, autonomous vehicles can bring massive benefits by reducing traffic accidents. Correspondingly, much effort has been paid to the task of pedestrian detection, which is a fundamental task for supporting autonomous vehicles. With the progress of computational power in recent years, adopting deep learning based methods has become a trend for improving the performance of pedestrian detection. In this article, we present design guidelines on deep learning-based pedestrian detection methods for supporting autonomous vehicles. First, we will introduce classic backbone models and frameworks, and we will analyze the inherent attributes of pedestrian detection. Then, we will illustrate and analyze representative pedestrian detectors from occlusion handling, multi-scale feature extraction, multi-perspective data utilization, and hard negatives handling these four aspects. Last, we will discuss the developments and trends in this area, followed by some open challenges.

ID FRAMEWORK
AB To solve the unacceptable issue caused by the inconsistency of lane-changing behaviour between autonomous vehicles and actual drivers. A lane-changing behaviour decision-making model based on the Gauss mixture hidden Markov model (GM-HMM) is proposed according to the characteristic of a driver's lane changing behaviour. The proposed model is tested and verified based on the database of Next-Generation Simulation (NGSIM). The results show that the GM-HMM is 95.4% similar to the real driver's behaviour. To further verify the proposed model, the proposed algorithm is compared with some machine learning techniques from literature in different test scenarios. The comparison and analysis indicate that the GM-HMM method can more accurately simulate the real driver's lane-change behaviour, thus improving the trust of the passengers and other vehicles around autonomous vehicles.

TI Lane Detection and Trajectory Tracking Control of Autonomous Vehicle

DE Lane detection; Model predictive control; Trajectory tracking;

AB A novel approach of combining lane detection and model predictive control (MPC) is presented to maintain the accuracy and stability of trajectory tracking control for autonomous vehicles. For the approach, the autonomous vehicles equipped with a camera act as the research object; image recognition technology such as dynamic region of interest (ROI) extraction, edge detection and Hough straight line detection are applied to extract the lane line. Next, to track the extracted lane line, the MPC based on a three-degree-of-freedom vehicle dynamics model is constructed; and the front wheel steering angle is corrected by the fuzzy controller based on the yaw angle and the yaw rate. In order to verify the effectiveness of the designed controller, a simulation model is established based on Matlab/Simulink-Carsim. And the simulation is performed under double lane change road. The simulation results show that the root mean square error of the optimized tracking trajectory and the expected trajectory is reduced by 19.35 %, which indicates that the designed controller shows good robustness and adaptability.

SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ADVANCED ROBOTIC SYSTEMS

DE autonomous vehicles; parallel parking

AB A new method for the planning and autonomous execution of a single-trajectory, velocity-independent, parallel parking manoeuvre for autonomous vehicles is presented. The procedure commences with the identification and pre-selection of a smooth sigmoidal trajectory known as the Gompertz curve in parametric format. Trajectory parameters are determined in real-time during the path-planning phase using an optimization scheme in order to generate a candidate path. The optimization scheme takes into account the maximum steering angles that can be physically realized and checks the generated candidate trajectory for collisions. Thereafter, the trajectory is reparametrized to arc-length format using the cubic interpolation method and the vehicle orientation at every point of the trajectory is deduced. Following that, values of the steering angle(s) are determined. In the final step, the vehicle uses dead-reckoning to follows the arc-length parametrized path in reverse in order to park itself in a single-manoeuvre. The proposed method is substantiated through both extensive simulations and real sensor data.

ID CHANNEL MODELS
AB Low-speed autonomous transport of passengers and goods is expected to have a strong, positive impact on the reliability and ease of travelling. Various advanced functions of the involved vehicles rely on the wireless exchange of information with other vehicles and the roadside infrastructure, thereby benefitting from the low latency and high throughput characteristics that 5G technology has to offer. This work presents an investigation of 5G millimeter-wave communication links for a low-speed autonomous vehicle, focusing on the effects of the antenna positions on both the received signal quality and the link performance. It is observed that the excess loss for communication with roadside infrastructure in front of the vehicle is nearly half-power beam width independent, and the increase of the root mean square delay spread plays a minor role in the resulting signal quality, as the absolute times are considerably shorter than the typical duration of 5G New Radio symbols. Near certain threshold levels, a reduction of the received power affects the link performance through an increased error vector magnitude of the received signal, and subsequent decrease of the achieved data throughput.

AB Motivated by the advancement in connected and autonomous vehicle technologies, this paper develops a novel car-following control scheme for a platoon of connected and autonomous vehicles on a straight highway. The platoon is modeled as an interconnected multi-agent dynamical system subject to physical and safety constraints, and it uses the global information structure such that each vehicle shares information with all the other vehicles. A constrained optimization based control scheme is proposed to ensure an entire platoon's transient traffic smoothness and asymptotic dynamic performance. By exploiting the solution properties of the underlying optimization problem and using primal-dual formulation, this paper develops dual based distributed algorithms to compute optimal solutions with proven convergence. Furthermore, the asymptotic stability of the unconstrained linear closed-loop system is established. These stability analysis results provide a principle to select penalty weights in the underlying optimization problem to achieve the desired closed-loop performance for both the transient and the asymptotic dynamics. Extensive numerical simulations are conducted to validate the efficiency of the proposed algorithms. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Autonomous vehicles (AVs) are rapidly proliferating. However, their future adoption is dependent on guarantees of their safety and security. Studies have shown that AVs are vulnerable to malicious cyberattacks with potentially lethal consequences. It is, therefore, imperative to deploy defensive techniques to enhance their cybersecurity. The method of dynamic watermarking (DW) has been proposed as an active technique for cyber-physical systems to detect cyberattacks. In this study, DW is implemented on an actual AV. It is shown that the DW technique is effective for timely detection of different types of attacks on the yaw rate measurement under autonomous operation, and thereby, allows recourse to measures such as stopping or pulling off to the side to prevent collisions.

AB In this paper, a discrete car-following interval model for autonomous vehicles is proposed, with the steady following and dynamic following intervals, and the range of the steady following interval is established. The stability conditions of the model are explored using linear stability analysis theory. Numerical simulation is used to verify the influence of the discrete following interval model on mixed traffic flow under small perturbations and hard braking. The research results show that with the increase in the proportion of autonomous vehicles, the stability of traffic flow is gradually enhanced. In particular, in the small perturbation condition, the autonomous vehicle has a speed maintenance period in the steady following interval, thereby reducing the influence of the preceding vehicle perturbations. With the increase of the steady following interval, the stability of traffic flow first increases and then decreases. Moreover, when the length of steady following interval is constant, with the increase of the minimum safety time headway, the stability of traffic flow is gradually enhanced.

AB A step towards fully autonomous vehicles can be achieved by autonomous collision avoidance. This paper presents the development and implementation of a rear-end collision avoidance system which consists of novel linear threat assessment, projected escape path planning with non-zero initial condition, reference generation and linear path control by an electric steering actuator using dynamic inversion. The linear threat assessment continuously calculates threat metrics associated with collision avoidance by either steering or braking. The escape path planner continuously estimates a path with constraints on the peak lateral acceleration and the required lateral deviation. The reference generator then estimates the states for avoidance according to the available friction. Linear state feedback control is applied for path following to avoid a collision in both straight-road scenarios and curved-road scenarios. The proposed approach is evaluated in simulations, and in practice on a C-segment Ford vehicle. A user-related assessment about the usefulness and satisfaction is included to conclude the paper.

AB In this article, the problem of steering control based on Takagi-Sugeno (T-S) fuzzy vehicle lateral dynamics is investigated for autonomous driving with nonlinearities, system uncertainties, and actuator constraints. During normal vehicle cruising, the vehicle velocity always changes due to the different road conditions and/or steering wheel maneuvers, and moreover, the vehicle dynamics is also significantly influenced by the tire/road forces under different road surface conditions, which brings many difficulties in steering controller design. By adopting fuzzy modeling techniques and varying look-ahead control strategy, an approach to the T-S fuzzy antiwindup output feedback controller design is proposed for the steering control in path tracking within T-S fuzzy-model-based analysis framework, where the actuator amplitude saturation and rate limit are simultaneously taken into consideration. Finally, valuation results with Carsim/MATLAB joint simulation are shown to demonstrate the effectiveness of the developed methods, and some comparison results in path tracking performance with fixed look-ahead distance control rule and the driver model controller embedded in Carsim are provided, which illustrate the advantages of the developed controller design method.

AB Autonomous driving relies greatly on deep learning to comprehend the surroundings and activities of the road systems. The learning models are traditionally trained off-line and used during driving. However, recent research on federated learning has enabled distributed deep learning for model adaptation with new data inputs from end users. Similarly, the recent research on continual learning has enabled the upgrading of the learned model with newer rounds of training, without losing previously acquired knowledge. For autonomous and/or connected vehicles, these mean it is possible to take new, maybe real time, data inputs from various sensors from multiple vehicles in vicinity, to train and update the preloaded models. The updated models can improve the safety and reduce human involvements when driving through unfamiliar situations. This paper tackles one important issue, namely, the model data dissemination for enabling such a distributed learning. The model data dissemination consists of steps of soliciting workers, transmitting model, and collecting the updates. In a mixed autonomous vehicles and connected vehicles network scenario, communication overhead and network dynamics are the major challenges. We present analyses on critical latency issues pertained to the various aspects of the model data dissemination to gain insights on the feasibility of federated learning for such a scenario. Also, we introduce a communication architecture and a publish-subscribe system for the model data dissemination. Our system is built with an information-centric networking paradigm via a tiered edge network architecture. Such a system organizes the steps of the model data dissemination clearly and manages the dynamics of the participating vehicles easily. The results show that the presented system reduces overall communication overhead and delay. It also provides high resiliency to packet losses in the mixed wireless connected and autonomous vehicular network.

ID COORDINATED CONTROL
AB This paper proposes a new tracking controller for autonomous underwater vehicle-manipulator systems (UVMSs) using the concept of model reference adaptive control. It also addresses the detailed modeling and simulation of the dynamic coupling between an autonomous underwater vehicle and manipulator system based on Newton-Euler formulation scheme. The proposed adaptation control algorithm is used to estimate the unknown parameters online and compensate for the rest of the system dynamics. Specifically, the influence of the unknown manipulator mass on the control performance is indirectly captured by means of the adaptive control scheme. The effectiveness and robustness of the proposed control scheme are demonstrated using numerical simulations.

AB This paper describes a decision-theoretic approach to cooperative sensor planning between multiple autonomous vehicles executing a military mission. For this autonomous vehicle application, intelligent cooperative reasoning must be used to select optimal vehicle viewing locations and select optimal camera pan and tilt angles throughout the mission. Decisions are made in such a way as to maximize the Value of information gained by the sensors while maintaining vehicle stealth. Because the mission involves multiple vehicles, cooperation can be used to balance the work load and to increase information gain. This paper presents the theoretical foundations of our cooperative sensor planning research and describes the application of these techniques to ARPA's Unmanned Ground Vehicle program.

AB Background: Individuals with physical disabilities face many challenges, especially with mobility. Transportation plays a key role in an individual's health as it provides the access to critical services such as medical visits. Autonomous vehicles (AVs) can be one possible solution to increase transportation accessibility. However, there is currently limited information detailing the obstacles individuals with disabilities face when it comes to mobility, or research regarding perceptions of this population toward autonomous vehicles. Objective: The goals of this study were twofold: 1) to identify the accessibility needs associated with transportation for individuals with a physical disability and 2) to understand the initial perceptions of this population towards autonomous vehicles to meet these needs. Methods: A survey with multiple choice and short-answer questions was developed to gather data on transportation issues and experiences from individuals with physical disabilities. This survey was distributed to disability networks. Results: Our results illustrate the many challenges that individuals with physical disabilities experience related to transportation, such as cost, time for planning, and convenience of use. We also found that individuals with physical disabilities had an overall positive attitude towards AVs and would be willing to pay the same price as private transportation or possibly more to use AVs if it had the proper accessibility and safety features. Conclusions: Overall, this work can be used to inform decisions surrounding accessibility of current transportation as well as guide the planning and design of autonomous vehicles for a population with physical disabilities.

AB This paper presents a novel approach for guiding mobile robots inside greenhouses demonstrated by promising preliminary physical experiments. It represents a comprehensive attempt to use the successful principles of AGVs (auto-guided vehicles) inside greenhouses, but avoiding the necessity of modifying the crop layout, and avoiding having to bury metallic pipes in the greenhouse floor. The designed vehicle can operate different tools, e.g., a spray system for applying plant-protection product, a lifting platform to reach the top part of the plants to perform pruning and harvesting tasks, and a trailer to transport fruits, plants, and crop waste. Regarding autonomous navigation, it follows the idea of AGVs, but now laser emitters are used to mark the desired route. The vehicle development is analyzed from a mechatronic standpoint (mechanics, electronics, and autonomous control).

AB An autonomous valet parking (AVP) system is designed to locate a vacant parking space and park the vehicle in which it resides on behalf of the driver, once the driver has left the vehicle. In addition, the AVP is able to direct the vehicle to a location desired by the driver when requested. In this paper, for an AVP system, we introduce technology to recognize a parking space using image sensors. The proposed technology is mainly divided into three parts. First, spatial analysis is carried out using a height map that is based on dense motion stereo. Second, modelling of road markings is conducted using a probability map with a new salient-line feature extractor. Finally, parking space recognition is based on a Bayesian classifier. The experimental results show an execution time of up to 10 ms and a recognition rate of over 99%. Also, the performance and properties of the proposed technology were evaluated with a variety of data. Our algorithms, which are part of the proposed technology, are expected to apply to various research areas regarding autonomous vehicles, such as map generation, road marking recognition, localization, and environment recognition.

AB Road safety through vehicular control is the prime interest of research in Vehicular Ad hoc Networks (VANETs). Diagnostic analysis of In-vehicle sensors is one of the core concerns for vehicular safety. There is a number of safety applications promising the features needed in vehicular safety. Therefore, this paper designed, developed, and implemented a solution for diagnostic analysis of In-vehicle sensors with autonomous recovery procedure. An artificial intelligence-based technique is used for monitoring, reporting and autonomous recovering of vehicle sensors. The algorithm used for diagnostic analysis of sensors not only determines the operational state of the sensors but also executes procedure for sensors autonomous recovery. A graphical display depicts the operational state of sensors for driver's information. Hexadecimal message format is implemented for transmission and reception of sensors data to the central administration unit using Internet Protocol (IP). The simulation results confirm the effectiveness of proposed solution in term of recovery time of faulty sensor. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

ID MOBILE ROBOTS; STABILIZATION; STRATEGY
AB Model Predictive Controller (MPC) is a capable technique for designing Path Tracking Controller (PTC) of Autonomous Vehicles (AVs). The performance of MPC can be significantly enhanced by adopting a high-fidelity and accurate vehicle model. This model should be capable of capturing the full dynamics of the vehicle, including nonlinearities and uncertainties, without imposing a high computational cost for MPC. A data-driven approach realised by learning vehicle dynamics using vehicle operation data can offer a promising solution by providing a suitable trade-off between accurate state predictions and the computational cost for MPC. This work proposes a framework for designing an MPC with a Neural Network (NN)-based learned dynamic model of the vehicle using the plethora of data available from modern vehicle systems. The objective is to integrate an NN-based model with higher accuracy than the conventional vehicle models for the required prediction horizon into MPC for improved tracking performances. The proposed NN-based model is highly capable of approximating latent system states, which are difficult to estimate, and provides more accurate predictions in the presence of parametric uncertainties. The results in various road conditions show that the proposed approach outperforms the MPCs with conventional vehicle models.

AB In order to deal with coordination control for multiple autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs), a three-dimensional coordination control scheme is proposed by combining sliding mode control, backstepping technique, and leader-follower strategy. A virtual trajectory is introduced to decrease the information exchange between AUVs. Global leader motion and follower controller constitute the coordination control scheme and are verified by a triangular prism formation simulation of six AUVs. The simulation results demonstrate that the controllers are capable of coordinating AUVs to achieve the desired formation and the coordination control scheme is effective.

AB The combination of self-driving technology and taxis has a considerable potential in improving service quality and economic efficiency that can completely change traditional taxi operation. This study accordingly focuses on the autonomous taxi (aTaxi) dispatching problem in hybrid request mode where travelers can either request immediate rides or reserve taxi services ahead of time. In this study, a centralized dispatcher and decentralized autonomous dispatchers are designed to plan short-term and long-term routes for aTaxis in real time, respectively. The centralized dispatcher integrates vehicle-to-passenger assignment with empty vehicle rebalance to guarantee solution quality. Decentralized autonomous dispatchers distribute a portion of the calculation to aTaxis, thus reducing the centralized dispatcher's workload. The dispatching strategy ensures that the response to traveler requests can be made immediately, and if such requests are accepted, the travelers will receive the expected services. Finally, experiments are conducted based on the actual road network and the trip data of Manhattan to investigate the dispatching strategy. The results confirm the high performance of the proposed dispatching strategies in terms of service quality and economic efficiency. It is also found that the increase in reservation rates can enhance the robustness of the method with respect to errors in predicted requests. Moreover, when the number of vehicles is adequate and reservations are made longer ahead of time, the completion rate of requests and the revenue improve.

AB Nowadays, deep learning methods based on a virtual environment are widely applied to research and technology development for autonomous vehicle's smart sensors and devices. Learning various driving environments in advance is important to handle unexpected situations that can exist in the real world and to continue driving without accident. For training smart sensors and devices of an autonomous vehicle well, a virtual simulator should create scenarios of various possible real-world situations. To create reality-based scenarios, data on the real environment must be collected from a real driving vehicle or a scenario analysis process conducted by experts. However, these two approaches increase the period and the cost of scenario generation as more scenarios are created. This paper proposes a scenario generation method based on deep learning to create scenarios automatically for training autonomous vehicle smart sensors and devices. To generate various scenarios, the proposed method extracts multiple events from a video which is taken on a real road by using deep learning and generates the multiple event in a virtual simulator. First, Faster-region based convolution neural network (Faster-RCNN) extracts bounding boxes of each object in a driving video. Second, the high-level event bounding boxes are calculated. Third, long-term recurrent convolution networks (LRCN) classify each type of extracted event. Finally, all multiple event classification results are combined into one scenario. The generated scenarios can be used in an autonomous driving simulator to teach multiple events that occur during real-world driving. To verify the performance of the proposed scenario generation method, experiments using real driving video data and a virtual simulator were conducted. The results for deep learning model show an accuracy of 95.6%; furthermore, multiple high-level events were extracted, and various scenarios were generated in a virtual simulator for smart sensors and devices of an autonomous vehicle.

In initial at-sea tests, our investigation focuses on a notional scenario wherein an autonomous underwater vehicle pursuing a survey goal unexpectedly detects the presence of a potentially hostile surface vessel. Our tests suggest that Goal-Driven Autonomy, a model of goal reasoning, can successfully reason about this scenario using only the limited computational resources typically available on underwater robotic platforms.

AB Autonomous and intelligent system show a remarkable step in urban traffic management. Autonomous Intersection Management (AIM) is an outstanding example of using an autonomous vehicle and wireless communication technology. The traffic performance of a single AIM system has been proved in many works however, traffic in the network of multiple AIMs is waiting for an implementation. Coordination of traffic between intersections in the network is an important step of managing the overall networked traffic throughput. The authors modeled the traffic network with the multi-agents concept and used the discrete consensus algorithm to coordinate between autonomous agents and implemented the rerouting algorithm in order to distribute the excessive traffics to neighbored intersections with the optimal condition. Our target is to have a balance traffic in each intersection and reaches the equilibrium where the stability has been not compromised. The results show that reaching consensus condition will bring the networked traffic to an equilibrium state where a peak traffic will not be happened. In addition, this method shows that when traffic in a network reached consensus, it will also converge to the Nash equilibrium in the finite time.

ID OPTIMIZATION
AB Machine learning (ML) algorithms are essential components in autonomous driving. In most existing connected and autonomous vehicles (CAVs), a large amount of driving data collected from multiple vehicles are sent to a central server for unified training. However, data privacy and security have become crucial during the data-sharing process. Federated learning (FL) for data security has arisen nowadays, and it can improve the data privacy of distribute machine learning. However, the malicious attackers can still be able to attack the training process. Due to the complete reliance on the central server, FL is very fragile. To address the above problem, we propose Bift: 1) a fully decentralized ML system combined with FL and 2) blockchain to provide a privacy-preserving ML process for CAVs. Bift enables distributed CAVs to train ML models locally using their own driving data and then to upload the local models to get a better global model. More importantly, Bift provides a consensus algorithm named Proof of Federated Learning to resist possible adversaries. We evaluate the performance of Bift and demonstrate that Bift is scalable and robust, and can defend against malicious attacks.

AB This study proposes a multi-mode switching longitudinal autonomous driving system based on model predictive control (MPC) with acceleration estimation of proceeding vehicle. A hierarchical control framework composed of three layers is utilised. In the first layer, five longitudinal driving scenarios are defined based on emergency degree. In the second layer, the MPC for longitudinal autonomous driving is designed and serving as the upper controller. Among which a non-linear tracking differentiator is used for acceleration estimation of preceding vehicle. In the third layer, the inverse longitudinal vehicle system dynamic model with strong non-linearity is considered in the lower controller. Proportional-integral-derivative feedback and feedforward control are combined to track the desired acceleration. Simulation and hardware-in-loop test results show that the multi-mode switching longitudinal autonomous driving system is feasible and effective, and has important value for engineering application.

ID ADAPTIVE CRUISE CONTROL; BEHAVIOR; DESIGN
AB The use of connected autonomous vehicles (CAVs) can help reduce the gaps between vehicles. However, smaller gaps may cause challenges for on-ramp vehicles to merge on the freeway. This study introduces several strategies that allow on-ramp vehicles to merge safely and efficiently with the mainline by providing adequate merging gaps or resolving merging conflicts in a mixed traffic environment. Eight methods are proposed to facilitate merging. These strategies are simulated in a mixed traffic environment with different traffic characteristics, including different proportions of CAVs. The results indicate that the operational performance is affected by the CAV penetration rate and traffic management strategy. For a relatively low freeway traffic volume or 100% CAV penetration rate, traffic operations under the do-nothing option perform almost as well as the best traffic management strategy. However, at lower CAV penetration rates and high freeway traffic volumes, the proposed strategies are more viable than the do-nothing option.

AB A hierarchical trajectory tracking and yaw stability combined control strategy of autonomous ground vehicle within-wheel motor is proposed in this paper to achieve simultaneous and accurate trajectory tracking and vehicle yaw stability control. A trajectory-tracking controller is designed on the basis of model predictive control algorithm, and the ideal front-wheel steering angle requirement is calculated to follow the referenced trajectory. In order to improve the accuracy of vehicle steering control, a vehicle steering controller is designed based on high-order sliding mode control method, in which the control demand of front-wheel steering angle is satisfied by real-time torque control of vehicle steering motor. Simultaneously, a double power reaching rate-based sliding mode control method is applied to design the vehicle yaw stability controller, in which the yaw moment control requirement is met by an optimal oriented tire force allocation algorithm. The simulation and experiment results show that the presented control method can improve the accuracy and real-time performance of trajectory tracking control while ensuring vehicle yaw stability.

AB In this paper, a hierarchical energy management control strategy is investigated for autonomous plug-in hybrid electric vehicle in vehicle-following environment. With the target of safety and comfort, the designed algorithm is divided into two layers. The grey neural network is leveraged in the upper layer controller to predict the future speed trend of preceding vehicle, and the target speed of ego vehicle is planned by fuzzy adaptive control algorithm. By combining with the planned state of charge reference trajectory, genetic algorithm is exploited in the adaptive equivalent consumption minimization strategy-based lower layer controller to determine the initial equivalent factor map by offline iterative calculation, and the fuzzy logic algorithm is employed to update the equivalent factor in real time according to the state of charge difference. Finally, the simulation and hardware-in-the-loop experiment are conducted to validate the performance of the proposed strategy. The simulation results highlight the capability of the proposed strategy in solving multi-objective optimization for autonomous plug-in hybrid electric vehicle in vehicle-following environment, and the experiment results validate that the energy consumption economy of the proposed strategy reaches 95.43% optimality of the results derived by dynamic programming while ensuring the satisfied driving comfort and safety.

ID ALGORITHM
AB The tracking accuracy of nearby vehicles determines the safety and feasibility of driver assistance systems or autonomous vehicles. Recent research has been active to employ additional sensors or to combine heterogeneous sensors for more accurate tracking performance. Especially, autonomous driving technologies require a sensor fusion technique that considers various driving environments. In this research, a novel method for high-level data fusion is proposed to improve the accuracy of tracking surrounding vehicles. In response to the changing driving environment, the locations of the vehicles are estimated in real-time using an adaptive track-to-track fusion technique and an interacting multiple model filter. Asynchronous measurements from multiple sensors such as radar, camera, and LiDAR, are utilized for the estimation. For each sensor, two motion models representing the vehicle's movement are applied to increase the estimation accuracy. Utilizing a multimodal network-based track-to-track fusion approach, it combines the estimates of the target vehicle position from each sensor into a single estimate. The inputs of the network are intended to determine the reliability of each sensor, considering the driving conditions that may affect sensor accuracy. Also, multiple embeddings in the network are created so that the corresponding data maintains its relevance and enables the real-time computing. The proposed method is verified using real driving data collected from various environments.

ID SLIDING MODE CONTROL; SUBJECT
AB This article investigates the three-dimensional trajectory tracking control problem for an underactuated autonomous underwater vehicle in the presence of parameter perturbations and external disturbances. An adaptive robust controller is proposed based on the velocity control strategy and adaptive integral sliding mode control algorithm. First, the desired velocities are developed using coordinate transformation and the backstepping method, which is the necessary velocities for autonomous underwater vehicle to track the time-varying desired trajectory. The bioinspired neurodynamics is used to smooth the desired velocities, which effectively avoids the jump problem of the velocity and simplifies the derivative calculation. Then, the dynamic control laws are designed based on the adaptive integral sliding mode control to drive the underactuated autonomous underwater vehicle to sail at the desired velocities. At the same time, the auxiliary control laws and the adaptive laws are introduced to eliminate the influence of parameter perturbations and external disturbances, respectively. The stability of the control system is guaranteed by the Lyapunov theorem, which shows that the system is asymptotically stable and all tracking errors are asymptotically convergent. At the end, numerical simulations are carried out to demonstrate the effectiveness and robustness of the proposed controller.

AB We remove the long standing restriction that plant dynamics in extremurn seeking control must be stable and provide an extension that allows single integrators, double integrators, and moderately unstable single poles. An application of the result for single and double integrators is in control of autonomous vehicles. Extremum seeking is used for finding a source of a signal (chemical, electromagnetic, etc.) whose strength decays with the distance. This is achieved without the measurement of the position vector and using only the measurement of the scalar signal. (c) 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB This article aims to study coupled mean-field equation and ODEs with discrete events motivated by vehicular traffic flow. Precisely, multi-lane traffic flow in presence of human-driven and autonomous vehicles is considered, with autonomous vehicles possibly influenced by external policymakers. First, a finite-dimensional hybrid system is developed based on the continuous Bando-Follow-the-Leader dynamics coupled with discrete events due to lane-change maneuvers. Then the mean-field limit of the finite-dimensional hybrid system is rigorously derived for the dynamics of the human-driven vehicles. The microscopic lane-change maneuvers of the human-driven vehicles generate a source term for the mean-field PDE. This leads to an infinite-dimensional hybrid system described by coupled Vlasov-type PDE, ODEs, and discrete events.

AB This paper presents a path-following and collision avoidance system for autonomous surface vehicles based on nonlinear model predictive control. The proposed strategy is capable of following a desired path while maintaining a commanded velocity, whereas it can diverge from the references to safely perform maneuvers to elude unexpected obstacles. A nonlinear dynamic model of the vehicle is applied to predict the vehicle states into a finite horizon. Furthermore, a LiDAR sensor located at the front of the boat is employed for local object detection. Here, the high-performance optimal control framework, acados, is used to solve the optimization problem onboard. Real-time numerical simulations and field experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach against multiple buoys.

AB As part of the infiltration of automation across urban life, autonomous vehicles (AVs) are traversing cities and regions across the world. This paper presents our critical analysis of trials of these vehicles, which are being shaped by, and are shaping, the material, political, and economic fabric of the city. We take the burgeoning literature on urban experimentation in a new empirical direction - that of mobility - and deepen understanding of the sense in which such experiments are urban. Our extensive analysis of global experiments with automated vehicles provides an analytical typology of four forms of experimentation - on-road, test bed, precinct, and living lab - each with differing relations to the city and differing potentials for political transformation. We illuminate the city as much more than a container for experiments, being multiply implicated in these AV trials through which, we argue, differentiated conditions of possibility emerge for contesting and reconfiguring the city's "automobility."

AB In this letter, we reveal a new precise localization framework based on inter-vehicle GNSS information fusion (IGIF) for autonomous robot systems. In this framework, we derive a new hybrid GNSS filter (HGF) using information from both onboard sensors and the inter-vehicle network, and a consistency checking (CC) method to improve the system reliability. The main novelty of the proposed method is the fusion of ionosphere-free (IF) and double differenced (DD) combinations to improve the global positioning accuracy of robots and the two-level probabilistic detection of erroneous inter-vehicle measurements. A real-world experiment was conducted and it turned out that our method provided more consistent, continuous, and accurate position estimation than the state-of-the-art methods while only requiring low communication bandwidth.

AB Simulation is increasingly important in the development and testing of robots and autonomous vehicles as it opens the door for candidate navigation, perception, and sensor fusion algorithms to be expeditiously probed in complex and safety-critical scenarios. As most robots and autonomous vehicles make heavy use of cameras to perceive their surroundings, camera modeling becomes a prerequisite for the successful simulation of these autonomous agents. This contribution outlines the context in which camera models are used; provides a component-by-component analysis of the image acquisition pipeline along with algorithms used for its modeling; and closes with a discussion of data-driven approaches that embrace a different perspective on camera modeling.

AB Recently, the autonomous driving technology has developed rapidly with the shared autonomous vehicle system extensively investigated. However, little attention has been given to the diversity of the travel demands. In view of this, the paper proposes a dispatching strategy to solve the vehicle assignment and rebalancing problems with simultaneous consideration of immediate, reservation, shareable and unshareable requests. The centralised optimisation and the decentralised heuristic methods are combined to handle the different requests efficiently, which enables the dispatching strategy to address the urban scale problem. The centralised optimisation method assigns the short-term requests and plans the empty vehicle rebalance by the network simplex algorithm, while the decentralised heuristic method assigns the long-term requests and fully uses the previous step results in each solution step of the rolling horizon. The simulation of Manhattan, New York, with 4,000 vehicles and 1,823,152 requests, confirms the high operational performance and the efficiency of the proposed dispatching strategy compared to the existing approach and the benchmark strategy. It was also found that more reservation requests with the earlier reservation time did not generate significant improvement in operational performance, and the high sharable request ratio facilitated the reduction of the travel distance and empty distance.

AB This paper presents a robust H-infinity output-feedback control strategy for the path following of autonomous ground vehicles (AGVs). Considering the vehicle lateral velocity is usually hard to measure with low cost sensor, a robust H-infinity static output-feedback controller based on the mixed genetic algorithms (GA)/linear matrix inequality (LMI) approach is proposed to realize the path following without the information of the lateral velocity. The proposed controller is robust to the parametric uncertainties and external disturbances, with the parameters including the tire cornering stiffness, vehicle longitudinal velocity, yaw rate and road curvature. Simulation results based on CarSim-Simulink joint platform using a high-fidelity and full-car model have verified the effectiveness of the proposed control approach. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

AB Electric vehicles are progressively introduced in urban areas, because of their ability to reduce air pollution, fuel consumption and noise nuisance. Nowadays, some big cities are launching the first electric car-sharing projects to clear traffic jams and enhance urban mobility, as an alternative to the classic public transportation systems. However, there are still some problems to be solved related to energy storage, electric charging and autonomy. In this paper, we present an autonomous docking system for electric vehicles recharging based on an embarked infrared camera performing infrared beacons detection installed in the infrastructure. A visual servoing system coupled with an automatic controller allows the vehicle to dock accurately to the recharging booth in a street parking area. The results show good behavior of the implemented system, which is currently deployed as a real prototype system in the city of Paris.

AB With significant advancements in information and communication technologies, connected and autonomous vehicles (CAVs) can provide improved transportation services. At present, a variety of technologies, such as vehicular networks, communication interfaces, and modern hardware devices enable CAVs to support reliable, safe, and quality transportation system options with improved performance and increased effectiveness. In this paper, we carefully explore a set of distinguished state-of-the-art CAV systems with a focus on On-board Computational Unit (OBCU) hardware architectures, communication technologies, deployment challenges, and performance aspects. The exploration critically identifies important area transformations and anticipates future trends influencing CAV communications and processing requirements. To that end, we propose the design of a future generic OBCU architecture that can be customized with appealing features and used in CAVs.

ID THREAT ASSESSMENT
AB Security problem is a fundamental issue for autonomous vehicles. Trajectory planning is a significant component of autonomous vehicle system, which directly influences the automated traffic safety. In this paper, the motion prediction of other traffic participants is considered. We use Monte Carlo simulation to predict the probabilistic occupancy of the object and give a map from probability statistics to actual scenarios. The non-time-based reference trajectory can be obtained by using high-definition map and lane detection. Then model predictive control is utilized to optimize the reference trajectory according to the current state of autonomous vehicle. Different prediction horizons and coordinate transformation are adopted to optimize the planning. By doing so, the constraint conditions can be easily involved and the result is more intuitive. The probabilistic occupancy of other traffic participants are computed offline and then the obtained results are used in real-time application. Therefore, the real-time computational burden is reduced. The crash probability is put forward to verify the feasibility of real-time trajectory in safety assessment module. Two typical scenarios are analyzed: lane change on the straight road and turning at the intersection. The simulation results illustrate the efficiency of our method.

AB This study investigates the lane-keeping control of autonomous vehicles with an emphasis on the digital delayed nature of the system. The vehicle dynamics are represented using a kinematic bicycle model, and a hierarchical lane-keeping controller is introduced with multiple delays in the feedback loop. An extension of the semidiscretization method is presented, in order to perform the stability analysis of the digitally controlled vehicle with multiple discrete time delays. The differences between the continuous approximation and the exact consideration of discrete time delays are highlighted. We show that in certain cases, neglecting the effects of quantization can lead to significant inaccuracies, especially when tuning the lower-level controller. The results are verified using a series of small-scale laboratory experiments.

ID SCHEME; SECURE; AUTHENTICATION
AB Automated valet parking, deemed as a key milestone on the way to autonomous driving, has great potential to improve the "last-mile" driving experience for users. On the other hand, it triggers serious risks on vehicle theft and location privacy leakage. To address these issues, we propose a secure and privacy-preserving automated valet parking protocol for self-driving vehicles. The proposed protocol is characterized by extending anonymous authentication to support two-factor authentication with mutual traceability for reducing the risks of vehicle theft and preventing the privacy leakage of users in automated valet parking. Specifically, based on one-time password and secure mobile devices, two-factor authentication is achieved between vehicles and smart-phones to ensure vehicle security in remote pickup. By exploiting the BBS+ signature and the Cuckoo filter, user location privacy is protected against the curious parking lots and service providers. In addition, the traceable tags are designed to enable a trusted authority to identify the vehicles and users for localizing a stolen or missing vehicle and preventing the slandering of greedy users. Finally, formal security analysis on the proposed protocol is given to show that the authentication, anonymity, and traceability can be reduced to standard hard assumptions, and performance evaluation demonstrates the proposed protocol is efficient and practical to be implemented in autonomous driving era.

AB The challenge for unmanned aerial vehicles to sense and avoid obstacles becomes even harder if narrow passages have to be crossed. An approach to solve a mission scenario that tackles the problem of such narrow passages is presented here. The task is to fly an unmanned helicopter autonomously through a course with gates that are only slightly larger than the vehicle itself. A camera is installed on the vehicle to detect the gates. Using vehicle localization data from a navigation solution, camera alignment and global gate positions are estimated simultaneously. The presented algorithm calculates the desired target waypoints to fly through the gates. Furthermore, the paper presents a mission execution plan that instructs the vehicle to search for a gate, to fly through it after successful detection, and to search for a proceeding one. All algorithms are designed to run onboard the vehicle so that no interaction with the ground control station is necessary, making the vehicle completely autonomous. To develop and optimize algorithms, and to prove the correctness and accuracy of vision-based gate detection under real operational conditions, gate positions are searched in images taken from manual helicopter flights. Afterwards, the integration of visual sensing and mission control is proven. The paper presents results from full autonomous flight where the helicopter searches and flies through a gate without operator actions.

AB It is anticipated that autonomous vehicles will have a huge impact on the creation of sustainable smart cities and communities. One of the key concerns regarding autonomous vehicles is how automation may threaten jobs in the transport industry, including the traditional role of taxi drivers. To begin to explore how important an actual taxi driver is to customers and the extent to which they might be happy to have autonomous taxis replace traditional taxis, we conducted qualitative interviews with 34 Millennial-aged participants. These were problem centered narrative interviews, largely conducted face-to-face, and analyzed using thematic analysis. Millennials were focused upon because, given current figures and likely future projections of use, they form the key market for prospective future autonomous taxis. The results show that the kind of taxi rides Millennials make are particularly suitable for automated taxis because interaction with a human driver is not a high priority for this group, while the prospect of autonomous taxis being cheaper is. Meanwhile the fate of taxi drivers does not play a significant part in how Millennials reason about this. An incidental finding, here, is that, by offering a convenient and affordable alternative, the advent of automated taxis may also pose a threat to public transportation.

AB The current world today is indisputably digital and its advanced digital technologies have grown more rapidly than ever since. The recent scientific and engineering progress in autonomous vehicles (AVs) and advanced driver assistance systems (ADAS) make us believe that autonomous vehicles will be fully functional without human intervention in the near future. The current ADAS methods are best at realizing different modes of AV, however, it still lacks behind to handle uncertain situations such as deciding the specific location to stop. To overcome this, we propose a novel image retrieval approach for finding the semantic locations by using vigorous features and color information. Firstly, the proposed method offers different image categories and the driver selects a query image of the semantic location. Secondly, the method extracts its salient features and color information using the proposed technique. Thirdly, the method computes the similarity between the query image and the dataset images. Finally, if the threshold similarity is found, the method asks the driver for appropriate actions (e.g. slow down or stop). The experimental results on three benchmark datasets show the efficiency and accuracy of the proposed method for finding the semantic locations in autonomous vehicles.

AB This survey article provides an overview on future directions for research in urban mobility and city logistics. It sets a focus on three particularly serious changes in the business models: vehicle autonomy, crowdsourced logistics, and urban micro-consolidation centers. In the future, service fleets might fully or partially be autonomous which brings new operational opportunities and challenges. In many business models, crowdsourcing jobs are already common. While this might save costs, it also leads to uncertainty in the available workforce and their behavior. Finally, micro-consolidation centers enable the use of smaller, cheaper, and emission-friendlier vehicles, but lead to more complex planning and operations. For each topic, the article presents an overview on the relevant literature as well as important and open research challenges.

AB Path following is an indispensable function for autonomous vehicles. Desired paths may be of arbitrary shape, not just the mostly investigated straight lines and circles. This paper addresses the path following problem of arbitrary twice differentiable curves using vector-field-based approach. A tangent vector field is constructed through coordinate transformation, and a sufficient condition for its feasibility concerning the input saturation is given out. A saturated turning velocity controller is designed and its Lyapunov stability is discussed in detail. Numerical simulation results show us that the path following performance of the proposed approach is comparable with that of the literature while involving 5 less parameters to be set.

AB The backward behavior of tractor-semitrailer vehicles is particularly challenging compared to passenger vehicles, causing many difficulties not only for drivers but also for autonomous driving. Offset backing, which is one of the most important backward scenarios for articulated vehicles, can be applied to various path planning in a confined space, such as parking, and can be used for Advanced Driver Assistance Systems (ADAS) and autonomous driving. First of all, by analyzing the slow movement of a tractor-semitrailer vehicle in a confined space, standard unit motions and compound motions for general posture adjustment were defined. By approximating the offset backing driving paths of expert tractor-semitrailer drivers with a geometric method, qualitative path planning was completed by combining compound and unit motions. In addition, complementary motions were added to respond to errors that occur due to the simplicity of the qualitative path planning based on the geometric method. The usefulness of the developed offset backing path planning for tractor-semitrailer vehicles was demonstrated through repeated experimental tests with a model autonomous vehicle.

AB Driver inattention is among major contributing factors to traffic accidents. There have been and continue to be efforts by governing bodies, car manufacturers, and researchers to prevent driver inattention or, failing that, to mitigate its effects. Many vehicles nowadays come equipped with driver monitoring systems that can alert the driver to, or compensate for, inattention. Moreover, the research community continues to explore and investigate more robust approaches to deal with inattention. Meanwhile, vehicle automation, to various degrees, is becoming more prevalent, with the human's role in the driving task changing depending on the level of autonomy. This necessitates that inattention detection, moving forward, be studied and designed in view of automation and in the context of a specific level of vehicle autonomy. Driver inattention and vehicle automation interact in a complex way, and that needs to be taken into account in the design of future vehicles. We explore this interaction in this paper in light of research findings, and survey inattention detection systems and attempt to contextualize them within popular frameworks for next-generation autonomous vehicles.

AB With the increase in the number of automated vehicles, roads will contain a mix of automated vehicles and human-driven vehicles. At present, rule-based driving strategy control of automated vehicles in mixed traffic flow makes it difficult to obtain optimal control. Therefore, this study proposes a learning-based driving strategy for connected and autonomous vehicles under mixed traffic flow. The proposed method differs from other driving strategies in two respects. First, both the lane-change and car-following policies are included, and the Deep Q-network algorithm is utilized to train the two policies in a mixed traffic-flow environment. Second, the proposed driving strategy considers both traffic efficiency and safety when designing the reward function. Through simulation experiments, the differences in traffic efficiency and safety of this method and the rule-based method were compared and analyzed under different traffic densities and penetration rates of connected and autonomous vehicles. Simulation results show that the driving strategy improves the average velocity (by 7.02 km/h) and traffic safety (especially in high-density traffic), compared with traditional rule-based driving strategy.

AB In this paper, we investigate the benefits of vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) communication for autonomous vehicles and provide results on how V2V information helps reduce employable time headway in the presence of parasitic lags. For a string of vehicles adopting a constant time headway policy and availing the on-board information of predecessor's vehicle position and velocity, the minimum employable time headway (h(min)) must be lower bounded by 2 tau(0) for string stability, where tau(0) is the maximum parasitic actuation lag. In this paper, we quantify the benefits of using V2V communication in terms of a reduction in the employable time headway: 1) If the position and velocity information of r immediately preceding vehicles is used, then hmin can be reduced to 4 tau(0)/(1 + r); 2) furthermore, if the acceleration of 'r' immediately preceding vehicles is used, then hmin can be reduced to 2 tau(0)/(1 + r); and 3) if the position, velocity, and acceleration of the immediate and the r-th predecessors are used, then h(min) >= 2 tau(0)/(1 + r). Note that cases (2) and (3) provide the same lower bound on the minimum employable time headway; however, case (3) requires much less communicated information.

AB Autonomous vehicles (AV)s have become a trending topic nowadays since they have the potential to solve traffic problems, such as accidents and congestion. Although AV systems have greatly evolved, it still have their limitations. For example, Google reported that their AVs have been involved in several collisions and near misses. While most of these collisions and near misses were caused by third parties, the AVs should be able to predict and avoid them. Events like this show that there is still room for improvement in the AV system. This paper aims to present a review of the state-of-the-art algorithms proposed to enable AV behaviour prediction systems to predict trajectories and intentions for pedestrians and vehicles. This will be achieved by using information from previous literature review papers, recent works, and results obtained using well-known datasets.

AB Alongside the development of digital life, certain concepts gain new dimensions among new generations. When entertainment is the subject, it creates emergent desires, behaviours and mindsets in the social and consumer cultures. However, existing perspectives around in-car entertainment do not fully embrace the digitally dynamic environment in which Generation Z is heavily involved. This paper uses the future autonomous vehicle's interior context as a case study to understand Gen Z's meaning change around in-car entertainment. It draws on a qualitative research methodology by combining semi-structured interviews with design metaphor activities to understand Gen Z's altered mindset with the impact of digital technology. As ultimate findings, eight different in -car entertainment mindsets of Gen Z emerged: Effortlessness Seeking, Sense of Belonging, Balance Seeking, Authenticity Seeking, Advocating, Decision-Making, Creating and Interacting. The implications of an autonomous vehicle's entertainment experience were discussed. It is expected that this study will contribute to understanding the shifting mindset and behaviour of Gen Z in how they desire to entertain themselves within an autonomous vehicle. The study suggests what to consider regarding maximising in-car entertaining experiences for Gen Z.

AB This article studies the design, modeling, and implementation challenges for a target detection algorithm using multi-sensor technology of a co-operative autonomous offshore system, formed by an unmanned surface vehicle (USV) and an autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV). First, the study develops an accurate mathematical model of the USV to be included as a simulation environment for testing the guidance, navigation, and control (GNC) algorithm. Then, a guidance system is addressed based on an underwater coverage path for the AUV, which uses a mechanical imaging sonar as the primary AUV perception sensor and ultra-short baseline (USBL) as a positioning system. Once the target is detected, the AUV sends its location to the USV, which creates a straight-line for path following with obstacle avoidance capabilities, using a LiDAR as the main USV perception sensor. This communication in the co-operative autonomous offshore system includes a decentralized Robot Operating System (ROS) framework with a master node at each vehicle. Additionally, each vehicle uses a modular approach for the GNC architecture, including target detection, path-following, and guidance control modules. Finally, implementation challenges in a field test scenario involving both AUV and USV are addressed to validate the target detection algorithm.

AB Autonomous vehicles are to revolutionize the way urban mobility demands are served, and they are most likely to be powered by electricity. To accurately quantify the benefits of replacing existing mobility services with autonomous electric vehicles, electric autonomous mobility-on -demand (EAMoD) systems need to be evaluated and designed with the congestion effects they may cause taken into account. In this work, the congestion effects are depicted through a discrete event simulation model with state-dependent link travel speed and limited link space that allow endogenous congestion to emerge, spread, and dissipate across the entire road network. Three mathematical models are integrated into the simulation model to optimally match vehicles with waiting requests, relocate empty vehicles to potential high-demand areas, and assign low charge vehicles to charging stations based on the workloads of the charging stations. Based on the simulation model, we apply Bayesian optimization to jointly design the fleet size and charging facility configuration considering the endogenous congestion incurred by the daily operation of autonomous electric vehicles. Contraction hierarchies are adopted to route vehicles to perform assigned tasks in real-time. The proposed solution method is tested on Manhattan below 60th street, which corresponds to the potential congestion pricing zone in New York City. Experiment results show that the proposed simulation-based optimization approach is computationally tractable, and can find a satisfactory solution to the fleet sizing and charging infrastructure design problem within a tight computation budget. Excluding congestion effects at system design stage would lead to up to 14% passenger loss due to long assignment waiting time. Although the charging facility cost accounts for only 1.8% of the total cost, the number of chargers can indirectly affect the percentage of passengers that can be served through its efficiency in recharging vehicles. A charging facility configuration aligned with the fleet size can help to improve service quality and vehicle utilization rate.

AB The automation of the overtaking maneuver is considered to be one of the toughest challenges in the development of autonomous vehicles. This operation involves two vehicles (the overtaking and the overtaken) cooperatively driving, as well as the surveillance of any other vehicles that are involved in the maneuver. This operation consists of two lane changes-one from the right to the left lane of the road, and the other is to return to the right lane after passing. Lane-change maneuvers have been used to move into or out of a circulation lane or platoon; however, overtaking operations have not received much coverage in the literature. In this paper, we present an overtaking system for autonomous vehicles equipped with path-tracking and lane-change capabilities. The system uses fuzzy controllers that mimic human behavior and reactions during overtaking maneuvers. The system is based on the information that is supplied by a high-precision Global Positioning System and a wireless network environment. It is able to drive an automated vehicle and overtake a second vehicle that is driving in the same lane of the road.

AB This article describes a method for vision-based autonomous convoy driving in which a robotic vehicle autonomously pursues another vehicle. Pursuit is achieved by visually tracking a target mounted on the back of the pursued vehicle. Visual tracking must be robust, since a failure leads to catastrophic results. To make our system as reliable as possible, uncertainty is accounted for in each measurement and propagated through all computations. We use a best linear unbiased estimate (BLUE) of the target's position in each separate image, and a polynomial least-mean-square fit (LMSF) to estimate the target's motion. Robust antonomous convoy driving has been demonstrated in the presence of various lighting conditions, shadowing, other vehicles, turns at intersections, curves, and hills. A continuous, autonomous, convoy drive of over 33 km (20 miles) was successful, at speeds averaging between 50 and 75 km/h (30-45 miles/h).

AB Autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) have been applied in various scientific missions including oceanographic research, bathymetry studies, sea mine detection, and marine pollution tracking. We have designed and field-tested in the ocean a backseat driver autonomous system for a 5.5 m survey-class Explorer AUV to detect and track a mixed-phase oil plume. While the first driver is responsible for controlling and safely operating the vehicle; the second driver processes real-time data surrounding the vehicle based on in situ sensor measurements and adaptively modifies the mission details. This adaptive sensing and tracking method uses the Gaussian blur and occupancy grid method. Using a large bubble plume as a proxy, our approach enables real-time adaptive modifications to the AUV's mission details, and field tests show successful plume detection and tracking. Our results provide for remote detection of underwater oil plumes and enhanced autonomy with these large AUVs.

AB In this paper, we propose a path following Model Predictive Control-based (MPC) scheme utilising. steering and braking. The control objective is to track a desired path for obstacle avoidance manoeuvre by a combined use of braking and steering. The proposed control scheme relies on the Nonlinear MPC (NMPC) formulation we used in [F. Borrelli. et al, WC-based approach to active steering for autonomous vehicle systems, Int. J. Veh. Autonomous Syst. 3(2/3/4) (2005). pp. 265-29L] and [P. Falcone. et al., Predictive active steering control for autonomous vehicle systems, I FEE Tran.. Control Syst. Technol. 15(3) (2007), pp. 566-580.]. In this work, the NMPC formulation will be used in order to derive two different approaches. The first relies on a full tenth-order vehicle model and has high computational burden. The second approach is based on a simplified bicycle model and has a lower computational complexity compared to the first. The effectiveness of the proposed approaches is demonstrated through simulations and experiments.

AB This paper presents a neural network adaptive controller for autonomous diving control of an autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) using adaptive backstepping method. In general, the dynamics of underwater robotics vehicles (URVs) are highly nonlinear and the hydrodynamic coefficients of vehicles are difficult to be accurately determined a priori because of variations of these coefficients with different operating conditions. In this paper, the smooth unknown dynamics of a vehicle is approximated by a neural network, and the remaining unstructured uncertainties, such as disturbances and unmodeled dynamics, are assumed to be unbounded, although they still satisfy certain growth conditions characterized by 'bounding functions' composed of known functions multiplied by unknown constants. Under certain relaxed assumptions pertaining to the control gain functions, the proposed control scheme can guarantee that all the signals in the closed-loop system satisfy to be uniformly ultimately bounded (UUB). Simulation studies are included to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed control scheme, and some practical features of the control laws are also discussed.

AB Connected and Autonomous Vehicles (CAVs) combine technologies of autonomous vehicles (AVs) and connected vehicles (CVs) to develop quicker, more reliable, and safer traffic. Artificial Intelligence (AI)-based CAV solutions play significant roles in sustainable cities. The convergence imposes stringent security requirements for CAV safety and reliability. In practice, vehicles are developed with increased automation and connectivity. Increased automation increases the reliance on the sensor-based technologies and decreases the reliance on the driver; increased connectivity increases the exposures of vehicles' vulnerability and increases the risk for an adversary to implement a cyber-attack. Much work has been dedicated to identifying the security vulnerabilities and recommending mitigation techniques associated with different sensors, controllers, and connection mechanisms, respectively. However, there is an absence of comprehensive and in-depth studies to identify how the cyber-attacks exploit the vehicles' vulnerabilities to negatively impact the performance and operations of CAVs. In this survey, we set out to thoroughly review the security issues introduced by AV and CV technologies, analyze how the cyber-attacks impact the performance of CAVs, and summarize the solutions correspondingly. The impact of cyber-attacks on the performance of CAVs is elaborated from both viewpoints of intra-vehicle systems and inter-vehicle systems. We pointed out that securing the perception and operations of CAVs would be the top requirement to enable CAVs to be applied safely and reliably in practice. Additionally, we suggested to utilize cloud and new AI methods to defend against smart cyber-attacks on CAVs.

AB The main problem in bringing autonomy to any vehicle lies in the design of a suitable guidance law. For truly autonomous operation, the vehicle needs to have a reliable Navigation, Guidance and Control (NGC) system of which the guidance system is the key element that generates suitable trajectories to be followed. In this review paper. various guidance laws found in the literature and their relevance to autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVS) are discussed. Since existing guidance laws for underwater vehicles have emulated from tactical airborne missile systems. a number of approaches for the missile guidance systems are considered. Finally, potential guidance strategies for AUVs are proposed.

AB The improvement of energy performance for platoons of autonomous connected vehicles is one of the major challenges the road transport sector is facing with. To this aim, this work addresses and solves the energy-consumption problem for uncertain heterogeneous electric nonlinear autonomous vehicles platoon via a novel Eco-Driving Control Architecture able to optimize its energy consumption performance while ensuring the fulfillment of the optimal leader tracking trajectory. Specifically, it consists of a Nonlinear Model Predictive Control (NMPC) strategy, driving the leader motion and computing the optimal ecological trajectory to be imposed on the whole platoon, and a novel distributed exponentially-stable robust PID-like protocol, driving the follower vehicles motion for achieving a precise leader-tracking with a desired transient behavior as required for the accurate implementation of the energy-saving control. The exponential stability of the overall vehicular network is analytically proven with the Lyapunov theory and the derived robust stability conditions allow the proper tuning of the control gains on the basis of the desired decay rate. The efficiency of the proposed approach is corroborated via the high-fidelity Mixed Traffic Simulator (MiTraS) co-simulation platform under different operative scenarios and a wide uncertainty range for the vehicles parameters. Simulation results confirm how the proposed architecture ensures the eco-driving behaviour for the whole vehicles platoon.

AB A robust tube MPC controller based on tube-division with a linear time-varying (LTV) model is proposed for autonomous vehicle path tracking. To reduce the conservativeness, a novel offline method is designed to calculate the tubes by dividing the original N-steps invariant sets into sequences of tighter candidate tubes. The propagation limits of the vehicle time-varying parameters within a prediction horizon are used in the division to ensure each candidate tube contains any state trajectory starting at its origin. A corresponding tube will be selected instead of being calculated online at each sampling instant in terms of vehicle states, which makes a more efficient online computation. The results of the simulation show the improved performance of the proposed robust tube MPC controller.

AB This paper provides an in-depth description of the best rated human-machine interface that was presented during the 2016 Grand Cooperative Driving Challenge. It was demonstrated by the Chalmers Truck Team as the envisioned interface to their open source software framework OpenDLV, which is used to power Chalmers' fleet of self-driving vehicles. The design originates from the postulate that the vehicle is fully autonomous to handle even complex traffic scenarios. Thus, by including external and internal interfaces, and introducing a show, don't tell principle, it aims at fulfilling the needs of the vehicle occupants as well as other participants in the traffic environment. The design also attempts to comply with, and slightly extend, the current traffic rules and legislation for the purpose of being realistic for full-scale implementation.

AB This paper describes a vision-based system for inspections of underwater structures, e.g., pipelines, cables, etc., by an autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV). Usually, underwater inspections are performed by remote operated vehicles (ROVs) driven by human operators placed in a support vessel. However, this task is often challenging, especially in conditions of poor visibility or in presence of strong currents. The system proposed allows the AUV to accomplish the task in autonomy. Moreover, the use of a three-dimensional (3-D) model of the environment and of an extended Kalman filter (EKF) allows the guidance and the control of the vehicle in real time. Experiments done on real underwater images have demonstrated the validity of the proposed method and its efficiency in the case of critical and complex situations.

AB The impacts of autonomous vehicles (AV) on safety, energy and atmospheric emissions have been recognised to be important issues, but an air quality impact assessment is missing. In this study, by using a numerical modelling approach, the impact of AV on the air quality of a medium-sized Portuguese urban area was evaluated. For that, the air pollutants nitrogen oxides (NOx) and carbon dioxide (CO2) were considered and three scenarios were developed: i) a baseline scenario; ii) an autonomous scenario, assuming an AV market penetration rate of 30%; and iii) an electric autonomous scenario, taking into account that those 30% of AV are pure battery electric cars. A modelling system composed by a road traffic model, a road transport emission model and a Computational Fluid Dynamics air quality model was used. The autonomous scenario promoted an increase of both NOx (+1.8%) and CO2 (+0.7%) emissions, while the electric autonomous scenario resulted in emission reductions of about 30% for both air pollutants. In terms of air quality, distinct patterns were found: i) the autonomous scenario promoted both increases and decreases of NOx concentrations; and ii) the electric autonomous scenario promoted a widespread reduction of NOx concentrations (with an average value of -4%). Overall the results showed that AV have the potential to improve urban air quality, but, further research is needed to enrich the findings of this work. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

DE Autonomous articulated; vehicles; backing-up maneuvers; nonlinear
   dynamical systems
ID PATH-TRACKING; TRUCK; STABILIZATION
AB This paper presents an approach, based on the qualitative theory of nonlinear dynamical systems, for the analysis and design of control systems for autonomous articulated vehicles. In particular, backing-up maneuvers are considered. These maneuvers are dangerous because the vehicles tend to 'jackknife' when the angle between the tractor and the trailer is greater than a certain value. This danger is increased when the actuators are saturated because they can cause a lack of controllability in the state space and control becomes complicated. The paper proposes a two-level control system with an orientation controller in the lower level and a look-ahead controller in the higher. In the paper, a general orientation feedback controller is presented. This control strategy represents a wide family of different nonlinear controllers and can be applied with different particular control laws. The paper applies the qualitative theory of nonlinear dynamical systems to study the stability of the control system. Thus, the stability of the system under some constraints is demonstrated. The paper includes both simulation and experimental results of the implementation on the Romeo 4R autonomous vehicle, which is a full-size autonomous electrical golf cart with a trailer.

AB Shared autonomous vehicles (AVs) will soon be introduced in public transportation as cities and their transportation systems become 'smarter'. This brings long-term environmental, economic and societal benefits to cities. However, shared AVs will not only need to overcome technological challenges but also prevail against social barriers for successful marketplace penetration. Hence, we proposed and investigated the acceptance of four shared AV service designs for public use in this study, namely, autonomous buses, shuttles, AV rideshares and autonomous or robo-taxis. An online survey conducted in Singapore with 734 adults found the greatest receptiveness toward the introduction of autonomous shuttles, in part due to perceptions that they will perform well and be easy to adopt. This aligns with ongoing shared AV trials where AV shuttles are mostly used. Larger autonomous buses had the second-highest acceptance. AV rideshares and taxis seem to largely appeal to the existing regular users of the conventional counterparts of these services. These results suggest that to encourage a mode switch from public transport to ridesharing and taxis, or vice versa, shared AVs need to appeal to users beyond being an automated version of existing modes. That is, shared AVs need to address an underserved or unmet transportation need or population.

AB Research on the sixth-generation cellular networks (6G) is gaining huge momentum to achieve ubiquitous wireless connectivity. Connected autonomous vehicles (CAVs) is a critical vertical application for 6G, holding great potentials of improving road safety, road and energy efficiency. However, the stringent service requirements of CAV applications on reliability, latency, and high speed communications will present big challenges to 6G networks. New channel access algorithms and intelligent control schemes for connected vehicles are needed for 6G-supported CAV. In this article, we investigated 6G-supported cooperative driving, which is an advanced driving mode through information sharing and driving coordination. First, we quantify the delay upper bounds of 6G vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) communications with hybrid communication and channel access technologies. A deep learning neural network is developed and trained for the fast computation of the delay bounds in real-time operations. Then, an intelligent strategy is designed to control the intervehicle distance for cooperative autonomous driving. Furthermore, we propose a Markov chain-based algorithm to predict the parameters of the system states, and also a safe distance mapping method to enable smooth vehicular speed changes. The proposed algorithms are implemented in the AirSim autonomous driving platform. Simulation results show that the proposed algorithms are effective and robust with safe and stable cooperative autonomous driving, which greatly improve the road safety, capacity, and efficiency.

AB Intelligent connected vehicles interact and share information through people, vehicles, roads and clouds. Aiming at the problem of data privacy leakage in the process of sensing data sharing with intelligent connected vehicles, a privacy-preserving group-aware data privacy protection model was proposed. Firstly, to protect the privacy of data receiving interface circuit vehicles, an aggregation scheme based on differential privacy is designed. Secondly, to ensure the trustworthiness of the data receiving interface circuit vehicles, a reputation model of the data receiving interface circuit vehicles was constructed. Finally, a data sharing model was constructed based on the tolerance constraint of the sending vehicle to the result deviation and the privacy leakage compensation of the vehicle in the data receiving interface circuit. The revenue optimisation algorithm (DPOD) was used to solve the model, and the interaction reliability between the participating vehicle and the platform was optimised. The simulation results show that the testing results of the differential privacy model on the intelligent network platform are obviously improved. Therefore, the group-aware data privacy protection model can effectively serve the data privacy protection of autonomous sensor network data transmission, and has the prospect of popularisation in intelligent transportation.

AB One major key to autonomous driving is reliable knowledge about the vehicle's surroundings. In complex situations like urban intersections, the vehicle's on-board sensors are often unable to detect and classify all features of the environment. Therefore, high-precision digital maps are widely used to provide the vehicle with additional information. In this article, we introduce a system which makes use of a mobile edge computing architecture (MEC) for computing digital maps on infrastructure-based, distributed computers. In cooperation with the mobile network operator Vodafone an LTE test field is implemented at the Aldenhoven Testing Center (ATC). The proving ground thus combines an urban crossing with the MEC capabilities of the LTE test field so that the developed methods can be tested in a realistic scenario. In the near future the LTE test field will be equipped with the new 5G mobile standard allowing for fast and reliable exchange of map and sensor data between vehicles and infrastructure.

ID BEHAVIOR
AB Decision-making in uncontrolled intersection is one of the main challenges in urban autonomous driving. This paper proposed a new decision-making framework in uncontrolled intersection based on the intention prediction method and Mixed Strategy Nash Equilibrium theory. The framework is a three-stage method: target vehicle motion prediction, driving mode decision, and motion planning. The driving intention (left turn, right turn, or go straight) of the target vehicle at the intersection can be predicted using the combination algorithm of GMM-HMM and SVM. According to the driving intention and road structure, the trajectory fitting module would use the Bezier curve to fit the predicted trajectory of a target vehicle. Furthermore, combined with trajectories of the ego vehicle, the S-T diagram is used to judge whether there is a spatio-temporal conflict point of the target vehicle and ego vehicle. If there is a conflict point of the target vehicle and ego vehicle, the driving mode ('yield' or 'cross') of the ego vehicle is selected by using the Mixed Strategy Nash Equilibrium theory. This method can not only avoid premature or unnecessary deceleration due to conservation but also avoid a collision or violent deceleration due to greed. According to the driving mode, the planning module uses the model predictive control algorithm to determine the optimal acceleration strategy. Have been verified by the vehicle test, it indicates that the proposed decision-making framework can make ego vehicles pass through the intersection safely and comfortably.

AB A reliable yet economical unmanned surface vehicle (USV) has been developed for the bathymetric surveying of lakes. The system combines an autonomous navigation framework, environmental sensors, and a multibeam echosounder to collect submerged topography, temperature, and wind speed and monitor the vehicle's status during prescribed path-planning missions. The main objective of this research is to provide a methodological framework to build an autonomous boat with independent decision-making, efficient control, and long-range navigation capabilities. Integration of sensors with navigation control enabled the automatization of position, orientation, and velocity. A solar power integration was also tested to control the duration of the autonomous missions. The results of the solar power compared favorably with those of the standard LiPO battery system. Extended and autonomous missions were achieved with the developed platform, which can also evaluate the danger level, weather circumstances, and energy consumption through real-time data analysis. With all the incorporated sensors and controls, this USV can make self-governing decisions and improve its safety. A technical evaluation of the proposed vehicle was conducted as a measurable metric of the reliability and robustness of the prototype. Overall, a reliable, economic, and self-powered autonomous system has been designed and built to retrieve bathymetric surveys as a first step to developing intelligent reconnaissance systems that combine field robotics with machine learning to make decisions and adapt to unknown environments.

AB The paper introduces a high level speed control method for the coordination of multiple autonomous vehicles (AVs) in roundabout scenarios. The aim of the control method is to guarantee collision-free motion of the AVs, and similarly, to minimize their traveling time. In the method a priority-based ordering process of the AVs is used, which enforces the time-efficient motion of the AVs. The collision-free motion is guaranteed through an optimization-based method including control input constraints. The ordering process and the optimization form a low complexity solution, which requires low computation effort. The proposed control strategy is involved in the high level of a hierarchical control structure. The effectiveness of the proposed control strategy is illustrated by simulation examples and Hardware-in-the-Loop demonstration.

AB The mobility of people is at the center of transportation planning and decision-making of the cities of the future. In order to accelerate the transition to zero-emissions and to maximize air quality benefits, smart cities are prioritizing walking, cycling, shared mobility services and public transport over the use of private cars. Extensive progress has been made in autonomous and electric cars. Autonomous Vehicles (AV) are increasingly capable of moving without full control of humans, automating some aspects of driving, such as steering or braking. For these reasons, cities are investing in the infrastructure and technology needed to support connected, multi-modal transit networks that include shared electric Autonomous Vehicles (AV). The relationship between traditional public transport and new mobility services is in the spotlight and need to be rethought. This article proposes an agent-based simulation framework that allows for the creation and simulation of mobility scenarios to investigate the impact of new mobility modes on a city daily life. It lets traffic planners explore the cooperative integration of AV using a decentralized control approach. A prototype has been implemented and validated with data of the city of Trento.

AB Autonomous driving in off-road environments requires an exceptionally capable sensor system, particularly given that the unstructured environment does not provide many of the cues available in on-road environments. This paper presents a complex vision system, which is able to provide the two basic sensorial capabilities needed by autonomous vehicle navigation in extreme environments: obstacle detection and path detection. A variable-width-baseline (up to 1.5 m) single-frame stereo system is used for pitch estimation and obstacle detection, whereas a decision-network approach is used to detect the drivable path by a monocular vision system. The system has been field tested on the TerraMax vehicle, which is one of the only five vehicles to complete the 2005 Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) Grand Challenge course.

AB With the technical support of an intelligent networking environment, autonomous driving technology is facing a new stage of development, and the decision-making behavior of autonomous vehicles is changing fundamentally, so it is urgent to explore the lane-changing decision-making behavior mechanism of autonomous driving. Firstly, through the analysis of system similarity, the similarity between autonomous vehicles and moving molecules is sought, and the attraction and repulsion between molecules are applied to the lane-changing process of vehicles to effectively recognize the traffic scene of lane-changing vehicles. Secondly, the molecular interaction potential is introduced to unify the attraction and repulsion, and explore the dynamic influencing factors of lane-changing behavior for vehicles. Moreover, we systematically analyze the interaction relationship in the lane-changing process of Connected and Automated Vehicles, and establish the molecular interaction potential lane-changing model to explore the lane-changing decision-making behavior mechanism. Furthermore, we study the impact of micro lane-changing behavior on macro traffic flow. Finally, the SL2015 lane-changing model and the molecular interaction potential lane-changing model are compared and analyzed by using the SUMO platform. The results show that the speed fluctuation of Connected and Automated Vehicles based on the molecular interaction potential lane-changing model is reduced by 15.5%, and the number of passed vehicles is increased by 3.26% on average, which has better safety, stability, and efficiency. The molecular interaction potential modeling of lane-changing decision-making behavior for Connected and Automated Vehicles comprehensively considers the interaction relationship of dynamic factors in the traffic environment, and scientifically shows the lane-changing decision-making mechanism of Connected and Automated Vehicles.

AB Learning autonomous vehicle programming can be very challenging for students, especially when combined with robotic vehicle design and construction. This paper presents a methodology successfully used over the past six years to teach autonomy using a versatile platform built upon a commercially available product. A number of courses have been taught using the methodology at both the undergraduate and graduate levels. Students' ability to successfully learn and produce a solution to an autonomous robot control challenge has shown to be very effective.
