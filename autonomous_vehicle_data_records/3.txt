AB Understanding the surrounding environment is crucial for autonomous vehicles to make correct driving decisions. In particular, urban scene segmentation is a significant integral module commonly equipped in the perception system of autonomous vehicles to understand the real scene like a human. Any missegmentation of the driving scenario can potentially result in uncontrollable consequences such as serious accidents or the exception of the perception system. In this article, we investigate the vulnerability of the popular scene segmentation models designed with the backbones of deep neural networks (DNNs), which have been shown to be sensitive to adversarial attacks. Specifically, we propose an iterative projected gradient-based attack method that can effectively fool several DNN-based segmentation models with a remarkably higher attacking successful rate, and much smaller adversarial perturbations. Moreover, we also develop an adversarial training algorithm with min-max optimization style to enrich the robustness of the scene segmentation models. Extensive experiments on the Cityscape benchmark dataset consisting of large-scale urban scene images for autonomous vehicles demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed attack method, as well as the benefit of the adversarial training scheme for the scene segmentation models.

AB In this paper, an urban-based path planning algorithm that considered multiple obstacles and road constraints in a university campus environment with an autonomous micro electric vehicle (micro-EV) is studied. Typical path planning algorithms, such as A*, particle swarm optimization (PSO), and rapidly exploring random tree* (RRT*), take a single arrival point, resulting in a lane departure situation on the high curved roads. Further, these could not consider urban-constraints to set collision-free obstacles. These problems cause dangerous obstacle collisions. Additionally, for drive stability, real-time operation should be guaranteed. Therefore, an urban-based online path planning algorithm, which is robust in terms of a curved-path with multiple obstacles, is proposed. The algorithm is constructed using two methods, A* and an artificial potential field (APF). To validate and evaluate the performance in a campus environment, autonomous driving systems, such as vehicle localization, object recognition, vehicle control, are implemented in the micro-EV. Moreover, to confirm the algorithm stability in the complex campus environment, hazard scenarios that complex obstacles can cause are constructed. These are implemented in the form of a delivery service using an autonomous driving simulator, which mimics the Chungbuk National University (CBNU) campus.

ID ATTITUDE STABILIZATION
AB A quadrotor-like autonomous underwater vehicle that is similar to, yet different from quadrotor unmanned aerial vehicles, has been reported recently. This article investigates the stability and nonlinear controllability properties of the vehicle. First, the 12-degree-of-freedom model of the vehicle deploying an X shape actuation system is developed. Then, a stability property is investigated showing that the vehicle cannot be stabilized by a time invariant smooth state feedback law. After that, by adopting a nonlinear controllability analysis tool in geometric control theory, the small-time local controllability of the vehicle is analyzed for a variety of cases, including the vertical plane motion, the horizontal plane motion, and the three-dimensional space motion. Finally, different small-time local controllability conditions for different cases are developed. The result shows that the small-time local controllability holds for vertical plane motion and horizontal plane motion. However, the full degree of freedom kinodynamics model (i.e. 12 states) of the vehicle does not satisfy the small-time local controllability from zero-velocity states.

DE Autonomous vehicle navigation; Optimal planning; Waypoints generation;
   Multi-criteria optimization; Vehicle's kinematic constraints;

AB This paper deals with autonomous navigation of unmanned ground vehicles (UGV). The UGV has to reach its assigned final configuration in a structured environments (e.g. a warehouse or an urban environment), and to avoid colliding neither with the route boundaries nor any obstructing obstacles. In this paper, vehicle planning/set-points definition is addressed. A new efficient and flexible methodology for vehicle navigation throughout optimal and discrete selected waypoints is proposed. Combining multi-criteria optimization and expanding tree allows safe, smooth and fast vehicle overall navigation. This navigation through way-points permits to avoid any path/trajectory planning which could be time consuming and complex, mainly in cluttered and dynamic environment. To evaluate the flexibility and the efficiency of the proposed methodology based on expanding tree (taking into account the vehicle model and uncertainties), an important part of this paper is dedicated to give an accurate comparison with another proposed optimization based on the commonly used grid map. A set of simulations, comparison with other methods and experiments, using an urban electric vehicle, are presented and demonstrate the reliability of our proposals.

AB For autonomous vehicles, obstacle detection results using 3D lidar are in the form of point clouds, and are unevenly distributed in space. Clustering is a common means for point cloud processing; however, improper selection of clustering thresholds can lead to under-segmentation or over-segmentation of point clouds, resulting in false detection or missed detection of obstacles. In order to solve these problems, a new obstacle detection method was required. Firstly, we applied a distance-based filter and a ground segmentation algorithm, to pre-process the original 3D point cloud. Secondly, we proposed an adaptive neighborhood search radius clustering algorithm, based on the analysis of the relationship between the clustering radius and point cloud spatial distribution, adopting the point cloud pitch angle and the horizontal angle resolution of the lidar, to determine the clustering threshold. Finally, an autonomous vehicle platform and the offline autonomous driving KITTI dataset were used to conduct multi-scene comparative experiments between the proposed method and a Euclidean clustering method. The multi-scene real vehicle experimental results showed that our method improved clustering accuracy by 6.94%, and the KITTI dataset experimental results showed that the F1 score increased by 0.0629.

AB As the impact and complexity of disasters, either natural or man-made, have increased, collaborative operation of a group of unmanned vehicles attracts much attention for effective response in disaster environments. In particular, mission planning is crucial for an effective collaboration of multiple heterogeneous vehicle systems. This study presents a mission planning algorithm and its application procedure in disaster situations. In general, disaster response missions such as search, rescue, and oil spill tracking are complicated in nature and come in various forms. Therefore, the mission needs to be broken down into simpler tasks that are more readily achievable to autonomous vehicles without human intervention. This study also presents a set of algorithms for efficient initial search and task allocation. The performance and feasibility of the proposed methodologies are evaluated with numerical simulations.

AB In the literature, the intensive research effort has been made on the trajectory planning for autonomous vehicles, while the integration of the trajectory planner with the trajectory controller is less focused. This study proposes the spatiotemporal-based trajectory planner and controller by a two-level dynamically integrated structure. In the upper level, the best trajectory is selected among a group of candidate time-parameterised trajectories, while the target vehicle ending position and velocity can be satisfied. Then the planned trajectory is evaluated by checking the feasibility when the actual vehicle dynamic motion constraints are considered. After that, the lower level trajectory controller based on the vehicle dynamics model will control the vehicle to follow the desired trajectory. Numerical simulations are used to validate the effectiveness of the proposed approach, where the scenario of an intersection and the scenario of overtaking are applied to show that the proposed trajectory controller can successfully achieve the control targets. In addition, compared with the potential field method, the proposed method based on the four-wheel independent steering and four-wheel independent driving electric vehicle shows great advantages in guaranteeing the vehicle handling and stability.

AB In autonomous vehicle navigation, it usually involves a basic process of estimating the vehicle pose at one instant relative to the vehicle pose at a previous instant, and we refer to this process as temporal relative localization (TRL). Accurate and reliable TRL is valuable for vehicle localization and mapping which plays a fundamental role in autonomous vehicle navigation. A common way for realizing TRL is dead reckoning based on motion sensor such as inertial navigation system (INS). To augment the performance of INS based TRL, a nine-degree-of-freedom (9-DOF) vehicle dynamics model (VDM) is proposed as the system model for the filtering process of TRL; it can effectively characterize vehicle pitch and roll motion, especially in slope road scenarios. For better fault tolerance, a distributed fusion framework which consists of a master filter and two local filters for multi-source data fusion is introduced. The split covariance intersection filter (Split CIF) is applied to handle unknown temporal and spatial correlation that inevitably exists in such distributed fusion mechanism. A comparative experimental study demonstrates the advantage of the proposed method in terms of accuracy and robustness.

AB Reducing the response time of emergency vehicle(EV) is accompanied with many health and traffic-related benefits. New technologies can be utilised in creating a cooperative lane-changing behaviour for surrounding traffic to reduce the response time. In this research, the influence of lane-changing behaviour on the delay of EV and surrounding vehicles was studied in microscopic traffic simulation. A driving behaviour and a pre-emption algorithm were developed to prioritise EVs on a signalised corridor. Two areas in front of EV were defined including stopping and lane-changing areas with different behaviours in a connected and autonomous traffic environment. It was concluded that using stopping and lane-changing areas together is more favourable regarding the delays of both EV and surrounding traffic. Also, the results verified the presence of an optimum lane-changing threshold after which the EV delay became constant.

AB This paper describes an autonomous driving control algorithm based on skid steering for a Robotic Vehicle with Articulated Suspension (RVAS). The driving control algorithm consisted of four parts: speed controller for following the desired speed, trajectory tracking controller to track the desired trajectory, longitudinal tire force distribution algorithm which determines the optimal desired longitudinal tire force and wheel torque controller which determines the wheel torque command at each wheel to keep the slip ratio below the limit value as well as to track the desired tire force. The longitudinal and vertical tire force estimators were designed for optimal tire force distribution and wheel slip control. The dynamic model of the RVAS is validated using vehicle test data. Simulation and vehicle tests were conducted in order to evaluate the proposed driving control algorithm. Based on the simulation and test results, the proposed driving controller was shown to produces satisfactory trajectory tracking performance.

AB Pythagorean-hodograph (PH) curves offer distinct advantages in planning curvilinear paths for unmanned or autonomous air, ground, or underwater vehicles. Although several authors have discussed their use in these contexts, prior studies contain misconceptions about the properties of PH curves or invoke heuristic approximate constructions when exact methods are available. To address these issues, the present study provides a basic introduction to the key properties of PH curves, and describes some exact constructions of particular interest in path planning. These include (a) maintenance of minimum safe separations within vehicle swarms; (b) construction of paths of different shape but identical arc length, ensuring simultaneous arrival of vehicles travelling at a constant speed; (c) determination of the curvature extrema of PH paths, and their modification to satisfy a given curvature bound; and (d) construction of curvature-continuous paths of bounded curvature through fields of polygonal obstacles.

AB The intelligent control of autonomous vehicles is one of the most important challenges that intelligent transport systems face today. The application of artificial intelligence techniques to the automatic management of vehicle actuators enables the different Advanced Driver Assistance Systems (ADAS) or even autonomous driving systems, to perform a low level management in a very similar way to that of human drivers by improving safety and comfort. In this paper, we present a control schema to manage these low level vehicle actuators (steering, throttle and brake) based on fuzzy logic, an artificial intelligence technique that is able to mimic human procedural behavior, in this case, when performing the driving task. This automatic low level control system has been defined, implemented and tested in a Citroen C3 testbed vehicle, whose actuators have been automated and can receive control signals from an onboard computer where the soft computing-based control system is running.

AB This paper investigates the distributed circumnavigation problem by an autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) team to enclose a target. When the AUVs do not have a global coordinate system or a common reference direction, moreover when some vehicles cannot detect the target, this circumnavigation problem becomes challenging. The above situation is common in underwater environments and is taken into account in this paper. Considering the kinematic and dynamic models of vehicles, this paper proposes a cascade-based distributed control law. The proposed control law via local relative position measurement can realize a desired circumnavigation formation around the target. Furthermore, we show that with a radius determinant mechanism, this control law enables the vehicles which do not detect the target to keep a specified pattern without exchanging the target position information. Finally, simulations are provided to illustrate the result. (C) 2021 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB We are developing a novel framework, PRIDE (PRediction In Dynamic Environments), to perform moving object prediction (MOP) to assist unmanned ground vehicles in performing path planning within dynamic environments. In addition to predicting the location of moving objects in the environment, we have extended PRIDE to generate simulated traffic during on-road driving. In this paper, we explore applying the PRIDE-based traffic control algorithms for the performance evaluation of autonomous vehicles. Through the use of repeatable and realistic traffic simulation, one is able to evaluate the performance of an autonomous vehicle in an on-road driving scenario without the risk involved with introducing the vehicle into a potentially dangerous roadway situation. In addition, by varying a single vehicle's parameters (such as aggressivity), we can show how the entire traffic pattern is affected. We will describe the successes that have been achieved to date in a simulated environment, as well as enhancements that are currently being researched and expected in the near future.

AB Vital societal and industrial autonomous components are increasingly interconnected through communication networks to complete critical tasks cooperatively. However, as the reliability and trust requirements for connected autonomous systems continue to grow, the centralized communication and decision approaches that are in use today are reaching their limits. Focusing on autonomous driving applications, this paper proposes a resilient and trustworthy framework on wireless distributed consensus networks, where the communication links are less reliable or are even in the presence of incorrect local sensor readings/decisions. To accomplish that, a novel three stages consensus mechanism is proposed based on the practical Byzantine fault tolerance (PBFT), where the veto collection and gossip stages are designed to meet the stringent and complex requirements for a vehicle's maneuvers. A plan tree synthesis is also proposed to make consensus on a series of decisions while adopting network members' decision preferences. A detailed protocol including the distributed consensus, plan tree synthesis, dynamic grouping, etc. is proposed. Simulation results show that the proposed consensus mechanism is able to be reached and propagated through the network under poor wireless communication conditions and the presence of faulty vehicles with incorrect sensor readings. The result can be extended to other autonomous systems to significantly enhance safety in critical industrial applications.

ID MODEL-PREDICTIVE CONTROL
AB An approach to resilient planning and control of autonomous vehicles in multi-vehicle traffic scenarios is proposed. The proposed method is based on model predictive control (MPC), where alternative predictions of the surrounding traffic are determined automatically such that they are intentionally adversarial to the ego vehicle. This provides robustness against the inherent uncertainty in traffic predictions. To reduce conservatism, an assumption that other agents are of no ill intent is formalized. Simulation results from highway driving scenarios show that the proposed method in real-time negotiates traffic situations out of scope for a nominal MPC approach and performs favorably to state-of-the-art reinforcement-learning approaches without requiring prior training. The results also show that the proposed method performs effectively, with the ability to prune disturbance sequences with a lower risk for the ego vehicle.

AB Multi-modal fusion is a basic task of autonomous driving system perception, which has attracted many scholars' attention in recent years. The current multi-modal fusion methods mainly focus on camera data and LiDAR data, but pay little attention to the kinematic information provided by the sensors of the vehicle, such as acceleration, vehicle speed, angle of rotation. These information are not affected by complex external scenes, so it is more robust and reliable. In this article, we introduce the existing application fields of vehicle information and the research progress of related methods, as well as the multi-modal fusion methods based on information. We also introduced the relevant information of the vehicle information dataset in detail to facilitate the research as soon as possible. In addition, new future ideas of multi-modal fusion technology for autonomous driving tasks are proposed to promote the further utilization of vehicle information.

AB Unorganized traffic is a generalized form of travel wherein vehicles do not adhere to any predefined lanes and can travel in-between lanes. Such travel is visible in a number of countries e.g. India, wherein it enables a higher traffic bandwidth, more overtaking and more efficient travel. These advantages are visible when the vehicles vary considerably in size and speed, in the absence of which the predefined lanes are near-optimal. Motion planning for multiple autonomous vehicles in unorganized traffic deals with deciding on the manner in which every vehicle travels, ensuring no collision either with each other or with static obstacles. In this paper the notion of predefined lanes is generalized to model unorganized travel for the purpose of planning vehicles travel. A uniform cost search is used for finding the optimal motion strategy of a vehicle, amidst the known travel plans of the other vehicles. The aim is to maximize the separation between the vehicles and static obstacles. The search is responsible for defining an optimal lane distribution among vehicles in the planning scenario. Clothoid curves are used for maintaining a lane or changing lanes. Experiments are performed by simulation over a set of challenging scenarios with a complex grid of obstacles. Additionally behaviours of overtaking, waiting for a vehicle to cross and following another vehicle are exhibited.

ID ADAPTIVE CRUISE CONTROL
AB Connected Autonomous Vehicles (AVs) promise innovative solutions for traffic flow management, especially for congestion mitigation. Vehicle-to-Vehicle (V2V) communication depends on wireless technology where vehicles can communicate with each other about obstacles and make cooperative strategies to avoid these obstacles. Vehicle-to-Infrastructure (V2I) also helps vehicles to make use of infrastructural components to navigate through different paths. This paper proposes an approach based on swarm intelligence for the formation and evolution of platoons to maintain traffic flow during congestion and collision avoidance practices using V2V and V2I communications. In this paper, we present a two level approach to improve traffic flow of AVs. At the first level, we reduce the congestion by forming platoons and study how platooning helps vehicles deal with congestion or obstacles in uncertain situations. We performed experiments based on different challenging scenarios during the platoon's formation and evolution. At the second level, we incorporate a collision avoidance mechanism using V2V and V2I infrastructures. We used SUMO, Omnet++ with veins for simulations. The results show significant improvement in performance in maintaining traffic flow.

The VFF (Virtual Force Field) method, which is widely used in the field of mobile robotics, is modified for application to the autonomous navigation of marine vehicles. This Modified Virtual Force Field (MVFF) method can be used in either track-keeping or collision avoidance modes. Moreover, the operator can select a track-keeping pattern mode in the proposed algorithm. The collision avoidance algorithm has the ability to handle static and/or moving obstacles. The fuzzy expert rules are designed deliberately under COLREG guidelines. An extensive simulation study is used to verify the proposed method.

AB Featured Application
   This paper proposes taillight detection, stereo taillight matching, and taillight pairing methods for the stereo-vision-based nighttime vehicle-to-vehicle positioning process. This process can be used in advanced driver-assistance systems and autonomous vehicles.
   The stereo vision system has several potential benefits for delivering advanced autonomous vehicles compared to other existing technologies, such as vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) positioning. This paper explores a stereo-vision-based nighttime V2V positioning process by detecting vehicle taillights. To address the crucial problems when applying this process to urban traffic, we propose a three-fold contribution as follows. The first contribution is a detection method that aims to label and determine the pixel coordinates of every taillight region from the images. Second, a stereo matching method derived from a gradient boosted tree is proposed to determine which taillight in the left image a taillight in the right image corresponds to. Third, we offer a neural-network-based method to pair every two taillights that belong to the same vehicle. The experiment on the four-lane traffic road was conducted, and the results were used to quantitatively evaluate the performance of each proposed method in real situations.

AB Autonomous driving has the ability to reshape mobility and transportation by reducing road accidents, traffic jams, and air pollution. This can yield energy efficiency, convenience, and more productivity as significant driving time will be gained and used in other activities instead. Autonomous vehicles are complex systems consisting of several modules that perform perception, decision-making, planning, and control. Control is essential for achieving automatic driving; it is basically divided into longitudinal control that handles speed tracking and lateral control which ensures accurate steering. The latter is primordial in path tracking applications and recent research has witnessed a huge leap in this field. The aim of this paper is to provide a technical survey of the latest research on the lateral control of autonomous vehicles as well as to highlight technical challenges and limits for further developments.

Our approach is based on a velocity vector field, which is a closed-loop strategy that guides the vehicle towards the landing point and simultaneously enforces the shape of its trajectory. Relative position between the vehicle and the landing zone, which can be easily determined using visual sensors installed on-board, is the only information necessary to perform the landing. We present vector fields that can be used to land both fixed- and rotary-wing autonomous aircrafts. We also show experiments and simulations with a quadrotor equipped with a monocular camera to illustrate the characteristics of the proposed approach.

AB In optimization of a shared autonomous electric vehicle (SAEV) system, idle vehicle relocation strategies are important to reduce operation costs and customers' wait time. However, for an on-demand service, continuous optimization for idle vehicle relocation is computationally expensive, and thus, not effective. This study proposes a deep learning-based algorithm that can instantly predict the optimal solution to idle vehicle relocation problems under various traffic conditions. The proposed relocation process comprises three steps. First, a deep learning-based passenger demand prediction model using taxi big data is built. Second, idle vehicle relocation problems are solved based on predicted demands, and optimal solution data are collected. Finally, a deep learning model using the optimal solution data is built to estimate the optimal strategy without solving relocation. In addition, the proposed idle vehicle relocation model is validated by applying it to optimize the SAEV system. We present an optimal service system including the design of SAEV vehicles and charging stations. Further, we demonstrate that the proposed strategy can drastically reduce operation costs and wait times for ondemand services.

AB A fuzzy logic based general purpose modular control architecture is presented for underwater vehicle autonomous navigation, control and collision avoidance. Three levels of fuzzy controllers comprising the sensorfusion module, the collision avoidance module and the motion control module are derived and implemented. No assumption is made on the specific underwater vehicle type, on the amount of a priori knowledge of the 3-D undersea environment or on static and dynamic obstacle size and velocity. The derived controllers account for vehicle position accuracy and vertical stability in the presence of ocean currents and constraints imposed by the roll motion. The main advantage of the proposed navigation control architecture is its simplicity, modularity, expandability and applicability to any type of autonomous or semi-autonomous underwater vehicles. Extensive simulation studies are performed on the NPS Phoenix vehicle whose dynamics have been modified to account for roll stability.

AB The shortest distance between the vehicle's position and the path is used as control error for path control of autonomous vehicles. In order to determine this distance, the projection point onto the path needs to be determined continuously. This requires fast algorithms with high numerical reliability. Two approaches for the projection have been developed for the application and have been implemented in a controller concept. They are suitable for different path definitions. The first approach using bi-curves keeps the effort low by projection onto elementary curves and guarantees the required reliability by reformulating the problem. The second approach bases on an observer approach, considers the motion of the vehicle, and is applicable for arbitrary parameterized smooth curves.

AB Connected autonomous vehicles (CAVs) have emerged as a promising solution for enhancing transportation efficiency. However, the increased adoption of CAVs is expected to lead to a rise in transportation demand and, subsequently, higher energy consumption. In this context, electric CAVs (E-CAVs) present a significant opportunity to shape the future of efficient transportation systems. While conventional CAVs possess the potential to reduce fuel consumption, E-CAVs offer similar prospects but through distinct approaches. Notably, the control of acceleration and regenerative brakes in E-CAVs stands out as an area of immense potential for increasing efficiency, leveraging various control methods in conjunction with the cooperative and perception capabilities inherent in CAVs. To bridge this knowledge gap, this paper conducts a comprehensive survey of energy efficiency methods employed in conventional CAVs while also exploring energy efficiency strategies specifically tailored for E-CAVs.

AB Connected and autonomous vehicles (CAVs) are the future of personal and public transportation, but many security issues exist related to the communication and activity of such transportation means. Beyond the obvious, these security issues raise important safety concerns for a CAV's human occupants. Our focus is on the ubiquitous use of controller area network (CAN) bus technology for internal vehicle networks (IVNs) and how we can secure them with the rigid implementation of zero trust. Through an analysis of current threat vectors, we propose a zero-trust architecture to fundamentally protect the individual components that make up a CAV's sensor and control network through the use of the CAN bus. We use a simulated environment to show how our architectural approach provides net benefits and offer thoughts on the application of the architecture to IVN use cases but also how it might be expanded to inter-CAV communication in the future.

AB This paper investigates the fault-tolerant path following control problem of autonomous ground electric vehicles with in-wheel motors through hierarchical control strategy. The sliding mode observer with boundary layer is designed to estimate the vehicle state, and the time-delay estimation method is used to compute the actuator fault. Considering the actuator fault, the fault-tolerant path following control strategy is proposed, in which the upper layer controller is developed to achieve path following control and guarantee vehicle stability simultaneously by sliding mode control method, and the lower layer controller is presented to achieve the control efforts of upper layer controller by adaptive orientated tire force allocation method. The simulations are implemented in the CarSim-Simulink co-simulation platform, and the simulation results have verified the effectiveness of proposed fault-tolerant path following control method.

AB The traditional neutral buoyancy underwater vehicle's carrying capacity is limited by space and displacement, making it difficult to meet the increasing demand for mission sensors. In light of this, a new type of negative-buoyancy autonomous underwater vehicle equipped with an autorotating rotor is proposed in this paper. Referring to the principle of air autorotating rotor, the negative-buoyancy autorotating-rotor autonomous underwater vehicle (NAAUV) adopts an autorotating rotor to provide lift and compensate for negative buoyancy, thus achieving effective navigation. Negative-buoyancy vehicles have greater carrying capacity, less use of buoyancy materials, smaller size of the vehicle, and lower resistance and energy consumption. To verify the working principle of NAAUV, a dynamic model is established and the navigation process of the vehicle is simulated. The results verify satisfactory navigation stability of the vehicle. Focus on the issue of the flapping and shimmy caused by inconsistent speeds of advancing and retreating rotor blades, the two-way fluid-structure interaction simulation method is adopted. As a result, flapping deformation and equivalent stress of the rotor are acquired. Because rotor material performance requirements are not strict, common metal materials can meet the requirements.

AB The technology for autonomous vehicles (AVs) has been advancing rapidly and is expected to cause systematic changes in our modes of travel. An increasing number of studies have explored people's preferences, acceptance, and adoption intention related to AVs in recent years, although AVs continue to be rare in regular traffic. This study reviewed 94 relevant studies from 2016 to 2021 in terms of their research contexts, paradigms, models applied, key influencing factors identified, and future research directions to provide an overview of these studies and summarize the state-of-the-art progress in AV acceptance. The review revealed that the descriptive studies outnumber the experimental ones, and approximately 80% of the reviewed studies focused on private-use AVs. Additionally, the questionnaire survey method was most frequently used to collect data, and a few human factors and ergonomic models were frequently used in the analysis. The proven key factors affecting people's acceptance in the literature and a few research gaps to be addressed in future studies were summarized. Subsequent studies were suggested to achieve more realistic settings through experimental method, and consider user attitude changes by pre- and post-ride or longitudinal researches. The influence of situational properties should be further discovered, and behavioral instead of intentional studies should be focused.The current development of AVs is mainly driven by the supply side rather than demand side; therefore, the findings of this study provide important insights for addressing and improving human acceptance of AVs, which in turn is expected to increase user demand in the future.

AB Introduction: This study aimed to investigate the characteristics and patterns of the connected and autonomous vehicle (CAV) involved crashes. Method: The crash data were collected from the reports of CAV involved crash submitted to the California Department of Motor Vehicles. The descriptive statistics analysis was employed to investigate the characteristics of CAV involved crashes in terms of crash location, weather conditions, driving mode, vehicle movement before crash occurrence, vehicle speed, collision type, crash severity, and vehicle damage locations. The bootstrap based binary logistic regressions were then developed to investigate the factors contributing to the collision type and severity of CAV involved crashes. Results: The results suggested that the CAV driving mode, collision location, roadside parking, rear-end collision, and one-way road are the main factors contributing to the severity level of CAV involved crashes. The CAV driving mode, CAV stopped or not, CAV turning or not, normal vehicle turning or not, and normal vehicle overtaking or not are the factors affecting the collision type of CAV involved crashes.

AB This paper presents the design and validation of a model-based H-infinity vehicle lateral controller for autonomous vehicles in a simulation environment. The controller was designed so that the position and orientation tracking errors are minimized and so that the vehicle is able to follow a trajectory computed in real-time by exploiting proper video-processing and lane-detection algorithms. From a computational point of view, the controller is obtained by solving a suitable LMI optimization problem and ensures that the closed-loop system is robust with respect to variations in the vehicle's longitudinal speed. In order to show the effectiveness of the proposed control strategy, simulations have been undertaken by taking advantage of a co-simulation environment jointly developed in Matlab/Simulink (c) and Carsim 8 (c). The simulation activity shows that the proposed control approach allows for good control performance to be achieved.

TI Evaluation of macroscopic fundamental diagram characteristics for a
   quantified penetration rate of autonomous vehicles
SO EUROPEAN TRANSPORT RESEARCH REVIEW
LA English
DT Article

ID AUTOMATED VEHICLES; MODEL
AB BackgroundThe availability of private vehicles with autonomous features is widespread nowadays. Various car manufacturers are providing attributes like collision warning, city automatic emergency braking, adaptive cruise control, pedestrian detection, lane-keeping assistance and lane departure warning, rear cross-traffic and blind-spot warning in their high-end models.PurposeSuch features can automatically manage the macroscopic fundamental traffic parameters such as speed, headway, etc adaptively. Consequently leading to a heterogeneous traffic stream with diverse car-following behaviour comprising completely manual/traditional (TVs) and autonomous vehicles (AVs). This questions the applicability of classic traffic flow theory relationships on such heterogeneous traffic streams.MethodologyThis paper focuses on developing the macroscopic fundamental diagram for such heterogeneous traffic streams based on the quantified penetration rate (QPR) for autonomous vehicles. The penetration rate is devised by taking into account user demographics, land usage and road network properties. QPR is used as an input for heterogeneous urban traffic stream scenarios to calculate the aggregated urban traffic network dynamics of flow and density for the same network. Travel time versus flow characteristics is evaluated based on calibrated hyperbolic urban link travel time function for both interrupted and uninterrupted flows following the aggregated speed and density output from MFDs for heterogeneous traffic streams. Also, two scenarios are generated for comparison to explain the improvement in the network characteristics together with a sensitivity analysis.ResultsCompared to the base scenario there could be 25-35% of AVs on the road networks based on the analysis in coming fifteen years. This increment in usage impacts the capacity of road networks positively by increasing it up to 59%.ConclusionsResults obtained after the application of the suggested model approach to the real network can be used to define a realistic method for multi-vehicle equilibrium assignment models for heterogeneous traffic streams including autonomous vehicles instead of approximating the penetration rates.

AB This paper considers the main challenges for all components engaged in the driving task suggested by the automation of road vehicles or autonomous cars. Numerous autonomous vehicle developers often invest an important amount of time and effort in fine-tuning and measuring the route tracking to obtain reliable tracking performance over a wide range of autonomous vehicle speed and road curvature diversities. However, a number of automated vehicles were not considered for fault-tolerant trajectory tracking methods. Motivated by this, the current research study of the Differential Lyapunov Stochastic and Decision Defect Tree Learning (DLS-DFTL) method is proposed to handle fault detection and course tracking for autonomous vehicle problems. Initially, Differential Lyapunov Stochastic Optimal Control (SOC) with customizable Z-matrices is to precisely design the path tracking for a particular target vehicle while successfully managing the noise and fault issues that arise from the localization and path planning. With the autonomous vehicle's low ceilings, a recommendation trajectory generation model is created to support such a safety justification. Then, to detect an unexpected deviation caused by a fault, a fault detection technique known as Decision Fault Tree Learning (DFTL) is built. The DLS-DFTL method can be used to find and locate problems in expansive, intricate communication networks. We conducted various tests and showed the applicability of DFTL. By offering some analysis of the experimental outcomes, the suggested method produces significant accuracy. In addition to a thorough study that compares the results to state-of-the-art techniques, simulation was also used to quantify the rate and time of defect detection. The experimental result shows that the proposed DLS-DFTL enhances the fault detection rate (38%), reduces the loss rate (14%), and has a faster fault detection time (24%) than the state of art methods.

AB The paper presents preliminary research whose main goal is to build a ship protection system. One of the elements of the system will be a sub-system responsible for capturing and destroying/neutralizing all dangerous objects occurring inside a guarded area. This task will be performed by a team of autonomous underwater vehicles. To construct a decision system for the vehicles, i.e. the system whose task is to provide high-level decisions regarding direction and velocity of move, many different methods can be applied. Examples are evolutionary neural networks and expert systems with fuzzy decision rules. To test usefulness of the above methods in a role of the decision system, experiments in a predator-prey problem were carried out. In the experiments, the task of vehicles-predators was to capture a vehicle-prey behaving by a simple deterministic strategy. The current paper is a report on all the experiments mentioned.

AB Autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) are routinely used to survey areas of interest in seas and oceans all over the world. However, those operations requiring intervention capabilities are still reserved to manned submersibles or remotely operated vehicles (ROVs). In the recent years, few research projects have demonstrated the viability of a new type of submersible, the intervention AUV (I-AUV), which can perform underwater missions involving manipulations in a completely autonomous way. The EU FP7 TRIDENT project is one of the most recent examples of such technological concept. This paper describes the different mechatronic components that constitute the I-AUV developed for the TRIDENT project, their hardware and software integration, and the performance of the vehicle during the project trials.

AB Many path planning algorithms developed for land or air based autonomous vehicles no longer apply under the water. A time-optimal path planning method for autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs), based on a Markov decision process (MDP) algorithm, is proposed for the marine environment. Its performance is examined for different oceanic conditions, including complex coastal bathymetry and time-varying ocean currents, revealing advantages compared to the A* algorithm, a traditional path planning method. The ocean current is predicted using a regional ocean model and then provided to the MDP algorithm as a priori. A computation-efficient and feature-resolved spatial resolution are determined through a series of sensitivity experiments. The simulations demonstrate the importance to incorporate ocean currents in the path planning of AUVs in the real ocean. The MDP algorithm remains robust even if the ocean current is complex.

AB Highly automated vehicles are making their way towards implementation in many modes of transportation, including shipping. From the safety perspective, it is critically important that such vehicles or the operators overseeing them maintain their sense of the environment, also referred to as situational awareness. The present study investigates the worldwide research effort focusing on situational awareness for autonomous transport and explores how the maritime domain could benefit from it. The results indicate that most of the research originates from the automotive sector, but the topic is developing fast in other transportation modes too. Some findings have been shared across the modes of transportation, but only to a limited extent. Although technology development is performed based on the achievements within basic research domains, there has been little feedback from applied sciences. Similarly, collaborative research is not strongly developed.

AB Some species of fish are able to alter their mode of swimming to interact with naturally produced vortices; the use of these gaits reduces the energy expended by the fish. To analyse the feasibility of autonomous underwater vehicles replicating these gaits, a series of experiments are performed with unpowered rigid and flexible bodies positioned in the Karman wake of a rigid cylinder. Simple motion capture techniques are used to capture the bodies' lateral and upstream motion in the flow. The results demonstrate that manufactured bodies are capable of passively mimicking fish behaviours, to a limited extent. More importantly, it was concluded that while significant upstream movement was possible for a manufactured object, it was achievable irrespective of the stiffness of the material. For autonomous underwater vehicles operating in unsteady flow regimes, an ability to utilise energy-saving gaits may improve the range or operational time.

AB An on-road vehicle localization scheme is proposed to keep a track of an ego vehicle with respect to the ego/target lane center, using the results of the camera-based lane recognition. A vehicle's lateral motion model is first developed in terms of lane curve tracking error states, which is assumed to satisfy the clothoid road constraint. The proposed vehicle localization scheme computes vehicle's state, such that advanced state space control can be applied at a constant fast rate. Utilizing multirate characteristics of each sensor, a multirate decentralized state estimator is developed, which exhibits robust convergence against uncertain slow update period of the camera-based lane recognition. Performance and robustness of the proposed on-road vehicle localization scheme is verified through the computational and experimental tests using camera-based lane recognition.

AB In this paper, an intelligent navigation system for an unmanned underwater vehicle powered by renewable energy and designed for shadow water inspection in missions of a long duration is proposed. The system is composed of an underwater vehicle, which tows a surface vehicle. The surface vehicle is a small boat with photovoltaic panels, a methanol fuel cell and communication equipment, which provides energy and communication to the underwater vehicle. The underwater vehicle has sensors to monitor the underwater environment such as sidescan sonar and a video camera in a flexible configuration and sensors to measure the physical and chemical parameters of water quality on predefined paths for long distances. The underwater vehicle implements a biologically inspired neural architecture for autonomous intelligent navigation. Navigation is carried out by integrating a kinematic adaptive neuro-controller for trajectory tracking and an obstacle avoidance adaptive neuro-controller. The autonomous underwater vehicle is capable of operating during long periods of observation and monitoring. This autonomous vehicle is a good tool for observing large areas of sea, since it operates for long periods of time due to the contribution of renewable energy. It correlates all sensor data for time and geodetic position. This vehicle has been used for monitoring the Mar Menor lagoon.

AB This paper presents an indirect adaptive control method for an autonomous underwater vehicle-manipulator system (UVMS) based on an extended Kalman filter (EKF). This method overcomes the disadvantages of existing disturbance observers and direct adaptive control schemes, which are based on linear system techniques and regressor-based techniques. The proposed control scheme can be applied to UVMSs for various purposes such as payload compensation, interaction effects compensation, underwater current or external disturbance compensation, reaction compensation, and independent system control. The performance of the proposed controller was demonstrated numerically by payload compensation, where it compensated for the reaction effects experienced during a manipulation task, and disturbance (underwater current) compensation in a UVMS with a six degrees of freedom (DOF) underwater vehicle and a 3-DOF underwater manipulator.

DT Article
DE Model Predictive Control; autonomous vehicles; interactive systems
ID SYSTEMS; MPC
AB Stochastic Model Predictive Control (SMPC) has attracted increasing attention for autonomous driving in recent years, since it enables collision-free maneuvers and trajectory planning and can deal with uncertainties in a non-conservative way. Many promising strategies have been proposed on how to use SMPC to select appropriate maneuvers and plan safe trajectories in uncertain environments. The limitation of these approaches is that they focus on scenarios where only one vehicle is controlled by SMPC and is, thus, reacting to the surrounding vehicles; however, the surrounding vehicles do not react to the SMPC-controlled vehicle, which means there is no mutual interaction. However, when multiple autonomous vehicles are driving on the road, each individual vehicle will take the behavior of the other surrounding vehicles into account and adjust its individual decisions accordingly in trajectory planning. This paper, therefore, examines in simulations how the interactive control system of multiple SMPC-controlled vehicles behave based on a Distributed SMPC (DSMPC) framework. For a three-lane highway scenario, we first investigate the effects of the risk parameter of the collision avoidance probabilistic constraint on non-interactive and interactive vehicle systems and provide insights into how to parameterize the controllers in interactive vehicle systems.

AB Cooperative vehicle management emerges as a promising solution to improve road traffic safety and efficiency. This paper addresses the speed planning problem for connected and autonomous vehicles (CAVs) at an unsignalized intersection with consideration of turning maneuvers. The problem is approached by a hierarchical centralized coordination scheme that successively optimizes the crossing order and velocity trajectories of a group of vehicles so as to minimize their total energy consumption and travel time required to pass the intersection. For an accurate estimate of the energy consumption of each CAV, the vehicle modeling framework in this paper captures 1) friction losses that affect longitudinal vehicle dynamics, and 2) the powertrain of each CAV in line with a battery-electric architecture. It is shown that the underlying optimization problem subject to safety constraints for powertrain operation, cornering and collision avoidance, after convexification and relaxation in some aspects can be formulated as two second-order cone programs, which ensures a rapid solution search and a unique global optimum. Simulation case studies are provided showing the tightness of the convex relaxation bounds, the overall effectiveness of the proposed approach, and its advantages over a benchmark solution invoking the widely used first-in-first-out policy. The investigation of Pareto optimal solutions for the two objectives (travel time and energy consumption) highlights the importance of optimizing their trade-off, as small compromises in travel time could produce significant energy savings.

AB There has been a rapid rise in papers modelling the impacts of autonomous vehicles. Drawing on a review of this literature, we analyse and discuss the messages conveyed by these studies from a policy-making perspective. An overview of the studies is provided to highlight the different policy frames. We consider the roles that modelling knowledge should have in policy-making in the context of unstable and uncertain futures where novel transport modes bring into question the use of past knowledge and assumptions. We conclude that both limitations of, and assumptions in, models need to be made more explicit and accessible when used in policy-making.

AB This paper proposes a navigation situation assessment method for autonomous surface vehicles (ASVs) in a cooperative hunting environment. By virtue of the repulsion function expressed in the artificial potential field, the navigation situation of hunting ASVs and target ASVs is firstly described. And the hunting situation is also constructed to describe the cooperative hunting. Based on the navigation situation and the hunting situation, a navigation situation assessment method for cooperative hunting of multiple ASVs is designed, where the number of hunting vehicles and the hunting radius can be successfully computed. Simulation results show that this proposed situation assessment method can give an optimised formation pattern and provide an effective reference for cooperative hunting of ASVs.

This primitive is a parameterized quintic spline, denoted as,eta-spline, that allows interpolating an arbitrary sequence of points with overall second-order geometric (G(2)-) continuity. Issues such as completeness, minimality, regularity, symmetry, and flexibility of these G(2)-splines are addressed in the exposition. The development of the new primitive is tightly connected to the inversion control of nonholonomic car-like vehicles. The paper also exposes a supervisory strategy for iterative steering that integrates feedback vision data processing with the feedforward inversion control.

AB We conducted a comprehensive investigation into the relationship between autonomous vehicles (AVs) and the built environment (BE). We explored how various potential changes in transportation by AVs may influence the BE using the D-variables: density, diversity, design, and destination accessibility. Our review revealed that AVs could cause drastic changes to all aspects of the BE; however, the extent of these changes strongly depends on uncertainties in technology, policy, and transportation modes. Further research into AVs-BE relationships should focus on developing comprehensive scenarios, accounting for these uncertainties and regional and social characteristics.

AB With the maturity and development of autonomous driving technology, mixed autonomous and manual vehicle traffic will become the main form of traffic flow in the future. First, conservative and radical lane change models of manual and autonomous vehicles in the weaving area are constructed to further study the freeway traffic capacity. Additionally, this study uses US-101 and Jinbao interchange trajectory data to fit the conservative-radical model switching point distribution function for manual vehicles. Moreover, simulation experiments determine the optimal switching point position of an autonomous vehicle lane-changing model to optimize traffic flow in the weaving area. Based on gap acceptance theory, the method considers the distribution of model switching points, estimates the ideal safe gap for each type of lane change, calculates the occurrence probability of different lane change types of vehicles, and determines the expected number of lane-changing vehicles in each weaving lane. Then, a capacity model of the weaving area considering man-machine mixed traffic flow is constructed using linear programming. Then, this study uses MATLAB to determine the optimal value of the linear programming model and compares the SUMO simulation results with the theoretical analysis results. The results show that when the autonomous vehicle penetration rate is 20%, 50% and 80%, the deviation rates of the optimal solution of the theoretical model and the simulation results are 4.7%, 9.1%, and 9.2%, respectively, verifying the reliability of the traffic capacity model. The proposed traffic capacity model of the weaving area under mixed traffic flow can provide technical support for the planning and design of the weaving area and improving its traffic operation state. & COPY; 2023 Elsevier B.V.

AB Autonomous and assisted driving in city urban areas is a challeging topic that needs to be addressed during the following ten to twenty years. In the current work an attempt in this direction is carried out by using vision-based systems not only for autonomous vehicle driving, but in helping the driver recognize vehicles, and traffic signs. Some well consolidated results have been attained on a private test circuit using a commercial Citroen Berlingo as described in this paper.

AB This paper investigates the level of model fidelity needed in order for a model predictive control (MPC)-based obstacle avoidance algorithm to be able to safely and quickly avoid obstacles even when the vehicle is close to its dynamic limits. The context of this work is large autonomous ground vehicles that manoeuvre at high speed within unknown, unstructured, flat environments and have significant vehicle dynamics-related constraints. Five different representations of vehicle dynamics models are considered: four variations of the two degrees-of-freedom (DoF) representation as lower fidelity models and a fourteen DoF representation with combined-slip Magic Formula tyre model as a higher fidelity model. It is concluded that the two DoF representation that accounts for tyre nonlinearities and longitudinal load transfer is necessary for the MPC-based obstacle avoidance algorithm in order to operate the vehicle at its limits within an environment that includes large obstacles. For less challenging environments, however, the two DoF representation with linear tyre model and constant axle loads is sufficient.

AB This paper examines ground based (as opposed to satellite based) sensing methods for vehicle position fixing. Sensors are considered in various categories, motion measurement (odometry, inertial), artificial landmarks (laser positioning, millimetre wave radar), and local feature detection (sonar, machine vision). Particular emphasis is paid to technologies which have proven successful beyond the field of agriculture, and to machine vision because of its topicality. The importance of sensor fusion, using a sound theoretical framework, is emphasised. The most common technique, the Kalman filter, is outlined and practical points are discussed. As an example system, the autonomous vehicle developed at Silsoe Research Institute is described. This vehicle does not use an absolute positioning system, rather it navigates using local features, in this case the crop plants. This vehicle uses a sensor package that includes machine vision, odometers, accelerometers, and a compass, where sensor fusion is accomplished using an extended Kalman filter.

AB This paper shows how the development of an intelligent vehicle application can benefit from using standard mobile robotics elements in general, and a development framework in particular. This framework, ThinkingCap-II, has been successfully used in other robotics applications. It consists of a series of modules and services that have been developed in Java and allows the distribution of these modules over a network. The framework facilitates reusing components and concepts from other developments, which permits increasing the performance of the intelligent vehicle development. This fact is especially useful for small research groups. A two car convoy application has been implemented using this architecture and the development of an autonomous vehicle. Both the ThinkingCap-II and the autonomous vehicle architectures are described in detail. Finally some experiments are presented. Simulated experiments are used to validate the convoy model, testing the activation of the different behaviors in the decision-making process. Real experiments show the actual working of the developed intelligent vehicle application. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

We develop a distributed, hybrid decision-making framework for safe and efficient autonomous driving of selfish vehicles on multi-lane highways, where each dynamics is modeled as a mixed-logical-dynamical system. We formalize the coordination problem as a generalized mixed-integer potential game, seeking an equilibrium solution that generates almost individually optimal mixed-integer decisions, given the safety constraints. Finally, we embed the proposed best-response-based algorithms within the distributed open- and closed-loop control policies.

AB Autonomous vehicles currently suffer from a time-inefficient driving style caused by uncertainty about human behavior in traffic interactions. Accurate and reliable prediction models enabling more efficient trajectory planning could make autonomous vehicles more assertive in such interactions. However, the evaluation of such models is commonly oversimplistic, ignoring the asymmetric importance of prediction errors and the heterogeneity of the datasets used for testing. We examine the potential of recasting interactions between vehicles as gap acceptance scenarios and evaluating models in this structured environment. To that end, we develop a framework aiming to facilitate the evaluation of any model, by any metric, and in any scenario. We then apply this framework to state-of-the-art prediction models, which all show themselves to be unreliable in the most safety-critical situations.

AB This study investigates empty vehicle redistribution algorithms for personal rapid transit and autonomous taxi services. The focus is on passenger service and operator cost. A new redistribution algorithm is presented in this study: index-based redistribution (IBR). IBR is a proactive method, meaning it takes into account both current demand and anticipated future demand, in contrast to reactive methods, which act based on current demand only. From information on currently waiting for passengers, predicted near-future demand and projected arrival of vehicles, IBR calculates an index for each vehicle station, and redistribution is done based on this index. Seven different algorithm combinations are evaluated using a test case in Paris Saclay, France (20 stations and 100 vehicles). A combination of simple nearest neighbours and IBR is shown to be promising. Its results outperform the other methods tested in peak and off-peak demand, in terms of average and maximum passenger waiting times as well as station queue length. The effect of vehicle fleet size on generalised cost is analysed. Waiting times, mileage and fleet size are taken into account while assessing this generalised cost.

AB In this paper, a novel adaptive sliding mode controller (SMC) was designed based on a robust law considering disturbances and uncertainties for autonomous ground vehicle (AGV) longitudinal dynamics. The robust law was utilized in an innovative method involving the upper bounds of disturbances and uncertainties. Estimating this lumped uncertainty upper limit based on a neural network approach allowed its online knowledge. It guided the controller to withstand the disturbance and to compensate for the uncertainties. A stability analysis, according to Lyapunov, was completed to confirm the asymptotic convergence of the states to the desired state. The effectiveness and benefits of the planned approach were scrutinized by simulations and comparative studies.

AB Establishing a line-of-sight link between autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) is an unavoidable challenge for realizing high data rate optical communication in ocean exploration. We propose a method for link establishment by maintaining the relative position and orientation between AUVs. Using a reinforcement learning algorithm, we search for the policy that can suppress external disturbances and optimize the link establishment efficiency. To evaluate the performance of the proposed method, we prepared a hovering AUV to conduct the link establishment experiments. The reinforcement learning policy trained in a simulation environment was deployed on the AUV in real environments. In field experiments, our approach successfully performed the link establishment from the hovering AUV to an autonomous surface vehicle. Based on the experimental results, we evaluate the performance of the AUV in executing the link establishment policy. Comparisons with existing optical search-based link establishment methods are presented.

AB With the growing popularity of autonomous vehicles, ensuring their safety has become a significant concern. Vehicle manufacturers have incorporated the Android operating system to enhance user convenience. However, the Android operating system's diversity and vulnerability may significantly impact autonomous vehicles because these natures lead to a critical threat in autonomous vehicle security: Android malware. The complex nature of multi-data sources fusion in autonomous driving systems has resulted in low detection efficiency and accuracy for Android malware. Given the security requirements for autonomous-driving systems, this article presents an Android malware classification method centered around the multifeature fusion and deep learning architecture designed to detect and classify Android malware within autonomous-driving systems. The proposed MUDROID framework relies on the Android permission mechanism and behavioral feature to formulate a malware classification model. Comprising four essential components-feature extraction, representation, multifeature fusion, and classifier training, MUDROID leverages the advantages of CNN and GCN combination model and is adept at extracting and interpreting multidimensional features, consequently constructing a multifeature fusion classifier to amplify the efficiency and accuracy of Android malware detection and classification. The experiment results support MUDROID's superior classification performance, with an impressive Android malware detection accuracy rate of 98.69% and family classification (95.42%). The proposed method can detect and classify Android malware effectively, thus elevating the security and robustness of the self-driving system. Additionally, the approach in this article also addresses feature representation issues in detecting malware variants, facilitating the recognition of Android malware variants across diverse platforms.

ID WIRELESS COMMUNICATIONS; 5G MOBILE; VISION
AB Recently, 5G and beyond 5G (B5G) systems, Ultrareliable Low Latency Network (URLLC) represents the key enabler for a range of modern technologies to support Industry 4.0 applications, such as transportation and healthcare. Real-world implementation of URLLC can help in major transformations in industries like autonomous driving, road safety, and efficient traffic management. Furthermore, URLLC contributes to the objective of fully autonomous cars on the road that can respond to dynamic traffic patterns by collaborating with other vehicles and surrounding environments rather than relying solely on local data. For this, the main necessity is that how information is to be transferred among the vehicles in a very small time frame. This requires information to be transferred among the vehicles reliably in extremely short time duration. In this paper, we have implemented and analyzed the Multiaccess Edge Computing- (MEC-) based architecture for 5G autonomous vehicles based on baseband units (BBU). We have performed Monte Carlo simulations and plotted curves of propagation latency, handling latency, and total latency in terms of vehicle density. We have also plotted the reliability curve to double-check our findings. When the RSU density is constant, the propagation latency is directly proportional to the vehicle density, but when the vehicle density is fixed, the propagation latency is inversely proportional. When RSU density is constant, vehicle density and handling latency are strictly proportional, but when vehicle density is fixed, handling latency becomes inversely proportional. Total latency behaves similarly to propagation latency; that is, it is also directly proportional.

AB Failure to maintain a safe driving distance between moving vehicles is one of the major causes of traffic accidents. Research on maintaining a safe distance with autonomous vehicles is especially important. This paper uses the Hilbert-Huang transform (HHT) method and error estimation to analyze the frequency modulated continuous wave (FCMW) signal of Doppler radar for autonomous vehicle applications. The FMCW signal is decomposed into intrinsic mode functions (IMF) using the empirical mode decomposition (EMD) method. The Doppler radar signal is then reproduced through the Hilbert spectrum obtained using the instantaneous amplitude and instantaneous frequency. The characteristics of the motion of the object are obtained by analyzing the reconstructed Doppler radar signal. The simulation and verification results confirm that this method can accurately estimate the distance between vehicles within the range of 20 similar to 120 meters at speeds of 50 similar to 230 km/h. Error estimation is also obtained based on the distance to the car in front and the vehicle's speed. This study contributes by the application of the proposed Hilbert-Huang transform (HHT) method for the analysis of the frequency modulated continuous wave (FCMW) signal of Doppler radars. The method of this study has been applied to multi-target detection. In this simulation, there are 5 targets, each with a different distance from the car and the speed of the car. The simulation results show that the proposed method can improve the accuracy of the sensor in terms of estimating the distance, reliability and stability of the vehicle, and can increase the safety of the autonomous vehicles.

AB Parametric modeling uncertainties and unknown external disturbance are major concerns in the development of advanced lateral motion controller for autonomous vehicle at the limits of driving conditions. Considering that tyre operating at or close to its physical limits of friction exhibits highly nonlinear force response and that unknown external disturbance can be caused by changing driving conditions, this paper presents a novel lateral motion control method that can maintain the yaw stability of autonomous vehicle while minimizing lateral path tracking error at the limits of driving conditions The proposed control scheme consists of a robust steering controller and an adaptive neural network (ANN) approximator. First, based on reference path model, dynamics model and kinematics model of vehicle, the robust steering controller is developed via backstepping variable structure control (BVSC) to suppress lateral path tracking deviation, to withstand unknown external disturbance and guarantee the yaw stability of autonomous vehicle. Then, by combining adaptive control mechanism based on Lyapunov stability theory and radial basis function neural network (RBFNN), the ANN approximator is designed to estimate uncertainty of tyre cornering stiffness and reduce its adverse effects by learning to approximate arbitrary nonlinear functions, and it ensures the uniform ultimate boundedness of the closed-loop system. Both simulation and experiment results show that the proposed control strategy can robustly track the reference path and at the same time maintains the yaw stability of vehicle at or near the physical limits of tyre friction.

AB Traffic congestion has large economic and social costs. The introduction of autonomous vehicles can potentially reduce this congestion by increasing road capacity via vehicle platooning and by creating an avenue for influencing people's choice of routes. We consider a network of parallel roads with two modes of transportation: 1) human drivers, who will choose the quickest route available to them, and 2) a ride hailing service, which provides an array of autonomous vehicle route options, each with different prices, to users. We formalize a model of vehicle flow in mixed autonomy and a model of how autonomous service users make choices between routes with different prices and latencies. Developing an algorithm to learn the preferences of the users, we formulate a planning optimization that chooses prices to maximize a social objective. We demonstrate the benefit of the proposed scheme by comparing the results to theoretical benchmarks that, we show, can be efficiently calculated.

AB Taking advantages of connected and autonomous vehicle (CAV) technologies, this paper proposes to optimize the departure times, travel routes, and longitudinal trajectories of CAVs, as well as signal timings at intersections to achieve a stable traffic state, where no vehicles need to stop before entering any intersection and no queue spillover occurs at any intersection. The departure times, travel routes and signal timings are optimized in central controller, while the vehicle trajectories can be optimized by distributed roadside processors, which together form a hierarchical traffic management scheme. The conventional NEMA phasing structure is applied for signal control, so that no additional safety issue needs to be considered inside crowded intersections. Two mixed-integer nonlinear programs are proposed for achieving the stable traffic state on arterials and in grid networks. Numerical tests are performed to demonstrate the two programs.

ID VECTOR MAGNETOMETER
AB Geomagnetic field signals have potential for use in underwater navigation and geophysical surveys. To map underwater geomagnetic fields, we propose a method that exploits an autonomous surface vehicle. In our system, a magnetometer is rigidly attached to the vehicle and not towed by a cable, minimizing the system's size and complexity but requiring a dedicated calibration procedure due to magnetic distortion caused by the vehicle. Conventional 2-D methods can be employed for the calibration by assuming the horizontal movement of the magnetometer, and the proposed 3-D approach can correct for horizontal misalignment of the sensor. Our method does not require a supporting crane system to rotate the vehicle, and calibrates and maps simultaneously by exploiting data obtained from field operation. The proposed method has been verified experimentally in inland waters, generating a magnetic field map of the test area that is of much higher resolution than the public magnetic field data.

AB Digitalization and automation play essential roles in how companies create value for their customers in emerging industries, including autonomous vehicle solutions (AVSs) and automated driving. In this study, we explore digital servitization business models in the context of AVS ecosystems. We utilize publicly available company data to discuss cases that illustrate the emerging business models of AVSs in the business-to-business (B2B) context. We contribute to research on autonomous solutions by identifying four types of AVSs: (i) advanced-data -assisted solutions, (ii) semiautonomous platooning solutions, (iii) autonomous demarcated solutions, and (iv) autonomous swarmed solutions. We advance digital servitization and business model research by revealing business models associated with those AVSs, namely: (i) safety as a service, (ii) efficiency as a service, (iii) ca-pacity as a service, and (iv) flexibility as a service. By combining these three fields of research, we enrich the digital servitization research and address the current gap in research on autonomous solutions by focusing on business models. Our analysis enables the development of novel conceptual tools for autonomous solutions and servitization driven by digitalization. Moreover, we suggest the concept of business model fluidity to explain rapid and autonomous business model changes and adaptation to different use contexts and customer contexts.

AB This study presents a three-lane highway overtaking strategy for an automated vehicle, which is based on a heuristic planning reinforcement learning algorithm. The proposed decision-making controller focuses on keeping the autonomous vehicle operating safely and efficiently. First, the modelling of the overtaking driving scenario is introduced and the reference approaches named intelligent driver model and minimise overall braking induced by lane changes are formulated. Second, the Dyna-H algorithm, which combines the modified Q-learning algorithm with a heuristic planning policy, is utilised for highway overtaking decision-making. Three different heuristic strategies are formulated to improve learning efficiency and compare performance. This algorithm is applied to determine the lane change and speed selection for an ego vehicle in the environment with uncertainties. Finally, the performance of Dyna-H is estimated in the autonomous overtaking scenario by comparing it with the reference and traditional learning methods. Furthermore, the Dyna-H-enabled decision-making strategies are validated and analysed in an open-sourcing driving dataset. Results prove that the proposed decision-making strategy could produce superior performance in convergence rate and control.

AB Autonomous driving is a cornerstone of the automotive industry's strategy to meet future mobility needs of consumers. Despite being essential for successful adoption, consumers' motives regarding fully autonomous vehicles remain unclear. By collecting data from 25 in-depth laddering interviews in Germany and applying means-end chain analysis, we qualitatively explore the overarching motivational structures underlying consumers' perception of autonomous driving with Level 5 automation. The results show three overarching motives: self-fulfillment, security and responsibility. Self-fulfillment relates to the meaningful utilization of disposable driving time for enhancing career success, nurturing social connections, and enhancing one's quality of life. Security includes the desire for improvements in personal integrity and the fear of insufficient safety while driving fully autonomously. Responsibility expresses the longing to behave in a responsible manner and the fear of accountability for the actions of autonomous vehicles. Contrary to previous findings, the loss of driving pleasure, environmental, and ethical concerns have only secondary relevance. Considering these motivational patterns, we draw implications for managers and policy makers to facilitate market penetration and support a successful adoption of autonomous driving vehicles.

AB This paper proposes a two-stage optimization framework for generating the optimal parking motion trajectory of autonomous ground vehicles. The motivation for the use of this multilayer optimization strategy relies on its enhanced convergence ability and computational efficiency in terms of finding optimal solutions under the constrained environment. In the first optimization stage, the designed optimizer applies an improved particle swarm optimization technique to produce a near-optimal parking movement. Subsequently, the motion trajectory obtained from the first stage is used to start the second optimization stage, where gradient-based techniques are applied. The established methodology is tested to explore the optimal parking maneuver for a car-like autonomous vehicle with the consideration of irregularly parked obstacles. Simulation results were produced and comparative studies were conducted for different mission cases. The obtained results not only confirm the effectiveness but also reveal the enhanced performance of the proposed optimization framework.

ID LOCALIZATION
AB Mobile edge computing has been proposed as a solution for solving the latency problem of traditional cloud computing. In particular, mobile edge computing is needed in areas such as autonomous driving, which requires large amounts of data to be processed without latency for safety. Indoor autonomous driving is attracting attention as one of the mobile edge computing services. Furthermore, it relies on its sensors for location recognition because indoor autonomous driving cannot use a GPS device, as is the case with outdoor driving. However, while the autonomous vehicle is being driven, the real-time processing of external events and the correction of errors are required for safety. Furthermore, an efficient autonomous driving system is required because it is a mobile environment with resource constraints. This study proposes neural network models as a machine-learning method for autonomous driving in an indoor environment. The neural network model predicts the most appropriate driving command for the current location based on the range data measured with the LiDAR sensor. We designed six neural network models to be evaluated according to the number of input data points. In addition, we made an autonomous vehicle based on the Raspberry Pi for driving and learning and an indoor circular driving track for collecting data and performance evaluation. Finally, we evaluated six neural network models in terms of confusion matrix, response time, battery consumption, and driving command accuracy. In addition, when neural network learning was applied, the effect of the number of inputs was confirmed in the usage of resources.

AB Based on the reviewed literature, the objective of the article is to investigate the most important cyberattack factors affecting the effectiveness of the connected and autonomous transport system. Accordingly, remotely implemented malicious interventions are in the focus of our study, especially considering cyberattacks on connected and autonomous vehicles. To introduce the expected impact of the analysed cyberattacks, certain cyberattack types are demonstrated in the paper. In the paper, malicious interventions are assumed to attack the transport network contrary to the individual road users, which assumption can strongly increase the risk of a given cyber-incident. To illustrate the effect of the evaluated cyberattacks, the transport system of Budapest is used. According to the results, some of the interventions might not be effective, while some of them can expectedly significantly increase travel time values of the network.

TI Can a Conventional Propulsion System Match the Efficiency of an
   Underwater Glider Buoyancy Engine?
SO MARINE TECHNOLOGY SOCIETY JOURNAL
LA English
DT Article
DE autonomous underwater vehicle; energy efficiency; robotics
AB Autonomous underwater gliders are a family of autonomous vehicles used for a long-range, long-term observation of oceanic environments. To do this, they leverage changes in net buoyancy and the resulting vertical motion to generate forward locomotion via hydrodynamic surfaces. To function for extended periods, these systems operate in a low-speed, low-drag regime. Conventionally propelled underwater vehicles typically operate at speeds in excess of those achievable by gliders and therefore require more energy in order to compensate for losses due to hydrodynamic drag. An interesting question arises when considering the operational efficiencies of conventionally propelled systems when they operate at speeds typical of underwater gliders. A first-principles energy-based approach to glider operations was derived and verified using real-world data. The energy usage for buoyancy-driven propulsion was compared to conventional propulsion types. The results from these calculations indicate that a conventionally propelled autonomous underwater vehicle can compete with a buoyancy-driven system given the proper propulsive efficiency.

AB To ensure safe overtaking of intelligent vehicles in dynamic interactive environments, this paper proposes an end-to-end learning method for autonomous overtaking based on Graph Convolutional Network (GCN) and Conditional Imitation Learning (CIL). This method completes the autonomous overtaking behavior by directly mapping the environmental perception data to the underlying vehicle control actions (e.g. throttle and steer angle). This method fully considers the influence of other vehicles' driving behavior on the overtaking behavior of the ego vehicle. Firstly, the dynamic interactive environments information around the ego vehicle is aggregated in the form of graph-structured data, and the aggregated global features are used as the input of the GCN to output the optimal action instructions that the ego vehicle should take. Secondly, combined with CIL, the action instructions output by the GCN are used as high-level commands to guide CIL. Finally, combined with other perception data, the underlying control actions of the vehicle will be output by CIL to complete safe overtaking in dynamic interactive environments. The method proposed in this paper can effectively extract the global information of the driving scene and complete the collision-free autonomous overtaking behavior, which greatly improves the intelligence of the driving system. The feasibility of the method has been verified by experiments on the CARLA simulation platform. The experimental results prove that the performance of this method is better than that of the conventional end-to-end learning framework, and it has better success rate and generalization performance.

AB This letter investigates online high-definition (HD) map caching for autonomous driving in vehicular networks when vehicles' requests and trajectories are unknown in advance. We first introduce a general HD map model that divides each HD map into different sub-maps to accommodate different driving functionalities. Then we introduce a service model for road side units (RSUs) by considering both the freshness of the dynamic sub-maps that are locally saved at each vehicle and the retrieving cost of sub-maps that are not cached at RSUs but must be needed for high-level driving control. After that, we propose a distributed multi-agent multi-armed bandit (MAMAB) algorithm for each RSU to learn its own cache strategy independently for maximizing the accumulated cache utility over a finite time horizon. Simulation results are provided to validate the effectiveness of our proposed algorithm.

DE UUV; heading control; autonomous heading planning; ranging sonar; ROS
AB To address the challenge of unmanned underwater vehicle (UUV) autonomous navigation in long-distance underwater tunnel detection tasks and improve the control performance of its heading control system, a method of autonomous heading planning and control based on sonar-ranging feedback control was proposed. This method combines UUV's autonomous heading planning technology with the heading proportion-integral-derivative (PID) control algorithm, optimizing the acquisition method of controller input data, to impart specific adaptive characteristics to the controller. Using the ranging principle of ultrasonic spontaneous self-collection, it is possible to obtain the yaw direction and angle of the vehicle relative to the target heading in the tunnel and continuously adjust the control law to change the heading as the vehicle's heading status changes during navigation. The effectiveness of the autonomous heading planning and control method is verified through pool experiments. The analysis and experimental results show that the proposed heading planning method achieves good control effect in UUV's underwater tunnel detection heading control, and exhibits obvious advantages in long-distance closed tunnel environments. UUV can adaptively adjust the heading according to the tunnel environment and has a fast response and strong applicability in planning and controlling the heading.

AB The autonomous underwater vehicle has widespread applications in marine resource exploration, seabed search and rescue, underwater military reconnaissance, and marine environmental monitoring. Owing to the limited battery capacity, autonomous underwater vehicles usually only operate for several hours or days at a time. This article presents an extended-range wave-powered autonomous underwater vehicle (WPAUV) for underwater wireless sensor networks. Through theoretical analysis, simulation, dry and field experiments, the power generation performance of the extended-range WPAUV was evaluated. Under different wave amplitudes and wave frequencies, the mechanical efficiency of the extended-range WPAUV ranges from 20.41% to 81.56%. The average efficiency is 45.35%. In the field experiments, under calm ocean conditions, the maximum instantaneous power can reach 67.74W with an average of 10.18W. This high performance manifests that the extended-range WPAUV can effectively scavenge wave energy and converts it into electrical energy for expanding the cruising mileage.

AB Interpersonal roadway communication is a vital component of the transportation system. Road users communicate to coordinate movement and increase roadway safety. Future autonomous vehicle research needs to account for the role of interpersonal roadway communication. This literature review synthesizes research on interpersonal interaction between drivers, bicyclists, and pedestrians while also directing attention to implications for autonomous and connected vehicle research. Articles were collected from TRID, PsycINFO, Google Scholar, and ScienceDirect using search terms relevant to driving, communication, and vulnerable road users. The synthesis documents that interpersonal communication not only takes place but is also an important and understudied aspect of safe roadway travel. The review also found that road users employ a variety of communication methods that include gestures, facial expressions, and built-in vehicular devices. Comprehension of messages is influenced by several factors including culture, context, and experience. These results shed light on potential issues and challenges of interpersonal communication and the introduction of autonomous vehicles to the roadway.

AB To avoid the potential risk triggered by the failure of the conflict arbitration of autonomous vehicles, a driving intention prediction method based on the Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural network involving Temporal Pattern Attention (TPA) is proposed. To be more specific, the TPA is embedded into the LSTM network to improve predictive accuracy. Furthermore, for evaluating the risk of the candidate trajectory, a risk assessment based on the velocity obstacle method which considers influence factors such as time to collision and collision energy loss is proposed. Finally, the proposed trajectory prediction algorithm is verified with the Next Generation Simulation data set and actual vehicle experiment.

AB This paper presents the description of a novel uncertainty estimation method employed for the navigation of autonomous guided vehicles. In the proposed algorithm, the uncertainty of the odometric navigation system is estimated as a function of the actual maneuver being carried out, which is identified by navigation data themselves. The result is a recursive method for estimating the evolution of spatial uncertainty, which takes into account unknown systematic effects and uncorrelated effects due to kinematic model uncertainty. The method is explained starting from the measurement, models and its parameters as a function of the actual. maneuvers. A verification of covariance propagation estimate due to systematic effects was carried out by means of a Monte Carlo simulation method. Experimental verification was carried out using an autonomous vehicle. Compatibility between a reference environment-referred system and the uncertainty estimated by the proposed method was achieved in 95% of the trials.

AB Autonomous cars controlled by an artificial intelligence are increasingly being integrated in the transport portfolio of cities, with strong repercussions for the design and sustainability of the built environment. This paper sheds light on the urban transition to autonomous transport, in a threefold manner. First, we advance a theoretical framework to understand the diffusion of autonomous cars in cities, on the basis of three interconnected factors: social attitudes, technological innovation and urban politics. Second, we draw upon an in-depth survey conducted in Dublin (1,233 respondents), to provide empirical evidence of (a) the public interest in autonomous cars and the intention to use them once available, (b) the fears and concerns that individuals have regarding autonomous vehicles and (c) how people intend to employ this new form of transport. Third, we use the empirics generated via the survey as a stepping stone to discuss possible urban futures, focusing on the changes in urban design and sustainability that the transition to autonomous transport is likely to trigger. Interpreting the data through the lens of smart and neoliberal urbanism, we picture a complex urban geography characterized by shared and private autonomous vehicles, human drivers and artificial intelligences overlapping and competing for urban spaces.

   steering wheel angle model
AB Human drivers have rich and diverse driving characteristics on curved roads. Finding the characteristic quantities of the experienced drivers during curve driving and applying them to the steering control of autonomous vehicles is the research goal of this article. We first recruited 10 taxi drivers, 5 bus drivers, and 5 driving instructors as the representatives of experienced drivers and conducted a real car field experiment on six curves with different lengths and curvatures. After processing the collected driving data in the Frenet frame and considering the free play of a real car's steering system, it was interesting to observe that the shape enclosed by steering wheel angles and the coordinate axis was a trapezoid. Then, we defined four feature points, four feature distances, and one feature steering wheel angle, and the trapezoidal steering wheel angle (TSWA) model was developed by backpropagation neural network with the inputs were vehicle speeds at four feature points, and road curvature and the outputs were feature distances and feature steering wheel angle. The comparisons between TSWA model and experienced drivers, model predictive control, and preview-based driver model showed that the proposed TSWA model can best reflect the steering features of experienced drivers. What is more, the concise expression and human-like characteristic of TSWA model make it easy to realize human-like steering control for autonomous vehicles. Lastly, an autonomous vehicle composed of a nonlinear vehicle model and electric power steering (EPS) system was established in Simulink, the steering wheel angles generated by TSWA model were tracked by EPS motor directly, and the results showed that the EPS system can track the steering angles with high accuracy at different vehicle speeds.

AB This paper presents two acoustic-based techniques to solve the localization problem for an autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV). After a brief description of the Bayesian filtering framework, the paper analyses two of the most common underwater scenarios. Each scenario corresponds to one of the two localization techniques. The scenarios are as follows: map-based localization, when the environment is sufficiently distinctive; transponder-based localization for navigation in large and not distinctive environments. An environment is said to be distinctive when there are possible reference points. For example, a completely flat featureless sea floor is not considered as distinctive. The proposed techniques were validated in simulation. The map-based localization technique was also validated in trials with the autonomous underwater vehicles Ictineu and Nessie IV. The trials with Ictineu took place in an abandoned marina with Ictineu travelling along a trajectory that was more than 600m long. The trials with Nessie IV took place in a rectangular pool and during an AUV competition.

   lasers; Laser beams; Autonomous vehicles
AB Autonomous vehicles rely on their perception systems to acquire information about their immediate surroundings. It is necessary to detect the presence of other vehicles, pedestrians, and other relevant entities. Safety concerns and the need for accurate estimations have led to the introduction of lidar systems to complement camera- or radar-based perception systems. This article presents a review of state-of-the-art automotive lidar technologies and the perception algorithms used with those technologies. Lidar systems are introduced first by analyzing such a system?s main components, from laser transmitter to beamscanning mechanism. The advantages/disadvantages and the current status of various solutions are introduced and compared. Then, the specific perception pipeline for lidar data processing is detailed from an autonomous vehicle perspective. The model-driven approaches and emerging deep learning (DL) solutions are reviewed. Finally, we provide an overview of the limitations, challenges, and trends for automotive lidars and perception systems.

AB An accurately predicted dynamic model is essentially required to design a robust control system for an autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) maneuvering in six degrees of freedom. The dynamic model consists of hydrodynamic derivatives which include inertial and damping coefficients. Traditionally, these coefficients can be estimated through Analytical and Semi-Empirical (ASE) methods, Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD), and through experiments such as captive or free model testing. Additionally, System Identification (SI) estimators, e.g. extended Kalman filter, are also employed to predict the complete set of parameters. Recently, with the advent of Artificial Intelligence (AI) in almost every field of science, supervised machine learning algorithms such as Support Vector Machine (SVM) and neural network algorithms are also being applied to predict the coefficients with lesser computational cost and higher accuracy. Additionally, AI based parametric and non-parametric modeling of autonomous marine vehicles have also been discussed. Accordingly, the contributions of researchers and scientists, with respect to the evolution and application of these important techniques for marine vehicles, particularly torpedo-shaped AUVs, done over the past more than 75 years, have been thoroughly surveyed and sequentially consolidated in this article. At the end, based on the survey, merits and demerits of each technique over the others have been highlighted and published results have also been discussed to evaluate the effectiveness of these estimation techniques for autonomous underwater vehicles.

AB The present work aims to study how deep learning approaches solve the safety problems in the interaction between autonomous vehicles and pedestrians. A Vehicle-Pedestrian Detection (VPD) algorithm based on Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) is proposed regarding the massive amounts of parameters during feature extraction of traditional vehicle-pedestrian interaction algorithms. Furthermore, the Squeezenet algorithm is applied to extract traffic characteristics with fewer parameters. The performance of the proposed algorithm is analyzed through simulation experiments. Results demonstrate that when the successful transmission probability reaches 100% and the lambda value is 0.01-0.05, the proposed algorithm can provide the result closest to the actual value, with the smallest data delay and the highest data transmission security. In different categories, the proposed algorithm can provide the highest accuracy as the number of iterations increases compared with other algorithms (AlexNet, DenseNet, VGGNet, IGCNet, and ResNet), which can accurately forecast traffic safety accidents. The proposed algorithm can provide an accuracy of 81.98%, an improvement of at least 1.94% over other advanced CNNs, and at least 3.3% over algorithms included in comparative simulations. Hence, it can recognize and identify safe interactions between autonomous vehicles and pedestrians. Through experiments, the constructed algorithm can significantly reduce the data transmission delay, improve the prediction accuracy of the safe interaction between autonomous vehicles and pedestrians, and increase the recognition accuracy remarkably, which can provide experimental references for the intelligent development of the transportation industry in the future.

TI Design and Implementation of Digital Twin-Assisted Simulation Method for
   Autonomous Vehicle in Car-Following Scenario
SO JOURNAL OF SENSORS
LA English
DT Article
AB The automated system replaces the driver, which makes autonomous vehicle to improve safety and convenience, so the market of autonomous vehicle is huge. However, the real-world application of autonomous vehicles faces many challenges due to the immaturity of automated systems. As a consequence, simulation verification plays an irreplaceable role in the application of autonomous vehicle (AV). Car-following is the most common driving scenario in mixed traffic flows, so it is essential to develop an appropriate and effective simulation method for AV. Combined with the existing AV simulation methods and digital twin (DT) technology, this paper proposes a DT-assisted method for AV simulation in a car-following scenario. The method makes the physical vehicle interact with the DT vehicle, and the DT vehicle can dynamically regulate the physical entities through real-time simulation data; the simulation verification can be displayed in the DT scenario to ensure the security of the simulation. Meanwhile, a DT-assisted simulation framework of AV is proposed, the framework includes physical entity components, DT components, and data processing and evaluation components. Besides, a DT-assisted simulation platform is developed base on Unity engine. Finally, the DT-assisted simulation of AV in the car-following scenario is implemented in field experiment. The experimental results show that the proposed method can be effectively conducted AV simulation in car-following, and the average of communication latency is 52.3 ms, which is smaller than the update frequency 15 Hz (66.6 ms) between DT-assisted platform and AV. The DT-assisted simulation method of AV proposed in this paper is applied in the car-following scenario, which effectively solves the challenges of car-following scenario simulation through virtual-real interaction.

AB Self-driving cars and autonomous vehicles are revolutionizing the automotive sector, shaping the future of mobility altogether. Although the integration of novel technologies such as Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Cloud/Edge computing provides golden opportunities to improve autonomous driving applications, there is the need to modernize accordingly the whole prototyping and deployment cycle of AI components. This paper proposes a novel framework for developing so-called AI Inference Engines for autonomous driving applications based on deep learning modules, where training tasks are deployed elastically over both Cloud and Edge resources, with the purpose of reducing the required network bandwidth, as well as mitigating privacy issues. Based on our proposed data driven V-Model, we introduce a simple yet elegant solution for the AI components development cycle, where prototyping takes place in the cloud according to the Software-in-the-Loop (SiL) paradigm, while deployment and evaluation on the target ECUs (Electronic Control Units) is performed as Hardware-in-the-Loop (HiL) testing. The effectiveness of the proposed framework is demonstrated using two real-world use-cases of AI inference engines for autonomous vehicles, that is environment perception and most probable path prediction.

AB In the vast ocean, many ecologically important phenomena are temporally episodic, localized in space, and move according to local currents. To effectively study these complex and evolving phenomena, methods that enable autonomous platforms to detect and respond to targeted phenomena are required. Such capabilities allow for directed sensing and water sample acquisition in the most relevant and informative locations, as compared against static grid surveys. To meet this need, we have designed algorithms for autonomous underwater vehicles that detect oceanic features in real time and direct vehicle and sampling behaviors as dictated by research objectives. These methods have successfully been applied in a series of field programs to study a range of phenomena such as harmful algal blooms, coastal upwelling fronts, and microbial processes in open-ocean eddies. In this review we highlight these applications and discuss future directions.

ID URBAN; COLLISION; DISCRETE
AB Certifying the behavior of autonomous systems is essential to the development and deployment of systems in safety-critical applications. This paper presents an approach to using a correct-by-construction controller with the probabilistic results of dynamic obstacle anticipation, and validates the approach with experimental data obtained from Cornell's full-scale autonomous vehicle. The obstacle anticipation (used to calculate the probability of collision with dynamic obstacles around the vehicle) is abstracted to a set of Boolean observations, which are then used by the synthesized controller (a state machine generated from temporal logic task specifications). The obstacle anticipation, sensor abstraction, and synthesized controller are implemented on a full-scale autonomous vehicle, and experimental data are collected and compared with a formal analysis of the probabilistic behavior of the system. A comparison of the results shows good agreement between the formal analysis and the experimental results. (C) 2017 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

AB Vehicle dynamics plays a significant role on the formation of a vehicle platoon, especially at high speed condition. This paper proposes a distributed platoon formation framework for homogeneous autonomous vehicles which takes the vehicle dynamics into consideration. The boundaries of vehicle stability are firstly calculated by considering both lateral dynamics and actuator saturation. By combining the stability boundaries with multi-objective flocking (MOF) algorithm, a distributed formation controller is designed, which can form the vehicle platoon with high cruising speed steadily and rapidly. In addition, a low-level tracking controller is proposed to constitute a hierarchical control architecture which can achieve stable and accurate formation of platoon. Simulation results show the proposed platoon formation controller achieves safe, stable and rapid platoon formation than the traditional MOF-based formation controller which does not consider the vehicle dynamics.

AB Facilitated by advances in real-time sensing, low and high-level control, and machine learning, autonomous vehicles draw ever-increasing attention from many branches of knowledge. Neuromorphic (brain-inspired) implementation of robotic control has been shown to outperform conventional control paradigms in terms of energy efficiency, robustness to perturbations, and adaptation to varying conditions. Here we propose LiDAR-driven neuromorphic control of both vehicle's speed and steering. We evaluated and compared neuromorphic PID control and online learning for autonomous vehicle control in static and dynamic environments, finally suggesting proportional learning as a preferred control scheme. We employed biologically plausible basal-ganglia and thalamus neural models for steering and collision-avoidance, finally extending them to support a null controller and a target-reaching optimization, significantly increasing performance.

AB Recently, there have been significant advances in self-driving cars, which will play key roles in future intelligent transportation systems. In order for these cars to be successfully deployed on real roads, they must be able to autonomously drive along collision-free paths while obeying traffic laws. In contrast to many existing approaches that use prebuilt maps of roads and traffic signals, we propose algorithms and systems using Unified Map built with various onboard sensors to detect obstacles, other cars, traffic signs, and pedestrians. The proposed map contains not only the information on real obstacles nearby but also traffic signs and pedestrians as virtual obstacles. Using this map, the path planner can efficiently find paths free from collisions while obeying traffic laws. The proposed algorithms were implemented on a commercial vehicle and successfully validated in various environments, including the 2012 Hyundai Autonomous Ground Vehicle Competition.

TI Object Detection in Dense and Mixed Traffic for Autonomous Vehicles With

SO IEEE ACCESS
LA English

DE Object detection; deformable convolution; autonomous vehicle; deep

AB Autonomous vehicles rely on the accurate detection and recognition of objects in their surroundings, a critical requirement for safe operation, especially in congested traffic with diverse vehicle types. This study presents a novel dataset collected in various road conditions in Indonesia, and it focuses on the detection and classification of visual objects around autonomous vehicles. Object recognition is achieved through the use of YOLOv7-based deep learning, adapted to identify small, faint, and partially concealed objects. Key enhancements include the integration of a deformable layer and the transition from Non-Maximum Suppression (NMS) to Soft Non-Maximum Suppression (softNMS). The dataset comprises eight predefined custom classes commonly encountered in Indonesian traffic. We collected video data recordings of heavy traffic scenarios featuring a wide range of vehicle types as training and testing data. The object detection model is fine-tuned through transfer learning, with multiple learning configurations explored for comparison. Experimental results demonstrate that deep learning models trained with transfer learning outperform those trained from scratch. Specifically, the modified YOLOv7, referred to as YOLOv7-MOD, incorporates a deformable convolution layer for up-sampling, leading to a remarkable performance of 94.68% in Recall, 96.87% in Precision, and 95.76% in F1-score. The modification resulted in an additional performance increase of 1.05% on average compared to the original model. The findings indicate that YOLOv7-MOD enhances the precision of object detection and recognition compared to the original YOLOv7, making it a promising solution for autonomous vehicle perception systems.

AB A search vehicle routing algorithm is presented, inspired by thermalling in glider operations, for use in unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) search routing problems where radio frequency signal noise affects target geolocation. We conduct ground testing experiments and observe that signal strength significantly deviates from its mean value - 10-20% variation in our experiments - at each distance epoch away from a target of interest. The thermalling algorithm uses straight-line segments and relatively simple guidance logic to generate routes that appear promising for fixed-wing, short endurance and autonomous UAV routing applications. We compare the simulated performance of the thermalling algorithm to a stochastic gradient descent algorithm using 1,000 randomly generated problem instances and show that, when considering signal readings and distance traveled as performance metrics, the thermalling algorithm performs better in 100% and 37% of problem instances respectively.

AB Taxi ride-sharing based on autonomous vehicles (AVs) is seen as a new and promising mode of urban mobility to promise a huge social and environmental benefits, such as conserving fuel, mitigating traffic congestions, reducing air pollution. Although a number of studies have focused on taxipooling or taxi ride-sharing, majority of these studies just concerned about the vehicle routing problem. Limited studies were conducted to excavate and understand the potential benefits of this new mobility mode through a comprehensively designed taxi ride sharing system. To fill this gap, this study tries to design an autonomous taxi ride-sharing system for commuting trips from the perspective of energy consumption, in which schedule (i.e., taxi type, taxi path, feet size) and depot location are optimized within a unified model. Based on this, we further evaluate its effectiveness in reductions of energy consumption and vehicle usage, and analyze the influences of several key factors on the system efficiency. Case studies show that the taxi ride-sharing service mode needs fewer vehicles than the private car travel mode, and outperforms the traditional taxi service mode in terms of fuel consumption. Moreover, it is found that trip density is an important influence factor on the benefits of taxi ride-sharing system. This study aims to provide transportation managers a good understanding of the energy benefits of well-designed autonomous taxi ride-sharing system.

TI Cooperative lateral vehicle control for autonomous valet parking
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF AUTOMOTIVE TECHNOLOGY

DE Lateral vehicle control; Dynamic surface control; Autonomous valet
   parking
AB This paper presents a lateral vehicle control algorithm for autonomous valet parking (AVP). Under the assumption that the position and heading angle are provided via vehicle-to-infrastructure (V2I) communication, the lateral controller aims to conduct two different driving maneuvers, i.e., forward driving and backward parking, and to control various types of vehicles in a unified approach. Therefore, it is necessary for the lateral controller to be robust enough to track the desired trajectories for different driving maneuvers, as well as to compensate for the uncertainty caused by the need to consider various vehicle types. With the assumption of operating conditions such as a low speed and small slip angle, a nonlinear kinematic model with kinematic constraints is used for the design of the lateral control. Based on this nonlinear model, a nonlinear control technique called dynamic surface control (DSC) is applied to design the lateral controller, and its stability is analyzed in the framework of linear differential inclusion. Finally, the proposed lateral control algorithm is validated through vehicle simulations and field tests.

AB Deterministic perception of the surrounding environment is both crucial and a challenging task for autonomous vehicles. A wide range of sensors, including LiDAR, RADAR, cameras, and so on, are used to build the perception layer of an autonomous vehicle. Many interfaces, such as OBD-II, Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, cellular networks, etc., have been introduced in autonomous vehicles to control various functionalities, including V2X communications, over-the-air updates, security, remote vehicle-health monitoring, and so on. These interfaces are introducing new attack surfaces that can be exploited via external as well as internal attacks. Attackers have successfully demonstrated how to exploit these attack surfaces by crafting attack vectors to launch both insider and external attacks. The sensor and sensor data are also vulnerable to both external and insider attacks. Developing safeguards against these attacks is a steppingstone toward the design and development of reliable autonomous vehicles. For instance, failure to detect and localize sensor data tampering can result in an erroneous perception of the environment and lead to wrong path-planning and control decisions. In this paper, we propose a novel semi-fragile data hiding-based technique for real-time sensor data integrity verification and tamper detection and localization. Specifically, the proposed data hiding-based method relies on 3-dimensional quantization index modulation (QIM)-based data hiding to insert a binary watermark into the LiDAR data at the sensing layer, which is used for integrity verification and tamper detection and localization at the decision-making unit, e.g., the advanced driver assistance system (ADAS). The performance of the proposed scheme is evaluated on a benchmarking LiDAR dataset. The impact of information hiding on the object-recognition algorithm is also evaluated. Experimental results indicate that the proposed method can successfully detect and localize data tampering attacks, such as fake object insertion (FOI) and target object deletion (TOD). Robustness to noise-addition attacks is also evaluated.

ID LONGITUDINAL CONTROL; CONTROL DESIGN; BOUNDEDNESS
AB We consider an autonomous vehicle platoon system consisting of N+1 vehicles in the presence of modeling uncertainty. The uncertainty may be due to parameter variations, aerodynamics, external disturbances, etc., which is nonlinear and time-varying. Subject to the collision avoidance consideration, the original state is one-sided restricted. To resolve this restriction, we propose a state transformation to convert the bounded state into a globally unbounded state. Furthermore, motivated by the properties of artificial swarm systems, we incorporate the swarm system performance into the platoon system by treating it as a d'Alembert's constraint. By the Udwadia and Kalaba's approach, we obtain the analytic (closed-form) expression of the constraint force. Based on this, a class of robust controls for each vehicle (except the leading vehicle) is proposed to drive the platoon system to follow the ideal swarm model. Four major system performances are accomplished: (i) compact vehicle formation, (ii) collision avoidance, (iii) stable platoon system formation, (iv) global behavior.

AB This paper proposes an intelligent safe driving system (ISDS) for autonomous vehicles. The system utilizes a hierarchical control framework, where the high-level and low-level controllers are responsible for the decision making and motion control respectively. In the high-level controller, two finite-state machines (FSMs) are applied. One of the FSMs identifies the relative positions of the surrounding vehicles to the subject vehicle, and the other one chooses the proper driving behaviors intelligently to deal with the complex situations. In the low-level controller, the double-model-predictive-control structure is designed for the lateral motion control, and the PID feedback control with the inverse model is employed for the longitudinal motion control. The proposed control system is tested in the Simulink/CarSim simulation environment. The results show that the controlled subject vehicle is able to avoid the collision with the surrounding vehicles and acquire the desired speed autonomously. The motion stability is also guaranteed during the accelerating/decelerating and lane changing.

AB Off-road autonomous navigation is one of the most difficult automation challenges from the point of view of constraints on mobility, speed of motion, lack of environmental structure, density of hazards, and typical lack of prior information. This paper describes an autonomous navigation software system for outdoor vehicles which includes perception, mapping, obstacle detection and avoidance, and goal seeking. It has been used on several vehicle testbeds including autonomous HMMWV's and planetary rover prototypes. To date, it has achieved speeds of 15 km/hr and excursions of 15 km.
   We introduce algorithms for optimal processing and computational stabilization of range imagery for terrain mapping purposes. We formulate the problem of trajectory generation as one of predictive control searching trajectories expressed in command space. We also formulate the problem of goal arbitration in local autonomous mobility as an optimal control problem. We emphasize the modeling of vehicles in state space form. The resulting high fidelity models stabilize coordinated control of a high speed vehicle for both obstacle avoidance and goal seeking purposes. An intermediate predictive control layer is introduced between the typical high-level strategic or artificial intelligence layer and the typical low-level servo control layer. This layer incorporates some deliberation, and some environmental mapping as do deliberative Al planners, yet it also emphasizes the real-time aspects of the problem as do minimalist reactive architectures.

AB Autonomous vehicles (AVs) and electric vehicles (EVs) will trigger disruptive changes to trans-portation systems via efficient driving, efficient use of travel time, reduced emissions and improved safety, mobility, roadway capacity, etc. However, these technologies might increase vehicle miles traveled (VMT), travel times, and ownership costs. Shared mobility systems can alleviate the high price of these technologies, but they will result in users' waiting time, incon-venience, and increased VMT. This study captures a variety of trade-offs in developing a fleet optimization multiclass user (with different value of travel time (VOTT)) problem considering AVs and EVs in both private and shared mobility systems. Two metaheuristic algorithms are developed and compared to solve the computationally complex large-scale non-linear optimiza-tion problem defined in this study. The case study (Ann Arbor, Michigan) results are sensitive to trip lengths, VOTT, emissions and travel time savings (in AVs). The proposed framework provide valuable insights for planning of emerging technologies.

AB The paper presents some fundamental issues when using a UWB (Ultra Wide Band) navigation system on a fast prototyping platform such as LEGO Mindstorms. The authors present the functional parameters of the chassis and show how it affects the navigation scheme of a UWB positioning system that consisted of four reference points and one tag, which was placed on the vehicle. The chassis was prepared on the Lego Mindstorms platform and the functional parameters such as axle angle, speed and delay were determined. The obtained results indicate that there are chassis limitations for using a UWB positioning system to navigate. The accuracy of reaching the destination point, which was equal to the size of the car that was constructed, was acceptable. The study also enabled us to conclude that this project could be the nucleus of a more complex scenario in smart autonomous robotics or public transport (support for small autonomous vehicles, electric personal transport vehicles, drones, ADAS systems, etc.).

AB This paper presents an approach of wheel slip constraint in controlling an autonomous four-wheeled steering and four-wheeled drive (4WS4WD) vehicle. This approach regards the quasi-steady state of the combined wheel slips as the target to limit. We introduce a control structure of wheel torque and wheel steering to transform the original constrained tracking problem to that of state regulation with norm-bounded control. For the transformed problem, an integral compensation with low-and-high gain technique is exploited to simultaneously eliminate steady-state error of the path tracking and enhance utilization of the constrained wheel slip. Simulation shows that the proposed scheme effectively renders the vehicle tracking along reference path within a prespecified threshold of wheel slip. Besides, a harmonious coordination between the wheel torque and wheel steering can be provided during the cornering control.

AB The advancement in machine learning and artificial intelligence promotes the testing and deployment of autonomous vehicles (AVs) on public roads. The California Department of Motor Vehicles (CA DMV) has launched the Autonomous Vehicle Tester Program, which collects and releases reports related to Autonomous Vehicle Disengagement (AVD) from autonomous driving. Understanding the causes of AVD is critical to improving the AV system's safety and stability and providing guidance for AV testing and deployment. In this work, we built a scalable end-to-end pipeline to collect, process, model, and analyze the disengagement reports released from 2014 to 2020 using natural language processing and deep transfer learning. The analysis of disengagement data using taxonomy, visualization, and statistical tests revealed the trends of AV testing, cause frequency, and significant relationships between causes and effects of AVD. We found that (1) manufacturers tested AVs intensively during the Spring and/or Winter, (2) test drivers initiated more than 80% of the disengagement while more than 75% of the disengagement were because of errors in perception, localization & mapping, planning and control of the AV system, and (3) there was a significant relationship between the initiator of AVD and the cause category. This study serves as a successful practice of deep transfer learning using pre-trained models and generates a consolidated disengagement database allowing further investigation for other researchers. The related code and data are available on github.https://github.com/refengchou/Cause-and-effect-relationship-extraction

AB Today, a lot of research on autonomous driving technology is being conducted, and various vehicles with autonomous driving functions, such as ACC (adaptive cruise control) are being released. The autonomous vehicle recognizes obstacles ahead by the fusion of data from various sensors, such as lidar and radar sensors, including camera sensors. As the number of vehicles equipped with such autonomous driving functions increases, securing safety and reliability is a big issue. Recently, Mobileye proposed the RSS (responsibility-sensitive safety) model, which is a white box mathematical model, to secure the safety of autonomous vehicles and clarify responsibility in the case of an accident. In this paper, a method of applying the RSS model to a variable focus function camera that can cover the recognition range of a lidar sensor and a radar sensor with a single camera sensor is considered. The variables of the RSS model suitable for the variable focus function camera were defined, the variable values were determined, and the safe distances for each velocity were derived by applying the determined variable values. In addition, as a result of considering the time required to obtain the data, and the time required to change the focal length of the camera, it was confirmed that the response time obtained using the derived safe distance was a valid result.</p>

AB In this paper, the feasibility of a low-cost real-time kinematic GPS (RTK-GPS) sensor for localization of an autonomous vehicle to achieve a high-speed driving is studied. For achieving high-speed autonomous driving, although the image-based method combined with a GPS can be a good approach for localization, the RTK-GPS position can be utilized with a low cost. On high-speed driving, it is important to acquire an accurate localization, because a less accurate position may degrade the performance to follow the waypoints on a target path with proper driving stability. Thus, in this study, the RTK-GPS position was applied to reduce position errors in a test vehicle with a low-cost GPS and the RTKLIB. A modified adaptive look-ahead distance pure pursuit algorithm was implemented to control the test vehicle. An autonomous driving experiment using the RTK-GPS position was carried out to verify the performance of the vehicle at a high speed of 130 kph on a track of 2477 m long with various corners and inclinations in a racing circuit. The test vehicle with the proposed real-time autonomous driving system using the RTK-GPS position achieved 111 s to complete a full lap on the racing track without departures from the track and noticeable lateral errors. This result was 32 s slower than the record accomplished by a professional human driver's 79 s.

AB Autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) are important in areas such as underwater scientific research and underwater resource collection. However, AUVs suffer from data portability and energy portability problems due to their physical size limitation. In this work, an acoustic guidance method for underwater docking is proposed to solve the problem of persistent underwater operation. A funnel docking station and an autonomous remotely operated vehicle (ARV) are used as the platform for designing the guidance algorithms. First, the underwater docking guidance is divided into three stages: a long-range approach stage, a mid-range adjustment stage and a short-range docking stage. Second, the relevant guidance strategy is designed for each stage to improve the docking performance. Third, a correction method based on an ultra-short baseline (USBL) system is proposed for the ARV's estimate of the depth, relative position and orientation angle of the docking station. To verify the feasibility of the docking guidance method, in this work, tests were performed on a lake and in a shallow sea. The success rate of autonomous navigation docking on the lake was 4 out of 7. The success rate of acoustic guidance docking on the lake and in the shallow sea were 11 out of 14 and 6 out of 8, respectively. The experimental results show the effectiveness of the docking guidance method in lakes and shallow seas.

AB This brief presents a robust nonlinear state estimator for autonomous surface vehicles, where the movement is restricted to the horizontal plane. It is assumed that only the vehicle position and orientation can be measured, being the former affected by bounded noises. Then, under some fair standard assumptions concerning the maximum velocities and acceleration rates of the vehicle, the estimator is able to reconstruct not only the velocities but also the lumped generalized disturbances that cluster external disturbances, nonlinearities, and unmodeled dynamics. The observer is easily tunable by the user, with a set of four scalars, two of them related to the velocity of convergence of the estimator, and other two parameters to set the desired tradeoff between noise sensitivity and disturbance rejection. Several simulations with a well-known test-bed craft are provided to show how the proposed algorithm outperforms previous ones in the literature under realistic environmental conditions.

AB Model Predictive Control (MPC) is frequently used for the steering controllers of autonomous vehicles, and simple vehicle dynamics is usually used for the reference model. However, simple vehicle dynamics is not sufficient for evasive steering maneuvers that require very fast steering actions. The objective of this study is to design an MPC that works for such maneuvers. We considered the steering system model and vehicle model in the MPC design. The proposed steering model provides information about the disturbances, the bandwidth of the actuator, and the motor voltage while maintaining a simple structure. The controller computes less demanding desired steering angles that do not violate the voltage constraints at the cost of tracking error. Otherwise, the MPC would result in failure of the desired evasive maneuver due to voltage saturation causing failure of the steering angle tracking. A simulation and experimental results confirmed that evasive maneuvers are successfully performed with the proposed steering controller within the allowable voltage range, and it outperformed a regular MPC based on a simple vehicle model.

AB Reinforcement learning (RL) has shown excellent performance in the sequential decision-making problem, where safety in the form of state constraints is of great significance in the design and application of RL. Simple constrained end-to-end RL methods might lead to significant failure in a complex system like autonomous vehicles. In contrast, some hierarchical RL (HRL) methods generate driving goals directly, which could be closely combined with motion planning. With safety requirements, some safe-enhanced RL methods add post-processing modules to avoid unsafe goals or achieve expectation-based safety, which accepts the existence of unsafe states and allows some violations of safe constraints. However, ensuring state safety is vital for autonomous vehicles. Therefore, this paper proposes a state-based safety enhancement method for autonomous driving via direct hierarchical reinforcement learning. Finally, we design a constrained reinforcement learner based on the State-based Constrained Markov Decision Process (SCMDP), where a learnable safety module could adjust the constraint strength adaptively. We integrate a dynamic module in the policy training and generate future goals considering safety, temporal-spatial continuity, and dynamic feasibility, which could eliminate dependence on the prior model. Simulations in the typical highway scenes with uncertainties show that the proposed method has better training performance, higher driving safety in interactive scenes, more decision intelligence in traffic congestions, and better economic driving ability on roads with changing slopes.

ID MODEL-PREDICTIVE CONTROL; ELECTRIC VEHICLES; STEERING CONTROL; SYSTEM
AB In the current literature, model-predictive (MP) algorithm is widely applied in autonomous vehicle trajectory planning and control but most of the current studies only apply the linear tyre model, which cannot accurately present the tyre non-linear characteristic. Furthermore, most of these studies separately consider the trajectory planning and trajectory control of the autonomous vehicle and few of them have integrated the trajectory planning and trajectory control together. To fill in above research gaps, this study proposes the integrated trajectory planning and trajectory control method using a non-linear vehicle MP algorithm. To fully utilise the advantages of four-wheel-independent-steering and four-wheel-independent-driving vehicle, the MP algorithm is proposed based on four-wheel dynamics model and non-linear Dugoff tyre model. This study also proposes the mathematical modelling of the static obstacle and dynamic obstacle for the obstacle avoidance manoeuvre of the autonomous vehicle. Finally, simulation results have been presented to show the effectiveness of the proposed control method.

AB Same-day delivery has become a very important challenge for e-commerce providers. However, effective delivery concepts are still not established. In this paper, we analyze the potential of combining parcel pickup stations and autonomous vehicles for same-day delivery. This combination may allow for consolidation of goods, automated delivery processes, and reduced operation costs. We consider the problem on the operational planning level. A depot, a set of pickup stations, and an autonomous delivery fleet are given. Customers dynamically order goods to a preferred pickup station and expect fast service. The goods need to be delivered from the depot to the preferred pickup station or another pickup station in the close neighborhood. Autonomous vehicles are directly dispatched between the depot and the stations. To decide where and when to dispatch a vehicle and about the corresponding goods to load, we present a policy function approximation (PFA). Our intuitive PFA allows real-time decision making while balancing the tradeoff between fast delivery and consolidation. We conduct an extensive computational study for the pickup station network of the city of Braunschweig. We show how our delivery concept allows fast delivery for up to 100 delivered goods per vehicle and day. We further pair the PFA with a value function approximation to account for heterogeneity in demand. We finally derive important managerial insights for strategical and tactical planning and present an extensive outlook on promising future research directions. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

AB There are many sensor fusion frameworks proposed in the literature using different sensors and fusion methods combinations and configurations. More focus has been on improving the accuracy performance; however, the implementation feasibility of these frameworks in an autonomous vehicle is less explored. Some fusion architectures can perform very well in lab conditions using powerful computational resources; however, in real-world applications, they cannot be implemented in an embedded edge computer due to their high cost and computational need. We propose a new hybrid multi-sensor fusion pipeline configuration that performs environment perception for autonomous vehicles such as road segmentation, obstacle detection, and tracking. This fusion framework uses a proposed encoder-decoder based Fully Convolutional Neural Network (FCNx) and a traditional Extended Kalman Filter (EKF) nonlinear state estimator method. It also uses a configuration of camera, LiDAR, and radar sensors that are best suited for each fusion method. The goal of this hybrid framework is to provide a cost-effective, lightweight, modular, and robust (in case of a sensor failure) fusion system solution. It uses FCNx algorithm that improve road detection accuracy compared to benchmark models while maintaining real-time efficiency that can be used in an autonomous vehicle embedded computer. Tested on over 3K road scenes, our fusion algorithm shows better performance in various environment scenarios compared to baseline benchmark networks. Moreover, the algorithm is implemented in a vehicle and tested using actual sensor data collected from a vehicle, performing real-time environment perception.

AB In this paper, we propose a two-layer overtaking control framework of the autonomous electric ground vehicle, including trajectory planning and tracking control. In the upper layer, a stable overtaking trajectory is derived by considering the duration of the overtaking, driving comfort and vehicle stability simultaneously. Besides, the safety spacing between the overtaking and overtaken vehicles is analyzed to prevent the potential collision. To track the generated reference trajectory precisely, we design a robust model predictive controller adopting the input-to-state stability property in the lower layer to reduce the affection of disturbances and parameter uncertainties. Two driving strategies with different lateral accelerations, that is, mild and aggressive, are simulated to verify the effectiveness of the proposed control framework. By comparing to the driver-vehicle control system, the proposed control framework can not only achieve safe, smooth, and rapid overtaking but also realize the accurate state tracking in the presence of tire cornering stiffness uncertainty.

AB This paper, for the first time, presents comparable projections of travel behaviour impacts of the introduction of autonomous vehicles (AVs) into the private car fleet for two countries, namely the USA and Germany. The focus is on fully autonomous vehicles (AVs) which allow drivers to engage in other activities enroute. Two 2035 scenarios - a trend scenario and an extreme scenario are presented for both study countries. For these projections, we combine a vehicle technology diffusion model and an aspatial travel demand model. Factors that influence AV impact in the behavioural model are mainly new automobile user groups, e.g. travellers with mobility impairments, and altered generalized costs of travel, e.g. due to a lower value of travel time savings for car travel. The results indicate that AV penetrations rates might be higher in Germany (10% or 38% respectively) than in the USA (8% or 29% respectively) due to a higher share of luxury cars and quicker fleet turnover. On the contrary, the increase of vehicle mileage induced by AVs is not higher in Germany (+2.4% or +8.6% respectively) than in the USA (+3.4% or +8.6% respectively). This is mainly due to the lack of mode alternatives and lower fuel costs resulting in a higher share of travel times among the total generalized costs of travel in the USA. These results clearly indicate that context factors shaped by national policy will influence AV adoption and impact on travel demand changes. Based on these results the paper draws policy recommendations which will help to harness the advantages of AVs while avoiding their negative consequences.

AB Ensuring the safety of pedestrians is essential and challenging when autonomous vehicles are involved. Classical pedestrian avoidance strategies cannot handle uncertainty, and learning-based methods lack performance guarantees. In this paper we propose a hybrid reinforcement learning (HRL) approach for autonomous vehicles to safely interact with pedestrians behaving uncertainly. The method integrates the rule-based strategy and reinforcement learning strategy. The confidence of both strategies is evaluated using the data recorded in the training process. Then we design an activation function to select the final policy with higher confidence. In this way, we can guarantee that the final policy performance is not worse than that of the rule-based policy. To demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method, we validate it in simulation using an accelerated testing technique to generate stochastic pedestrians. The results indicate that it increases the success rate for pedestrian avoidance to 98.8%, compared with 94.4% of the baseline method.

AB This paper introduces a novel lateral guidance strategy for autonomous ground vehicles operating in deformable environments. The strategy combines a geometric algorithm with a dynamic controller to leverage the advantages of both methods. The geometric algorithm is based on a modified Pure Pursuit method, which calculates the lateral error by considering a dynamic parameter associated with the look-ahead distance. The controller takes model uncertainties and time-variant parameters into account in a grid-based LPV (Linear Parameter Varying) synthesis. To validate the proposed control architecture, a dedicated off-road vehicle simulator that accounted for deformable soils was used. The effectiveness and robustness of the proposed lateral guidance strategy were demonstrated by integrating and validating the control architecture on a vehicle prototype. The results indicate that the proposed approach effectively handled complex and uncertain deformable environments. Overall, this study presents a new lateral guidance strategy that enhances the performance and reliability of autonomous ground vehicles in challenging environments.

AB This paper presents an interactive lane keeping model for an advanced driver assistant system and autonomous vehicle. The proposed model considers not only the lane markers but also the interaction with surrounding vehicles in determining steering inputs. The proposed algorithm is designed based on the Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) with long short-term memory cells, which are configured by the collected driving data. A data collection vehicle is equipped with a front camera, LiDAR, and DGPS. The input features of the RNN consist of lane information, surrounding targets, and ego vehicle states. The output feature is the steering wheel angle to keep the lane. The proposed algorithm is evaluated through similarity analysis and a case study with driving data. The proposed algorithm shows accurate results compared to the conventional algorithm, which only considers the lane markers. In addition, the proposed algorithm effectively responds to the surrounding targets by considering the interaction with the ego vehicle.

AB Autonomous vehicle racing has emerged as vibrant, innovative technology development, demonstration platform in recent years. Universities, companies demonstrate their achievements on various vehicles -from 1:10th to full-scale prototypes. One of those platforms is the Dallara AV-21, and the spec-vehicle for the Indy Autonomous Challenge. This paper outlines the robust model predictive control (MPC) concept used within the software stack of the TUM Autonomous Motorsport team. It is based on a simplified friction-limited point mass model and a set of low-level feedback controllers. The remaining model uncertainties are managed via introducing a constraint-tightening approach based on a Tube-MPC approach. In contrast to classical tracking controllers, the optimization problem is formulated to freely optimize the trajectory while staying within certain maximum deviations of the reference. This approach allows to rely on a coarse output of the trajectory planning approach while maintaining smoothness requirements in steering, throttle, and brake actuation. The paper highlights the advantages of the proposed robust reoptimization concept compared to pure tracking formulations. It showcases the performance compared to a classical LQR controller and an MPC, which utilizes a vehicle model with a more sophisticated tire model. The controller achieved a top speed of 265 kmh(-1) and lateral accelerations up to 21 ms(-2) during a two-vehicle competition involving dynamic overtaking maneuvers on the Las Vegas Motor Speedway, a famous racetrack with turns banked up to 20(?).

AB The execution of lane changes has a strong impact on driving safety and traffic throughput. Therefore, it is highly desired to automate and coordinate lane changes. The subject of this paper is the scheduling of lane changes of a group of connected and autonomous vehicles (CAVs) with the aim of minimizing the time during which all lane changes are completed, while keeping small inter-vehicle distances. To this end, the paper first develops an algorithm for minimizing the lane change time of a single CAV. This algorithm is then successively applied to all lane-changing CAVs. As a special feature, the proposed algorithm analytically computes CAV reference trajectories based on a second-order vehicle model such that all computations can be carried out in real time. In addition, the developed method supports the implementation of the computed CAV trajectories using cooperative adaptive cruise control in order to ensure safe driving in a tight vehicle formation. Detailed simulation experiments and a comparison to a benchmark method demonstrate the superior performance of our method.

AB In the context of automation and digitalization technologies and due to the existing trends of re-urbanization, autonomous vehicles for execution of services such as package delivery, transportation, vegetation care and street cleaning are considered innovative solutions. This paper presents a concept and implementation of a system developed to plan and deliver packages within pedestrian areas, using autonomous vehicles. The novelty of the system lies in the systematic view of this use case, which considers all stakeholder views from the CEP (courier, express, and parcel services) provider, traffic participants, and customers and where the technical and technological innovation is guided by interactivity with the users. This work outlines the design and integration of user interaction, the developed vehicles within the fleet designed for operating within pedestrian environments, and localization and navigation strategies. After the vehicles were approved and certified from a technical point of view to operate in pedestrian areas, the entire system was tested and evaluated in a new city district of Heilbronn with approximately 800 inhabitants. In the last six weeks of experiments, 572 packages were delivered in an autonomous way. The interactive way of planning and executing services on demand led, according to a market study in Heilbronn, to an increased acceptance of the users for autonomous package delivery services from 76% to 91%.

AB Connected and autonomous vehicles (CAVs) have the potential to disrupt all industries tied to transport, including tourism. This conceptual paper breaks new ground by providing an in-depth imaginings approach to the potential future far-reaching implications of CAVs for urban tourism. Set against key debates in urban studies and urban tourism, we discuss the enchantments and apprehensions surrounding CAVs and how they may impact cities in terms of tourism transport mode use, spatial changes, tourism employment and the night-time visitor economy, leading to new socio-economic opportunities and a range of threats and inequities. We provide a concluding agenda that sets the foundation for a new research sub-field on CAVs and tourism, of relevance to urban planners, policymakers and the tourism industry.

ID DESIGN
AB Automatic guided vehicles, in particular, and industrial autonomous mobile robots, in general, are commonly used to automate intralogistics processes. However, there are certain logistic tasks, such as picking objects of variable sizes, shapes, and physical characteristics, that are very difficult to handle fully automatically. In these cases, the collaboration between humans and autonomous robots has been proven key for the efficiency of industrial processes and other applications. To this aim, it is necessary to develop person-following robot solutions. In this work, we propose a fully autonomously controlling autonomous robotic interaction for environments with unknown objects based on real experiments. To do so, we have developed an active tracking system and a control algorithm to implement the person-following strategy on a real industrial automatic-guided vehicle. The algorithm analyzes the cloud of points measured by light detection and ranging (LIDAR) sensor to detect and track the target. From this scan, it estimates the speed of the target to obtain the speed reference value and calculates the direction of the reference by a pure-pursuit algorithm. In addition, to enhance the robustness of the solution, spatial and temporal filters have been implemented to discard obstacles and detect crossings between humans and the automatic industrial vehicle. Static and dynamic test campaigns have been carried out to experimentally validate this approach with the real industrial autonomous-guided vehicle and a safety LIDAR.

AB The purpose of this study is to develop an autonomous lane change control system that adapts to variable surrounding conditions, to ensure vehicle safety and traffic flow stability. In this paper, we propose decision-making and control procedures for realizing autonomous lane changing; to this end, we consider not only behaviors for changing lanes but also those involved in approaching the lane changing state, with a focus on the controller design. A decoupled control structure and longitudinal trajectory-free control approach are suggested. We design a novel inter-vehicle spacing policy and a 3DOF lateral error vehicle dynamics model. To verify the effectiveness of our system, simulation experiments are performed for 12 scenarios, and system assessments are conducted based on four evaluation perspectives. The results confirm that our system can safely control the vehicle amidst various surrounding vehicle conditions and can also ensure vehicle motion stability. Furthermore, we solve the existing dynamic instability problem of lateral control, which arises through longitudinal acceleration variability. Another significant advantage of this model is that the controlled vehicle does not interfere with the target-lane traffic flow and smoothly synchronizes with the flow during lane changing.

AB Autonomous vehicle technology is greatly valued nowadays, and an active collision avoidance system is one of the key parts for autonomous driving. This study presents a comprehensive architecture of an active collision avoidance system for an autonomous vehicle, which is integrated with a decision-making module, a path-planning module, a lateral-path-following module and a fuzzy adaptive following module (longitudinal motion) to deal with potential hazards on a straight road or a curved road. In order to make the planned path for overtaking manoeuvres safer, an improved harmonic velocity potential approach for path planning is presented, which innovatively enhances the effect of an obstacle potential on a road by adding a scale term, so that it can generate a smooth path for a vehicle-overtaking manoeuvre. All the potentials which are used for vehicle lane keeping or lane changing are well designed. The lateral-path-following module is based on the constrained linear model predictive control approach, which ensures that the host vehicle can follow the planned path precisely. Furthermore, when the overtaking manoeuvre is not suitable, the fuzzy adaptive following module is utilized to ensure that the host vehicle can adaptively keep a safe distance from the preceding vehicle. Tactical decisions, such as overtaking, accelerating or decelerating, are determined by the decision-making module. Finally, several typical scenarios with low traffic on a straight road or a curved road are simulated to verify the effectiveness and the feasibility of the active collision avoidance system. The simulation results show that the host vehicle can make a successful collision avoidance manoeuvre without the intervention of a human driver in different situations.

AB Efficient path tracking plays a key role in the overall ride experience of Autonomous Vehicles (AVs). Model Predictive Control (MPC) is one of the most competent techniques which is capable of handling multiple variables and constraints. The performance of this controller heavily relies on the proper choice of the vehicle model used to predict future states. This work proposes a novel MPC framework for the effective adoption of vehicle models to achieve a compromise between MPC's performance and computational cost. To this aim, a Switched MPC (SMPC) using vehicle models with different levels of complexity and fidelity is developed. The SMPC uses a novel supervision scheme to adopt the appropriate vehicle model based on the models' prediction error and MPC's solution time. Two different configurations of SMPC are implemented: (1) A Fuzzy Logic System (FLS), and (2) An adaptive switching supervisor. The outcomes show that both approaches can perform path tracking accurately on roads with varying curvatures for different AV speeds. Moreover, comparisons with the conventional MPCs show that the proposed controllers can perform comparably with selective use of a complex vehicle model. Notably, they benefit from a higher computation efficiency from sidestepping the most complex models during path tracking.

AB Autonomous transportation is an inevitable means of day-to-day activity that supports a country's economic growth. Effective communication systems design is an incentive for autonomous vehicles' protection and comfort to be further extended. Inter-vehicle communication and effective ways for the user to communicate with the autonomous vehicle and the communication systems' elements for autonomous vehicles need to be considered. Vehicular ad hoc network (VANET) is a prominent roadside communication-assisting technology designed to serve the purpose. Mitigating communication errors in transportation prevent service interruptions and ease information access. External and internal communication lags need to be addressed to sustain uninterrupted communication. To improve communication reliability, an opportunistic data dissemination model is introduced in this paper. This dissemination model observes storage and processing communication demands and time dependency to assist roadside communication. The observations are processed by a neural-network-based learning scheme to respond precisely to users' requests by pre-estimating vehicular and communication storage and time requirements. The communicating autonomous transport system is notified of the time and storage dependency of the requests to improve data dissemination. The communication status is updated with the infrastructure-assisted connecting technologies to ensure better VANET performance. The experimental results achieve a high resource utilization ratio of 93.4%, throughput 8.3 Mbps, less response time of 288.53 ms, request loss of 1.9%, and average delay of 60 ms compared to other existing methods.

AB Control systems of autonomous vehicles or driver assistant control systems always face uncertainties due to the in-vehicle and environmental disturbances. In addition, the steering ability for rear tyres leads to more stability and more handling and manoeuvrability. In this paper the adaptive sliding mode control (ASME) strategy is employed to improve handling issues due to the road's friction, which plays a key role in handling dynamics. The proposed dynamic model used in this paper is a simple and useful two-degree of freedom model. Two parallel ASMCs are used: one for positioning error and the other for angular error. The simulations are executed for two different road conditions with considering the hypercritical condition. To verify the designed controller, the controller is applied to the non-linear full vehicle model. The simulation results prove that the controller perfectly works for different road conditions. The controller is also robust against uncertainties such as road friction.

AB Autonomous underwater vehicles are at present being used for scientific, commercial and military submerged applications. In this paper, a system has been proposed which can be used underwater as remotely operated underwater vehicle for submerged survey for different purposes. These systems require self-sufficient direction and control frameworks so as to perform submerged assignments. Displaying, framework identification and control of these vehicles are as yet real dynamic zones of innovative work. This theory is worried about the plan and improvement of an Autonomous Underwater Vehicle (AUV) specifically proposed for passage into global submerged vehicle rivalries. The theory comprises of two stages; the first includes the plan and development of the vehicle while the subsequent stage is worried about the demonstrating and framework identification of the vehicle, just as the reproduction of a control system. The structure and advancement of the vehicle comprised of actualizing a mechanical and electrical framework, just as the reconciliation of subsystems. The framework identification of the vehicle parameters comprised of utilizing locally available sensors to perform static and dynamic tests. Least squares estimation was utilized to gauge the parameters from the pre-researched data obtained. (C) 2019 Shanghai Jiaotong University. Published by Elsevier B.V.

AB Over the last decades the vehicle industry has shown interest in integrating new technologies on vehicles' design. Such technologies are used in autonomous, connected and electrical vehicles with the primary hope of improving road safety and the environmental impact of road traffic. Regarding the environmental impact, the transport sector has been considered responsible for Greenhouse Gas emissions for the past thirty years or more, and efforts have been made to reduce impacts of such emissions on the environment. The environmental noise is also associated with road traffic and its effects on public health, along with ways of scaling them down, have been under investigation. Taking into consideration worldwide efforts on climate change and new vehicle technologies that are being introduced, this paper provides a review on the studies concerning the environmental and traffic noise impacts anticipated by the implementation of these kinds of vehicles in the market and in road traffic. Two types of studies, conducted the last 10 years, are included in this review: a) studies that use logical estimates to draw conclusions on how Connected and Autonomous Vehicles (CAVs) as well as Electrical Vehicles will alter fuel consumption, gas emission, etc., and b) studies that make use of mathematical frameworks and the data available to extract numerical results. Eleven (11) factors affecting CAVs' environmental impacts were found and categorized based on whether they are related to the vehicle, the road network or the user. A comparison of the different procedures is attempted, in order to identify the factors that are influencing the emergence of anticipated environmental impacts as well as their variety and extent.

AB In the future, vehicle sharing platforms for passenger transport will be unmanned, autonomous, and electric. These platforms must decide which vehicle should pick up which type of customer based on the vehicle's battery level and customer's travel distance. We design dynamic vehicle allocation policies for matching appropriate vehicles to customers using a Markov decision process model. To obtain the model parameters, we first model the system as a semi-open queuing network (SOQN) with multiple synchronization stations. At these stations, customers with varied battery demands are matched with semi-shared vehicles that hold sufficient remaining battery levels. If a vehicle's battery level drops below a threshold, it is routed probabilistically to a nearby charging station for charging. We solve the analytical model of the SOQN and obtain approximate system performance measures, which are validated using simulation. With inputs from the SOQN model, the Markov decision process minimizes both customer waiting cost and lost demand and finds a good heuristic vehicle allocation policy. The experiments show that the heuristic policy is near optimal in small-scale networks and outperforms benchmark policies in large-scale realistic scenarios. An interesting finding is that reserving idle vehicles to wait for future short-distance customer arrivals can be beneficial even when long-distance customers are waiting.

AB This paper presents a bio-inspired geomagnetic navigation method for autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) without using any a priori geomagnetic information. Firstly, the multi-objective search problem is raised. Secondly, the geomagnetic navigation model is established by constructing a cost function. Then, by taking into consideration the biological magneto-taxis movement behavior for the geomagnetic environment stimulus, the multi-objective evolutionary search algorithm is derived to describe the search process. Finally, compared to the state-of-the-art, the proposed method presents better robustness. The simulation results demonstrate the reliability and feasibility of the proposed method.

ID DESIGN
AB Autonomous vehicles are playing an increasingly importance in support of a wide variety of critical events. This paper presents a novel autonomous health management scheme on rail vehicles driven by permanent magnet synchronous motors (PMSMs). Firstly, the PMSMs are modeled based on first principle to deduce the initial profile of pneumatic braking (p-braking) force, then which is utilized for realtime demagnetization monitoring and degradation prognosis through similarity-based theory and generate prognosis-enhanced p-braking force strategy for final optimal control. A case study is conducted to demonstrate the feasibility and benefit of using the real-time prognostics and health management (PHM) information in vehicle 'drive-brake' control automatically. The results show that accurate demagnetization monitoring, degradation prognosis, and real-time capability for control optimization can be obtained, which can effectively relieve brake shoe wear.

AB In this study, a novel 4-wheel-steering electric vehicle is proposed as an autonomous ground vehicle. It aims to study the path tracking control algorithm of the 4-wheel-steering autonomous ground vehicle for intelligent driving.. Path tracking model is built for path tracking controller design based on a single track model. Besides, the linear parameter-varying system model is constructed to make the path tracking controller adaptive to different longitudinal velocities and road friction coefficients. Furthermore, a linear quadratic regulator controller for path tracking is designed and stability analysis is carried out. To eliminate the error caused by disturbance, feedforward control is combined with a linear quadratic regulator controller. To verify the path tracking performance of the designed controller, numerical simulations are carried out based on a high-fidelity and full-vehicle model constructed in CarSim. Moreover, real road experiments are performed. Both the simulation results and experiment results show that the designed controller has good path tracking performance. In addition, the path tracking controller shows good robustness to deal with different longitudinal velocities and road friction coefficients.

AB Sooner than expected, roads will be populated with a plethora of connected and autonomous vehicles serving diverse mobility needs. Rather than being stand-alone, vehicles will be required to cooperate and coordinate with each other, referred to as cooperative driving executing the mobility tasks properly. Cooperative driving leverages Vehicle to Vehicle (V2V) and Vehicle to Infrastructure (V2I) communication technologies aiming to carry out cooperative functionalities: (i) cooperative sensing and (ii) cooperative maneuvering. To better equip the readers with background knowledge on the topic, we firstly provide the detailed taxonomy section describing the underlying concepts and various aspects of cooperation in cooperative driving. In this survey, we review the current solution approaches in cooperation for autonomous vehicles, based on various cooperative driving applications, i.e., smart car parking, lane change and merge, intersection management, and platooning. The role and functionality of such cooperation become more crucial in platooning use-cases, which is why we also focus on providing more details of platooning use-cases and focus on one of the challenges, electing a leader in high-level platooning. Following, we highlight a crucial range of research gaps and open challenges that need to be addressed before cooperative autonomous vehicles hit the roads. We believe that this survey will assist the researchers in better understanding vehicular cooperation, its various scenarios, solution approaches, and challenges.

AB Cooperative adaptive cruise control (CACC) has been widely considered as a potential solution for reducing traffic congestion, increasing road capacity, reducing fossil fuel consumption and improving traffic safety. Traditional CCAC methods rely heavily on the vehicle-to-vehicle communications to achieve cooperation. However, in the real-world scenarios, unreliable communication will degrade CACC to adaptive cruise control, which may bring negative influences on safety (i.e., increase the risk of collisions). To overcome this drawback, this paper innovatively applies a spring damping energy model to construct a robust autonomous vehicle platoon system. The proposed design of the energy model ensures that the stability and safety of the platoon system be maintained in the event of such sudden degradation. Based on this technique, a distributed control protocol which only utilizes local information from neighbors is then proposed. Furthermore, some practical constraints such as the connectivity of the vehicle platoon system and the bound of the control inputs are guaranteed. Finally, the effectiveness of the proposed CCAC strategy is validated by multiple simulation experiments in Unreal Engine.

AB A novel method for guidance of vision-based autonomous vehicles for indoor security patrolling using scale-invariant feature transformation (SIFT) and vehicle localization techniques is proposed. Along-path objects to be monitored are used as landmarks for vehicle localization. The localization work is accomplished by three steps: SIFT-based object image feature matching, 2-D affine transformation using the Hough transform, and analytic 3-D space transformation. Object monitoring can be simultaneously achieved during the vehicle-localization process, and most planar-surfaced objects can be utilized in the process, greatly enhancing the applicability of the proposed method. Vehicle trajectory deviations from the planned path due to mechanic error accumulation are also estimated by setting up a calibration line on the monitored object image and applying the 3-D space transformation. Moreover, a path-correction technique is proposed to conduct a path adjustment and guide the vehicle to navigate to the next path node. Analysis of the accuracy of the vehicle-localization and path-correction results is finally included. The experimental results show that the proposed method, utilizing only a single view of each object, can guide the vehicle to navigate accurately and monitor objects successfully.

AB In this paper, an implementation of a vehicle-in-the-loop (VIL) verification environment is presented tailored to automated intersection traffic management applications. Although the fundamental goal of this implementation is to evaluate our proposed optimal traffic management scheme for autonomous vehicles, the test environment is configurable and reproducible to incorporate most of the real time intersection control methods for verification purposes. In our cyber-physical virtual testing environment, actual test vehicles and intersection control server at the physical layer interact with simulated vehicles in an implemented traffic microsimulation layer. The intersection control server continuously runs a Mixed Integer Linear Program (MILP) that was previously proposed by authors for vehicle arrival scheduling at all-autonomous intersections with no physical traffic lights. In addition to the novel intersection traffic management scheme at the cyber layer, this VIL environment also includes a fuel consumption tracker that is based on our proposed fuel rate estimation methods using the basic vehicle diagnostic data. Using this environment, the mobility efficacy and the fuel consumption reduction potential of the proposed intersection control scheme are compared with two baseline scenarios in VIL experiments.

ID MODEL-PREDICTIVE CONTROL; GAME; GO
AB Steering control is a vital function for autonomous vehicles, whose performance largely determines the driving safety. The widely used feedback steering controllers degrade significantly when vehicles drive at high speeds. This is mainly because these controllers can not effectively exploit nonlinear vehicle dynamics and future road information. Hence, the steering actions generated by these controllers can not achieve accurate and stable path tracking performance. To overcome this limitation, we propose a deep learning based Monte Carlo Tree Search (DeepMCTS) method to enhance the feedback controllers. Due to the accuracy of the learning-based model in characterizing nonlinear vehicle dynamics and the lookahead search ability of MCTS, the control performance of the feedback controllers can be enhanced significantly. Different from MPC methods, which leverage vehicle dynamics and future road information via online optimization, our method relies on the efficient tree search process. Hence, our method can avoid heavy computational burden. Testing results validate the proposed method can achieve better tracking accuracy and stability in high speeds scenarios.

DE Object detection; segmentation and categorization; autonomous agents
AB For autonomous driving, vehicle detection is the prerequisite for many tasks like collision avoidance and path planning. In this letter, we present a real-time three-dimensional (RT3D) vehicle detection method that utilizes pure LiDAR point cloud to predict the location, orientation, and size of vehicles. In contrast to previous 3-D object detection methods, we used a pre-RoIpooling convolution technique that moves a majority of the convolution operations to ahead of the RoI pooling, leaving just a small part behind, so that significantly boosts the computation efficiency. We also propose a pose-sensitive feature map design which can be strongly activated by the relative poses of vehicles, leading to a high regression accuracy on the location, orientation, and size of vehicles. Experiments on the KITTI benchmark dataset show that the RT3D is not only able to deliver competitive detection accuracy against state-of-the-art methods, but also the first LiDAR-based 3-D vehicle detection work that completes detection within 0.09 s which is even shorter than the scan period of mainstream LiDAR sensors.

AB This letter presents a planning system for autonomous driving among many pedestrians. A key ingredient of our approach is Pedestrian Optimal Reciprocal Collision Avoidance, a pedestrian motion prediction model that accounts for both a pedestrian's global navigation intention and local interactions with the vehicle and other pedestrians. Unfortunately, the autonomous vehicle does not know the pedestrians' intentions a priori and requires a planning algorithm that hedges against the uncertainty in pedestrian intentions. Our planning system combines a Partially Observable Markov Decision Process algorithm with the pedestrian motion model and runs in real time. Experiments show that it enables a robot scooter to drive safely, efficiently, and smoothly in a crowd with a density of nearly one person per square meter.

AB Autonomous Vehicles (AV) possess an automated driving system that allows the vehicle to respond to external conditions and provide advanced and intelligent transportation services with limited to no human intervention. For AV, the legitimacy and reliability of sensed and transmitted data have direct influence on road network operations. For instance, the integrity of vehicle communications is vulnerable to various threats such as spoofing attacks. Due to the extremely volatile nature of AV, traditional centralized security solutions lack in flexibility and mobility support. Moreover, the very large scale of future AV networks mandates an innovative design of intelligent communications among the vehicles to identify authentic traffic information broadcasted all across the network. In this paper, we design a vehicular collaboration framework that drives the interactions among autonomous vehicles based on trustworthy communications to prevent data integrity attacks. The design involves a distributed, hedonic coalition formation game in which the vehicles evaluate their utilities according to their trust in each other and the data they transmit. The proposed vehicular coalition formation algorithm enables the vehicles to dynamically join and leave the collaborative communities based on trust updates. Vehicles' hybrid trust relationships are derived by integrating the three parameters of the REK model: Reputation, Experience, and Knowledge to optimally exploit the available information in the network and adapt the framework to different road traffic contexts. Furthermore, to protect the formed coalitions against data integrity attacks, a trust-based data aggregation procedure using Dempster-Shafer theory of evidence is adopted to limit the effect of false events on vehicles' decisions. The experimental results show that our collaboration framework is resilient to data corruption and fabrication attacks. (C) 2022 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB An adaptive cruise control system with a longitudinal controller that follows a preceding vehicle in autonomous vehicles is proposed. The adaptive cruise control system in a test vehicle recognizes a preceding vehicle located in front of the test vehicle and drives the test vehicle with a safety distance to the preceding vehicle by controlling its accelerator and brake. Vehicle distance errors caused by preceding vehicle distances can be determined by the distance information obtained from the laser scanner installed on the front side of a succeeding vehicle. The acceleration control in a succeeding vehicle performs velocity control by transmitting APS (Acceleration Position Sensor) signals, which can be generated at the speed control unit artificially, to ECU (Electronic Control Unit). An adaptive cruise control system presented in this research is simulated with CARSIM and SIMULINK and its performance is also proved to be very practical after several experimental test on a real car.

AB To improve the curve driving stability and safety under critical maneuvers for four-wheel independent drive autonomous electric vehicles, a three-stage direct yaw moment control (DYC) strategy design procedure is proposed in this work. The first stage includes modeling of the tire nonlinear mechanical properties, i.e. the coupling relationship between the tire longitudinal force and the tire lateral force, which is crucial for the DYC strategy design, in the STI (Systems Technologies Inc.) form based on experimental data. On this basis, a 7-DOF vehicle dynamics model is established and the direct yaw moment calculation problem of the four-wheel independent drive autonomous electric vehicle is solved through the nonsingular fast terminal sliding mode (NFTSM) control method. Thus optimal direct yaw moment can be obtained. To achieve this direct yaw moment, an optimal allocation problem of the tire forces is further solved by using the trust-region interior-point method, which can effectively guarantee the solving efficiency of a complex optimization problem such as the tire driving and braking forces allocation of four wheels in this work. Finally, effectiveness of the DYC strategy proposed for autonomous electric vehicles is verified through the CarSim-Simulink co-simulation results.

AB Simulation is a cornerstone of autonomous driving efforts, allowing testing to occur more rapidly and with significantly less risk than is possible with hardware platforms alone. Simulation systems must be able to emulate a variety of sensors including cameras and LiDARs in order to allow high-level software such as image processing and path planning to be tested. In this paper, we present a hardware-in-the-loop simulation system without real-time constraints. It is based on CARLA to give access to the sensors required to test high-level software, and incorporates compute hardware identical to that used on an autonomous vehicle platform in order to provide realistic constraints regarding available processing power. In addition, we explore the robot operating system based software framework used on the Formula SAE vehicle and its integration with the driving simulator. Finally, we validate the sensor outputs and vehicle dynamics of the simulated system against a physical autonomous driving hardware platform.

AB With increasing growth of vehicles, traffic congestion and safety deserve to be looked at more closely. Cooperative autonomous driving is an effective solution to reduce traffic congestion and ensure traffic safety. In this paper, cooperative autonomous control of multiple vehicles is considered to realize sharing the same roads without collusion with each other. Lane-following and braking control are two basic operations of cooperative driving. The objectives of lane-following are to make intervehicles keep a safe spacing and run on the middle position of a lane. To reach the targets, two distributed control protocols are proposed in which we consider not only lateral control but also longitudinal control. The stability analysis is also shown for both the control protocols. Braking control is another basic operation for autonomous cooperative control. In order to make vehicles stop at the desired target stopping position (TSP), a new braking control protocol is also designed, and the convergence of which is analyzed and shown that, under three kinds of distinct braking control parameters, the position of the mass center of all vehicles exponentially converges to the TSP, and the velocity of the mass center of all vehicles exponentially converges to zero, which provide a guide for selecting the braking control parameters in real engineering applications. Moreover, the initial and limit conditions of position and velocity are discussed. Simulations demonstrate the validity and superiority of the proposed control protocols compared with existing approaches.

AB This paper presents a comparative study of two path planning algorithms using optimal control theory for the autonomous multi-wheeled combat vehicle. The developed optimal path planning algorithms use Pontryagin's minimum principle (PMP) and dynamic programming (DP) approaches. PMP and DP are two major branches of the optimal control theory. A simplified two degrees of freedom (DOF) vehicle model is used to derive the differential equations of the vehicle. The cost function associated with the path generation is to be minimised with the vehicle dynamics equations. A comparative study and performance analysis of generated optimal paths using the proposed algorithms was carried out for various scenarios. The simulation results demonstrate that the generated optimal solution using PMP is very close to the DP solution, which is the guaranteed global optimum. In addition, the initial and final condition parameters and the vehicle dynamics are satisfied. However, the PMP computation time is significantly less than the DP.

AB This paper envisions a mixed network with autonomous vehicle (AV) expressways and non-autonomous local streets in the future, where a trip may consist of both the AV self-driving part and the manual-driving part. A linear traffic corridor approach is adopted, where AV expressways and non-autonomous streets are in parallel and are connected through the entrance/exit. This mimics the intermediate future where AV expressways may be initially deployed along major corridors. We model and analyze road users route choice in such a mixed network. We also examine how AV expressways are integrated with the local streets can affect system performance.

AB This study examines the potential for cost and carbon emission reduction for autonomous trucks to adopt lower peak speeds than today's human driven trucks, where the hourly cost of the driver remains a significant trade-off. Adopting lower speeds presents an indirect savings opportunity in addition to savings associated with the removal of the driver.
   Benefits and trade-offs for varying target speed of autonomous trucks on highways were investigated with a parameterised analysis of transport and cargo cost components. A validated fuel consumption model was used to compare fuel consumption for different speed strategies across idealised highway drive-cycles and vehicle scenarios. A volume-limited tractor-trailer (50% cargo mass capacity) could reduce fuel consumption and carbon emissions by 26% when reducing target speed from 90 km/h to 70 km/h. When the trade-offs of driver, vehicle and cargo time are considered for the same 20 km/h target speed reduction, combined costs increase by 3% for the human driver scenario, but decrease by 4% for an autonomous truck (assuming medium cargo time value). Sensitivity to vehicle type, loading, drive-cycle and cargo value was examined.
   A UK supermarket chain case study was investigated and key differences between a UK and US context were compared. Mandatory rest breaks and Hours-of-Service restrictions were identified as additional barriers for human driven vehicles to adopt slower speed strategies.

AB Since one control loop input disturbs the control of another loop, the dynamic coupling of the longitudinal and lateral directions adversely affects the motion tracking accuracy of autonomous vehicles. With the ability to minimize the interactions between the longitudinal and lateral dynamics, the inverse system learned by the neural network is an effective way to decouple vehicle dynamics. After tracking the vehicle states projected from the desire motion, the dynamic decoupling and the motion tracking are both realized. However, the accumulation of vehicle state tracking errors causes the stable yaw tracking error and the lateral tracking divergence. To solve the accompanying problem, a path correction model is designed to periodically update the desired vehicle states. Moreover, the applicability of the inverse system decoupling method is improved in this paper, because the method usually adopted in distributed drive electric vehicles is applied to four-wheel driving vehicles representing the traditional driving form. Simulation results indicate that the decoupling motion tracking method with the path correction model is suitable for long-distance and complex conditions and has the highest comprehensive tracking accuracy compared with the integrated MPC (model predictive control) and the pure pursuit in the dynamic coupling conditions.

ID MODEL
AB Trajectory tracking control in the cut-in scenarios is challenging, since the autonomous vehicles have to follow the reference trajectory and cooperate with the cut-in vehicles. This paper proposes a human-centered trajectory tracking control strategy integrating driver behavior prediction for the cut-in scenarios and their transient processes. A recurrent neural network (RNN) with long short-term memory (LSTM) cells is used to predict the driver behaviors of the cut-in vehicle. Then, a model predictive control (MPC) approach considering the driver behaviors of the cut-in vehicle is designed to track the reference trajectory. The transient processes of the cut-in scenarios are considered for different cut-in behaviors. Moreover, the moving horizon estimator (MHE) is used to estimate the vehicle lateral velocity that is used in the controller. Human driver tests on a driving simulator show that the drivers' intention of the cut-in vehicle can be predicted by the RNN with LSTM cells. CarSim (R) simulation studies show the human-centered trajectory tracking controller can track the reference trajectory using the estimated vehicle lateral velocity. The autonomous vehicle can cooperate with the cut-in vehicle in different driving situations and obtain smooth transient processes of the cut-in scenarios.

AB A novel control strategy is proposed for the autonomous vehicle equipped with the front and rear independent steering systems to enhance the capability of collision avoidance and improve path tracking and handling stability under critical maneuvers. The novel control system includes a path replanning controller, a path tracking controller, and a stability controller. The path replanning controller is designed to generate a collision-free trajectory by optimizing a cost function. The cost function can be updated quickly and iteratively, according to the dynamic fitting matrix and measurement signals. The path tracking controller and the stability controller with considering multi-constraints are designed to generate the steering angle of the front wheel and the rear wheel, respectively, which improve the ability of path tracking and handling stability of the autonomous vehicle under extreme conditions. The real-time effectiveness of the proposed control strategy is verified and evaluated in Hardware-in-the-loop (HIL) simulation environment. The function of collision avoidance of the control algorithm is verified in the scenario of the preset obstacle artificially on the globally planned path. The proposed control strategy, presents superior performance against two other control strategies based on model predictive control algorithm, and also exhibits satisfactory performance in terms of path tracking as well as handling stability of the autonomous vehicle.

AB In the area of autonomous driving, it typically brings great difficulty in solving the motion planning problem since the vehicle model is nonlinear and the driving scenarios are complex. Particularly, most of the existing methods cannot be generalized to dynamically changing scenarios with varying surrounding vehicles. To address this problem, this development here investigates the framework of integrated decision and control. As part of the modules, static path planning determines the reference candidates ahead, and then the optimal path-tracking controller realizes the specific autonomous driving task. An innovative and effective constrained finite-horizon approximate dynamic programming (ADP) algorithm is herein presented to generate the desired control policy for effective path tracking. With the generalized policy neural network that maps from the state to the control input, the proposed algorithm preserves the high effectiveness for the motion planning problem towards changing driving environments with varying surrounding vehicles. Moreover, the algorithm attains the noteworthy advantage of alleviating the typically heavy computational loads with the mode of offline training and online execution. As a result of the utilization of multi-layer neural networks in conjunction with the actor-critic framework, the constrained ADP method is capable of handling complex and multidimensional scenarios. Finally, various simulations have been carried out to show that the constrained ADP algorithm is effective.

AB A steering actuator is the core component of an autonomous vehicle. Because of noise interference, the extraction of useful fault features for an accurate fault diagnosis of steering actuator becomes an arduous task. This article proposes an adaptive denoising residual network (AD-ResNet) for fault diagnosis of steering actuator with reduced noise interference and improved accuracy. First, a high-complexity model based on long short-term memory (LSTM) is built to estimate redundant signals, and then, fault features are generated by comparing redundant signals with the measured sensor signals. Second, an attention unit is designed to determine the unique set of thresholds for each fault feature. Finally, hard thresholding is embedded in a deep network as a nonlinear transform layer to reduce noise. Simulation experiments were performed at different signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs), and the results confirmed that the proposed method could adaptively denoise the high-noise signals. The proposed method was then validated against a fault dataset that was built using road experiments with an autonomous vehicle, and it achieved an accuracy, a sensitivity, a specificity, and an F1-score of 91.66%, 91.66%, 97.22%, and 0.9159, respectively, averaged over all fault states. The proposed method outperformed the comparison methods in the experiments.

AB With the rapid development of autonomous driving technologies, a vast array of autonomous driving algorithms and platforms have emerged. These algorithms and platforms are usually designed for different tasks in specific scenarios, which makes them incompatible with each other. To solve the problem, we propose a ubiquitous operating system named Parallel Driving Operating System (PDOS) based on the parallel driving theory. Specifically, the PDOS architecture includes the hardware layer, the kernel layer, the functional layer, and the application layer, which can realize heterogeneous hardware support, ubiquitous resource management, algorithm optimization, and ubiquitous application development, respectively. Moreover, we derive the PDOS into specific operating systems in four application scenarios, i.e., intelligent mining, intelligent warehousing, intelligent logistics, and intelligent port. To validate the PDOS, we test its usability, reliability, and efficiency in these scenarios. Evaluation results demonstrate the high performance of PDOS in multiple autonomous driving, and indicate that PDOS is an efficient operating system for parallel driving.

AB In recent years, autonomous vehicles and advanced driver assistance systems have drawn a great deal of attention from both research and industry, because of their demonstrated benefit in reducing the rate of accidents or, at least, their severity. The main flaw of this system is related to the poor performances in adverse environmental conditions, due to the reduction of friction, which is mainly related to the state of the road. In this paper, a new model-based technique is proposed for real-time road friction estimation in different environmental conditions. The proposed technique is based on both bicycle model to evaluate the state of the vehicle and a tire Magic Formula model based on a slip-slope approach to evaluate the potential friction. The results, in terms of the maximum achievable grip value, have been involved in autonomous driving vehicle-following maneuvers, as well as the operating condition of the vehicle at which such grip value can be reached. The effectiveness of the proposed approach is disclosed via an extensive numerical analysis covering a wide range of environmental, traffic, and vehicle kinematic conditions. Results confirm the ability of the approach to properly automatically adapting the inter-vehicle space gap and to avoiding collisions also in adverse road conditions (e.g., ice, heavy rain).

AB Nowadays, human-oriented has already become the direction of the development of the intelligent vehicle, among which, the cabin, in constant contact with drivers, is getting more and more attention. Intelligent assisted systems have alleviated the burden on drivers during long journeys and provided a remedy for operational errors. As the trend towards increasingly intelligent vehicles, the issue of human-machine codriving is receiving attention from scientific researchers. The technologies of human-machine interactions usually contain two parts, the human-to-vehicle and vehicle-to-human. This paper analyzes the potential innovation of human-machine systems from the perspective of human sensing, including visual, auditory, tactile, and olfactory. Based on the review of human-machine technologies, the current intelligentization of vehicles is divided into driver interaction and crew service systems. Then, the structure of a future intelligent interaction system considering multi-sensing is proposed and further discussed. Finally, by analyzing the relationship between the system for human and autonomous systems, a classification of the intelligence level for interaction systems is presented.

AB The automated steering control technology is crucial for an autonomous vehicle, but due to parametric uncertainties and time varying, the performance of automated steering control can be degraded. Therefore, a vehicle automated steering controller based on a model predictive control (MPC) approach is proposed in this article. First, considering tire nonlinear characteristics, the state and control matrices are modified, then the time-varying vehicle speed is considered and a linear parameter varying lateral model is established through utilizing a polytope with finite vertices to describe vehicle longitudinal velocity. Then, the MPC-based vehicle path tracking controller, which is robust against parameter uncertainties, is designed; the proposed controller can be solved via a set of linear matrix inequalities (LMI), which are derived from Lyapunov asymptotic stability and the minimization of the worst case infinite horizon quadratic objective function. The proposed control system is evaluated by both cosimulations of MATLAB/Simulink & CarSim and real-bus tests. Results show the effectiveness of the proposed controller, and it can ensure the control accuracy and strong robustness.

ID MODEL
AB Trajectory planning plays an important role in autonomous driving technology. This paper presents an improved Hybrid A* algorithm by considering vehicle dynamics in planning. First, a vehicle dynamic model with three degrees of freedom and a nonlinear UniTire tyre model are developed to describe the vehicle dynamics. Then, in order to generate curvature-continuous trajectory, the method of expanding nodes based on the rotation speed of steering wheel is introduced. Then, heuristic functions are designed for trajectory searching. In addition, the feasibility of the planning result is verified in the driver-vehicle-road closed loop system. Simulation results show the proposed trajectory planning method performs well under a variety of working conditions and the planned trajectory is trackable even at extreme conditions, e.g., high speed and low-adhesion road surfaces. Specifically, on the icy road, the planned results are good and the maximum lateral tracking error of this trajectory is limited to 0.24 m.

AB This paper describes the application of a novel methodology for high-level control and coordination of autonomous vehicle teams and its demonstration on high-fidelity models of the organic air vehicle developed at Honeywell Laboratories. The scheme employs decentralized receding horizon controllers that reside on each vehicle to achieve coordination among team members. An appropriate graph structure describes the underlying communication topology between the vehicles. On each vehicle, information about neighbors is used to predict their behavior and plan conflict-free trajectories that maintain coordination and achieve team objectives. When feasibility of the decentralized control is lost, collision avoidance is ensured by invoking emergency maneuvers that are computed via invariant set theory.

AB Path planning is one of the essential steps for autonomous ground vehicles or even wheeled mobile robots. This paper proposes a general framework for the path planning using quintic trigonometric Bezier curve with two shape parameters and C3 continuity. We express that when there are obstacles, predefined path can be adjusted by only using shape parameters without altering any obstacle. Additionally, the velocity, lateral acceleration, longitudinal and lateral jerks of the predefined cubic and quintic Bezier, and cubic and quintic trigonometric Bezier paths are compared. Also, a path surface for autonomous ground vehicles can be generated using developable surfaces.

AB A computationally efficient cycle time model for conceptualizing autonomous vehicle storage and retrieval systems and comparing their performance with crane-based automated storage and retrieval systems is presented. The model is based on an iterative computational scheme exploiting random storage assumptions and queuing model approximations. Relative to earlier models, the procedure scales up efficiently for large problems thereby enabling more extensive search of a design solution space. Simulation based validation studies suggest that model accuracy is adequate for system conceptualization. The procedure is demonstrated using realistically sized sample problems.

AB Due to the growing interest in automated driving, a deep understanding on the characteristics of human driving behavior is critical for human-like autonomous vehicles. Among various driving behaviors, lane change is the most important one for vehicle lateral driving safety. This study proposes an unsupervised method to extract and discover the behavioral patterns of lane change maneuvers for the purpose of exploring the composed behavioral patterns during lane change. This method involves two phases: Firstly, the lane change sequences will be segmented into blocks using time-series segmentation algorithms. Three segmentation algorithms were utilized in this study. In the second phase, the segments will be clustered to find the corresponding behavioral pattern of each segment. Two extended latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA) models were adopted to cluster the segments. The combination of different segmentation and clustering algorithms were evaluated and compared by employing entropy and perplexity as the evaluation criteria. Collected lane change data from naturalistic driving were applied to examine its effectiveness. The results show that this method could effectively mine descriptive behavioral patterns from lane change data. This study provides a promising data mining solution to facilitating deep and comprehensive understanding on driver lane change behaviors, which will promote the development of human-like autonomous vehicles.

AB Contemporary trends are focused on the development of the so-called smart, connected and multimedia cars as well as actions in the field of driving autonomy, and these trends may lead to changes in the structure of the industry through the emergence and growth of the importance of new entities. The article presents the concept of autonomous vehicles (AVs) and the way it is perceived by users of traditional cars. Surveys were carried out in various age groups on the possibilities of developing AVs in Poland. The group of respondents were inhabitants of a rural area, small towns and cities with over 300,000 inhabitants. Based on our own research, it can be concluded that, due to many different factors, including costs, legal regulations and conviction, among others, AVs will not appear so soon in common use on Polish roads. The results of the research showed that the majority of respondents consider hybrid vehicles (HVs) and then electric vehicles (EVs) to be the dominant type of vehicles in the near future in Poland, at the same time pointing at the long process of adopting AV technology.

AB Autonomous driving algorithms are always in operation during normal driving and require responses to many more driving situations than ADAS, which assists the driver only in specific risk scenarios. However, due to the absence of a quantitative algorithm evaluation method, most algorithms are evaluated in their own test scenarios. Even in similar cases in identical scenarios, different decisions may be made depending on small differences such as the speed or location of surrounding vehicles. Therefore, one representative scenario cannot cover all cases and it is difficult to quantitatively compare and evaluate algorithms. In this study, the parameters constituting the scenario are determined for lane change and intersection scenarios, typical scenarios in autonomous driving research. Then, all key parameters are swept within a certain range, and all cases that are slightly different are generated even in identical scenario. Simulations are performed automatically on the generated cases, and the vehicle risk is calculated on all cases based on the time to occupancy (TTO). Using this evaluation method, edge cases in which the autonomous algorithm may have weaknesses can be found.

AB Although automation of motorized vehicles has the potential to transform public transport as we know it, prospective users are still skeptical. Trials with shared autonomous vehicles (AVs) offer an opportunity to assess future demand in a more realistic setting. In the context of an autonomous shuttle service trial operating on public road-space in Switzerland, we carried out a mode choice experiment with a random sample of 773 potential users. Study participants could choose between a rental bike, walking, and the autonomous bus at varying costs, travel time, occupation, and weather conditions. Based on attitudinal survey items on technology commitment, consisting of technology acceptance, control, and competence that were integrated into a latent variable model, we study how technology commitment affects mode choice behaviour. While results show a comparably low willingness to pay, they also indicate that technology acceptance is a robust predictor of autonomous bus usage. In line with the technology adoption life cycle argument, potential users are currently mainly technology enthusiasts. Thus, in order to also "bring on board" the less technophile parts of the population, improved communication of AV benefits will be required.

AB Without any knowledge of the vehicle model and its parameters, a novel complete model-free path-following control strategy is developed for autonomous vehicles based on the time-delay estimation (TDE) technique. Different from the existing time-delay control (TDC) approaches, an adaptive nonsingular terminal sliding mode (ANTSM) control law is designed to stabilize the path-following errors without any information of the suitable control gain, which is significant in the conventional TDC scheme, and the boundary of the TDE error, which is necessary for the sliding-mode-based control scheme. The proposed model-free control structure can dynamically update the gain of the designed controller and the boundaries of the TDE error, and the practical finite-time convergence of the preview error can be achieved. In the HIL tests, the comparative results demonstrate that the proposed ANTSM model-free control strategy can provide superior comprehensive tracking performance over both the model-based sliding mode controller and the conventional TDC controller, while the autonomous vehicle follows desired paths.

AB Blockchain technology continues to grow and extend into more areas with great success, which highlights the importance of studying the fields that have been, and have yet to be, fundamentally changed by its entrance. In particular, blockchain technology has been shown to be increasingly relevant in the field of transportation systems. More studies continue to be conducted relating to both fields of study and their integration. It is anticipated that their existing relationships will be greatly improved in the near future, as more research is conducted and applications are better understood. Because blockchain technology is still relatively new as compared to older, more well-used methods, many of its future capabilities are still very much unknown. However, before they can be discovered, we need to fully understand past and current developments, as well as expert observations, in applying blockchain technology to the autonomous vehicle field. From an understanding and discussion of the current and potential future capabilities of blockchain technology, as provided through this survey, advancements can be made to create solutions to problems that are inherent in autonomous vehicle systems today. The focus of this paper is mainly on the potential applications of blockchain in the future of transportation systems to be integrated with connected and autonomous vehicles (CAVs) to provide a broad overview on the current related literature and research studies in this field.

AB Intelligent vehicles need high bandwidth wireless communication links for safety and commercial communication. However, the new generations of wireless communication networks (WCNs), such as quasi-optic millimeter-wave (mmWave) (5G) and visible light optic (6G) WCNs, are exposed to blockage/scattering problems in highly dense (urban) areas. In this paper, we propose a reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS)-equipped (unmanned aerial vehicle) UAV (RISeUAV) to secure an uninterrupted line-of-sight (LoS) communication link for an intelligent vehicle. The vehicle can be a smart ambulance and needs a stable high-speed link for autonomous navigation, also for continuous monitoring/diagnosing of the health condition of a patient. A two-stage method is proposed to address the NP-hardness and nonconvexity of planning an optimal trajectory for autonomous navigation of the RISeUAV limited to UAV motion and LoS constraints. In the first stage, the optimal tube path is determined by considering the energy consumption, LoS link, and UAV speed/acceleration constraints. In the second stage, an accurate RISeUAV trajectory is obtained through the secured tube path by considering the communication performance, passive beamforming, and nonholonomic constraint of the RISeUAV. Dynamic programming and successive convex approximation methods are used in the first and second stages, respectively. Simulation results show the accuracy/effectiveness of the method.

AB Navigating and interacting in a narrow space, especially where visual and range sensors do not work, is challenging for autonomous robotic vehicles. In such a scenario, collisions with obstacles and other vehicles are inevitable; thus, effective proximity detection systems are required for safe robot navigation and interactions. This article proposes an innovative design of vision-based soft tactile sensing system for autonomous robotic vehicles (ViART). ViART has a silicone rubber barrel-shaped skin. A set of markers interspaced around the inner surface equator of the skin is monitored by a fish-eye camera installed at one end of the barrel. Displacements of these markers are measured to perceive the physical interaction of tactile sensor and surrounding objects. Contact angle and force of the tactile sensor were estimated and evaluated through a series of experiments, achieving a mean absolute error of 1.12 degrees and 0.12 N, respectively. We demonstrated the capability of a developed sensing system with experiments of multiple autonomous mobile robots without visual feedback, showing its capability to navigate in challenging environments, such as narrow spaces, clustered obstacles, and a mix of static and dynamic obstacles. Moreover, with these experiments, we reveal how unique characteristics of the skin including 360 degrees multicontact detection and force measurement help leveraging the capacities of obstacle avoidance and navigation of multiagent robotic systems. Tactile-based multicontact sensing capacity provides information on the relative velocity for the robot to avoid obstacles efficiently, whereas tactile-based force estimation enables the robot to avoid obstacles by pushing obstacles away. We expect this contribution may pave a way to implement soft tactile sensing for robust, efficient, safe interaction, and navigation of autonomous vehicles in restricted environments.

AB The process of designing autonomous underwater vehicles comprises several steps, including the designing of the body shape. The hydrodynamic designing of the body shape is a major step in designing the body of an underwater vehicle. The effective parameters in the hydrodynamic design of body shape include the lengths of nose and tail, nose and tail profiles, and also the dimensions of the blunt sections in front of the nose and behind the tail. In the present study, the design of experiments method has been employed to investigate the effect of each of the above parameters on the drag coefficient of an autonomous underwater vehicle body. For this purpose, in addition to introducing the body classes of the Hydrolab family of underwater vehicles, the numerical simulation results of fluid flow over the body of a Hydrolab500 AUV have been used for the design of experiments. In the first step, an experiment has been performed in water tunnel on a test model in order to validate the pressure profile for the body of Hydrolab500. The comparison between the empirical and numerical results related to Hydrolab500 body confirms the validity of the numerical approach used in this paper. The results of the present work show that the drag coefficient of an autonomous submersible in the final design can be accurately estimated with the help of the presented method.

AB Artificial Intelligence (AI) and the constant paradigm shift in road traffic have led to a need for significant improvement in road safety to minimize traffic accidents. LiFi helps minimize accidents by transmitting data between multiple vehicles (i.e. Vehicle-to-Vehicle (V2V)) and between vehicles and infrastructure (i.e. Vehicle-to-Infrastructure (V2I)) without interference. LiFi uses light to transmit data between devices or vehicles, which ensures efficient data transmission speed and is therefore considered a safe technology. A method called Deep Jacobian Regression and Tate Bryant Euler Recommendation (DJR-TBER) is proposed in this paper based on V2V and V2I autonomous vehicle communication. The proposed method DJR-TBER consists of an input layer, four hidden layers and finally an output layer. Sensors are first used to obtain the information. A linear regression-based speed evaluation model is developed and followed by a Jacobi matrix-based distance evaluation model in the hidden layer. The third hidden layer by developing a distance evaluation model. The use of Laplacian function ensures secure V2I communication for the autonomous vehicle. Finally, a Tate-Bryant-Euler angle-based model for emergency handling is proposed in the hidden layer to optimally consider the aspect of braking in emergency situations and thus increase driving safety.

AB Transport is an area that is developing at a tremendous pace. This development applies not only to electric and hybrid cars appearing more and more often on the road but also to those of an autonomous or semi-autonomous nature. This applies to both passenger cars and vans. In many different publications, you can find a description of a number of benefits of using automated guided vehicles (AGV) for logistics and technical tasks, e.g., in the workplace. An important aspect is the use of knowledge management and machine learning, i.e., artificial intelligence (AI), to design these types of processes. An important issue in the construction of autonomous vehicles is the IT connection of sensors receiving signals from the environment. These signals are data for deep learning algorithms. The data after IT processing enable the decision-making by AI systems, while the used machine learning algorithms and neural networks are also needed for video image analysis in order to identify and classify registered objects. The purpose of this article is to present and verify a mathematical model used to respond to vehicles' demand for a transport service under set conditions. The optimal conditions of the system to perform the transport task were simulated, and the efficiency of this system and benefits of this choice were determined.

AB This article presents a computational framework for planning mine countermeasures (MCM) search missions by autonomous vehicles. It employs generalized optimal control (GenOC), a model-based trajectory optimization approach, to maximize the expected search performance of vehicle-sensor pairs in different minehunting scenarios. We describe each element of the proposed framework and adapt it to solve real-world MCM motion planning problems. A key contribution of this article develops sensor models that are more tunable than conventional ones based on lateral range curves. The proposed models incorporate engineering parameters and 3-D geometry to compute mine detection probability as a function of sonar design and search vehicle trajectories. Specific examples for various forward-looking and sidescan sonar systems deployed by unmanned vehicles are included. Objective computations utilize these sonar detection models during optimization to minimize the risk that candidate search trajectories fail to detect mines in an area of interest. Simulation results highlight the flexibility of our proposed GenOC framework and confirm that optimal trajectories outperform conventional search patterns under time or resource constraints. We conclude by identifying some of the practical considerations of this approach, and suggest ways that numerical analysis of GenOC solutions can be used for MCM mission planning and decision aid development.

AB This research was mainly focused on the evaluation of path planning approaches as a prerequisite for the automation of bale collection operations. A comparison between a traditional bale collection path planning approach using traditional vehicles such as tractors, and loaders with an optimized path planning approach using a new autonomous articulated concept vehicle with neighborhood reach capabilities (AVN) was carried out. Furthermore, the effects of carrying capacity on reduction in the working distance of the bale collection operation was also studied. It was concluded that the optimized path planning approach using AVN with increased carrying capacity significantly reduced the working distance for the bale collection operation and can thus improve agricultural sustainability, particularly within forage handling.

AB On 22 August 2004 the Autosub-2 autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) was on its return leg of a 144 km, 24 h under-ice mission in the Arctic sea over the Northwind Shoal off the northeast Greenland coast when it found its path blocked by a deep ice keel that had drifted across its planned mission route. After three attempts, the Autosub found a way around the keel and continued on its way to rendezvous with its mother ship. This paper reports the development, testing, and operation of collision and obstacle avoidance techniques used in the Arctic and Antarctic under-ice expeditions of the Autosub-2 AUV.

AB To further improve learning efficiency and performance of reinforcement learning (RL), a novel uncertainty-aware model-based RL method is proposed and validated in autonomous driving scenarios in this paper. First, an action-conditioned ensemble model with the capability of uncertainty assessment is established as the environment model. Then, a novel uncertainty-aware model-based RL method is developed based on the adaptive truncation approach, providing virtual interactions between the agent and environment model, and improving RL's learning efficiency and performance. The proposed method is then implemented in end-to-end autonomous vehicle control tasks, validated and compared with state-of-the-art methods under various driving scenarios. Validation results suggest that the proposed method outperforms the model-free RL approach with respect to learning efficiency, and model-based approach with respect to both efficiency and performance, demonstrating its feasibility and effectiveness.

AB Shared autonomous electric vehicles, also known as autonomous mobility on demand systems, are expected to become commercially available by the next decade. In this work we propose a methodology for the optimization of their charging with vehicle-to-grid in parallel with optimized routing and relocation. The methodology presented is based on previous work expanded to include charge optimization. The proposed model optimizes transport service and charging at two different time scales by running two model-predictive control optimization algorithms in parallel. Charging is optimized over longer time scales to minimize both approximate waiting times and electricity costs. Routing and relocation are optimized at shorter time scales to minimize waiting times, with the results of the long-time-scale optimization as charging constraints. This approach allows efficient optimization of both aspects of system operation. The problem is solved as a mixed-integer linear program. A case study using transport and electricity price data for Tokyo is used to test the model. Results show that the system can substantially reduce charging costs without significantly affecting waiting times, with cost reduction dependent on electricity price variability. Vehicle-to-grid is shown to be unsuitable for current electricity and battery prices, however offering substantial savings with price profiles with higher variability.

AB Realizing long-term autonomous missions involving teams of heterogeneous robots is a challenge. It requires mechanisms to make robots react to disturbances or failures that will arise during the mission, while trying to successfully achieve the mission in cooperation. This paper presents HiDDeN, a distributed deliberative architecture that manages the execution of a hierarchical plan. This plan has initially been computed offline, ensuring some military operational constraints of the mission. Each robot's supervisor then executes its own part of the plan, and reacts to failures using a hierarchical repair approach. This hierarchical repair has been designed with the sake of ensuring operational constraints, while reducing the need of communication between robots, as communication may be intermittent or even nonexistent when the robots operate in completely separate environments. HiDDeN's robustness and scalability is evaluated with simulations. Experiments with an autonomous helicopter and an autonomous underwater vehicle have been realized and are presented as the defining point of our contribution.

AB Future aerospace vehicles (ASV) are designed to fly in both inner and extra atmospheric fields, which requires autonomous adaptability to the uncertainties emanated from abrupt faults and continuously time-varying environments. An autonomous control reconfiguration scheme is presented for ASV to deal with the uncertainties on the base of control effectiveness estimation. The on-line estimation methods for the time-varying control effectiveness of linear control system are investigated. Some sufficient conditions for the estimable system are given for different cases. There are proposed corresponding on-line estimation algorithms which are proved to be convergent and robust to noise using the least-square-based methods. On the ground of fuzzy logic and linear programming, the control allocation algorithms, which are able to implement the autonomous control reconfiguration through the redundant actuators, are put forward. Finally, an integrated system is developed to verify the scheme and algorithms by way of numerical simulation and analysis.

ID TAKEOFF
AB Vision-based techniques are widely used in micro aerial vehicle autonomous landing systems. Existing vision-based autonomous landing schemes tend to detect specific landing landmarks by identifying their straightforward visual features such as shapes and colors. Though efficient to compute, these schemes only apply to landmarks with limited variability and require strict environmental conditions such as consistent lighting. To overcome these limitations, we propose an end-to-end landmark detection system based on a deep convolutional neural network, which not only easily scales up to a larger number of various landmarks but also exhibit robustness to different lighting conditions. Furthermore, we propose a separative implementation strategy which conducts convolutional neural network training and detection on different hardware platforms separately, i.e. a graphics processing unit work station and a micro aerial vehicle on-board system, subject to their specific implementation requirements. To evaluate the performance of our framework, we test it on synthesized scenarios and real-world videos captured by a quadrotor on-board camera. Experimental results validate that the proposed vision-based autonomous landing system is robust to landmark variability in different backgrounds and lighting situations.

AB Provably safe motion planning for automated road vehicles must ensure that planned motions do not result in a collision with other traffic participants. This is a major challenge in autonomous driving, since the future behavior of other traffic participants is not known and since traffic participants are often hidden due to occlusions. In this work, we propose a formal set-based prediction that contains all acceptable future behaviors of both detected and potentially hidden traffic participants. Based on formalized traffic rules and nondeterministic motion models, we perform reachability analysis to predict the set of possible occupancies and velocities of vehicles, pedestrians, and cyclists. Real-world experiments with a test vehicle in various traffic situations demonstrate the applicability and real-time capability of our over-approximative prediction for both online verification and fail-safe trajectory planning. Even in congested, complex traffic scenarios, our forecasting approach enables self-driving vehicles to never cause accidents.

AB In present-day highly-automated vehicles, there are occasions when the driving system disengages and the human driver is required to take-over. This is of great importance to a vehicle's safety and ride comfort. In the U.S state of California, the Autonomous Vehicle Testing Regulations require every manufacturer testing autonomous vehicles on public roads to submit an annual report summarizing the disengagements of the technology experienced during testing. On 1 January 2016, seven manufacturers submitted their first disengagement reports: Bosch, Delphi, Google, Nissan, Mercedes-Benz, Volkswagen, and Tesla Motors. This work analyses the data from these disengagement reports with the aim of gaining abetter understanding of the situations in which a driver is required to takeover, as this is potentially useful in improving the Society of Automotive Engineers (SAE) Level 2 and Level 3 automation technologies. Disengagement events from testing are classified into different groups based on attributes and the causes of disengagement are investigated and compared in detail. The mechanisms and time taken for take-over transition occurred in disengagements are studied. Finally, recommendations for OEMs, manufacturers, and government organizations are also discussed.

This method quickly converges and provides an accurate in situ assessment of metals present, which helps the control system of the AUV to decide on future sampling locations.

AB This paper proposes a novel integrated multi-algorithm fusion localization and trajectory tracking framework for autonomous vehicles under extreme conditions with non-Gaussian noises. Firstly, in order to solve the problem that GPS signals are interfered with non-Gaussian noises or lost, a localization method based on Particle Filter (PF) is designed, which takes full advantage of the reference objects position information and vehicle driving state information, thus realizing the self-localization for high-speed autonomous vehicles. Besides, considering the accumulated errors of the model-driven Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU) in the long-horizon positioning prediction, an online future driving state prediction algorithm based on multi-order variable-step Markov model (MM) is proposed to calculate the future vehicle position in scenarios without reference. The fusion of these two methods can give full play to their respective advantages, thus improving the accuracy and robustness of the whole localization algorithm in scenes with non-Gaussian noises. Then, the location information and the future driving state are applied to the trajectory tracking controller based on adaptive model predictive control (AMPC). Finally, the CarSim-Matlab/Simulink cGAOo-simulations results show the effectiveness of the proposed framework when GPS signal is interfered with non-Gaussian noises, which further improve the positioning accuracy and autonomous tracking stability.

AB In this paper a linear MPC control scheme is proposed to address the motion problems of an autonomous wheelchair in a realistic environment. Thanks to an inner feedback-linearizing loop, the formulation of the model predictive control problem is simplified, allowing for a real-time computationally-efficient implementation. Thanks to the MPC framework, constraints like obstacle avoidance, actuator limitations, and passenger comfort have been included in the optimization problem. Experimental results show the effectiveness of the proposed scheme.

This work describes the enhancement of the AUV's maneuverability through the addition of thrusters, the leveraging of a state-of-the-art thrust allocation algorithm, and the development of both a path-following controller and a dedicated imaging system. The performance of the optimized platform is demonstrated in a simulation and in actual real sea visual survey missions.

AB Trajectory planning for autonomous vehicles is a research topical subject. In previous studies, optimal intermediate targets have been used in the Potential Fields (PFs). PFs are only a path planning method, or a reactive obstacle avoidance method and not a trajectory tracking method. In this article, the PFs are interpreted as an on-line control method to follow an optimal trajectory. An analysis and methodological approach to design the attractive potential as a robust controller are proposed, and a new definition of a fractional repulsive potential to characterize the dangerousness of obstacles is developed. Simulation results on autonomous vehicles are given.

AB This paper presents a hybrid behavior-based scheme using reinforcement learning for high-level control of autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs). Two main features of the presented approach are hybrid behavior coordination and semi on-line neural-Q_learning (SONQL). Hybrid behavior coordination takes advantages of robustness and modularity in the competitive approach as well as efficient trajectories in the cooperative approach. SONQL, a new continuous approach of the Q_learning algorithm with a multilayer neural network is used to learn behavior state/action mapping online. Experimental results show the feasibility of the presented approach for AUVs.

AB The term metaverse, which shows a 3D-designed virtual medium where people can connect through their avatars to spend time, telecommute, and socialize, has entered our lives fast. There are limitless implementations that can take place in the metaverse. Integration of another technological innovation, which is autonomous vehicles to the metaverse, is at hand. There are numerous alternative uses of autonomous vehicles in the metaverse. In this study, three alternative implementation options for autonomous vehicles in the metaverse are investigated. These alternatives are evaluated using the proposed multi-criteria decision-making (MCDM) method under twelve different criteria, which are grouped under four main aspects, namely technological, societal, legal and ethical, and transportation. A novel hybrid model based on q-rung orthopair fuzzy sets (q-ROFSs) which consists of three stages is presented to express the framework definition, calculate the weight coefficients of the criteria, and rank various alternatives. In the first stage, the structure of the problem is created. In the second stage, q-ROFSs based OPA algorithm is used to calculate the weights of the criteria. In the last stage, q-ROFSs based RAFSI (Ranking of Alternatives through Functional mapping of criterion sub-intervals into a Single Interval) is applied to choose the best alternative among the three alternatives. Finally, we present a case study to verify our proposed method. The results of this study have the potential to be used as a guide by decision-makers of the metaverse while integrating autonomous vehicles into the transportation system.

AB Autonomous vehicles (AVs) may have a transformative influence on transportation systems. AV use is expected to reduce crash, transport costs, and land use. However, the net effects of the autonomous vehicle are unknown because there are no fully-autonomous vehicles in reality. The simulation systems are indispensable to be built up not only for cost but also for obtaining massive data. An agent-based simulation is capable of simulating the entities in a complex system, such as the AV system. Considering the potential of agent-based models to complement existing models and the difficulty to understand, to duplicate and to compare different agent-based models, this paper review existing agent-based modeling of autonomous vehicles with the help of ODD protocol, which has been applied in the review of agent-based land-use change models and agricultural policy evaluation. The significant variables that researchers have taken into consideration in sensitivity analysis and in the different scenarios are explored in the paper. Fleet size is the primary variable researchers considered, and we also discussed the probable causes of different AV replacement rates. We have assessed the quality of reviewed articles to gain more acceptance from the agent-based modeling community. Most of the reviewed papers follow the ODD protocol of agent decision making. However, in order to improve the level of modeling transparency, the executable and related data shall be available, at least the data source and the programming language/simulation platform should be provided. Several recommendations for further research are also presented.

AB The paper describes the current developments of a class of low-cost, light-weight autonomous underwater vehicles for coastal oceanographic applications; the vehicle class is named Folaga, the Italian name of an aquatic bird that swims on the water surface and dives to catch fish. The main design characteristics of the most recent vehicle of the class, the Folaga III, are reviewed. Navigation and control system design are discussed, with particular attention to the diving phase, which is accomplished as in oceanographic gliders by varying the vehicle buoyancy and attitude. Experimental results show that the PID robust controllers implemented are effective in the diving control phase. Finally, a distributed cooperation algorithm to be applied by a team of Folaga-like vehicles in adaptive oceanographic sampling applications is described. The algorithm optimizes area coverage while taking into account the accuracy in the reconstruction of the oceanographic field and inter-vehicle communication through a range constraint. The resulting dynamic programming algorithm can be implemented in a distributed fashion among the team components. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

ID AUTOMATED VEHICLES
AB Emerging info-communication and vehicle technologies (especially vehicle automation) facilitate evolvement of autonomous road freight transportation. The entire transport system and its operation undergo a major change. New service concepts are growing and the existing ones are being transformed. The changing is particularly significant in city logistics. However, there are debates about the ways of automation of processes targeting improvement of capacity utilisation and decrease of expenditures. The main research questions of the paper are therefore: what properties of the future autonomous freight transportation are presumed; what system structure is to be constructed and how the system is to be operated? After introducing the basic notions and reviews of the current systems and developments, the shifting from traditional freight transportation to autonomous system is investigated by several aspects. A system-and process-oriented analytical modelling method has been applied. The main system constituents and their connections are modelled. Finally, we elaborate the operational model of road freight transportation, which is applicable principally in metropolitan areas. In conclusion, the presented results appoint the research and innovation trends towards the automation of freight transportation.

AB Autonomous mapless navigation is very challenging since it is difficult to effectively find the way without a map. In this article, we address a problem encountered when realizing reinforcement learning (RL)-based autonomous mapless navigation of a mobile vehicle with depth sensors when only local depth images and relative target positions are available. This study aims to determine the velocity of the mobile vehicle to avoid collisions and reach the final destination as soon as possible. To accomplish this objective, a new approach, called hindsight-intermediate-target-based RL (HIT-RL), to realize autonomous mapless navigation is proposed to effectively take detour routes to the destination based solely on recent local observations. The proposed HIT-RL generates virtual intermediate targets that guide the mobile vehicle to the final destination. The velocity of the mobile vehicle, as the action of RL, is determined to aim for the intermediate targets, and trained with a neural network to reach the original target by rewarding for it. Navigation tasks realized with an aerial vehicle, or a drone, that the proposed HIT-RL allows the mobile vehicle to effectively escape from dead ends without a map and, hence, reach the final destination within a reasonable time. The navigation performance is also illustrated with an actual mobile vehicle system to show that the proposed HIT-RL exhibits good performance in practical environments.

AB The introduction of autonomous vehicles (AV) will represent a milestone in the evolution of transportation and personal mobility. AVs are expected to significantly reduce accidents and congestion, while being economically and environmentally beneficial. However, many challenges must be overcome before reaching this ideal scenario. This study, which results from on-site visits to top research centres and a comprehensive literature review, provides an overall state-of-the-practice on the subject and identifies critical issues to succeed. For example, although most of the required technology is already available, ensuring the robustness of AVs under all boundary conditions is still a challenge. Additionally, the implementation of AVs must contribute to the environmental sustainability by promoting the usage of alternative energies and sustainable mobility patterns. Electric vehicles and sharing systems are suitable options, although both require some refinement to incentivise a broader range of customers. Other aspects could be more difficult to resolve and might even postpone the generalisation of automated driving. For instance, there is a need for cooperation and management strategies geared towards traffic efficiency. Also, for transportation and land-use planning to avoid negative territorial and economic impacts. Above all, safe and ethical behaviour rules must be agreed upon before AVs hit the road.

AB Autonomous navigation technology is used in various applications, such as agricultural robots and autonomous vehicles. The key technology for autonomous navigation is ego-motion estimation, which uses various sensors. Wheel encoders and global navigation satellite systems (GNSSs) are widely used in localization for autonomous vehicles, and there are a few quantitative strategies for handling the information obtained through their sensors. In many cases, the modeling of uncertainty and sensor fusion depends on the experience of the researchers. In this study, we address the problem of quantitatively modeling uncertainty in the accumulated GNSS and in wheel encoder data accumulated in anonymous urban environments, collected using vehicles. We also address the problem of utilizing that data in ego-motion estimation. There are seven factors that determine the magnitude of the uncertainty of a GNSS sensor. Because it is impossible to measure each of these factors, in this study, the uncertainty of the GNSS sensor is expressed through three variables, and the exact uncertainty is calculated. Using the proposed method, the uncertainty of the sensor is quantitatively modeled and robust localization is performed in a real environment. The approach is validated through experiments in urban environments.

LA English
DT Article
DE SLAM; LPV; Kalman Filter; LMI; autonomous vehicles
ID SIMULTANEOUS LOCALIZATION
AB Most existing algorithms in mobile robotics consider a kinematic robot model for the the Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) problem. However, in the case of autonomous vehicles, because of the increase in the mass and velocities, a kinematic model is not enough to characterize some physical effects as, e.g., the slip angle. For this reason, when applying SLAM to autonomous vehicles, the model used should be augmented considering both kinematic and dynamic behaviours. The inclusion of dynamic behaviour implies that nonlinearities of the vehicle model are most important. For this reason, classical observation techniques based on the the linearization of the system model around the operation point, such as the well known Extended Kalman Filter (EKF), should be improved. Consequently, new techniques of advanced control must be introduced to more efficiently treat the nonlinearities of the involved models. The Linear Parameter Varying (LPV) technique allows working with nonlinear models, making a pseudolinear representation, and establishing systematic methodologies to design state estimation schemes applying several specifications. In recent years, it has been proved in many applications that this advanced technique is very useful in real applications, and it has been already implemented in a wide variety of application fields. In this article, we present a SLAM-based localization system for an autonomous vehicle considering the dynamic behaviour using LPV techniques. Comparison results are provided to show how our proposal outperforms classical observation techniques based on model linearization.

AB The strapdown inertial navigation system (SINS) is widely used in autonomous vehicles. However, the random drift error of gyroscope leads to serious accumulated navigation errors during long continuous operation of SINS alone. In this paper, we propose to combine the Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU) data with the line feature parameters from a camera to improve the navigation accuracy. The proposed method can also maintain the autonomy of the navigation system. Experimental results show that the proposed inertial-visual navigation system can mitigate the SINS drift and improve the accuracy, stability, and reliability of the navigation system.

AB Big data already covers intelligent vehicles and is driving the autonomous driving industry's transformation. However, the large amounts of driving data generated will result in complex issues and a huge workload for the test and verification processes of an autonomous driving system. Only effective and precise data extraction and recording aimed at the challenges of low efficiency, poor quality, and a long-time limit for traditional data acquisition can substantially reduce the algorithm development cycle. Based on the premise of driver-dominated vehicle movement, the virtual decision-making of autonomous driving systems under the accompanying state was considered as a reference. Based on a dynamic time warping algorithm and forming a data filtering approach under a dynamic time window, an automatic trigger recording control model for human-vehicle difference feature data was suggested. In this method, the data dimension was minimized, and the efficiency of the data mining was improved. The experimental findings showed that the suggested model decreased recorded invalid data by 75.35% on average and saved about 2.65 TB of data storage space per hour. Compared with industrial-grade methods, it saves an average of 307 GB of storage space per hour.

AB This study argues that policymaking guided by public values can help to secure public benefit in technology implementation, for two reasons. Firstly, the emergence and deliberation over plural values can result in more publicly beneficial outcomes; secondly, public values establish the meaningful link between public interest and policy goals. We explore the value bases of arguments around the societal implementation of autonomous vehicles through interviews with professionals. Mapping values on a conceptual model with two dimensions of recognition-neglect and consensus-dissensus, we find that a limited set of values receives recognition, while two distinct sets are contested or neglected almost entirely.

ID INTEGRATION
AB In this paper, we model three layers of transportation disruption first electrification, then autonomy, and finally sharing and pooling in order to project transportation electricity demand and greenhouse gas emissions in the United States to 2050. Using an expanded kaya identity framework, we model vehicle stock, energy intensity, and vehicle miles traveled, progressively considering the effects of each of these three disruptions. We find that electricity use from light duty vehicle transport will likely be in the 570-1140 TWh range, 13-26%, respectively, of total electricity demand in 2050. Depending on the pace at which the electric sector decarbonizes, this increase in electric demand could correspond to a decrease in LDV greenhouse gas emissions of up to 80%. In the near term, rapid and complete transport electrification with a carbon-free grid should remain the cornerstones of transport decarbonization policy. However, long-term policy should also aim to mitigate autonomous vehicles' potential to increase driving mileage, urban and suburban sprawl, and traffic congestion while incentivizing potential energy efficiency improvements through both better system management and the lightweighting of an accident-free vehicle fleet.

AB Autonomous vehicles (AVs) have the potential to improve the health and well-being of older people. This exploratory study involved in-depth interviews with 43 key stakeholders across a broad range of sectors to identify the primary policy implications of AVs for aging populations. Four main issues were evident: a general lack of salience of the needs of older people in the AV discourse, the perceived dominance of the commercial drivers of AV technology, the implications of the particular characteristics of the senior segment, and a lack of available analyses to guide decision making. Threats and opportunities represented by these issues are discussed.

AB Automotive sensors are essential to autonomous driving, which performs various functions to perceive the surrounding environment. Among the various functions of the automotive sensors, the estimation of vehicle orientation is considered significant in responding to unpredictable situations in a dynamic driving environment. In this article, we propose a method of estimating the vehicle orientation using a cascaded multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) frequency-modulated continuous-wave (FMCW) radar system. The radar signal is collected by varying the orientation angle of the vehicle, and the point cloud data corresponding to the vehicle are extracted through signal preprocessing. Because the processed point cloud data are distributed along the axis of vehicle orientation, the orientation angle can be estimated by applying regression algorithms. We used the principal component analysis (PCA), decision tree, and convolutional neural network (CNN) algorithms for regression and compared their performances. The comparison of various estimation methods showed that the proposed method of using the CNN framework can accurately estimate the orientation angle of a vehicle within a root mean square error (RMSE) of 4 degrees.

TI Vehicle autonomous localization in local area of coal mine tunnel based

SO PLOS ONE
LA English
DT Article
ID SYSTEM; ENVIRONMENT; ROBOT
AB This paper presents a vehicle autonomous localization method in local area of coal mine tunnel based on vision sensors and ultrasonic sensors. Barcode tags are deployed in pairs on both sides of the tunnel walls at certain intervals as artificial landmarks. The barcode coding is designed based on UPC-A code. The global coordinates of the upper left inner corner point of the feature frame of each barcode tag deployed in the tunnel are uniquely represented by the barcode. Two on-board vision sensors are used to recognize each pair of barcode tags on both sides of the tunnel walls. The distance between the upper left inner corner point of the feature frame of each barcode tag and the vehicle center point can be determined by using a visual distance projection model. The on-board ultrasonic sensors are used to measure the distance from the vehicle center point to the left side of the tunnel walls. Once the spatial geometric relationship between the barcode tags and the vehicle center point is established, the 3D coordinates of the vehicle center point in the tunnel's global coordinate system can be calculated. Experiments on a straight corridor and an underground tunnel have shown that the proposed vehicle autonomous localization method is not only able to quickly recognize the barcode tags affixed to the tunnel walls, but also has relatively small average localization errors in the vehicle center point's plane and vertical coordinates to meet autonomous unmanned vehicle positioning requirements in local area of coal mine tunnel.

DE valet parking; autonomous vehicle; LiDAR; parking maneuver
AB Autonomous parking valet systems improve users' comfort, helping with the task of searching for a parking space and parking maneuvering; and due to the simple infrastructure design and low speeds, this maneuver is quite feasible for automated vehicles. Various demonstrations have been performed in both closed parking and in open air parking; scenarios that allow the use of specific technological tools for navigation and searching for a parking space. However, there are still challenges. The purpose of this paper was the integration of perception, positioning, decision-making, and maneuvering algorithms for the control of an autonomous vehicle in a parking lot with the support of a single LiDAR sensor, and with no additional sensors in the infrastructure. Based on a digital map, which was as simplified as possible, the driver can choose the range of parking spaces in which the vehicle must look for a space. From that moment on, the vehicle moves, looking for free places until an available one in the range selected by the driver is found. Then, the vehicle performs the parking maneuver, choosing between two alternatives to optimize the required space. Tests in a real parking lot, with spaces covered with metallic canopies, showed an accurate behavior.

AB Through vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) communication, both human-driven and autonomous vehicles can actively exchange data, such as velocities and bumper-to-bumper distances. Employing the shared data, control laws with improved performance can be designed for connected and autonomous vehicles (CAVs). In this article, taking into account human-vehicle interaction and heterogeneous driver behavior, an adaptive optimal control design method is proposed for a platoon mixed with multiple preceding human-driven vehicles and one CAV at the tail. It is shown that by using reinforcement learning and adaptive dynamic programming techniques, a near-optimal controller can be learned from real-time data for the CAV with V2V communications, but without the precise knowledge of the accurate car-following parameters of any driver in the platoon. The proposed method allows the CAV controller to adapt to different platoon dynamics caused by the unknown and heterogeneous driver-dependent parameters. To improve the safety performance during the learning process, our off-policy learning algorithm can leverage both the historical data and the data collected in real time, which leads to considerably reduced learning time duration. The effectiveness and efficiency of our proposed method is demonstrated by rigorous proofs and microscopic traffic simulations.

AB Connected autonomous vehicles can significantly improve the safety and mobility of urban transportation systems. However, these systems are vulnerable to model uncertainties, wireless communication impairments, and external disturbances. In this article, we propose a new autonomous intersection management (AIM) system, called hierarchical model predictive control (HMPC). In HMPC, the intersection coordination unit (ICU) in a global centralized layer is responsible for assigning a safe speed to each vehicle while minimizing the system's cost. In the Local decentralized layer, each vehicle is responsible for tracking the reference speed assigned by the ICU, while avoiding collisions. In our method, each vehicle can use its own sensors to monitor its close surroundings, and take its own decisions on its movements, independent on the control decisions sent from the ICU. We investigate the safety, scalability and robustness of HMPC compared with two well-known AIM methods based on centralized and decentralized control strategies. For the evaluation, we use simulation of urban mobility (SUMO). Further, we study the scalability and performance of the algorithms in the presence of communication impairments associated with wireless channels. Our simulation results show that HMPC can safely handle high traffic flow rates. Also, HMPC is robust to uncertainties caused by the wireless communication.

AB Given the recent advances in computer vision, image processing and control systems, self-driving vehicles has been one of the most promising and challenging research topics nowadays. The design of vision -based robust controllers to keep an autonomous car in the center of the lane, despite uncertainties and disturbances, is still an ongoing challenge. This paper presents a hybrid control architecture that combines Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) and Robust Linear Quadratic Regulator (RLQR) for vision-based lateral control of an autonomous vehicle. Evolutionary estimation is used to model the vehicle uncertainties. For performance comparison, a DRL method and three other hybrid controllers are also evaluated. The inputs for each controller are real-time semantically segmented RGB camera images which serve as the basis to calculate continuous steering actions to keep the vehicle on the center of the lane with a constant velocity. Simulation results show that the proposed hybrid RLQR with evolutionary estimation of uncertainties architecture outperforms the other algorithms implemented. It presents lower tracking errors, smoother steering inputs, total collision avoidance and better generalization in new urban environments. Furthermore, it significantly decreases the required training time.

AB This paper develops a Mathematical approach to optimize a time-dependent deployment plan of autonomous vehicle (AV) lanes on a transportation network with heterogeneous traffic stream consisting of both conventional vehicles (CVs) and AVs, so as to minimize the social cost and promote the adoption of AVs. Specifically, AV lanes are exclusive lanes that can only be utilized by AVs, and the deployment plan specifies when, where, and how many AV lanes to be deployed. We first present a multi-class network equilibrium model to describe the flow distributions of both CVs and AVs, given the presence of AV lanes in the network. Considering that the net benefit (e.g., reduced travel cost) derived from the deployment of AV lanes will further promote the AV adoption, we proceed to apply a diffusion model to forecast the evolution of AV market penetration. With the equilibrium model and diffusion model, a time-dependent deployment model is then formulated, which can be solved by an efficient solution algorithm. Lastly, numerical examples based on the south Florida network are presented to demonstrate the proposed models. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

The proposed technique is based on the definition of suitable task functions that are handled in the framework of singularity-robust task-priority inverse kinematics. The algorithm is implemented by a two-stage control architecture such that intervehicle communication is not required. The effectiveness of the approach is investigated by means of numerical simulation case studies.

AB This paper proposes a data-driven control approach on the basis of polynomial regressors for autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs). In contrast to conventional control approach, data-driven control does not require modeling for the systems. It only utilizes the analysis of massive stored dataset to predict the future control input, which can achieve the future output. Generally, the massive stored dataset can be analyzed by short-length vectors linearly. In this paper, a novel point is the improvement of existing data-driven control by polynomial regressors, which improve the control performance of AUVs. By numerical simulations, we illustrate the effectiveness of our proposed approach.

AB A small (50-kg, 2-m long) underwater vehicle with operating speeds of 20-30 cm/s and ranges up to 6000 kin has been developed and field tested. The vehicle is essentially an autonomous profiling float that uses a buoyancy engine to cycle vertically and wings to glide horizontally while moving up and down. Operational control and data relay is provided by GPS navigation and two-way communication through ORBCOMM low-earth-orbit satellites. Missions are envisioned with profile measurements repeated at a station or spaced along a transect. The initial instrument complement of temperature, conductivity, and pressure sensors was used to observe internal waves and tides in the Monterey underwater canyon.

AB This article presents a modified line-of-sight (LOS) guidance law and an adaptive neural network (NN) controller for underactuated marine vehicles in the presence of uncertainties and constraints. Unlike conventional LOS guidance, the proposed guidance law counteracts the drift caused by external disturbances to maintain zero cross-track error. Furthermore, an adaptive NN controller is designed using the barrier Lyapunov function (BLF) to deal with the system constraints and disturbances affecting unknown vehicle dynamics. The stability analysis of the adaptive controller guarantees the uniform ultimate boundedness of the closed-loop system. The proposed control strategy is verified in the simulation and experimental environment in the presence of external disturbances. Both simulation and experimental results confirm that the proposed modified LOS guidance law and adaptive NN controller guarantees asymptotic convergence to the desired path and maintains zero cross-track error despite environmental disturbances.

AB The Ground Control Station (GCS) is one of the essential elements to supervise and control autonomous vehicles performing complex missions. The increasing number of systems that involve multiple autonomous vehicles is making traditional GCSs evolve to let them handle different vehicles and operators. In this article, we present the more relevant properties of a versatile adaptable GCS that has been especially designed to let multiple operators, each using a different computer equipment, be in charge of controlling a heterogeneous team of autonomous vehicles. Its main properties are the possibility of 1) reconfiguring which information is displayed to each operator, 2) defining alarms to draw the operators attention when required, and 3) re-assigning, in real-time, the vehicles to different operators. These properties are supported by a distributed design of the GCS software architecture, presented in the paper and consistent of: a communication module, a high level planner, replicable monitoring and supervising units, and as many commanders as vehicles within each mission. This GCS has been developed within SALACOM (an autonomous system for locating and acting against sea spills), where two Unmanned Surface Vehicles (USVs) cooperate to collect a sea spill under the supervision of several operators that are responsible of the security of the mission. Finally, this paper also presents a case of use of the GCS within a real-world experiment involving two USVs performing leader-follower formation maneouvres.

TI Path Tracking Method Based on Model Predictive Control and Genetic
   Algorithm for Autonomous Vehicle
SO MATHEMATICAL PROBLEMS IN ENGINEERING
LA English
DT Article
AB Model predictive control (MPC) is often used for controlling the autonomous vehicle tracking the target path. But to apply MPC schemes, the nonlinear model of vehicle kinematics needs to be approximately converted to a linear format, and the path tracking problem has to be converted into certain formats in order to implement the solver of convex quadratic programming. To solve these issues, a control strategy combining MPC and genetic algorithm (GA) is put forward. The nonlinear predictive model is adopted to predict the future movement of a controlled vehicle. The objective function is established according to the future movement and target path. Instead of using a convex quadratic programming solver, GA is applied to solve the optimization problem. The proposed MPC-GA method can handle the arbitrary nonlinear problem and make the objective function more comprehensible and flexible. This method is applied in solving the path tracking problem of an autonomous vehicle. Both simulations and on-field tests are conducted. The results validate the efficiency of the proposed MPC-GA path tracking method in comparison with traditional methods. With the MPC-GA controller, the automatic driving on the park road is basically realized. The control strategy can be considered as an alternative method to solve the path tracking problem for an autonomous vehicle.

AB In this study, we propose a robust nonlinear control method using the barrier Lyapunov function (BLF) under the lateral offset error constraint for lateral control of autonomous vehicles. Furthermore, for the application of the BLF-based control method to lateral control, we propose a second-order lateral dynamics scheme based on the look-ahead distance of the vehicle. In the second-order lateral dynamics, the system functions with unknown parameters, and the external disturbances can be lumped into a disturbance term. The proposed method consists of an extended state observer (ESO) and a nonlinear controller. The ESO is designed to estimate the full state variable and disturbance, including the system modeling and external disturbance. The nonlinear controller is developed using the BLF to compensate for the disturbances and to guarantee the constraint for the lateral offset error. Consequently, the proposed method satisfies the output constraint in the presence of disturbances and modeling uncertainties as well as improves the lateral control performance using only the lateral offset error at the look-ahead distance. The lateral control performance of the proposed method is validated using CarSim and MATLAB/Simulink.

DE CAV-F; autonomous freight; dangerous goods; medical deliveries; policy
AB Health service providers in developed nations are responsible for 5% of their national carbon emissions, much of which originate from transport and supply chains. Connected autonomous freight vehicles (CAV-Fs) offer the potential to reduce this impact and enable lower cost operations, with trials being explored across the world. Transportation and carriage regulations, particularly in relation to the movement of dangerous goods (DG) such as medicines and diagnostic specimens, have not been developed for and applied to this new transport mode, particularly where loads are unaccompanied. Through an audit of current legislation and practice, this paper evaluates current DGs regulations applied to the transportation of medical products and medicines by autonomous road vehicles. Where existing regulations are not appropriate for CAV-Fs, recommendations and adaptations have been proposed to support safe and practical application. Remote monitoring and tracking of vehicles are critical for ensuring load security, quick and effective incident response, and management of documents and communications between parties. Loading/unloading procedures are significantly more important than in crewed vehicles, with load segregation and recording of all activity being of key importance. Other recommendations relate to training provision, vehicle specifications, and product health monitoring.

AB This paper presents an analysis of several criticality metrics used for evaluating the safety of Autonomous Vehicles (AVs) and also proposes environmentally friendly metrics with the scope of facilitating their selection by future researchers who want to evaluate both the safety and environmental impact of AVs. Regarding this, first, we investigate whether existing criticality metrics are applicable as a reward component in Reinforcement Learning (RL), which is a popular learning framework for training autonomous systems. Second, we propose environmentally friendly metrics that take into consideration the environmental impact by measuring the CO2 emissions of traditional vehicles as well as measuring the motor power used by electric vehicles. Third, we discuss the usefulness of using criticality metrics for Artificial Intelligence (AI) training. Finally, we apply a selected number of criticality metrics as RL reward component in a simple simulated car-following scenario. More exactly, we applied them together in an RL task, with the objective of learning a policy for following a lead vehicle that suddenly stops at two different opportunities. As demonstrated by our experimental results, this work serves as an example for the research community of applying metrics both as reward components in RL and as measures of the safety and environmental impact of AVs.

AB This paper focuses on the application of Multi-Objective Evolutionary Algorithms (MOEAs) to develop a Fuzzy Rule-Based System (FRBS) dedicated to manage the speed of an autonomous vehicle in an intersection scenario.
   Compared to other intersection scenarios, the main point here is that the autonomous vehicle is approaching an intersection that is being crossed by a row of manual vehicles those are not paying any attention to the presence of the autonomous vehicle, thus making coordination impossible. In this case, the autonomous vehicle bears sole responsibility for adapting its speed to the state of the other vehicles, with the aim of completing the maneuver safely and efficiently.
   The specific conditions of this problem make it complex because of the large time requirements needed to consider multiple criteria (which enlarge the solution search space) and the long computation time required in each evaluation. In addition, the large number of variables involved increases the complexity of the scenario.
   In this paper, a MOEA is proposed to obtain a more compact and efficient FRBS. The proposal is based on the well-known Strength Pareto Evolutionary Algorithm 2 (SPEA2) technique, but uses different mechanisms for guiding the search towards the desired Pareto zone. The MOEA uses specific operators to deal with the problem, to inherit fitness values from one generation to the next, thus arranging that it is only necessary to execute one scenario per generation to obtain an FRBS that works fine in many situations. In addition, the most important rules are identified in each FRBS, with the aim of realizing balanced crossovers. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Connected and autonomous vehicles (CAVs) can fulfill the emerging demand for smart transportation on a global scale. Such innovations for transportation can bring manyfold benefits, from fully autonomous driving services to proactive vehicle monitoring and traffic management. However, given the complexity involved in the deployment of CAVs, zero-tolerance safety, and security measures must be incorporated to avert vehicle immobilization, road accidents, disclosure of sensitive data, or any potential threats. In this article, we conceive a reference architecture for a CAVs ecosystem to derive a common attack taxonomy for the investigation of existing and emerging cyber threats. Subsequently, we discuss security mechanisms for the CAVs ecosystem that can be useful for the safe and secure transportation of passengers from one destination to another based on comprehensive studies of academic literature and industry white papers. Our work can provide valuable insights to security engineers and system architects for investigating security problems using a top-to-bottom approach and can aid in envisioning robust security solutions to ensure seamless CAVs operations.

DE autonomous lane change; risk assessment; cooperation concept
ID SITUATION ASSESSMENT
AB In this study, we present an innovative approach to risk assessment for rear-end collision avoidance using a cooperation concept for an autonomous lane change system. A Kalman filter is designed to estimate the longitudinal acceleration and predict the relative longitudinal position, velocity, and acceleration. Risk assessment is performed using the predicted motion of the object vehicle in the target lane. The cooperation concept is proposed to improve the flexibility of the lane change. If the risk assessment for the lane change indicates collision risk, the cooperativeness of the driver of the object vehicle is determined. If the driver of the object vehicle is regarded as a cooperative driver, within the original lane, the ego vehicle moves toward the target lane in preparation for the lane change. Subsequently, as soon as the risk assessment indicates that there is no collision risk, the lane change is performed. Thus, unlike conventional methods, the autonomous lane change using the proposed risk assessment can be initiated. Furthermore, the proposed risk assessment using cooperation concept is more flexible compared with previous methods for autonomous lane change in cluttered traffic.

DE Autonomous vehicles; calibration; planar motion; sloping motion;

ID MOTION; ROBUST
AB The extrinsic calibration of visual-inertial sensors has always been a complex problem for autonomous vehicles because the vehicle usually moves on a plane, rendering the calibration problem degenerate. Even if the vehicle drives on a slope, many great works are ineffective due to insufficient excitation. To address these challenges, we propose a method for calibrating the extrinsic parameters of camera and inertial measurement unit (IMU) sensors for vehicles, which involves two key contributions. The first is the introduction of a virtual vehicle reference frame, acting as a bridge to calibrate rotation in degenerate cases. This involves formulating two least-squares problems to estimate the 3-D relative rotation of the camera-IMU. Second, we propose an approach for estimating camera-IMU translation when a vehicle is navigating on a slope. This is done by solving a linear system, and these values are then refined using an algorithm that takes into account the gravitational magnitude. Extensive experimental results show that our proposed method effectively estimates rotation in planar motion and translation in sloping motion. Moreover, it achieves competitive accuracy and consistency when compared to state-of-the-art approaches.

AB Most environment perception methods in autonomous vehicles rely on deep neural networks because of their impressive performance. However, neural networks have black-box characteristics in nature, which may lead to perception uncertainty and untrustworthy autonomous vehicles. Thus, this work proposes a decision-making method to adapt the potential perception uncertainty due to the sensor noises, fuzzy features, and unfamiliar inputs. The whole method is named as Perception Neural Networks Uncertainty Aware Decision-Making (PNNUAD) method. PNNUAD first uses the Monte Carlo dropout method to estimate the perception neural network uncertainty into a distribution around the original output. Then, the perception uncertainty will be considered in a designed reinforcement learning-based planner using a distributed value function. Finally, a backup policy will maintain the vehicle's performance to avoid disastrous perception uncertainty. The evaluation section uses an augmented reality urban driving scenario; namely, the scenario builds in the CARLA simulator while the perception uncertainty comes from the real dataset. This case study focuses on the object class uncertainty of a widely used neural network, i.e., YOLO-V3. The results indicate that the proposed method can maintain AV safety even with poor perception performance. Meanwhile, the AV has not become too conservative by defending the perception uncertainty. This work is necessary for applying the statistics neural networks to safety-critical autonomous vehicles, and the source code will be open-source in this work.

ID SYSTEM
AB In this article, we study optimal control of automated vehicles (AVs) at an autonomous intersection with design specifications, where the intersection manager (computer) controls the acceleration/deceleration of AVs within a control region to determine their conflict-free trajectories. We develop a mathematical model to describe the cooperative dynamics of vehicles within the control zone of a signal-free intersection. Further, we formulate an optimization problem with the objective of maximizing traffic throughput while minimizing passenger discomfort. We then address the problem using mathematical programming to yield the optimal control input for each vehicle inside the control zone. We apply the proposed control mechanism for optimally coordinating the movement of AVs at an autonomous intersection subject to physical and safety constraints. In other words, the solution, if implemented, would allow vehicles to pass the intersection with safety guarantees (avoiding collisions), high-level efficiency (maximizing throughput), and good comfort (minimizing discomfort) without deploying traffic lights. In addition, we derive analytical specifications for the design and deployment of autonomous intersections, which appears to have been largely ignored in prior studies. Finally, we conduct a series of numerical experiments to show the effectiveness of the methodology proposed in this article. As the framework developed here is fairly general and can be extended to cover many complex traffic scenarios, we believe that the procedure presented in this article will be useful with the advent of AVs in the near future.

AB In the era of technological transformation, mobility and transportation systems are becoming more intelligent and greener. Thanks to powerful technologies and tools, electric and autonomous vehicles are spreading worldwide, substituting internal combustion engine vehicles and revolutionizing the way to drive. In this context, this paper is an extended version of the paper "Digital Twin in Intelligent Transportation Systems: a Review published in 2020 7th International Conference on Control, Decision and Information Technologies (CoDIT)". The aim of this paper is to provide a comprehensive review of the literature from the last five years on the use of digital twin (DT) technology for Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITSs), focusing on electric and autonomous vehicles. In particular, with respect to the previous work, the focus has been expanded to include DT integration with other cutting-edge technologies, such as the Internet of Things (IoT), Big Data, artificial intelligence (AI), machine learning (ML), and 5G for ITS. Moreover, this paper presents a broad perspective on challenges in EV applications, including tracking, monitoring, battery and charge management, connectivity, security, and privacy. In addition, this paper discusses how DT can be used to effectively address the current issues in electric vehicle services, such as tracking, monitoring, battery and charge management, connectivity, security, and privacy.

AB A new type of control law is developed to steer an autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) along a desired path. The methodology adopted for path-following deals explicitly with vehicle dynamics. Furthermore, it overcomes stringent initial condition constraints that are present in a number of path-following control strategies described in the literature. Controller design builds on Lyapunov theory and backstepping techniques. The resulting nonlinear feedback control law yields convergence of the path-following error trajectory to zero. Simulation results illustrate the performance of the control system proposed. (c) 2007 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

We propose a switched logic-based control strategy to solve the pursuing problem that can be described as comprising a continuous cycle of two distinct phases: (1) the determination of the bearing, and (2) the steering control of the vehicle to follow the direction computed in the previous step while the range is decreasing. We provide guaranteed conditions under which the switched closed-loop system achieves convergence of the relative distance error to a small neighborhood around zero.

However, legislators, urban administrators, policymakers, and planners are unprepared to deal with the possible disruption of autonomous vehicles, which potentially could replace conventional transport. There is a lack of knowledge on how the new capabilities will disrupt and which policy strategies are needed to address such disruption. This paper aims to determine where we are, where we are headed, what the likely impacts of a wider uptake could be, and what needs to be done to generate desired smart urban mobility outcomes. The methodology includes a systematic review of the existing evidence base to understand capability, impact, planning, and policy issues associated with autonomous vehicles. The review reveals the trajectories of technological development, disruptive effects caused by such development, strategies to address the disruptions, and possible gaps in the literature. The paper develops a framework outlining the inter-links among driving forces, uptake factors, impacts and possible interventions. It concludes by advocating the necessity of preparing our cities for autonomous vehicles, although a wider uptake may take quite some time.

ID MACHINE
AB Recent advances in manufacturing automation have motivated vision-based control of autonomous vehicles operated in unattended factories, material handling processes, warehouse operations, and hazardous environment explorations. Existing vision-based tracking control systems of autonomous vehicles, however, have been limited in real-time applications due to slow and/or expensive visual feedback and complicated dynamics and control with nonholonomic constraints. This paper presents a practical real-time vision-based tracking control system of an unmanned vehicle, ViTra. Unlike the conventional RS170 video-based machine vision systems, ViTra uses a DSP-based flexible integrated vision system (FIVS) which is characterized by low cost, computational efficiency, control flexibility, and a friendly user interface.
   In particular, this paper focuses on developing a framework for vision tracking systems, designing generic fiducial patterns, and applying real-time vision systems to tracking control of autonomous vehicles. A laboratory prototype vision-based tracking system developed at Georgia Institute of Technology permits the uniquely designed fiducial landmarks to be evaluated experimentally, the control strategy and the path planning algorithm derived in the paper to be validated in real-time, and the issues of simplifying nonlinear dynamics and dealing with nonholonomic constraints to be addressed in practice. Experimental results reveal interesting insights into the design, manufacture, modeling, and control of vision-based tracking control systems of autonomous vehicles.

AB Agricultural vehicles are adopted to undertake farming tasks by traversing along crop rows in the field. Working quality depends significantly on the driving skills of the operator. Automatic guidance has been introduced into agriculture to achieve high-accuracy path tracking during the last decades, which contributes considerably to straight-line navigation. The objective of this research was to develop an autonomous navigation controller that allowed movement autonomy for various agricultural vehicles. Three wheel-type vehicles were used as the test platform featuring automatic steering, hydrostatic transmission and speed control, which included a rice transplanter, a high-clearance sprayer and a tractor. A dual-antenna RTK-GNSS receiver was attached to the vehicles to provide spatial information on both positioning and heading by using the RTX service from Trimble. A path planning method was proposed to create a straight-line reference path by giving two points, and the target path was determined according to the vehicle initial status and working assignment. Headland turning was comprehensively taken into account by listing different turn patterns in order to realize autonomous navigation at the headland. The navigation controller hardware was fabricated for program execution, data processing and information communication with peripherals. A human-machine interface was designed for the operator to complete basic setting, path planning and navigation control by providing controls. Field experiments were conducted to evaluate the performance and versatility of the newly developed autonomous navigation controller in guiding agricultural vehicles to follow straight paths and turn at the headland. Results showed that an appropriate turn pattern was automatically executed when finishing straight-line navigation. The lateral error in straight-line tracking was no more than 6 cm, 6 cm and 5 cm for the rice transplanter, the high-clearance sprayer and the tractor, respectively. And the maximum lateral RMS error was 3.10 cm, 4.75 cm, 2.21 cm in terms of straight-line tracking, which indicated that the newly developed autonomous navigation controller was versatile and of high robustness in guiding various agricultural vehicles.

AB A practical design method is developed for cooperative tracking control of multiple autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs). Each AUV is modeled by a system with time-varying parameters, unknown nonlinear dynamics and unknown disturbance. A robust adaptive distributed controller is designed for each AUV such that all AUVs ultimately synchronize to the desired paths with required formation. Moreover, these controllers are distributed in the sense that the controller design for each AUV only requires relative state in formation between itself and its neighbors. Finally, a simulation example demonstrates the effectiveness of the control method. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB We investigate dynamical properties of traffic flow using the stochastic car-following model with modified optimal velocity on circular road. The safety distance following the two-second rule and autonomous vehicles obeying simple requirements are incorporated into the model. The dynamic safety distance increases in a light traffic condition where the average driving velocity is high, while decreases in a dense traffic condition in anticipation of slower traffic motion. The results show that the presence of the autonomous vehicles can enhance overall velocity and traffic current of the system, and postpone the traffic congestion. In a particular phase region, imposing a speed limit enables the system to leave the congested flow phase. The density-dependent speed limit in autonomous-free condition is obtained to achieve the optimal traffic flow. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB The performance and complicated interactions of different classes of travelers on regional urban networks are presented and analyzed. A new multi-class extension of a regional dynamic traffic model, the Network Transmission Model is proposed. The classes in question correspond to travelers using autonomous vehicles, conventional vehicles, equipped with Route Guidance and Information Systems, and unequipped vehicles. Each class is represented by a different routing method. Incremental Route Planning, an innovative predictive simulation-based routing method, Proxy Regret Matching, a non-predictive strategic learning-based method and Multinomial Logit-based Routing for 1st, 2nd and 3rd class respectively. All routing methods include a Public Transit Diversion mechanism and are assumed to provide prescriptive route guidance, with pre-trip information dissemination for every departing vehicle. We consider the possibility of non-compliance for conventional vehicles equipped with Route Guidance and Information Systems. We also consider 2 possible scenarios for autonomous vehicles that affect their travel time prediction accuracy. We simulate regional traffic dynamics for simultaneous application of all aforementioned routing methods, employing a market penetration scheme for each class of travelers. We analyze results regarding the overall network performance for various combinations of traveler class market penetration rates and non-compliance rates. We come to the conclusion that autonomous vehicles will not only provide benefits for 1st class travelers, but for all traveler classes on the network.

AB The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration reported that more than 90% of in-road accidents in 2015 occurred purely because of drivers? errors and misjudgments, with such factors as fatigue and other sorts of distractions being the main cause of these accidents [1]. One promising solution for reducing (or even resolving) such human errors is via autonomous or computer-assisted driving systems. Autonomous vehicles (AVs) are currently being designed with the aim of reducing fatalities in accidents by being insusceptible to typical driver errors. Moreover, in addition to improved safety, autonomous systems offer many other potential benefits to society: 1) improved fuel efficiency beyond that of human driving, making driving more cost beneficial and environmentally friendly, 2) reduced commute times due to improved driving behaviors and coordination among AVs, and 3) a better driving experience for individuals with disabilities, to name a few.

AB This study proposes a three-dimensional (3D) trajectory-tracking control scheme for an underactuated autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV). Given the 3D reference trajectory, the reference velocities, angles, angular velocities, force, and torques were planned first. These reference variables were used to obtain the error dynamics. The backstepping technique was used to design the trajectory-tracking controller for tracking the AUVs reference trajectory. According to the Lyapunov stability theory, the trajectory-tracking system was stable and bounded, and the tracking errors converged close to a small neighbourhood of zero. Finally, the effectiveness of the developed control method was demonstrated using simulations.

AB There is clear evidence that investment in intelligent transportation system technologies brings major social and economic benefits. Technological advances in the area of automatic systems in particular are becoming vital for the reduction of road deaths. We here describe our approach to automation of one the riskiest autonomous manoeuvres involving vehicles - overtaking. The approach is based on a stereo vision system responsible for detecting any preceding vehicle and triggering the autonomous overtaking manoeuvre. To this end, a fuzzy-logic based controller was developed to emulate how humans overtake. Its input is information from the vision system and from a positioning-based system consisting of a differential global positioning system (DGPS) and an inertial measurement unit (IMU). Its output is the generation of action on the vehicle's actuators, i.e., the steering wheel and throttle and brake pedals. The system has been incorporated into a commercial Citroen car and tested on the private driving circuit at the facilities of our research center, CAR, with different preceding vehicles - a motorbike, car, and truck - with encouraging results.

A trajectory tracking error-based model is used to design a linear model predictive controller and its control action is combined with feedforward and robust control actions. The experimental results show that the proposed control structure is capable to let a tractor-trailer system track both linear and curvilinear target trajectories with low tracking error.

AB This article exploits macroscopic information for the control of autonomous vehicles in platoon formation in case of external disturbances. The use of such information leads to smoother platooning. A mesoscopic controller is proposed, and disturbance string stability is proven through input-to-state stability concepts. Simulations prove the efficacy of the proposed approach by showing its robustness with respect to the presence of perturbations acting on the platoon vehicles.

ID BEHAVIOR
AB Autonomous vehicle technology increasingly allows drivers to turn their primary attention to secondary tasks (e.g., eating or working). This dramatic behavior change thus requires new input modalities to support driver-vehicle interaction, which must match the driver's in-vehicle activities and the interaction situation. Prior studies that addressed this question did not consider how acceptance for inputs was affected by the physical and cognitive levels experienced by drivers engaged in Non-driving Related Tasks (NDRTs) or how their acceptance varies according to the interaction situation. This study investigates naturalistic interactions with a fully autonomous vehicle system in different intervention scenarios while drivers perform NDRTs. We presented an online methodology to 360 participants showing four NDRTs with different physical and cognitive engagement levels, and tested the six most common intervention scenarios (24 cases). Participants evaluated our proposed seven natural input interactions for each case: touch, voice, hand gesture, and their combinations. Results show that NDRTs influence the driver's input interaction more than intervention scenario categories. In contrast, variation of physical load has more influence on input selection than variation of cognitive load. We also present a decision-making model of driver preferences to determine the most natural inputs and help User Experience designers better meet drivers' needs.

AB A new methodology is introduced for integrated design of guidance and control systems for autonomous vehicles (AVs). The methodology proposed borrows from the theory of gain-scheduled control and leads to an efficient procedure for the design of controllers for AVs to accurately track reference trajectories defined in an inertial reference frame. The paper illustrates the application of this procedure to the design of a tracking controller for the unmanned air vehicle Bluebird. The design phase is summarized, and the performance of the resulting controller is assessed in simulation using dynamic models of the vehicle and its sensor suite.

AB In autonomous driving, using a variety of sensors to recognize preceding vehicles at middle and long distances is helpful for improving driving performance and developing various functions. However, if only LiDAR or cameras are used in the recognition stage, it is difficult to obtain the necessary data due to the limitations of each sensor. In this paper, we proposed a method of converting the vision-tracked data into bird's eye-view (BEV) coordinates using an equation that projects LiDAR points onto an image and a method of fusion between LiDAR and vision-tracked data. Thus, the proposed method was effective through the results of detecting the closest in-path vehicle (CIPV) in various situations. In addition, even when experimenting with the EuroNCAP autonomous emergency braking (AEB) test protocol using the result of fusion, AEB performance was improved through improved cognitive performance than when using only LiDAR. In the experimental results, the performance of the proposed method was proven through actual vehicle tests in various scenarios. Consequently, it was convincing that the proposed sensor fusion method significantly improved the adaptive cruise control (ACC) function in autonomous maneuvering. We expect that this improvement in perception performance will contribute to improving the overall stability of ACC.

AB Precise and robust localization in a large-scale outdoor environment is essential for an autonomous vehicle. In order to improve the performance of the fusion of GNSS (Global Navigation Satellite System)/IMU (Inertial Measurement Unit)/DMI (Distance-Measuring Instruments), a multi-constraint fault detection approach is proposed to smooth the vehicle locations in spite of GNSS jumps. Furthermore, the lateral localization error is compensated by the point cloud-based lateral localization method proposed in this paper. Experiment results have verified the algorithms proposed in this paper, which shows that the algorithms proposed in this paper are capable of providing precise and robust vehicle localization.

AB The road topography can significantly affect the tyre vertical load and the vehicle dynamics response in off-road scenarios, which will greatly impact the autonomous vehicle's stability, trajectory planning and trajectory tracking performance. However, the road topography information is less focused in current literature. This study focuses on the local trajectory planning and tracking method by assuming waypoints along the global route are already available. First an innovative spatiotemporal-based local trajectory planning algorithm is proposed to select the desired trajectory with minimum road gradient and bank angle. After that, a 8 degrees-of-freedom (DOF) vehicle dynamics model is proposed to better present the dynamics performance. Finally a double-layer control strategy for trajectory tracking is designed to follow the desired planned trajectory. It is proved by simulations results that the peak bank angle and road gradient could be avoided, and the trajectory tracking performance is improved by the proposed method. Furthermore, the omni-directional vehicle is shown to have better vehicle stability performance than the vehicle with front-wheel steering (FWS) characteristic.

AB This paper provides an experimental implementation and verification of a hybrid (mixed discrete state/continuous state) controller for semi-autonomous and autonomous underwater vehicles in which the missions imply multiple task robot behavior. An overview of some of the missions being considered for this rapidly developing technology is mentioned including environmental monitoring, underwater inspection, geological survey as well as military missions in mine countermeasures.
   The functionalities required of such vehicles and their relation to 'intelligent control' technology is discussed. In particular, the use of Prolog as a computer language for the specification of the discrete event system (DES) aspects of the mission control is proposed. The connections between a Prolog specification and the more common Petri Net graphical representation of a DES are made. Links are made between activation commands, transitioning signals, and the continuous state dynamic control system (DCS) responsible for vehicle stabilization.
   Details are given of the NPS Phoenix vehicle implementation at the present time, together with experimental validation of the concepts outlined using a simplified example mission. The paper ends with a listing of questions and concerns for the evaluation of software controllers. A list of references is given for readers interested in this subject.

AB According to the inherent nature of the fluid that can naturally avoid obstacles, a path planning method for active collision avoidance of autonomous vehicles is presented based on the virtual flow field. Firstly, the mathematical model of the virtual flow field on the road is established by using the theory of hydrodynamics. Then a fifth degree polynomial curve is adopted to construct the virtual hazard area of the obstacle vehicle to prevent the fluid into this area, and it can be easily resized by adjusting the parameters of the lateral and longitudinal safety distance. Finally, Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) simulations are performed to quantitative predict the dynamic behavior of the ego vehicle on the straight or curved road and the desired path for active collision avoidance can be determined based on the calculation result of the flow field. The simulation results show that the proposed path planning method takes into account the dynamic characteristics and kinematic constraints of the vehicle, and ensures that the vehicle doesn't collide with the dynamic and static obstacles on the road.

AB Autonomous driving systems require many images for analyzing the surrounding environment. However, there is fewer data protection for private information among these captured images, such as pedestrian faces or vehicle license plates, which has become a significant issue. In this paper, in response to the call for data security laws and regulations and based on the advantages of large Field of View (FoV) of the fisheye camera, we build the first Autopilot Desensitization Dataset, called ADD, and formulate the first deep-learning-based image desensitization framework, to promote the study of image desensitization in autonomous driving scenarios. The compiled dataset consists of 650K images, including different face and vehicle license plate information captured by the surround-view fisheye camera. It covers various autonomous driving scenarios, including diverse facial characteristics and license plate colors. Then, we propose an efficient multitask desensitization network called DesCenterNet as a benchmark on the ADD dataset, which can perform face and vehicle license plate detection and desensitization tasks. Based on ADD, we further provide an evaluation criterion for desensitization performance, and extensive comparison experiments have verified the effectiveness and superiority of our method on image desensitization.

AB Enabled by the industrial Internet, intelligent transportation has made remarkable achievements such as autonomous vehicles by carnegie mellon university (CMU) Navlab, Google Cars, Tesla, etc. Autonomous vehicles benefit, in various aspects, from the cooperation of the industrial Internet and cyber-physical systems. In this process, users in autonomous vehicles submit query contents, such as service interests or user locations, to service providers. However, privacy concerns arise since the query contents are exposed when the users are enjoying the services queried. Existing works on privacy preservation of query contents rely on location perturbation or k-anonymity, and they suffer from insufficient protection of privacy or low query utility incurred by processing multiple queries for a single query content. To achieve sufficient privacy preservation and satisfactory query utility for autonomous vehicles querying services in cyber-physical systems, this article proposes a novel privacy notion of client-based personalized k-anonymity (CPkA). To measure the performance of CPkA, we present a privacy metric and a utility metric, based on which, we formulate two problems to achieve the optimal CPkA in term of privacy and utility. An approach, including two modules, to establish mechanisms which achieve the optimal CPkA is presented. The first module is to build in-group mechanisms for achieving the optimal privacy within each content group. The second module includes linear programming-based methods to compute the optimal grouping strategies. The in-group mechanisms and the grouping strategies are combined to establish optimal CPkA mechanisms, which achieve the optimal privacy or the optimal utility. We employ real-life datasets and synthetic prior distributions to evaluate the CPkA mechanisms established by our approach. The evaluation results illustrate the effectiveness and efficiency of the established mechanisms.

AB Due to high operation cost of dedicated inspection vehicles, conventional pavement management systems (PMS) suffer from limited data quantity collected from periodic inspections. However, increasing market penetration of connected autonomous vehicles (CAVs) offers opportunities to monitor pavement conditions more frequently through sensors, including vision cameras and accelerometers, originally installed for autonomous driving. In this paper, we proposed an autonomous condition monitoring-based pavement management system (ACM-PMS) with real-time data collection using CAVs traveling voluntarily. We presented a novel mathematical framework to evaluate potential benefits of ACM-PMS in reducing social costs for both users and agency, systematically accounting for its unique three advantages: (i) large amount of condition data increases prediction model ac-curacy; (ii) aggregated measurement of current facility condition improves inspection accuracy; (iii) agency can perform maintenance activities at optimal timings, achieving continuous-time and condition-based policies. Results of numerical examples confirm that ACM-PMS significantly reduces the social cost of conventional PMS.

AB Local path planning is important in the development of autonomous vehicles since it allows a vehicle to adapt their movements to dynamic environments, for instance, when obstacles are detected. This work presents an evaluation of the performance of different local path planning techniques for an Autonomous Surface Vehicle, using a custom-made simulator based on the open-source Robotarium framework. The conducted simulations allow to verify, compare and visualize the solutions of the different techniques. The selected techniques for evaluation include A*, Potential Fields (PF), Rapidly-Exploring Random Trees* (RRT*) and variations of the Fast Marching Method (FMM), along with a proposed new method called Updating the Fast Marching Square method (uFMS). The evaluation proposed in this work includes ways to summarize time and safety measures for local path planning techniques. The results in a Lake environment present the advantages and disadvantages of using each technique. The proposed uFMS and A* have been shown to achieve interesting performance in terms of processing time, distance travelled and security levels. Furthermore, the proposed uFMS algorithm is capable of generating smoother routes.

TI Heading Autopilot of Autonomous Underwater Vehicles With Internal Moving

SO JOURNAL OF COMPUTATIONAL AND NONLINEAR DYNAMICS
LA English
DT Article
AB Inspired by the designs of underwater gliders, hybrid autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) have emerged recently, which use internal actuators instead of control surfaces to control the heading angle and depth of the vehicles. In this paper, we focus on controlling the heading angle of a REMUS AUV by using an internal moving mass. We derive a nonlinear dynamical model of the vehicle with hydrodynamic forces and coupling between the vehicle and the internal moving mass. The model is used to study the stability of the horizontal-plane motion of the vehicle and to design a linear feedback law to stabilize its heading angle around a desired direction. Simulation results demonstrate that a controlled internal moving mass is able to fulfill the purpose of heading control.

AB This work presents a distributed hierarchical control strategy for fleets of autonomous vehicles cruising on a highway with diverse desired speeds. The goal is to design a control scheme that can be employed in scenarios where only vehicle-to-vehicle communication is available and where vehicles need to negotiate and agree on their positions on the road. To this end, after reaching an agreement on the lane speed with other traffic participants, each vehicle decides whether to keep cruising along the current lane or to move into another one. In the latter case, it negotiates the entry point with others by taking part in a distributed auction. An onboard controller computes an optimal trajectory transferring the vehicle with agreed velocity to the desired lane while avoiding collisions.

This format allows gradual market penetration of AVDS, which makes the technology attractive from a systems implementation standpoint. To evaluate the performance of the mixed traffic, we simulate manual and automated vehicles together and show that our AVDS can lead to potentially large gains in capacity and smoother flow without the loss of safety.

AB In the environment perception stage of autonomous driving, vehicles need to track its surrounding objects quickly and accurately to avoid dangerous behaviors. Therefore, visual object tracking has important practical application value in autonomous driving system. However, the performance of most hierarchical convolutional feature trackers are limited by ignoring the complex environment of autonomous driving. In this paper, a novel Siamese Attention Network to explore the rich spatial and channel information of objects was proposed. Because of the lack of important information between the channel and the spatial position, the tracking performance is reduced by the challenges of illumination change and deformation. The spatial attention block and channel attention block focus on the importance of different spatial positions and channels, respectively. The effective fusion of the two makes our tracker achieve the state-of-the art performance of 0.300 in the EAO criterion of 2017, which exceeds the baseline by 5.7%.

AB The paper is based on an experimental study at VSB TUO Ostrava with a DEMOCAR vehicle that simulates a real car with sensor fusion concept and a vehicle gateway to send and coordinate commands to ECUs to realize and manage autonomous driving. In this experimental study of autonomous driving vehicles control, a HARA (Hazard and Risk Analysis, ISO 26262:2018) has been done on vehicle level and strategies have been defined and implemented to manage safety situations where the car lateral control shall be hand over to a driver when in HAD 2 mode. The issue is that the switching to safe state shall not be done immediately but the vehicle has to stay in safe driving mode - fail-operational up to 4 seconds until a driver can take over. The UECE and other relevant studies show that it can take up to 6 seconds if driver/operator is not in the flow (HAD 3) and up to the 2 seconds when driver is in the flow (HAD 1). The paper makes assumptions and proposals about vehicle lateral control strategy to ensure the smooth take-over of the car by driver and its impact on control software development architectures.

AB Great advances had been achieved in the discipline of environmental perception, motion planning and control strategy implementation, however, fully autonomous vehicle is still far from large-scale commercial application. The concept of "human-automation shared control" provides a promising solution to enhance autonomous driving safety, to which great research effort has been contributed in recent years. Nevertheless, more attention should be given to the following aspects. The present shared control strategy either only considers the discontinuous switching control between driver and ADS or investigates the simple effect of driver's behavior in specific scenarios. The adaptive authority allocation between the driver's active assistance and ADS hasn't been investigated yet. In this paper, a shared control experiment with driver's active assistance is conducted in scheduled traffic scenarios to observe the state of vehicle and arm' EMG signal. After that, we construct a feature classification algorithm for shared control authority by clustering the experimental data. Then, a SCS with incremental PID controller and 2 DOF vehicle dynamic model is proposed. For validation of the SCS, the comparison of vehicle performance for different control authority illustrates that SCS can allocate appropriate control authority to improve the safety.

AB The rapid advance of autonomous vehicles (AVs) has motivated new perspectives and potential challenges for existing modes of transportation. Currently, driving assistance systems of Level 3 and below have been widely produced, and several applications of Level 4 systems to specific situations have also been gradually developed. By improving the automation level and vehicle intelligence, these systems can be further advanced towards fully autonomous driving. However, general development concepts for Level 5 AVs remain unclear, and the existing methods employed in the development processes of Levels 0-4 have been mainly based on task-driven function development related to specific scenarios. Therefore, it is difficult to identify the problems encountered by high-level AVs. The essential logical and physical mechanisms of vehicles have hindered further progression towards Level 5 systems. By exploring the physical mechanisms behind high-level autonomous driving systems and analyzing the essence of driving, we put forward a coordinated and balanced framework based on the brain-cerebellum-organ concept through reasoning and deduction. Based on a mixed mode relying on the crow inference and parrot imitation approach, we explore the research paradigm of autonomous learning and prior knowledge to realize the characteristics of self-learning, self-adaptation, and self-transcendence for AVs. From a systematic, unified, and balanced point of view and based on least action principles and unified safety field concepts, we aim to provide a novel research concept and develop an effective approach for the research and development of high-level AVs, specifically at Level 5.

AB This article addresses the problem of air-to-air autonomous landing of a small underactuated unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) on a larger one (carrier) in a noncooperative manner using vision-based state estimation. A Kalman filter-based state estimator reconstructs the state of the carrier relying on a camera mounted on the small UAV (follower). Then, a three-layer hierarchical architecture is proposed. A hybrid automaton based on a quasitime-optimal approach is used at the position layer to ensure a safe and fast landing. An adaptive observer is developed at the velocity layer to track robustly the reference velocity coming from the position layer and to compensate for the lack of information about the carrier acceleration. An attitude planner and a geometric stabilizer are used at the innermost layer. The proposed control architecture outperforms the one developed in a previous work by reducing the time to land up to 59% and increasing the accuracy up to 47%. Experimental tests have been performed to assess the performance of the proposed algorithm in representative scenarios.

AB In order to solve the tracking error caused by transmission backlash in the dual-motor autonomous steering system, and thus improve the trajectory tracking accuracy of autonomous vehicles, a novel steering control strategy combining sliding model control (SMC) with variable weights and linear quadratic regulator (LQR) is proposed in this paper. Firstly, the vehicle dynamics model is built and the steering system model with contact and backlash modes is established by combining it with the simplified gear backlash system. Secondly, the front wheel angle control based on SMC is designed and the weights of contact mode and backlash mode are optimized by Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) algorithm. Finally, the results of simulation under typical conditions show that the proposed strategy has better accuracy of angle tracking and stronger adaptability to the change of system load. Furthermore, it is also proved by simulation and Hardware-in-Loop (HiL) test under different trajectory tracking conditions that the LQR controller with proposed strategy has better accuracy of trajectory tracking for autonomous vehicles.

AB Finding the optimal location and rotation for every sensor in a multi-sensor setup is not trivial because there are many possible configurations to compare and the space of all feasible positions for the sensors is non-convex. The configuration includes the position and rotation (yaw, pitch, and roll) of the sensors on a car, it influences the ability of an autonomous driving vehicle to perceive its 3D environment. There are some algorithms that optimize the sensor configuration, but all of them lack important properties: They do not consider the accurate shape of the car, the physical size of sensors already placed, or the influence on error assistance to guarantee a safe perception in defined areas. This article introduces a new method that closes this gap. We expand an existing objective function and describe a new genetic algorithm for the optimization which can be applied to any geometric shape of a vehicle. Our method is demonstrated on a simple box model as well as on an accurate car model. These experiments show how the proposed methods can be used to analyze and improve the sensor configuration for any type of autonomous vehicle.

AB Current mobility services cannot compete on equal terms with self-owned mobility products concerning service quality. Because of supply and demand imbalances, ridesharing users invariably experience delays, price surges, and rejections. Traditional approaches often fail to respond to demand fluctuations adequately because service levels are, to some extent, bounded by fleet size. With the emergence of autonomous vehicles, however, the characteristics of mobility services change and new opportunities to overcome the prevailing limitations arise. In this paper, we consider an autonomous ridesharing problem in which idle vehicles are hired on-demand in order to meet the service-level requirements of a heterogeneous user base. In the face of uncertain demand and idle vehicle supply, we propose a learning-based optimization approach that uses the dual variables of the underlying assignment problem to iteratively approximate the marginal value of vehicles at each time and location under different availability settings. These approximations are used in the objective function of the optimization problem to dispatch, rebalance, and occasionally hire idle third-party vehicles in a high-resolution transportation network of Manhattan, New York City. The results show that the proposed policy outperforms a reactive optimization approach in a variety of vehicle availability scenarios while hiring fewer vehicles. Moreover, we demonstrate that mobility services can offer strict service-level contracts to different user groups featuring both delay and rejection penalties.

AB PurposeThis study aims to propose a novel method for the conflict detection and eradication of autonomous vehicles which has predetermined routes to establish multi pickup and delivery tasks according to task priorities and vehicle capacity status on each pickup and delivery nodes in assembly cells in the automotive production. Design/methodology/approachIn the designed system, the routing of autonomous vehicles (AVs) and scheduling of pickup and delivery tasks are established in production logistics. Gantt chart is created according to vehicle routes, and conflicts are detected using the proposed conflict-sweep algorithm. The proposed conflict-solving algorithm eliminates conflicts on intersections and roads by considering vehicle routes and task priorities. FindingsIn many production systems, there is a need to obtain flexible routes in each pickup delivery task group that changes during day, week, etc. Proposed system provides remarkable advantages in obtaining conflict-free routes for pre-scheduled multi transport tasks of vehicles by considering efficiency in production systems. Originality/valueA novel method is proposed for the conflict detection and eradication of AVs. Proposed system eliminates conflicts on intersections and roads by considering pre-planned vehicle routes for a fleet of heterogeneous AVs. Unlike most of the other conflict-free algorithms, in which conflicts are solved between two points, proposed system also considers multi pickup and delivery points for AVs. This is pioneering paper that addresses conflict-free route planning with backhauls and scheduling of multi pickup and delivery tasks for AVs.

AB An advanced LKS (lane keeping system) for use on curving roads is presented to maintain autonomous vehicle driving within the target lane, without unintentional lane departure. There are the following two main objectives in designing this system: one is performing perfect lane keeping and the other is ensuring the dynamic stability of the vehicle, especially when driving on a curving and low-friction road with time-varying high speed. In this paper, a combined vehicle model, consisting of a lane keeping model and a vehicle lateral dynamic model, is firstly introduced. Then, a novel adaptive-weight predictive controller is used to calculate the desired steering angle and the additional yaw moment which provide coordinated control forlane keeping and dynamic stability control. Meanwhile, a square-root cubature Kalman filter-based vehicle sideslip angle observer, with a strong tracking theory modification (ST-SRCKF), is established to estimate the sideslip angle during the driving process. Finally, HIL (hardware-in-the-loop) tests and field tests are constructed, and the results show the effectiveness of our proposed LKS controller and ST-SRCKF sideslip angle estimation.

AB Vehicles are currently being developed and sold with increasing levels of connectivity and automation. As with all networked computing devices, increased connectivity often results in a heightened risk of a cyber security attack. Furthermore, increased automation exacerbates any risk by increasing the opportunities for the adversary to implement a successful attack. In this paper, a large volume of publicly accessible literature is reviewed and compartmentalized based on the vulnerabilities identified and mitigation techniques developed. This review highlighted that the majority of studies are reactive and vulnerabilities are often discovered by friendly adversaries (white-hat hackers).

ID DYNAMIC SURFACE CONTROL
AB In this paper, we propose a novel path tracking control algorithm for an underactuated autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV). The underactuated AUV is controlled by the thrust force and the yaw torque: no sway thruster is used. To deal with this underactuated AUV problem in the path tracking, we introduce an approach angle. which makes the AUV converge to the reference path. To design the path tracking controller, we obtain the vehicle's error dynamics in the body-fixed frame, and then design the path tracking controller based on the dynamic surface control (DSC) method. The proposed controller only needs the information of the position and the heading angle of the reference path. Some simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed controller.

ID SOCIAL FORCE MODEL; PEDESTRIAN BEHAVIOR
AB Complex, dynamic, and interactive environment brings huge challenges to autonomous driving technologies. Because of the strong interactions between different traffic participants, autonomous vehicles (AVs) must learn how to interact with other road users. Failure to consider interaction when making decisions may result in safety issues. In this article, an interaction-aware decision-making approach is proposed for AVs. First, focusing on the interaction at uncontrolled midblock crosswalks, the game theory is used to model the vehicle-pedestrian interaction (VPI). Then, an interaction inference framework is developed using the interaction model to obtain interaction information with pedestrians. Besides, a collaborative action planning method is proposed to generate collaborative actions. More importantly, interactive decision-making is formulated as an optimization problem by considering the task item and action item. Furthermore, considering pedestrians' different levels of cooperation, the social force pedestrian model is developed. Then, a highly interactive environment is constructed. Finally, qualitative and quantitative evaluations are carried out against three baseline methods. The result shows that our method can interact with different pedestrians and balance safety and efficiency compared to baseline methods.

AB This paper presents an econometric modelling framework to unravel the communication and mobility issues of visually impaired pedestrians in the context of connected autonomous vehicles (CAVs). The research uses a dataset collected through a tailor-made stated-preference survey given to visually impaired pedestrians and provides evidence-based recommendations on communication techniques. The recommendations are based on the findings of a structural equation model (SEM) estimated using the survey data. The latent factors 'safety and security' and 'importance of hearing' are generated using a confirmatory factor analysis embedded in the SEM. The results from the model show that these two factors have negative influences on how much a visually impaired pedestrian trusts the use of CAVs.

ID NONHOLONOMIC CONSTRAINT; ALIGNMENT
AB The autonomous navigation technology of INS has always attracted the attention of many scholars. In satellite-denied environment, making full use of the auxiliary sensors with autonomous characteristics can suppress the dynamic error generated by INS in autonomous navigation effectively. However, auxiliary sensors like an odometer (OD) and laser doppler velocimeter (LDV) will cause instability to the navigation system. To solve the above problems, we propose an improved autonomous inerital-based integrated navigation scheme utilizing vehicle motion recognition. The main research work can be summarized as: (1) Non-holonomic constrained velocity model and tri-axis zero velocity model has been established for inertial-based integrated navigation model. (2) Vehicle motion state recognition method has been proposed utilizing the IMU data. As shown in the experimental results, the proposed method can estimate the IMU biases and increase the positioning accuracy effectively as compared with the traditional methods.

AB The reliability of autonomous vehicles is heavily dependent on their software frameworks, which are required to interface and process data from many different sensors on board the vehicle, perform navigational processes such as path planning and lane keeping, take action to ensure safety and display data to an operator in a useful fashion. These sensors can include a combination of cameras, LiDARs, GPS, IMU, and odometric sensors to achieve positioning and localisation for the vehicle and nearby objects in their environment and can be challenging to integrate. In this paper, we present a hybridised software framework that combines sensor and navigational processing for autonomous driving. Our framework utilises a modular approach for interfacing and safety functionality, whilst navigation and sensor interfaces are implemented as nodes in the robot operating system. Our testing results verify the suitability of our framework by integration with a hardware-in-the-loop simulation system and for fully autonomous field driving.

The modeling and validation of the research autonomous vehicle used in the experimental implementation is presented first, followed by the details of the Hardware-In-the-Loop connected and autonomous vehicle simulator used. The socially acceptable collision avoidance algorithm is formulated using the elastic band method as an online, local path modification algorithm. Parameter space based robust feedback plus feedforward steering controller design is used. Model-in-the-loop, Hardware-In-the-Loop and road testing in a proving ground are used to demonstrate the effectiveness of the real time implementation of the elastic band based socially acceptable collision avoidance method of this paper.

AB The full deployment of autonomous driving systems on a worldwide scale requires that the self-driving vehicle be operated in a provably safe manner, i.e., the vehicle must be able to avoid collisions in any possible traffic situation. In this paper, we propose a framework based on Model Predictive Control (MPC) that endows the self-driving vehicle with the necessary safety guarantees. In particular, our framework ensures constraint satisfaction at all times, while tracking the reference trajectory as close as obstacles allow, resulting in a safe and comfortable driving behavior. To discuss the performance and real-time capability of our framework, we provide first an illustrative simulation example, and then we demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework in experiments with a real test vehicle.

AB The autonomous vehicle (AV) is expected to dramatically increase road safety. Understanding the public's initial perceptions and acceptance of AV is imperative because these aspects are likely to determine the future evolution of AVs. This study focuses on public perceptions and acceptance of the two highest levels of vehicle automation - highly autonomous vehicle (HAV) and fully autonomous vehicle (FAV). We drew from the conversation on trust and developed a psychological model to explain three acceptance measures, namely, general acceptance, behavioral intention to use, and willingness to pay (WTP). Using a between-subject survey (N = 742), we determined that the respondents held a stronger belief of benefits from FAV than from HAV. Trust in AV retained a direct effect as well as an indirect effect (mainly through perceived benefit) on the three acceptance measures. In comparison with perceived risk, perceived benefit exerted a higher direct effect on AV acceptance and a higher mediating effect on the trust-acceptance relationship. A prediction analysis further demonstrated that the model exhibited acceptable predictive capability for public acceptance. We drew certain implications for increasing AV acceptance.

   constraints; semiautonomous vehicles.
ID OBSTACLE AVOIDANCE; DESIGN
AB In this paper, a predictive trajectory guidance and control framework is proposed that enables the safe operation of autonomous and semiautonomous vehicles considering the constraints of operating in dynamic public traffic. The core module of the framework is a nonlinear model predictive guidance module that uses a computationally expedient curvilinear frame for the description of the road and of the motion of the vehicle and other objects. The module enforces constraints generated from information about obstacles/other vehicles/objects, public traffic rules for speed limits and lane boundaries, and the limits of the vehicle's dynamics. The module can be configured in two basic modes. The first is a tracking mode, where the control inputs computed by the model predictive guidance module act as references for traditional lower level control systems. The second is a planning mode, where the traffic-optimal state trajectories computed by the model predictive control are reinterpreted for planning the optimal path and speed, which in turn can be tracked by an elaborate speed and path tracking controller. The performance of most aspects of the proposed scheme is illustrated by considering various simulations of the control framework applied to a high-fidelity vehicle dynamics model of the (semi-) autonomous vehicle in typical public driving events, such as intersections, passing, emergency braking, and collision avoidance. The feasibility of the proposed control framework for real-time application is highlighted with the discussions of the computational execution times observed for these various scenarios.

AB The performance of the model-based controller is always affected by the uncertainty and nonlinearity of the model parameters in the vehicle path tracking process. To address this issue, a novel path tracking controller based on model-free adaptive dynamic programming (ADP) is proposed for autonomous vehicles in this paper. To be specific, the proposed controller obtains information from the online state and front-wheel angle input data which are repeatedly used to calculate the controller gain iteratively. So, this controller features not requiring accurate knowledge of vehicle model parameters for controller development. Meanwhile, the path tracking performance of the autonomous vehicle will be inevitably disturbed by unknown nonlinear external disturbance. To approximate this disturbance, the learning characteristics of Radial Basis Function Neural Network (RBFNN) are applied to generate compensation for the front-wheel angle. Afterward, the weight updating law of RBFNN is derived by Lyapunov function to ensure the stability and convergence of the whole system. Finally, Hardware in the loop (HIL) test results demonstrate that the proposed ADP-RBF controller can improve the comprehensive performance of the vehicle path tracking control system and achieve the balance between path tracking accuracy and minimum sideslip angle.

AB Present study presents a novel region boundary-based tracking control for an Autonomous Underwater Vehicle (AUV). The control objective is to track a moving target formed by the union of all boundaries. In this case, multiplicative potential energy function is used to unite all the boundaries and various shapes can be created using this function. It is interesting to note that the AUV will be placed at a specific position on the dynamic region boundaries. A Lyapunov-like function is presented for stability analysis of the AUV. Simulation studies will be performed to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed controller.

AB Most existing studies on autonomous intersection management (AIM) often focus on algorithms to accommodate conflicts among vehicles by assuming that the entrance lane and the exit lane of vehicles are exogenous inputs. This paper shows that allowing entrance lanes and exit lanes to be optimized can significantly improve traffic efficiency. In particular, this paper proposes all-direction lanes, where left-turn, through, and right-turn traffic is all allowed at the same lane. We develop two methods for optimizing entering time (i.e., when to enter the intersection) and route choice decisions (i.e., entrance lane and exit lane), including the sliding-time-window-based global optimum (GO-STW) and the first-come-first-served method with optimal route choices (FCFS-R). The developed lane-based methods can be formulated as mixed integer linear programming (MILP) problems, which can be solved using the CPLEX solver. A heuristic is further adopted to solve the MILP model in a timely manner, which illustrates the potential real-time applicability of the proposed method. Numerical analysis is conducted to examine performance and effectiveness of the proposed methods and heuristic. We found that the optimization of lane/route choices is often more critical than entering time.

DE Autonomous cars; Heterogeneity; Bottleneck model; Self-driving cars;
   Road capacity
ID ADAPTIVE CRUISE CONTROL; TRAFFIC-FLOW; MODEL; TRANSPORT; VEHICLES
AB 'Autonomous cars' are cars that can drive themselves without human control. Autonomous cars can safely drive closer together than cars driven by humans, thereby possibly increasing road capacity. By allowing drivers to perform other activities in the vehicle, they may reduce the value of travel time losses (VOT). We investigate the effects of autonomous cars using a dynamic equilibrium model of congestion that captures three main elements: the resulting increase in capacity, the decrease in the VOT for those who acquire one and the implications of the resulting changes in the heterogeneity of VOTs. We do so for three market organizations: private monopoly, perfect competition and public supply. Even though an increased share of autonomous cars raises average capacity, it may hurt existing autonomous car users as those who switch to an autonomous car will impose increased congestion externalities due to their altered departure time behaviour. Depending on which effect dominates, switching to an autonomous vehicle may impose a net negative or positive externality. Often public supply leads to 100% autonomous cars, but it may be optimal to have a mix of car types, especially when there is a net negative externality. With a positive (negative) externality, perfect competition leads to an undersupply (oversupply) of autonomous cars, and a public supplier needs to subsidise (tax) autonomous cars to maximise welfare. A monopolist supplier ignores the capacity effect and adds a mark-up to its price. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The Braitenberg vehicle as a simple conceptual model to characterize the response behaviors of animals or insects under a stimulus is widely used to develop autonomous vehicles able to adapt to the varying environments. Considerable effort has been devoted to building neuromorphic processors with the software in the vehicles; however, there has been no demonstration of Braitenberg vehicle with neuromorphic hardware so far. Herein, a Braitenberg vehicle with simple memristive neuromorphic circuits is built for the first time. This vehicle exhibits adaptive behaviors in the supervised learning process and is eventually trained to conduct the task of tracking path. Moreover, the memristive circuit in the vehicle demonstrates a very short response latency (approximate to 56ns) to input sensory information. Herein, an alternative promising solution to build self-adaptive robots and pave the way for the realization of autonomous robots based on memristive neuromorphic circuits is offered.

AB Autonomous vehicular platoons will play an important role in improving on-road safety in tomorrow's smart cities. Vehicles in an autonomous platoon can exploit vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) communications to collect environmental information so as to maintain the target velocity and inter-vehicle distance. However, due to the uncertainty of the wireless channel, V2V communications within a platoon will experience a wireless system delay. Such system delay can impair the vehicles' ability to stabilize their velocity and distances within their platoon. In this paper, the problem of integrated communication and control system is studied for wireless connected autonomous vehicular platoons. In particular, a novel framework is proposed for optimizing a platoon's operation while jointly taking into account the delay of the wireless V2V network and the stability of the vehicle's control system. First, stability analysis for the control system is performed and the maximum wireless system delay requirements which can prevent the instability of the control system are derived. Then, delay analysis is conducted to determine the end-to-end delay, including queuing, processing, and transmission delay for the V2V link in the wireless network. Subsequently, using the derived wireless delay, a lower bound and an approximated expression of the reliability for the wireless system, defined as the probability that the wireless system meets the control system's delay needs, are derived. Then, the parameters of the control system are optimized in a way to maximize the derived wireless system reliability. Simulation results corroborate the analytical derivations and study the impact of parameters, such as the packet size and the platoon size, on the reliability performance of the vehicular platoon. More importantly, the simulation results shed light on the benefits of integrating control system and wireless network design while providing guidelines for designing an autonomous platoon so as to realize the required wireless network reliability and control system stability.

AB This letter proposes an edge learning-based offloading framework for autonomous driving, where the deep learning tasks can be offloaded to the edge server to improve the inference accuracy while meeting the latency constraint. Since the delay and the inference accuracy are incurred by wireless communications and computing, an optimization problem is formulated to maximize the inference accuracy subject to the offloading probability, the pre-braking probability, and data quality. Simulations demonstrate the superiority of the proposed offloading framework.

AB Autonomous vehicles (AVs) may benefit the health and safety of drivers across the driving lifespan, but perceptions of drivers are not known. Lived experiences of drivers exposed to AVs in combination with surveys, can more accurately reveal their perceptions. We quantified facilitators and barriers from data collected in older (N = 104) and younger drivers (N = 106). Perceptions were assessed via Autonomous Vehicle User Perception Survey (AVUPS) subscales (i.e., intention to use, barriers, well-being, and acceptance) pertaining to group exposure (simulator first [SF] or autonomous shuttle first [ASF]). We quantified the effects of group, time, and group x time interaction. Multiple linear regressions identified predictors (e.g., optimism, ease of use, life space, driving exposure, and driving difficulty, age, gender, race) of the AVUPS subscales. The regression analyses indicated that optimism and ease of use positively predicted intention to use, barriers, well-being, and the total acceptance score. Driving difficulty significantly predicted barriers, whereas miles driven negatively predicted well-being. The regression results indicated that predictors of user acceptance of AV technology included age, race, optimism, ease of use, with 33.6% of the variance in acceptance explained. The findings reveal foundational information about driver acceptance, intention to use, barriers, and well-being related to AVs. New knowledge pertains to how demographics, optimism, ease of use, life space, driving exposure, and driving difficulty inform AV acceptance. We provided strategies to inform city planners and other stakeholders on improving upon deployment practices of AVs.

AB An autonomous navigation method for low-thrust interplanetary vehicle is proposed. In the proposed navigation system, one inertial navigation system (INS) is employed to continuously estimate the position and attitude of vehicle, and three X-ray sensors observing X-ray pulsars are utilized to reduce the long-term effects of the errors in the INS. In addition, a modified square-root unscented Kalman filter (MSUKF) is proposed. The MSUKF adopts a fading factor to compensate the impact of modeling error, and contains no linearization steps. The results have shown that the proposed navigation system outperforms the traditional celestial-inertial method and the MSUKF could guarantee a faster convergence compared with former proposed nonlinear filters.

AB Intersection control has an important role in the management of urban traffic to ensure safety, high traffic flow and to prevent congestion. Recently, a growing body of literature has been reported on the theme of non-signalised intersection control in which traffic lights are replaced with intelligent road side units. Data from several studies suggest that non-signalised control could reduce vehicle delays and fuel consumption significantly whilst ensuring safety. However, there is little published data on the impact of the mixed driving behaviour with human-driven vehicles and autonomous vehicles. This paper investigates the emerging role of connectivity and vehicle autonomy in the context of traffic control under the mixed driving behaviour scenario. The concepts of vehicle-to-infrastructure (V2I) communications and multi-agent systems are central to achieving a robust and reliable traffic-light-free intersection control. Comprehensive computer simulation results on a four-way intersection indicate over 96% reduced average vehicle delay and 37% less fuel consumption with the non-signalised control solution compared to the traffic light control. The outcome of this study offers some important insights into enabling cooperation between vehicles and traffic infrastructure via V2I communications, in order to make more efficient real-time decisions about traffic conditions, whilst ensuring a higher degree of safety.

The autonomous control of surface Unmanned Surface Vessel (USV) generally covers the USV path planning, path tracking control, and autonomous collision avoidance control. But in the whole navigation process of USV, autonomous berthing is also a crucial part. And the research on the algorithm of the automatic berthing process of the USV is less. Mature USV autonomous berthing technology can effectively reduce the cost of human and material resources and financial resources while reducing the accident rate reasonably and safely. Therefore, it is of great importance to comprehensively promote the development of USV autonomous berthing technology.

SO JOURNAL OF AMBIENT INTELLIGENCE AND HUMANIZED COMPUTING

DE Traffic intersection management; Vehicle coordination; Self-organized
   systems; Multiagent systems
ID METHODOLOGY
AB Nowadays, the development of autonomous vehicles has emerged as an approach to considerably improve the traffic management in urban zones. Thanks to automation in vehicles as well as in other sectors, the probability of errors, typically due to repetitive tasks, has been drastically reduced. Therefore, technological aids in current driving systems are aimed to avoid or reduce human errors like imprudences or distractions. According to this, it is possible to tackle complex scenarios such as the automation of the vehicles traffic at intersections, as this is one of the points with the highest probability of accidents. In this sense, the coordination of autonomous vehicles at intersections is a trending topic. In the last few years, several approaches have been proposed using centralized solutions. However, centralized systems for traffic coordination have a limited fault-tolerance. This paper proposes a distributed coordination management system for intersections of autonomous vehicles through the employment of some well-defined rules to be followed by vehicles. To validate our proposal, we have developed different experiments in order to compare our proposal with other centralized approaches. Furthermore, we have incorporated the management of communication faults during the execution in our proposal. This improvement has also been tested in front of centralized or semi-centralized solutions. The introduction of failures in the communication process demonstrates the sensitivity of the system to possible disturbances, providing a satisfactory coordination of vehicles during the intersection. As final result, our proposal is kept with a suitable flow of autonomous vehicles still with a high communication fails rate.

AB Autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) commonly employ a Doppler velocity log (DVL) to achieve an accurate navigation solution. In real-world scenarios, like when operating in complex environments, situations of complete DVL outages may occur, leading to rapid degradation in the navigation solution. To circumvent such situations, this article proposes an approach to estimate the platform's velocity vector based on past DVL measurements and a motion model, for short time periods. At-sea experiments were conducted using two types of AUVs, each with a different DVL, to collect data for a total time duration of 90 min. This dataset was employed to show the benefits of using the proposed approach.

AB The Internet of Things (IoT) is a new trend in technology that is already changing the world in which we live by interconnecting physical objects that can collect or transmit information to us and to each other. In this paper, an application of the use of the IoT is presented by the development of a semi-autonomous utility vehicle using off-the-shelf home automation (smart) components. The system is composed of hardware and software elements that are integrated into a self-propelled scaled down version of an off-road vehicle, a lawn mower. A Web application was built and enabled for Android devices to command and control the vehicle, various applets in the application were enabled to be triggered using the Alexa voice service and an Amazon Tap speaker. The vehicle can be controlled through voice commands and is capable of moving in four directions at five different speeds. It is able to move at an average velocity of 35.7 m/min among its five speeds on vinyl floor, and at an average velocity of 20.8 m/min and 16.3 m/min on concrete and grass, respectively. The ultrasonic sensors installed on the vehicle proved their reliability by stopping the vehicle at an average distance of 7.3 cm away from different obstacles. This paper contributes to existing knowledge on the IoT by providing a demonstration of a semi-autonomous vehicle capable of cloud-based control both with voice commands and through a Web app.

ID AVOIDANCE; SYSTEM; ROAD
AB Planning of autonomous vehicles in the absence of speed lanes is a less-researched problem. However, it is an important step toward extending the possibility of autonomous vehicles to countries where speed lanes are not followed. The advantages of having nonlane-oriented traffic include larger traffic bandwidth and more overtaking, which are features that are highlighted when vehicles vary in terms of speed and size. In the most general case, the road would be filled with a complex grid of static obstacles and vehicles of varying speeds. The optimal travel plan consists of a set of maneuvers that enables a vehicle to avoid obstacles and to overtake vehicles in an optimal manner and, in turn, enable other vehicles to overtake. The desired characteristics of this planning scenario include near completeness and near optimality in real time with an unstructured environment, with vehicles essentially displaying a high degree of cooperation and enabling every possible (safe) overtaking procedure to be completed as soon as possible. Challenges addressed in this paper include a (fast) method for initial path generation using an elastic strip, (re-)defining the notion of completeness specific to the problem, and inducing the notion of cooperation in the elastic strip. Using this approach, vehicular behaviors of overtaking, cooperation, vehicle following, obstacle avoidance, etc., are demonstrated.

AB Marine archaeology beyond the capabilities of scuba divers is a technologically enabled field. The tool suite includes ship-based systems such as towed side-scan sonars and remotely operated vehicles, and more recently free-swimming autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs). Each of these platforms has various imaging and mapping capabilities appropriate for specific scales and tasks. Broadly speaking, AUVs are becoming effective tools for locating, identifying, and surveying archaeological sites. This paper discusses the role of AUVs in this suite of tools, outlines some specific design criteria necessary to maximize their utility in the field, and presents directions for future developments. Results are presented for a recent joint AUV-towed system survey and a demonstration of current mine-hunting technologies applied to archaeology.

AB Efficient path-planning algorithms are a crucial issue for modern autonomous underwater vehicles. Classical path-planning algorithms in artificial intelligence are not designed to deal with wide continuous environments prone to currents. We present a novel Fast Marching (FM)-based approach to address the following issues. First, we develop an algorithm we call FM* to efficiently extract a 2-D continuous path from a discrete representation of the environment. Second, we take underwater currents into account thanks to an anisotropic extension of the original FM algorithm. Third, the vehicle turning radius is introduced as a constraint on the optimal path curvature for both isotropic and anisotropic media. Finally, a multiresolution method is introduced to speed up the overall path-planning process.

AB This review article examines the crucial role of energy harvesting and energy recovery in the design of battery electric vehicles (BEVs) and fuel cell hybrid electric vehicles (FCHEVs) as these vehicles have limited onboard power sources. Harvesting energy and recovering energy from onboard systems can significantly improve energy efficiency, increase range, and reduce fuel consumption. The latest advances in vehicular energy recovery and harvesting, including regenerative braking, regenerative suspension, solar and wind energy harvesting, and other recovery methods are studied and the impact of the energy storage system and powertrain architecture on energy harvesting is investigated. Regenerative brake control strategies and driver behaviour's effect on energy recovery are reviewed, and the potential of energy harvesting in electric vehicles is discussed, including experimental and low-power harvesting methods. The importance of using perception and navigation technologies in autonomous vehicles to enhance energy efficiency is highlighted. The article identifies critical research gaps, challenges, and future directions for research in this field. This review stands out from previous papers by covering overlooked subjects such as driver behaviour and deceleration planning in autonomous vehicles, low-power harvesting methods, and experimental techniques applicable to electric vehicles.

ID NAVIGATION; LOCALIZATION
AB A positioning system estimates the position and orientation of a vehicle. Autonomous driving systems plan paths and control the vehicle based on the information from the positioning system. Recently, methods of estimating the position in urban areas have been actively studied. In U-turn sections, which are common in urban areas, vehicles perform a rotation to reverse the direction of travel. Through these sections, drivers can reduce the travel distance and save time but with a high risk of an accident. Despite there being a need for the development of autonomous driving schemes for U-turn sections, the existing research is limited. This study proposes an interacting multiple model (IMM) filter-based position estimation algorithm for urban U-turn sections. To reflect the dynamic characteristics of a vehicle during U-turn maneuvers, a multiple vehicle model was used. This model includes kinematic and dynamic vehicle models. The state estimates of the vehicle model and gyroscope are combined using an IMM filter. The position estimation algorithm developed in this study is verified via experiments. The experimental results indicate that, during urban U-turn maneuvers, the position estimation accuracy of the IMM filter-based algorithm is improved than that of the single vehicle model.

   FUTURE; MODEL
AB Upon the introduction of autonomous vehicles into daily traffic, it becomes increasingly likely that autonomous vehicles become involved in accident scenarios in which decisions have to be made about how to distribute harm among involved parties. In four experiments, participants made moral decisions from the perspective of a passenger, a pedestrian, or an observer. The results show that the preferred action of an autonomous vehicle strongly depends on perspective. Participants' judgments reflect self-protective tendencies even when utilitarian motives clearly favor one of the available options. However, with an increasing number of lives at stake, utilitarian preferences increased. In a fifth experiment, we tested whether these results were tainted by social desirability but this was not the case. Overall, the results confirm that strong differences exist among passengers, pedestrians, and observers about the preferred course of action in critical incidents. It is therefore important that the actions of autonomous vehicles are not only oriented towards the needs of their passengers, but also take the interests of other road users into account. Even though utilitarian motives cannot fully reconcile the conflicting interests of passengers and pedestrians, there seem to be some moral preferences that a majority of the participants agree upon regardless of their perspective, including the utilitarian preference to save several other lives over one's own.

AB Despite the growing interest in implementing shared autonomous vehicles (SAVs) as a new mobility mode, there is still a lack of methodologies to unpack SAV adoption by individuals after experiencing self-driving vehicles. This study aimed to fill this gap by analyzing data collected from a users' survey of a self-driving shuttle piloted downtown and on a university campus in Arlington, TX. Employing structural equation modeling, the hypothesized relationships between SAV adoption and key factors were tested. Data analyses indicated that individuals with limited access to a private vehicles, low-income people, young adults, university students, males, and Asians were more likely to ride this new service. Furthermore, results showed that SAV service attributes, including internal and external service performance and usual transportation mode, affected users' willingness to continue using the service in the future. The study also highlighted the role of trip waiting time, -purpose, and -frequency on SAV adoption. Our model simultaneously considered usual transportation mode and trip frequency as factors that could mediate the role of vehicle ownership on SAV adoption. The results suggested that participants with greater access to a private vehicle were strongly interested in using private vehicles and less likely to use the ridesharing alternative, consequently they less frequently used the piloted SAV. The outcomes from this study are expected to inform planners with advanced knowledge about emerging technology to help them to adjust SAV policies before autonomous vehicle services are fully on the roads.

AB In this paper we present queueing-theoretical methods for the modeling, analysis, and control of autonomous mobility-on-demand (MOD) systems wherein robotic, self-driving vehicles transport customers within an urban environment and rebalance themselves to ensure acceptable quality of service throughout the network. We first cast an autonomous MOD system within a closed Jackson network model with passenger loss. It is shown that an optimal rebalancing algorithm minimizing the number of (autonomously) rebalancing vehicles while keeping vehicle availabilities balanced throughout the network can be found by solving a linear program. The theoretical insights are used to design a robust, real-time rebalancing algorithm, which is applied to a case study of New York City and implemented on an eight-vehicle mobile robot testbed. The case study of New York shows that the current taxi demand in Manhattan can be met with about 8,000 robotic vehicles (roughly 70% of the size of the current taxi fleet operating in Manhattan). Finally, we extend our queueing-theoretical setup to include congestion effects, and study the impact of autonomously rebalancing vehicles on overall congestion. Using a simple heuristic algorithm, we show that additional congestion due to autonomous rebalancing can be effectively avoided on a road network. Collectively, this paper provides a rigorous approach to the problem of system-wide coordination of autonomously driving vehicles, and provides one of the first characterizations of the sustainability benefits of robotic transportation networks.

AB In recent years, some phenomena such as the COVID-19 pandemic have caused the autonomous vehicle (AV) to attract much attention in theoretical and applied research. This paper addresses the optimization problem of a heterogeneous fleet that consists of autonomous electric vehicles (AEVs) and conventional vehicles (CVs) in a Business-to-Consumer (B2C) distribution system. The absence of the driver in AEVs results in the necessity of studying two factors in modeling the problem, namely time windows in the routing plan and different compartments in the loading space of AEVs. We developed a mathematical model based on these properties, that was NP-hard. Then we proposed a hybrid algorithm, including variable neighborhood search (VNS) via neighborhood structure of large neighborhood search (LNS), namely the VLNS algorithm. The numerical results shed light on the proficiency of the algorithm in terms of solution time and solution quality. In addition, employing AEVs in the mixed fleet is considered to be desirable based on the operational cost of the fleet. The numerical results show the operational cost in the mixed fleet decreases on average by 57.22% compared with the homogeneous fleet.

AB Autonomous/self-driving vehicles have gained significant attention these days, as one of the intelligent transportation systems. However, those vehicles have risks related to their physical implementation and security against cyber threats. Therefore, this study proposes a new security-by-design model for estimating the uncertainty of autonomous vehicles and measuring cyber risks; thus it assists decision-makers in addressing the risks of the physical design and their attack surfaces. The proposed model is developed using neutrosophic sets that efficiently tackle multi-criteria decision-making (MCDM) problems with extensive conflicting criteria and alternatives. The proposed model integrates MCDM, Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP), Multi-Attributive Border Approximation Area Comparison (MABAC), and Preference Ranking Organization Method for Enrichment Evaluations II (PROMETHEE II), along with single-valued neutrosophic sets (SVNSs). An illustrative case considering ten risks in self-driving vehicles is used to validate the feasibility of the proposed model. Compared to the state-of-the-art methods, the proposed model is considered consistent and reliable to deal with and represent uncertainty and incomplete risk information using neutrosophic sets.

AB Cooperative perception is an effective way for connected autonomous vehicles to extend sensing range, improve detection precision, and thus enhance perception ability by combining their own sensing information with that of other vehicles. The existing cooperation perception schemes share only raw-, feature-, or object-level data, thus lacking the flexibility to adapt to highly dynamic vehicular network conditions, which leads to either bandwidth saturation or bandwidth underutilization, degrading the detection precision in the long run. In this article, we propose ML-Cooper, a multilevel cooperative perception framework, to fully utilize the bandwidth and hence improve detection precision. The key idea of ML-Cooper is to divide each frame of sensing data of the sender vehicle into three parts, and the corresponding raw data, feature data, and object data are transmitted to and fused at the receiver vehicle. We also develop a soft actor-critic (SAC) deep reinforcement learning algorithm to adaptively adjust the proportion of the three parts according to the channel state information of the Vehicle-to-Vehicle (V2V) link. The experimental results on KITTI and our collected data sets on two real vehicles show that ML-Cooper can achieve the highest average detection precision compared to existing single-level cooperative perception schemes.

AB In this work we present a traffic model to simulate network-level traffic evolution under the impact of controlled autonomous vehicles acting as moving bottlenecks. We first extend the Newell-Daganzo method to track the trajectories of moving bottlenecks and calculate the cumulative number of vehicles passing each moving bottleneck. By integrating the solutions to the cumulative number of vehicles passing moving bottlenecks and link nodes as boundary conditions in the link-transmission model, we can incorporate the impact of moving bottlenecks into the flow of traffic at a network scale. We present numerical simulation results that illustrate the effectiveness of the developed model to track the trajectories of the moving bottlenecks and simulate their impact on freeway traffic. Lastly, we present control applications of the developed model to trajectory optimization. The reduced fuel consumption associated with the careful control of AV trajectories in the moving bottleneck framework indicates the potential to considerably improve the flow of traffic by controlling the AVs in a mixed human and autonomous environment.

AB Mobility is the backbone of urban life and a vital economic factor in the development of the world. Rapid urbanization and the growth of mega-cities are bringing dramatic changes in the capabilities of vehicles. Innovative solutions like autonomy, electrification, and connectivity are on the horizon. How, then, we can provide ubiquitous connectivity to legacy and autonomous vehicles? This article seeks to answer this question b combining recent leaps of innovation in network virtualization with remarkable feats of wireless communications. To do so, this article proposes a novel paradigm called the Internet of Autonomous Vehicles (IoAV). We begin painting the picture of IoAV by discussing the salient features and applications of IoAV, followed by a detailed discussion on the key enabling technologies. Next, we describe the proposed layered architecture of IoAV and uncover some critical functions of each layer. This is followed by the performance evaluation of IoAV, which shows significant advantages of the proposed architecture in terms of transmission time and energy consumption. Finally, to best capture the benefits of IoAV, we enumerate some social and technological challenges, and explain how some unresolved issues can disrupt the widespread use of autonomous vehicles in the future.

AB Rear end collision is one hazard accident for an autonomous vehicle. Emergency braking has already been deeply researched and applied into some new model vehicles to avoid rear-end collision or mitigate its impacts. Emergency steering is another promising method to enhance vehicle safety; this kind of collision avoidance approach remains to be carefully studied. To fill this gap, this work proposes an emergency steering based rear-end collision avoidance approach concerning required safe distance as safety index. Vehicle dynamics, Tire Slip Angle and Segal lateral force model, are concerned to obtain the vehicle states. Monte Carlo simulation is executed to determine the value of required safe distance when encountering with a stationary and a suddenly decelerating target vehicle at different velocities. Safe Distance Margin and quantised influence two indexes are proposed to assess the influence of measurement uncertainty. Simulation and road test experiment results demonstrate that the proposed method is effective to avoid rear-end collision by emergency steering manoeuvre. Moreover, some aspects, like vehicle lateral stability, emergency manoeuvre selection and simultaneously emergency manoeuvres are discussed as well in this work in order to apply this collision avoidance method into practical application.

Our approach uses monocular imagery to mimic the human ability to perceive and control a remote aircraft. This allows for the autonomous control of a wide variety of aircraft with minimal on-board sensors. We improve upon other 2D single-shot detection methods by estimating a 3D box containing the aircraft, which allows us to capture a vehicle's position and attitude as measurements. Using a constant-jerk Kalman filter, we then estimate the complete aircraft state from these measurements. Finally a proportional-integral-derivative controller is used to provide closed-loop autonomous flight of an aircraft from a remote location. Hardware experiments of a completely autonomous vehicle flying waypoints illustrate the validity of this method.

AB Computer-free autonomous decision making based on environmental cues provides exciting alternatives to classic control systems for robots and smart materials. Although this functionality has been studied in microswimmers and active colloids where energy in the surrounding liquid is prevalent, there are no devices that can provide sufficient power from environmental chemicals to move and steer larger scale robots and vehicles in dry environments. This work overcomes this limitation with an environmentally controlled voltage source (ECVS) that, when directly attached to electric motors on a vehicle, can increase the energy available to the vehicle and provide computer-free autonomous navigation toward chemical fuels in the environment and away from hazards. The ECVS uses electrochemistry to extract power from the chemical fuels, and the vehicle avoids hazards that reduce the output voltage or electrochemical kinetics. Two ECVSs can also be arranged in series or parallel to perform logical functions based on the chemicals in contact with the ECVSs. This work presents a new method to simultaneously steer and power vehicles and robots without computers by directly responding to a wide variety of chemical fields in their environment using electrochemistry.

AB The core technique of unmanned vehicle systems is the autonomous maneuvering decision, which not only determines the applications of unmanned vehicles but also is the critical technique many countries are competing to develop. Reinforcement Learning (RL) is the potential design method for autonomous maneuvering decision-making systems. Nevertheless, in the face of complex decision-making tasks, it is still challenging to master the optimal policy due to the low learning efficiency caused by the complex environment, high dimensional state, and sparse reward. Inspired by the human learning process from simple to complex, we propose a novel progressive deep RL algorithm for policy optimization in unmanned autonomous decision-making systems in this paper. The proposed algorithm divides the training of the autonomous maneuvering decision into a sequence of curricula with learning tasks from simple to complex. Finally, through the self-play stage, the iterative optimization of the policy is realized. Furthermore, the confrontation environment with two unmanned vehicles with obstacles is analyzed and modeled. Finally, the simulation leads to the one-to-one adversarial tasks demonstrate the effectiveness and applicability of the proposed design algorithm.

AB This paper presents a comparative study on coordinated control of path tracking and vehicle stability for autonomous vehicles on low-friction roads. Generally, a path-tracking controller designed on high-friction roads cannot provide good performance under low-friction conditions. To cope with the problem, a coordinated control between path tracking and vehicle stability has been proposed to date. In this paper, three types of coordinated controllers are classified according to the controller structure. As an actuator, front-wheel steering, four-wheel steering, and four-wheel independent braking and driving are adopted. A common feature of these types of controllers is that front steering and yaw moment control are adopted as control inputs. To convert the yaw moment control into tire forces generated by combinations of multiple actuators, a control allocation method is applied. For each type, a controller is designed and simulated using vehicle simulation software. From the simulation results, a performance comparison among those controller types is carried out. Through comparison, it is shown that there are small differences among those types of controllers in terms of path tracking.

AB Continuous estimation the driver's take-over readiness is critical for safe and timely transfer of control during the failure modes of autonomous vehicles. In this article, we propose a data-driven approach for estimating the driver's take-over readiness based purely on observable cues fromin-vehicle vision sensors. We present an extensive naturalistic driving dataset of drivers in a conditionally autonomous vehicle running on Californian freeways. We collect subjective ratings for the driver's take-over readiness from multiple human observers viewing the sensor feed. Analysis of the ratings in terms of intra-class correlation coefficients (ICCs) shows a high degree of consistency in the ratings across raters. We define a metric for the driver's take-over readiness termed the 'Observable Readiness Index (ORI)' based on the ratings. Finally, we propose an LSTM model for continuous estimation of the driver'sORI based on a holistic representation of the driver's state, capturing gaze, hand, pose and foot activity. Our model estimates the ORI with a mean absolute error of 0.449 on a 5 point scale.

AB The three main modules of autonomous vehicles, i.e., sensing, decision making, and motion controlling, have been studied separately in most existing works on autonomous driving, which overlook the correlations among these modules, leading to a result of unsatisfactory performance. In this paper, we propose a novel scheme that first tactfully processes the sensing data, then jointly learns and optimizes the decision-making and motion-controlling using reinforcement learning (RL). Specifically, the proposed scheme designs a novel state representation mechanism, where the sensing data goes through the attention layer and the convolutional neural network (CNN) layer sequentially. The attention layer focuses on extracting the most important local information and then CNN layer takes a broad view to comprehensively consider the global information for a better representation. Furthermore, the proposed scheme jointly learns decision-making and motion-controlling, therefore, the relevance of these two modules is implicitly considered, which helps to achieve a better autonomous driving policy. Extensive simulation results show that the proposed scheme is better than classic control methods and some RL methods in terms of safety, velocity, etc. We also demonstrate the respective functions of the attention layer and the CNN layer through ablation studies. Finally, we construct a traffic scene with a real autonomous vehicle, and verified the feasibility of the proposed scheme.

AB To solve the issues of low performance and low reliability of autonomous steering systems in intelligent vehicles, this paper proposes a novel fault detection and fault tolerance control (FDFTC) strategy. Firstly, an autonomous steering controller with rack displacement as the state feedback input is utilized to improve the system performance. Secondly, considering the importance of the rack displacement signal to the controller and the harsh operating environment of the displacement sensor, the software redundancy of the sensor is necessary. Therefore, a FDFTC strategy composed of Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory (Bi-LSTM) based rack displacement estimator and Sequential Probability Ratio Test (SPRT) is designed to effectively handle displacement sensor faults. Finally, comprehensive simulation and Hardware-in-Loop (HiL) test results show that the proposed FDFTC strategy can promptly detect sensor failures and efficiently restore vehicles to a stable state, thus effectively maintaining the trajectory tracking of intelligent vehicles when faults occur.

AB In this study, a comprehensive overview of the available autonomous ground platforms developed by universities and research groups that were specifically designed to handle agricultural tasks was performed. As cost reduction and safety improvements are two of the most critical aspects for farmers, the development of autonomous vehicles can be of major interest, especially for those applications that are lacking in terms of mechanization improvements. This review aimed to provide a literature evaluation of present and historical research contributions toward designing and prototyping agricultural ground unmanned vehicles. The review was motivated by the intent to disseminate to the scientific community the main features of the autonomous tractor named BOPS-1960, which was conceived in the 1960s at the Alma Mater Studiorum University of Bologna (UNIBO). Jointly, the main characteristics of the modern DEDALO unmanned ground vehicle (UGV) for orchard and vineyard operations that was designed recently were evaluated. The basic principles, technology and sensors used in the two UNIBO prototypes are described in detail, together with an analysis of UGVs for agriculture conceived in recent years by research centers all around the world.

AB Trajectory tracking control of autonomous underwater vehicles in three-dimension always suffers disturbances such as input time delays and model uncertainties. Regarding this problem, an integral time-delay sliding mode control law is proposed in this article with dividing the vehicle's input time delays model into cascade system consisting of a kinematics subsystem and a dynamics subsystem. Based on the established pose error equation and velocity error equation, a suitable Lyapunov-Krasovskii functional is given to analyze and guarantee the global stability of the whole system under reasonable assumptions. At last, comparative simulations are presented to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.

AB This paper proposes a decision-making algorithm based on deep reinforcement learning to support fallback techniques in autonomous vehicles. The fallback technique attempts to mitigate or escape risky driving conditions by responding to appropriate avoidance maneuvers essential for achieving a Level 4+ autonomous driving system. However, developing a fallback technique is difficult because of the innumerable fallback situations to address and eligible optimal decision-making among multiple maneuvers. We employed a decision-making algorithm utilizing a scenario-based learning approach to address these issues. First, we crafted a specific fallback scenario encompassing the challenges to be addressed and matched the anticipated optimal maneuvers as determined by heuristic methods. In this scenario, the ego vehicle learns through trial and error to determine the most effective maneuver. We conducted 100 independent training sessions to evaluate the proposed algorithm and compared the results with those of heuristic-derived maneuvers. The results were promising; 38% of the training sessions resulted in the vehicle learning lane-change maneuvers, whereas 9% mastered slow following. Thus, the proposed algorithm successfully learned human-equivalent fallback capabilities from scratch within the provided scenario.

AB To improve the autonomy of maritime search and rescue (SAR) operation, this paper concentrates on the formation control problem for autonomous surface vehicles (ASVs) with the limited communication resource. A novel parallel search guidance, considering the maneuvering characteristics of ASVs, is developed to guide the formation to execute the automatic SAR operation. That can guarantee that the corresponding guidance law is highly efficient, self-driving and suitable for the large-scale formation. Combined with the guidance principle, a formation control algorithm is proposed by fuse of the event-triggered control and neural networks (NNs). In the proposed scheme, the gain uncertainty of actuators is effectively compensated requiring no prior information around the model structure. Unlike the existing results, the proposed event-triggered mechanism can activate synchronously both the controller and the NNs weight estimator. Considerable effort has been made to guarantee the semi-global uniform ultimate bounded (SGUUB) stability. Finally, two examples are illustrated to verify the effectiveness of the algorithm.

AB Performing repeatable duties automatically was the dreams of human being for centuries. Although full autonomy has long been dreamed of by visionaries, many researches have been performed for surface vehicles automation since the last century to get close to this dream stepwise. To increase daily working hours and accuracy and reduce cost, operations such as hydrography are susceptible for autonomy. Beside platform topology, installed sensors and energy resources, the core elements of any autonomous surface vehicle are navigation, guidance and control systems. To perform bathymetry operation in autonomy manner, a reliable and robust navigation algorithm is designed and embedded in an autonomous surface vehicle titled Morvarid. Morvarid is a plug-in hybrid solar powered catamaran boat. The developed algorithm is a combination of extended Kalman filter, search ball and potential field approaches. Many experimental field tests are carried out after simulation in Simulink environment. Test results illustrated the algorithm and improved the path followed by reducing SD and RMSE and there is a good correlation between simulation run and experimental tests.

ID GAME-THEORETIC APPROACH; MOTION PREDICTION; PLANNING-MODEL
AB In order to ensure a safer and more reliable trajectory during the lane change process, the motion decision algorithm needs to predict the possibility of different interaction behaviours with surrounding vehicles and then makes an advantageous decision. For this purpose, a motion decision method of considering the interaction of surrounding vehicles is proposed. Firstly, this study builds the payoff functions to determine the driving revenue of autonomous driving vehicles. Then, an interactive motion prediction method based on game theory is established to predict the interaction behaviours possibility and future local trajectories of surrounding vehicles. Based on this, a motion decision algorithm based on Nash Q-learning for an autonomous driving vehicle is established. With externalising the main behaviours predicted by the interactive game and the greedy optimisation method, the autonomous vehicle can determine the optimal sequence of actions and take into account the interaction of the surrounding vehicles. Finally, the motion decision in this study is validated by MATLAB in the merging lane scene, and compared with the existing rule-based lane change decision algorithm. The results show that the decision method in this study not only has superiority in safety and efficiency but also can effectively predict the interaction of surrounding vehicles.

AB As more vehicles are being connected to the Internet and equipped with autonomous driving features, more robust safety and security measures are required for connected and autonomous vehicles (CAVs). Therefore, threat analysis and risk assessment are essential to prepare against cybersecurity risks for CAVs. Although prior studies have measured the possibility of attack and damage from attack as risk assessment indices, they have not analyzed the expanding attack surface or risk assessment indices that rely upon real-time resilience. This study proposes the PIER method to evaluate the cybersecurity risks of CAVs. We implemented cyber resilience for CAVs by presenting new criteria, such as exposure and recovery, in addition to probability and impact, as indices for the threat analysis and risk assessment of vehicles. To verify its effectiveness, the PIER method was evaluated with respect to software update over-the-air and collision avoidance features. Furthermore, we found that implementing security requirements that mitigate serious risks successfully diminishes the risk indices. Using the risk assessment matrix, the PIER method can shorten the risk determination time through high-risk coverage and a simple process.

DE Autonomous vehicle-human driver interactions; Car-following behavior
ID TIME-HEADWAY; MODEL; COLLISION
AB The past few years have been witness to an increase in autonomous vehicle (AV) development and testing. However, even with a fully developed and comprehensively tested AV technology, AVs are anticipated to share the roadway network with human drivers for the unforeseeable future. In such a mixed environment, we use naturalistic driving data from the next generation simulation (NGSIM) and Lyft Level 5 (Lyft L5) prediction data sets to investigate whether the existence of AVs influences the car-following behavior of human drivers. We use time headway time series as a proxy to capture the car-following behavior of human drivers. We then develop a nested fixed model to find possible changes in behavior when human drivers are following different types of vehicles (i.e., human-driven vehicles or AVs). The factors included in this model are the platoon structure (a legacy vehicle following a legacy vehicle, and a legacy vehicle following an autonomous vehicle), road type (freeway and urban), time period (morning and afternoon), lane (right, middle, and left), and the source of the data (NGSIM and Lyft L5). Results indicate a statistically significant difference between the car-following behavior of drivers when they follow a human-driven vehicle compared to an AV. This change in the car-following behavior of drivers is manifested in the form of a reduction in the mean and variance of time headways when human drivers follow an AV. These findings can bridge the gap between anticipated and real-world impacts of AVs on traffic streams and roadway capacity, providing meaningful insights on the influence of AVs on the driving behavior of humans in a naturalistic driving environment.

AB To enhance the reality of Connected and Autonomous Vehicles (CAVs) kinematic simulation scenarios and to guarantee the accuracy and reliability of the verification, a four-layer CAVs kinematic simulation framework, which is composed with road network layer, vehicle operating layer, uncertainties modelling layer and demonstrating layer, is proposed in this paper. Properties of the intersections are defined to describe the road network. A target position based vehicle position updating method is designed to simulate such vehicle behaviors as lane changing and turning. Vehicle kinematic models are implemented to maintain the status of the vehicles when they are moving towards the target position. Priorities for individual vehicle control are authorized for different layers. Operation mechanisms of CAVs uncertainties, which are defined as position error and communication delay in this paper, are implemented in the simulation to enhance the reality of the simulation. A simulation platform is developed based on the proposed methodology. A comparison of simulated and theoretical vehicle delay has been analyzed to prove the validity and the creditability of the platform. The scenario of rear-end collision avoidance is conducted to verify the uncertainties operating mechanisms, and a slot-based intersections (SIs) control strategy is realized and verified in the simulation platform to show the supports of the platform to CAVs kinematic simulation and verification.

AB Due to the elderly's limited physical ability, their mode choice behavior with particular demand for the traffic system is significantly distinguished compared to young people. The emergence of Autonomous Vehicles (AVs) and Shared Autonomous Vehicles (SAVs) will allow the elderly to travel independently and offer more mode choices. However, emerging vehicles will continue to coexist with other traditional modes such as public transport. This paper aims to explore the internal mechanism of the elderly's choice behavior among public transport, AVs, and SAVs. We integrated the relevant factors by expanding the ecological model and used the Multiple Indicators and Multiple Causes (MIMIC) model to analyze the constructs' relationship. The results show that the elderly believe that public transport, AVs, and SAVs are useful and convenient travel modes for themselves, affecting intention significantly. In addition, the elderly's well-being and social influence during travel are also significant constructs for their behavioral intention. The research could provide academic supports for the traffic management departments when making relevant policies and measures for the elderly.

AB All-day and all-weather navigation is a critical capability for autonomous driving, which requires proper reaction to varied environmental conditions and complex agent behaviors. Recently, with the rise of deep learning, end-to-end control for autonomous vehicles has been well studied. However, most works are solely based on visual information, which can be degraded by challenging illumination conditions such as dim light or total darkness. In addition, they usually generate and apply deterministic control commands without considering the uncertainties in the future. In this letter, based on imitation learning, we propose a probabilistic driving model with multi-perception capability utilizing the information from the camera, lidar and radar. We further evaluate its driving performance online on our new driving benchmark, which includes various environmental conditions (e.g., urban and rural areas, traffic densities, weather and times of the day) and dynamic obstacles (e.g., vehicles, pedestrians, motorcyclists and bicyclists). The results suggest that our proposed model outperforms baselines and achieves excellent generalization performance in unseen environments with heavy traffic and extreme weather.

AB Central to the successful operation of an autonomous undersea vehicle (AUV) is the capability to return to a dock, such that consistent recovery of the AUV is practical. Vehicle orientation becomes increasingly important in the final stages of the docking, as large changes in orientation near the dock are impractical and often not possible. A number of homing technologies have been proposed and tested, with acoustic homing the most prevalent. If AUV orientation is required as well as bearing and distance to the dock, an acoustic homing system will require high update rates, and extensive signal conditioning. An Electromagnetic Homing (EM) system is one alternative that can provide accurate measurement of the AUV position and orientation to the dock during homing. This system offers inherent advantages in defining the AUV orientation, when compared to high frequency acoustic systems. The design and testing of an EM homing system are given, with particular attention to one can be adapted to a wide class of AUVs. A number of homing, docking, and latching trials were successfully performed with the design. Homing data include dead reckoning computation and acoustic tracking of the homing track, and video documentation of homing into the dock.

AB Autonomous driving promises to be the main trend in the future intelligent transportation systems due to its potentiality for energy saving, and traffic and safety improvements. However, traditional autonomous vehicles' behavioral decisions face consistency issues between behavioral decision and trajectory planning and shows a strong dependence on the human experience. In this paper, we present a planning-feature-based deep behavior decision method (PFBD) for autonomous driving in complex, dynamic traffic. We used a deep reinforcement learning (DRL) learning framework with the twin delayed deep deterministic policy gradient algorithm (TD3) to exploit the optimal policy. We took into account the features of topological routes in the decision making of autonomous vehicles, through which consistency between decision making and path planning layers can be guaranteed. Specifically, the features of a route extracted from path planning space are shared as the input states for the behavioral decision. The actor-network learns a near-optimal policy from the feasible and safe candidate emulated routes. Simulation tests on three typical scenarios have been performed to demonstrate the performance of the learning policy, including the comparison with a traditional rule-based expert algorithm and the comparison with the policy considering partial information of a contour. The results show that the proposed approach can achieve better decisions. Real-time test on an HQ3 (HongQi the third ) autonomous vehicle also validated the effectiveness of PFBD.

AB With 36 ventures testing autonomous vehicles (AVs) in the State of California, commercial deployment of this disruptive technology is almost around the corner (California Department of Transportation, 2016). Different business models of AVs, including Shared AVs (SAVs) and Private AVs (PAVs), will lead to significantly different changes in regional vehicle inventory and Vehicle Miles Travelled (VMT). Most prior studies have already explored the impact of SAVs on vehicle ownership and VMT generation. Limited understanding has been gained regarding vehicle ownership reduction and unoccupied VMT generation potentials in the era of PAVs. Motivated by such research gap, this study develops models to examine how much vehicle ownership reduction can be achieved once private conventional vehicles are replaced by AVs and the spatial distribution of unoccupied VMT accompanied with the vehicle reduction. The models are implemented using travel survey and synthesized trip profile from Atlanta Metropolitan Area. The results show that more than 18% of the households can reduce vehicles, while maintaining the current travel patterns. This can be translated into a 9.5% reduction in private vehicles in the study region. Meanwhile, 29.8 unoccupied VMT will be induced per day per reduced vehicles. A majority of the unoccupied VMT will be loaded on interstate highways and expressways and the largest percentage inflation in VMT will occur on minor local roads. The results can provide implications for evolving trends in household vehicles uses and the location of dedicated AV lanes in the PAV dominated future.

AB The flapping-wing aerial vehicle (FWAV) has appealed to more and more researchers recently owing to its outstanding performance in various domains and the development of some related technologies. The research on autonomous flight control of the FWAV involves many challenges and is still in nascent stages. In this work, we develop an FWAV with a mass of 14.1 g and build a vision-based experimental platform. A model-based controller is proposed on the basis of theory and simulation results prove its effectiveness. A PID control algorithm based on visual measurement is utilized to achieve the height-keeping control of the FWAV, and a software platform is designed to record the flight status determined using Euler angles and position information.

Part of this paper is focused on the performance of two path-following controllers, which are implemented using two different approaches, the first using fuzzy logic and the second using chained systems theory. The control effort and the errors magnitude along the path are evaluated in a comparative way. A magnetic guidance system for autonomous vehicles navigation in semi-structured outdoor environments is also described, integrating redundant encoders data and absolute positioning data provided by on-board magnetic sensors and magnetic markers buried in the road. Simulation and experimental results are presented showing the effectiveness of the overall control system.

TI Velocity-Based Path Following Control for Autonomous Vehicles to Avoid

AB As tire forces approach road friction limits, vehicles may always exhibit performance degradation and even instability. The actual capacity of the available road friction imposes coupled limits on a vehicle's longitudinal and lateral accelerations. In this paper, a varying speed method is proposed to design feasible speeds and accelerations, which ensure that the autonomous vehicle will not reach the tire-road friction limits during traversing a clothoid-based path. With the consideration of uncertain traction losses and vehicle parameters, a second-order super-twisting (ST) based speed control strategy is proposed to track above feasible speeds based on varying speed method, and to stabilize the sliding-mode variable of the speed tracking error with relative degree 1. Meanwhile, a second-order quasi-continuous (QC) based path-following control strategy is proposed to follow a desired transition path, and to stabilize the sliding-mode variable of the composite path-following errors with relative degree 2. On this basis, the proposed controllers have been verified to lead good robustness for tracking the ideal speeds and following the desired paths. As compared with the boundary of the autonomous vehicle running at a constant speed, the feasible speed boundary using varying speed method without exceeding the tire-road friction limits can be enlarged up to about 1.59 times, which is decided by the direction change between the entry and exit points of the desired path.

AB A personalized motion planning and tracking control framework is proposed to prevent collisions between autonomous vehicles and obstacles ahead. The presented framework consists of a motion planning generator and a cooperative tracking controller. For motion planning, a multi-constrained numerical optimization method is used to generate the obstacle avoidance motion planning for autonomous vehicles according to the individual needs of the passengers. For tracking control, a cooperative longitudinal and lateral motion controller is designed to track the planning results. The longitudinal controller is composed of a model predictive controller, and the lateral controller is composed of a nonlinear steering controller. The planning results show that the adopted motion planning algorithm can achieve personalized motion planning according to the needs of the passengers. Simulink and CarSim co-simulation results show the excellent tracking performance of the proposed cooperative controller. The performance analysis results show that the proposed framework can improve the corresponding driving performance according to the individual needs of the passengers.

AB Positive obstacles will cause damage to field robotics during traveling in field. Field autonomous land vehicle is a typical field robotic. This article presents a feature matching and fusion-based algorithm to detect obstacles using LiDARs for field autonomous land vehicles. There are three main contributions: (1) A novel setup method of compact LiDAR is introduced. This method improved the LiDAR data density and reduced the blind region of the LiDAR sensor. (2) A mathematical model is deduced under this new setup method. The ideal scan line is generated by using the deduced mathematical model. (3) Based on the proposed mathematical model, a feature matching and fusion (FMAF)-based algorithm is presented in this article, which is employed to detect obstacles. Experimental results show that the performance of the proposed algorithm is robust and stable, and the computing time is reduced by an order of two magnitudes by comparing with other exited algorithms. This algorithm has been perfectly applied to our autonomous land vehicle, which has won the champion in the challenge of Chinese Overcome Danger 2014 ground unmanned vehicle.

AB In this paper, a novel obstacle avoidance method is designed and applied to an experimental autonomous ground vehicle system. The proposed method brings a new solution to the problem and has several advantages compared to previous methods. This novel algorithm is easy to tune and it takes into consideration the field of view and the nonholonomic constraints of the robot. Moreover the method does not have a local minimum problem and results in safer trajectories because of its inherent properties in the definition of the algorithm. The proposed algorithm is tested in simulations and after the observation of successful results, experimental tests are performed using static and dynamic obstacle scenarios. The experimental test platform is an autonomous ground vehicle with Ackermann steering geometry which brings nonholonomic constraints to the vehicle. Experimental results show that the task of obstacle avoidance can be achieved using the algorithm on the autonomous vehicle platform. The algorithm is very promising for application in mobile and industrial robotics where obstacle avoidance is a feature of the robotic system. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB A key challenge for autonomous driving is to process a massive amount of sensor data and make safe and reliable decisions in real time. However, autonomous vehicles often have insufficient onboard resources to provide the required computation capacity. To address this problem, this article advocates a novel approach to offload computation-intensive autonomous driving services to roadside units and cloud for swift executions. Our approach combines an integer linear programming (ILP) formulation for offline optimization of the scheduling strategy and a fast heuristics algorithm for online adaptation. We verify our technique with both synthetic task graphs and real-world deployment. The experimental results show that our approach can improve system performance effectively.

AB Artificial potential fields and optimal controllers are two common methods for path planning of autonomous vehicles. An artificial potential field method is capable of assigning different potential functions to different types of obstacles and road structures and plans the path based on these potential functions. It does not, however, include the vehicle dynamics in the path-planning process. On the other hand, an optimal path-planning controller integrated with vehicle dynamics plans an optimal feasible path that guarantees vehicle stability in following the path. In this method, the obstacles and road boundaries are usually included in the optimal control problem as constraints and not with any arbitrary function. A model predictive path-planning controller is introduced in this paper such that its objective includes potential functions along with the vehicle dynamics terms. Therefore, the path-planning system is capable of treating different obstacles and road structures distinctly while planning the optimal path utilizing vehicle dynamics. The path-planning controller is modeled and simulated on a CarSim vehicle model for some complicated test scenarios. The results show that, with this path-planning controller, the vehicle avoids the obstacles and observes road regulations with appropriate vehicle dynamics. Moreover, since the obstacles and road regulations can be defined with different functions, the path-planning system plans paths corresponding to their importance and priorities.

AB Emerging autonomous modular vehicle (AMV) technology allows vehicle units to physically dock on or split from each other en route to form vehicles of different lengths. This technology has great potential in roadway logistics where platoons/long trains are formed to transport goods and passengers, i.e., freight and transit systems. AMV docking is an extreme case of autonomous vehicle (AV) platooning in that AMVs are physically connected with zero gaps. This paper formulates the AMV docking and AV platooning trajectory planning problem into a two-stage optimization problem. A feasible cone method is proposed to reveal the theoretical properties of solution feasibility and solve the first-stage problem analytically. This method provides the basics for a parsimonious heuristic approach to design trajectories specified as several quadratic segments. A heuristic alternative solution based on Pontryagin's maximum principle is proposed to solve a special case of the original problem to the exact optimum. Then an exact solution approach based on quadratic programming is proposed to optimize the trajectories. The feasible cone method is used to construct valid cuts to expedite the exact solution efficiency. Numerical experiments show that the parsimonious heuristic approach can achieve near-optimal solutions and greatly reduce the solution time compared with the exact solution approach, appealing to real-time engineering applications. The results also demonstrate the superiority of the parsimonious heuristic approach in optimizing AMV docking and AV platooning trajectories compared with traditional platooning methods. Sensitivity analysis results shed insights into advising parameter selections of platoon-related logistics to balance the tradeoff between operational efficiency and cost.

AB The platoon of connected autonomous vehicles plays an essential role in future intelligent transportation. It can improve traffic efficiency and release traffic congestion. However, there are lots of existing challenging problems of the control of connected autonomous vehicles, such as the negative impact caused by wireless communication and disturbance. To solve these challenges, a multi-objective asymmetric sliding mode control strategy is proposed in this paper. Firstly, the asymmetric degree is introduced in the topological matrix. Then, a sliding mode controller is designed targeting platoon's tracking performance. Moreover, Lyapunov analysis are used via Riccati inequality to find the controller's gains and guarantee internal stability and Input-to-output string stability. Finally, a non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm is utilized to find the Pareto optimal asymmetric degree regarding the overall performance of the platoon, including tracking index, fuel consumption, and acceleration standard deviation. Four different information flow topologies, including a random topology are studied. The results indicate that the proposed asymmetric sliding mode controller can ensure platoon's stability while improving its performance. The tracking ability is improved by 54.61% and 75.17%, fuel economy is improved by 0.78% and 6.34% under the Urban Road and Highway Case Study, respectively.

AB The movement state of obstacle including position, velocity, and yaw angle in the real traffic scenarios has a great impact on the path planning and decision-making of autonomous vehicle. Aiming at how to get the obstacle's movement state in the real traffic scenarios, an approach is proposed to detect and track obstacle based on three-dimensional Light Detection And Ranging (LiDAR). Firstly, the point-cloud data produced by three-dimensional LiDAR after the road segmentation is rasterized, and the reuse of useful non-obstacle cells is carried out on the basis of the rasterized point-cloud data. The proposed eight-neighbor cells clustering algorithm is used to cluster the obstacle. Based on the clustering result, static obstacle detection of multi-frame fusion is worked out by combining real-time kinematic global positioning system data and inertial navigation system data of autonomous vehicle. And we further use the static obstacle detection result to detect moving obstacle located in the travelable area. After that, an improved dynamic tracking point model and Kalman filter are applied to track moving obstacle stably, and we finally get the moving obstacle's stable movement state. A large amount of experiments on the autonomous vehicle developed by us show that the method has a high degree of reliability.

AB Automation carries paradigm-shifting potential for urban transport and has critical sustainability dimensions for the future of our cities. This article examines the diverse environmental and energy-related dimensions of automated mobility at the city level by reviewing an emerging and increasingly diversified volume of literature for road, rail, water, and air passenger transport. The multimodal nature of this investigation provides the opportunity for a novel contribution that adds value to the literature in four distinctive ways. It reviews from a sustainability angle the state of the art underpinning the transition to a paradigm of automated mobility, identifies current knowledge gaps highlighting the scarcity of non-technical research outside the autonomous car's realm, articulates future directions for research and policy development, and proposes a conceptual model that contextualizes the automation-connectivity-electrification-sharing-multimodality nexus as the only way forward for vehicle automation to reach its pro-environmental and resource-saving potential.

AB This paper deals with the real-time tracking control problem for an autonomous underwater vehicle based on an acoustic-based positioning method, i.e., the so-called GPS intelligent buoy system, which causes inevitable measurement delay. The measurement delay increases the control difficulty and degrades the tracking accuracy. Additionally, the exact modeling for an autonomous underwater vehicle is difficult due to uncertain hydrodynamic parameters. Based on these findings, a model-free control scheme is proposed. In the proposed scheme, the GPS intelligent buoy system provides the position signals without velocity measurements. Considering the measurement noise, a robust exact differentiator is used instead of the traditional numerical differentiation method to obtain the derivatives of position signals, which saves the limited actuator energy of autonomous underwater vehicles. Simulations are performed to verify the validity of the proposed control scheme. The results demonstrate that the proposed control scheme can achieve high timeliness and high tracking accuracy for autonomous underwater vehicles. Compared to the conventional model predictive control, the proposed controller requires 89.7% less average calculation time. In addition, the proposed controller outperforms the conventional proportion-differentiation controller in root-mean-square error by approximately 62.3-80.7%.

AB Autonomous underwater vehicle is an effective tool for humans to explore the ocean. It can be used for the monitoring of underwater structures and facilities, which puts forward more accurate and stable requirements for the system operation of the autonomous underwater vehicle. This paper studies the system and structural design, including the parameter identification design and control system design, of a novel autonomous underwater vehicle called "Arctic AUV". The dynamic mathematical model of the "Arctic AUV" was established, and the system parameter identification method based on the multi-sensor least squares centralized fusion algorithm was proposed. The simplification of the mathematical model of the robot was theoretically derived, and the online parameter identification and motion control were combined, so that the robot could cope with the influence of the arctic water velocity and external turbulence. Based on the hybrid control scheme of adaptive PID and predictive control, the accurate motion control of the "Arctic AUV" was realized. A prototype of "Arctic AUV" was developed, and system parameter identification experiments were carried out in indoor pool water. Hybrid adaptive and predictive control experiments were also carried out. The validity of the parametric design method in this paper was verified, and by comparative experiment, the effect of the control method proposed in this paper was better than the traditional method.

AB This paper proposes "An Integrated Self-diagnosis System (ISS) for an Autonomous Vehicle based on an Internet of Things (IoT) Gateway and Deep Learning" that collects information from the sensors of an autonomous vehicle, diagnoses itself, and the influence between its parts by using Deep Learning and informs the driver of the result. The ISS consists of three modules. The first In-Vehicle Gateway Module (In-VGM) collects the data from the in-vehicle sensors, consisting of media data like a black box, driving radar, and the control messages of the vehicle, and transfers each of the data collected through each Controller Area Network (CAN), FlexRay, and Media Oriented Systems Transport (MOST) protocols to the on-board diagnostics (OBD) or the actuators. The data collected from the in-vehicle sensors is transferred to the CAN or FlexRay protocol and the media data collected while driving is transferred to the MOST protocol. Various types of messages transferred are transformed into a destination protocol message type. The second Optimized Deep Learning Module (ODLM) creates the Training Dataset on the basis of the data collected from the in-vehicle sensors and reasons the risk of the vehicle parts and consumables and the risk of the other parts influenced by a defective part. It diagnoses the vehicle's total condition risk. The third Data Processing Module (DPM) is based on Edge Computing and has an Edge Computing based Self-diagnosis Service (ECSS) to improve the self-diagnosis speed and reduce the system overhead, while a V2X based Accident Notification Service (VANS) informs the adjacent vehicles and infrastructures of the self-diagnosis result analyzed by the OBD. This paper improves upon the simultaneous message transmission efficiency through the In-VGM by 15.25% and diminishes the learning error rate of a Neural Network algorithm through the ODLM by about 5.5%. Therefore, in addition, by transferring the self-diagnosis information and by managing the time to replace the car parts of an autonomous driving vehicle safely, this reduces loss of life and overall cost.

AB The capabilities of automated vehicles have increased over the last years, and different driving strategies have shown promising results on a variety of scenarios. However, there are still many challenges to be solved, and handling crowded roundabouts is one of them. This kind of scenario requires both safe and efficient maneuvers from the autonomous driving systems in order to maintain a proper traffic flow. This work presents a strategy to generate different speed profiles for a set of path candidates in order to obtain a merging maneuver according to current traffic scene. The proposed mechanism relies on the use of fictitious accelerations generated by leader and lag vehicles, incorporating by design comfort and safety bounds. The autonomous driving system proposed in this work was tested on realistic driving scenarios collected from public datasets and its performance was compared to human drivers on the same scenarios. The results showed in a variety of situations that the automated vehicle was capable of merging into roundabouts with tight merging gaps while maintaining both comfort and safety constraints.

AB Currently, many systems (machine vision, high resolution remote sensing, global positioning systems, and odometry techniques) have been integrated into agricultural equipment to increase the efficiency, productivity, and safety of the individual in all field activities. This study focused upon assessing a satellite-based localization solution used in straight path guidance of an autonomous vehicle developed for agricultural applications. The autonomous agricultural vehicle was designed and constructed under RHEA (Robot fleets for highly effective agriculture and forestry management) project and is part of a three-unit fleet of similar vehicles. Static tests showed that 99% of all positions are placed within a circle with a 2.9 cm radius centered at the geo-position using real-time satellite corrections (RTX). Dynamic tests between rows demonstrated a mean (N=610) of the standard deviation for real-time base station corrections (RTK) of 1.43 cm and for real-time satellite corrections (RTX) of 2.55 cm. These results demonstrate that the tractor was able to track each straight line with high degree of accuracy. The integration of a Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) with sensors (e.g., inertial sensor, altimeters, odometers, etc.) within the vehicle showed the potential of autonomous tractors for expanding agricultural applications utilizing this technology.

TI Frequency response method for terrain classification in autonomous

DE terrain classification; autonomous ground vehicles; probabilistic neural

AB Many autonomous ground vehicle (AGV) missions, such as those related to agricultural applications, search and rescue, or reconnaissance and surveillance, require the vehicle to operate in difficult outdoor terrains such as sand, mud, or snow. To ensure the safety and performance of AGVs on these terrains, a terrain-dependent driving and control system can be implemented. A key first step in implementing this system is autonomous terrain classification. It has recently been shown that the magnitude of the spatial frequency response of the terrain is an effective terrain signature. Furthermore, since the spatial frequency response is mapped by an AGV's vibration transfer function to the frequency response of the vibration measurements, the magnitude of the latter frequency responses also serve as a terrain signature. Hence, this paper focuses on terrain classification using vibration measurements. Classification is performed using a probabilistic neural network, which can be implemented online at relatively high computational speeds. The algorithm is applied experimentally to both an ATRV-Jr and an eXperimental Unmanned Vehicle (XUV) at multiple speeds. The experimental results show the efficacy of the proposed approach.

AB The introduction of autonomous vehicles (AVs) and shared autonomous vehicles (SAVs) is projected to enhance network performance and accessibility. The future share distribution of AV and SAV is not yet apparent, nor is which of these two future transport modes will become dominant. Therefore, this research deploys a simulation-based dynamic traffic assignment using Visum software to investigate the impact of varying the share distribution of AVs and SAVs on Budapest's network performance and consumer surplus in three projected future traffic scenarios for the years 2030 and 2050 compared to the Base scenario for 2020. The three future scenarios are presented and characterized by different penetration rates of AVs and SAVs to reflect the uncertainty in the market share of these future cars as follows: Mix-Traffic scenario for 2030, and AV-Focused and SAV-Focused scenarios for 2050. The results revealed that the emergence of AVs and SAVs would improve the overall network performance, and better performance was observed with increasing the share distribution of SAVs. Similarly, the consumer surplus increased in all future scenarios, especially with increasing the share distribution of AVs. Consequently, the advent of AVs and SAVs will improve traffic performance and increase consumer surplus, benefiting road users and authorities.

AB Due to the need for a higher safety level, autonomous marine surface vehicles have been increasingly applied for various applications in recent years. Nonlinear model predictive control (NMPC) has increasingly become a more preferred control technique. However, it has still limited use in industry due to its high computational load which is mainly caused by its complex Newton numerical method and Hessian matrix evaluations. In this study, we have developed a robust multistage NMPC algorithm to accurately control an autonomous marine surface vehicle when model uncertainties or environmental disturbances are present. The robust multistage NMPC is compared with the standard NMPC and perfect information NMPC. Advanced symbolic computation approach has been used to implement all three NMPC programs, where the complex gradient vector, Hessian matrix, and nonlinear dynamic optimization problem are derived analytically and evaluated with machine accuracy. The simulation results reveal that the robust multistage NMPC approach is successfully able to better control an autonomous marine surface vehicle than the standard NMPC method, and impressively is almost as good as the perfect information NMPC when model uncertainties or environmental disturbances are present. Furthermore, it has been demonstrated that the robust NMPC is also very effective for a large scaled-up prototype system.

AB The advent of autonomous vehicles brings major changes in the transportation systems influencing the infrastructure design, the network performance, as well as driving functions and habits. The penetration rate of this new technology highly depends on the acceptance of the automated driving services and functions, as well as on their impacts on various traffic, user oriented and environmental aspects. This research aims to present a methodological framework aiming to facilitate the modelling of the behaviour of new AV driving systems and their impacts on traffic, safety and environment. This framework introduces a stepwise approach, which will be leveraged by stakeholders in order to evaluate the new technology and its components at the design or implementation phase in order to increase acceptance and favor the adoption of the new technology. The proposed framework consists of four sequential steps: i. conceptual design, ii. data collection, processing and mining, iii. modelling and iv. autonomous vehicles impact assessment. The connection between these steps is illustrated and various Key Performance Indicators are specified for each impact area. The paper ends with highlighting some conceptual and modeling challenges that may critically affect the study of acceptance of autonomous vehicles in future mobility scenarios.

AB We propose a log analysis framework for test driving of autonomous vehicles. The log of a vehicle is a fundamental source to detect and analyze events during driving. A set of dumped logs are, however, usually mixed and fragmented since they are generated concurrently by a number of modules such as sensors, actuators and programs. This makes it hard to analyze them to discover latent errors that could occur due to complex chain reactions among those modules. Our framework provides a logging architecture based on formal specifications, which hierarchically organizes them to find out a priori relationships between them. Then, algorithmic or implementation errors can be detected by examining a posteriori relationships. However, a test in a situation of certain parameters, so called an oracle test, does not necessarily trigger latent violations of the relationships. In our framework, this is remedied by adopting metamorphic testing to quantitatively verify the formal specification. As a working proof, we define three metamorphic relations critical for testing autonomous vehicles and verify them in a quantitative manner based on our logging system.

AB With rapid advances in the field of autonomous vehicles (AVs), the ways in which human-vehicle interaction (HVI) will take place inside the vehicle have attracted major interest and, as a result, intelligent interiors are being explored to improve the user experience, acceptance, and trust. This is also fueled by parallel research in areas such as perception and control of robots, safe human-robot interaction, wearable systems, and the underpinning flexible/printed electronics technologies. Some of these are being routed to AVs. Growing number of network of sensors are being integrated into the vehicles for multimodal interaction to draw correct inferences of the communicative cues from the user and to vary the interaction dynamics depending on the cognitive state of the user and contextual driving scenario. In response to this growing trend, this timely article presents a comprehensive review of the technologies that are being used or developed to perceive user's intentions for natural and intuitive in-vehicle interaction. The challenges that are needed to be overcome to attain truly interactive AVs and their potential solutions are discussed along with various new avenues for future research.

AB This paper investigates the cyber-security problem for autonomous vehicles under sensor attacks. In particular, a model-based framework is proposed which can detect sensor attacks and identify their sources in order to achieve the secure localization of self-driving vehicles. To ensure robustness of the vehicle against cyber-attacks, sensor redundancy is introduced, that is to deploy multiple sensors, each of which provides real-time pose observations of the vehicle. A bank of attack detectors is developed to capture anomalies in each sensor measurement, which is a combination of an extended Kalman filter (EKF) and a cumulative sum (CUSUM) discriminator. EKFs are employed to estimate the vehicle position and orientation recursively, while each CUSUM discriminator is designed to analyze the residual generated by its combined EKF to detect the possible deviation of the sensor measurement from the expected pose derived according to the mathematical model of the vehicle. To monitor the inconsistency amongst multiple sensor measurements, an auxiliary detector is introduced which fuses observations from multiple sensors. Based on the results of all the detectors, a rule-based isolation scheme is developed to identify the source anomalous sensor. The effectiveness of our proposed framework has been demonstrated on real vehicle data.

AB Interacting with surrounding road users is a key feature of autonomous vehicles and is critical for their intelligence testing. Existing interaction modalities in autonomous vehicle simulation and testing are not sufficiently smart, and they barely reflect human-like behaviors in real-world driving scenarios. Therefore, a novel hierarchical game-theoretical framework is presented to represent naturalistic multimodal interactions among road users during simulation and testing, which is subsequently validated by the Turing test. Given that human drivers have no access to the complete information of the surrounding road users, the Bayesian game theory is used to model the decision-making process. Next, a probing behavior is generated by the proposed game-theoretic model, and is further applied to control the vehicle via the Markov chain. The proposed method is tested through a series of experiments and compared with existing approaches. In addition, Turing tests are conducted to quantify the human-likeness of the proposed algorithm. The experimental results show that the proposed Bayesian game-theoretic framework can effectively generate representative scenes of human-like decision-making during autonomous vehicle interactions, demonstrating its feasibility and effectiveness.

AB With the rapid advancement of connected and autonomous vehicles (CAV) in terms of testing and usage, the implementation of the autonomous interchange in the real world has become more realistic than before. Since the beginning of the last decade, the concept of autonomous intersection has been developed with slightly different techniques. This paper introduces a next-generation interchange control algorithm (NIC) that deals with service interchange terminals for the CAV with the ability to adjust the dimensions and geometric designs. It proposes six different geometric designs that have been modeled in a simulation software package (VISSIM) to employ the NIC algorithm. The system depicted a real-world scenario of an interchange with a slight modification on the geometric design to provide smoother entry to the interchange terminal. The analysis of the proposed designs in terms of throughput, capacity, delay, and volume-to-capacity (V/C) ratio indicated different performance measurements based on the analyzed traffic movements. Tight turn with one left dedicated turn provided the highest performance, while wide turn with two left shared turns indicated the lowest performance. Both NIC designs demonstrated significantly higher throughputs and significantly lower delays compared to a current traffic signal system. By applying the NIC with the existence of the CAV, the operation of highway interchange can be significantly improved.

AB The current world faces a considerable traffic rate on roads due to the increase in various types of vehicles. It caused emergency vehicles to delay and increasing the patients' health risk factor. Internet of vehicle-based artificial neural network (IoV-ANN) has been proposed for effective health autonomous system in medical things. The proposed IoV-ANN provides a secure network to monitor and track the vehicle's motion using the global positioning system. It consists of an autonomous system which is enabled with an artificial neural network (ANN). ANN model has three layers. First layers collect the data using IoV sensors. Second or hidden layers process the sensor data, predict the road's traffic condition and reroute the emergency vehicle to an exact route. IoV-ANN helps to reduce road congestion in this article to enhance the timely functioning of an emergency vehicle. ANN categorizes the congestion networks of traffic. Traffic restrictions such as changing the queue gap in the road signals and the alternative roads are altered automatically due to congestion. It allows the government to develop ideas for alternate routes to enhance traffic control. The output layer gives commands to the driver autonomously. The simulation analysis of the proposed method proved that the system could work independently. The IoV-ANN achieves the highest performance rate of (97.89%), with a reduced error rate (9.12%) traffic congestion rate (10.31%), travel period (32 s), vehicle detection rate (93.61%), classification accuracy (95.02%), MAPE (8.4%), throughput rate (93.50%) when compared to other popular methods.

AB The planning of semi-autonomous vehicles in traffic scenarios is a relatively new problem that contributes towards the goal of making road travel by vehicles free of human drivers. An algorithm needs to ensure optimal real time planning of multiple vehicles (moving in either direction along a road), in the presence of a complex obstacle network. Unlike other approaches, here we assume that speed lanes are not present and that different lanes do not need to be maintained for inbound and outbound traffic. Our basic hypothesis is to carry forward the planning task to ensure that a sufficient distance is maintained by each vehicle from all other vehicles, obstacles and road boundaries. We present here a 4-layer planning algorithm that consists of road selection (for selecting the individual roads of traversal to reach the goal), pathway selection (a strategy to avoid and/or overtake obstacles, road diversions and other blockages), pathway distribution (to select the position of a vehicle at every instance of time in a pathway), and trajectory generation (for generating a curve, smooth enough, to allow for the maximum possible speed). Cooperation between vehicles is handled separately at the different levels, the aim being to maximize the separation between vehicles. Simulated results exhibit behaviours of smooth, efficient and safe driving of vehicles in multiple scenarios; along with typical vehicle behaviours including following and overtaking.

   FRAMEWORK
AB Collision avoidance is one of the most important requirements for autonomous vehicles, particularly in complex and congested traffic scenarios where trajectories have little safety redundancy. However, simultaneously reaching the required accuracy and universal feasibility for different collision-avoidance behaviours is difficult due to the multi-state coupled motion of vehicles. To achieve the maximum traversability and ensure the safety of autonomous vehicles in any complex scenarios, we propose a quasi-critical collision-avoidance strategy based on a newly developed algorithm: the exclusive area of-relative-velocity vector. This strategy first involves the construction of an exclusive area-of-velocity vector for each object vehicle to extract its position relative to the subject vehicle. In this procedure, to establish a subject-motion-decoupled scenario, projective transformation is applied to regularise the moving elliptical contour of the subject vehicle as a settled circle while retaining all positional relationships between the subject and object vehicles using the invariants. Subsequently, a group of escaping conditions for this exclusive area are established to express this quasi-critical collision-avoidance strategy explicitly and mathematically. The ultimate ability to escape from such an area is determined through theoretical derivations and experiments according to vehicle dynamics. In terms of real scenario data, a set of escaping equations is established to calculate the escaping conditions subject to the current state and the ultimate motion ability. Via scenario verifications, this strategy is shown to represent the safety boundary accurately and ensure quasi-critical collision-avoidance conditions under complex scenarios. (c) 2022 Elsevier B.V.

AB Objective The objective of this study was to determine the different effects of the arrow-pointing augmented reality head-up display (AR-HUD) interface, virtual shadow AR-HUD interface, and non-AR-HUD interface on autonomous vehicle takeover efficiency and driver eye movement characteristics in different driving scenarios. Methods Thirty-six participants were selected to carry out a simulated driving experiment, and the eye movement index and takeover time were analyzed. Results The arrow pointing AR-HUD interface and the virtual shadow AR-HUD interface could effectively reduce the driver's visual distraction, improve the efficiency of obtaining visual information, reduce the number of times the driver's eyes leave the road, and improve the efficiency of the takeover compared with the non-AR-HUD interface, but there was no significant difference in eye movement indexes between the arrow pointing AR-HUD interface and the more eye-catching virtual shadow AR-HUD interface. When specific scenarios were considered, it was found that in the scenario of emergency braking of the vehicle in front, the arrow pointing AR-HUD interface and the virtual shadow AR-HUD interface had more advantages in takeover efficiency than the non-AR-HUD interface. However, in the scenarios of a rear vehicle overtaking the vehicle ahead and non-motor vehicles running red lights, there was no significant difference in takeover efficiency. For the non-motor vehicle invading the line, emergency U-turn of the vehicle in front, and pedestrian crossing scenarios, the virtual shadow AR-HUD interface had the highest takeover efficiency. Conclusions These research results can help improve the active safety of autonomous vehicle AR-HUD interfaces.

AB Purpose: This study aims to show the necessity of hardware-free simulation tools for autonomous vehicle design with a manageable production process in terms of time and hardware costs. To this end, a real-time simulation environment architecture is presented, including a set of required components and the feasibility of the proposed architecture is examined through the experiments conducted.Theory and Methods: To investigate the feasibility of the proposed real-time simulation architecture, an autonomous driving model, including lane tracking and traffic sign detection is introduced. Canny edge detection algorithm and different YOLO and R-CNN versions are deployed for lane tracking and traffic sign detection, respectively. The simulation architecture is tested with the components of the proposed autonomous driving model.Results: The proposed simulation architecture is evaluated on the accuracy rate of the object detection algorithm deployed for each simulation run. For this purpose, YOLO-v3, YOLO-v3 tiny, YOLO-v4, YOLO-v4 tiny, Fast R-CNN, Faster R-CNN, and Mask R-CNN algorithms are considered through the experiments. A street traffic sign dataset for Turkey is utilized for model training. According to the evaluation results, YOLOv4 is noted as the model that produces the highest accuracy rate with 95% throughout the evaluation.Conclusion: The evaluation results obtained from the simulation environment can be claimed as successful enough to use the proposed simulation architecture with different autonomous driving models for an autonomous vehicle design process without any real-world hardware cost.

AB In the path tracking control of intelligent vehicles, the traditional linear control method is prone to high tracking errors for uncertain parameters of the steering transmission system and road conditions. Therefore, considering the mechanical friction in the dual-motor autonomous steering system and the nonlinearity of tires, this paper proposes a path tracking control strategy of intelligent vehicles for the dual-motor autonomous steering system that considers nonlinear characteristics. First, a dual-motor autonomous steering system considering mechanical friction and the variation of tire cornering stiffness under different tire-road friction coefficients was established based on the structure of an autonomous steering system. Second, a tire-road friction coefficient estimator was designed based on a PSO-LSTM neural network. The tire cornering stiffness under different tire-road friction coefficients was estimated through the recursive least-square algorithm. Then, the control strategy of the dual-motor autonomous steering system was designed by combining the LQR path tracking controller with the adaptive sliding mode control strategy based on field-oriented control. Here, mechanical friction and the variation of tire cornering stiffness were considered. Finally, simulation and HiL tests validated the method proposed in this paper. The results show that the proposed control strategy significantly improves the tracking accuracy and performance of the dual-motor autonomous steering system for intelligent vehicles.

AB Aiming at the characteristics of connected and autonomous vehicle (CAV) which makes autonomous decision by perceiving the surrounding environment, a safe potential field model including lane marking potential field, road boundary potential field and vehicle potential field is established to describe the safe risk of CAV in the process of driving. In the process of building the safe potential field model, aiming at the defect that the existing vehicle potential field function has independent gravitational and repulsive expressions, a unified function of vehicle potential field based on Lennard-Jones potential is established by referring to the relationship of intermolecular interaction, and the parameter of vehicle's acceleration is considered into the vehicle potential field model. The statistical analysis of the parameter reveals that the change of acceleration directly affects the distribution of vehicle potential field and reflect the dynamic trend of vehicle's safe potential field under different driving states. Then, the safe potential field is applied to the car-following behavior of CAV, and the model's parameters are calibrated by Shanghai natural driving dataset; Finally, compared with the existing classic IDM and VTH models, the simulation results show that: the model still has smoother response curves in the three car-following scenarios designed to improve the safety and efficiency, which verifies the effectiveness of the model. The research results can lay a theoretical foundation for decision making behavior of safe driving, and also provide a unique way for the research of CAVs' safe technology. (C) 2021 Elsevier B.V.

AB Autonomous vehicles and shared mobility represent two fields of strong innovation in transportation research, and Shared Autonomous Vehicle (SAV) services have been studied as a new promising mobility system. Such services offer a strong potential especially when integrated with the Public Transport (PT) system, increasing its attractiveness by providing first- and last-mile connections to low-demand areas. This paper performs a systematic review on a niche of SAV-related literature, selecting articles that address PT-SAV integrations, the issue of how SAVs should be implemented together with already existing transit systems to enhance collective mobility. Papers have been classified firstly according to the methodological and modelling approaches used by researchers, and then according to the different operational schemes with which SAV systems can be deployed. Common findings have been reported and commented on, identifying the lack of articles aimed at determining the most suitable SAV service typology for specific contexts and network configuration. Many authors indicate that if SAVs are operated as feeder modes to mass transit, they might improve public transport connectivity. However, further research is needed to explore the efficacy of SAV systems as an opportunity to address first/last-mile PT planning issues.

AB Autonomous vehicles offer many potential benefits; however, this expansion of cyber-physical systems also introduces a new potential vulnerability through cybersecurity threats. It is there-fore important to understand the role vehicle occupants can play in preventing and responding to cyberattacks. The objective of this study is to (1) evaluate drivers' responses to unexpected cyberattacks, and (2) evaluate how cybersecurity knowledge affects situation awareness (SA) during cyberattacks on automated driving. A driving simulator study with 20 participants was conducted to measure drivers' performance during unexpected cyberattacks on a SAE Level 2 partially-autonomous vehicle and the infrastructure in the driving environment. Each participant experienced four driving scenarios, each scenario with a different cyberattack. Two cyberattacks were directly on the vehicle and two were on the infrastructure. Situation Awareness Global Assessment Technique (SAGAT) was used to measure participants' situation awareness during the drives and at the time of the cyberattacks. Participant takeover responses to the cyberattacks were collected through the driving simulator. Participants also completed a cybersecurity knowledge survey at the end of the experiment to assess their previous overall cyber awareness and expe-rience with autonomous vehicles. Most of the participants recognized the cyberattacks, however only about half of the participants chose to takeover control of the vehicle during the attacks, and in one attack no one overtook the automation. Results from ANOVAs showed significantly higher SA for participants with greater familiarity with cybersecurity terms and vehicle-to-everything technology. In addition, SA scores were significantly higher for participants who believed secu-rity systems (i.e., firewall, encryption) are important and for those who felt protected against cybercrimes. The present results suggest that increased cybersecurity knowledge can cause a high level of situation awareness during automated driving, which can help drivers to control unex-pected driving situations due to cybersecurity attacks.

AB Road management systems are to improve in terms of integrity, mobility, sustainability, and safety by the adoption of artificial intelligence and Internet of Things services. This article introduces the concept of covert attacks on autonomous vehicles which can jeopardize the safety of passengers. Covert attacks are designed to manipulate outputs of cyber physical systems through network channels in a way that while the changes are not easily perceptible by human beings, systems are negatively affected in the long run. We argue that future smart vehicles are vulnerable to viruses which can use adversarial learning methods to adapt themselves to hosts and remain stealth for a long period. As a case study, we design a covert attack on the lane keeping system of autonomous vehicles. In the scenario, an intelligent adversary manipulates sensor readings (lane position, curvature, etc.) in order to deceive the controller to drive the vehicle closer to the boundaries. The virus/attacker interactively learns the host vehicle behaviors in terms of lateral deviation and maneuverability and tries to increase the errors to the extent that remains unnoticeable to the driver. This process is carried out through actor-critic learning based on the Newton--Raphson method. We additionally design an intrusion detection system for such covert attacks. We use the GPS data and offline maps to reconstruct road curves and match them against readings. A simulation testbed is developed based on the map of Nurburgring-Grand Prix track to evaluate our models. Results confirm the validity and effectiveness of the proposed models.

AB In this paper, we quantify the impacts of model fidelity on the effectiveness of trajectory optimization for autonomous vehicles when driving at the limits of friction through experiments with a full-size vehicle. Models ranging from a double-track model with lateral and longitudinal load transfer dynamics to a simple point-mass model are used in combination with direct numerical optimization to generate optimal trajectories subject to the limits imposed by each model. The effectiveness of each model for trajectory planning is evaluated by testing the trajectories on an automated vehicle across friction conditions ranging from ice to dry asphalt. Comparisons between the outright performance of the car and the car's ability to track the optimal trajectory are made across the various models. The tests reveal that the advantage of more complex models is less that they better predict the vehicle's behavior, but that they provide a more nuanced view of the vehicle's limits and guidance on the proper coordination of the various actuators on the vehicle in order to make most efficient use of the available tire friction.

AB Compared with the traditional travel mode, the increasingly mature autonomous driving and shared travel technologies can lead to a higher driving utilization rate and lower car parc; however, at the same time, they will bring unknown impacts to the trans-energy system. As a new generation of vehicles, the behavior of electric vehicles will also be affected. This paper describes and models the behavior of electric vehicle group in the autonomous driving-shared travel mode in detail, and uses the multi-agent technology to establish a large-scale electric vehicle group simulation model. This model fully considers the constraints of traffic network and charging station and the influence of fuel vehicles, which can simulate the actual scene well and be used to study the charging behavior of electric vehicle group. Finally, the simulation model is used to obtain the charging load curve of the electric vehicle group under the new travel mode and analyze the influence of travel upgrade and network topology on charging load.

AB In this paper, the model-matching control in the longitudinal autonomous driving system is investigated by vehicle dynamics simulation, which contains nonlinear subcomponents and simplified subcomponents. The design of the robust model-matching controller is performed by the characteristics of the 2 degrees of freedom controller, which is composed of the feedforward compensator and the feedback compensator. It makes the characteristics of tractive and brake force to be equivalent to the specific transfer function, which is suggested as the reference model. Mathematical models of vehicle dynamic analysis including the model-matching control are constructed for computer simulation. Then, simple examples on open-loop simulation without any controller and closed loop simulation with the model-matching controller are applied to check the validity of the robust controller. As the practical example, the autonomous driving system in the longitudinal direction is adopted. It is proved that the model-matching control is effective and adequate to the disturbances and the perturbations, which are shown in the responses of the change of a vehicle mass and a road gradient.

AB Environmental perception is one of the key technologies to realize autonomous vehicles. Autonomous vehicles are often equipped with multiple sensors to form a multi-source environmental perception system. Those sensors are very sensitive to light or background conditions, which will introduce a variety of global and local fault signals that bring great safety risks to autonomous driving system during long-term running. In this paper, a real-time data fusion network with fault diagnosis and fault tolerance mechanism is designed. By introducing prior features to realize the lightweight network, the features of the input data can be extracted in real time. A new sensor reliability evaluation method is proposed by calculating the global and local confidence of sensors. Through the temporal and spatial correlation between sensor data, the sensor redundancy is utilized to diagnose the local and global confidence level of sensor data in real time, eliminate the fault data, and ensure the accuracy and reliability of data fusion. Experiments show that the network achieves state-of-the-art results in speed and accuracy, and can accurately detect the location of the target when some sensors are out of focus or out of order. The fusion framework proposed in this paper is proved to be effective for intelligent vehicles in terms of real-time performance and reliability.

AB Autonomous road vehicles are increasingly becoming more important and there are several techniques and sensors that are being applied for vehicle control. This paper presents an alternative system for maintaining the position of autonomous vehicles without adding additional elements to the standard sensor architecture, by using a 3D laser scanner for continuously detecting a reference element in situations in which the GNSS receiver fails or provides accuracy below the required level. Considering that the guidance variables are more accurately estimated when dealing with reference points in front of and behind the vehicle, an algorithm based on vehicle dynamics mathematical model is proposed to extend the detected points in cases where the sensor is placed at the front of the vehicle. The algorithm has been tested when driving along a lane delimited by New Jersey barriers at both sides and the results show a correct behaviour. The system is capable of estimating the reference element behind the vehicle with sufficient accuracy when the laser scanner is placed at the front of it, so the robustness of the control input variables (lateral and angular errors) estimation is improved making it unnecessary to place the sensor on the vehicle roof or to introduce additional sensors.

AB With the development and maturity of autonomous driving technology, parcel terminal distribution has taken the lead as an application scenario for unmanned delivery vehicles that autonomously perform the task of delivering packages between distribution centres and customers. The traditional terminal delivery model faces challenges such as high costs, low efficiency and time conflicts between delivery and customer convenience. Considering the multiple demands of parcels terminal delivery, this paper proposes a space-time route planning model coordinated with task assignment for autonomous delivery vehicle fleet with the objective of minimizing the total transportation distance and designs a route planning with task assignment algorithm. Firstly, a method of period division and the concept of reliable service time are put forward and a task integration approach is introduced. Then, the task assignment model based on task network and the shortest space-time route planning model are built. According to the characteristics of the model, a route planning with task assignment algorithm by improving the Tabu Search algorithm is designed to gain the best delivery space-time routes of autonomous delivery vehicle fleet. Simulation results show that the approach system of space-time route planning designed in this paper can effectively accomplish task assignment and route planning simultaneously.

SO JOURNAL OF ADVANCED TRANSPORTATION

AB A signal design problem is studied for efficiently managing autonomous vehicles (AVs) and regular vehicles (RVs) simultaneously in transportation networks. AVs and RVs move on separate lanes and two types of vehicles share the green times at the same intersections. The signal design problem is formulated as a bilevel program. The lower-level model describes a mixed equilibrium where autonomous vehicles follow the Cournot-Nash (CN) principle and RVs follow the user equilibrium (UE) principle. In the upper-level model, signal timings are optimized at signalized intersections to allocate appropriate green times to both autonomous and RVs to minimize system travel cost. The sensitivity analysis based method is used to solve the bilevel optimization model. Various signal control strategies are evaluated through numerical examples and some insightful findings are obtained. It was found that the number of phases at intersections should be reduced for the optimal control of the AVs and RVs in the mixed networks. More importantly, incorporating AVs into the transportation network would improve the system performance due to the value of AV technologies in reducing random delays at intersections. Meanwhile, travelers prefer to choose AVs when the networks turn to be congested.

ID SIMULATION; BERLIN
AB Fleets of shared Autonomous Vehicles (AVs) could replace private cars by providing a taxi-like service but at a cost similar to driving a private car. On the one hand, large Autonomous Taxi (AT) fleets may result in increased road capacity and lower demand for parking spaces. On the other hand, an increase in vehicle trips is very likely, as travelling becomes more convenient and affordable, and additionally, ATs need to drive unoccupied between requests. This study evaluates the impact of a city-wide introduction of ATs on traffic congestion. The analysis is based on a multi-agent transport simulation (MATSim) of Berlin (Germany) and the neighbouring Brandenburg area. The central focus is on precise simulation of both real-time AT operation and mixed autonomous/conventional vehicle traffic flow Different ratios of replacing private car trips with AT trips are used to estimate the possible effects at different stages of introducing such services. The obtained results suggest that large fleets operating in cities may have a positive effect on traffic if road capacity increases according to current predictions. ATs will practically eliminate traffic congestion, even in the city centre, despite the increase in traffic volume. However, given no flow capacity improvement, such services cannot be introduced on a large scale, since the induced additional traffic volume will intensify today's congestion.

AB With their prospect for causing both novel and known forms of damage, harm and injury, the issue of responsibility has been a recurring theme in the debate concerning autonomous vehicles. Yet, the discussion of responsibility has obscured the finer details both between the underlying concepts of responsibility, and their application to the interaction between human beings and artificial decision-making entities. By developing meaningful distinctions and examining their ramifications, this article contributes to this debate by refining the underlying concepts that together inform the idea of responsibility. Two different approaches are offered to the question of responsibility and autonomous vehicles: targeting and risk distribution. The article then introduces a thought experiment which situates autonomous vehicles within the context of crash optimisation impulses and coordinated or networked decision-making. It argues that guiding ethical frameworks overlook compound or aggregated effects which may arise, and which can lead to subtle forms of structural discrimination. Insofar as such effects remain unrecognised by the legal systems relied upon to remedy them, the potential for societal inequalities is increased and entrenched, situations of injustice and impunity may be unwittingly maintained. This second set of concerns may represent a hitherto overlooked type of responsibility gap arising from inadequate accountability processes capable of challenging systemic risk displacement.

AB Industrial transport system refers to the movement of goods, raw materials, and finished products within and between industrial facilities such as factories, warehouses, and distribution centers. It includes a variety of modes of transport such as trucks, forklifts, conveyor belts, and automated guided vehicles (AGVs). Context-aware route service management refers to system that can dynamically manage and optimize the routes taken by vehicles in transportation system based on contextual information. Our proposed framework for industrial transport systems and smart intelligent autonomous vehicles utilizes cluster-based context-aware routing (CCAR), which includes several significant contributions. Firstly, modified elephant herding optimization (MEHO) algorithm is used to efficiently group autonomous vehicles for routing. Secondly, an improved gravitational search (IGS) algorithm is used for cluster head (CH) selection responsible for transferring context information between vehicles (V2V). Thirdly, a deep hybrid multi-graph neural network (DHMG-NN) is designed for optimal neighboring roadside unit (RSU) node selection through different design constraints to ensure data dissemination between vehicles and infrastructure (V2I). Finally, we validate the effectiveness of our CCAR framework using various simulation scenarios. Our framework achieves a reduction of up to 78% in computation time and an improvement of up to 25% in customer satisfaction ratio and 15% higher than the overall performance ratio compared to the existing frameworks.
   Working process of proposed framework for industrial transport systems and smart intelligent autonomous vehicles utilize CCAR, which consist set of process such as clustering, CH selection, and data dissemination. CCAR framework aims to improve the efficiency, reliability, and energy consumption of industrial transport systems and smart intelligent autonomous vehicles. Selection provides a comprehensive understanding of the working process of the proposed methodology, including the mathematical models used to implement the CCAR framework.image

AB Video description is one of the most challenging task in the combined domain of computer vision and natural language processing. Captions for various open and constrained domain videos have been generated in the recent past but descriptions for driving dashcam videos have never been explored to the best of our knowledge. With the aim to explore dashcam video description generation for autonomous driving, this study presents DeepRide: a large-scale dashcam driving video description dataset for location-aware dense video description generation. The human-described dataset comprises visual scenes and actions with diverse weather, people, objects, and geographical paradigms. It bridges the autonomous driving domain with video description by textual description generation of the visual information as seen by a dashcam. We describe 16,000 videos (40 seconds each) in English employing 2,700 man-hours by two highly qualified teams with domain knowledge. The descriptions consist of eight to ten sentences covering each dashcam video's global features and event features in 60 to 90 words. The dataset consists of more than 130K sentences, totaling approximately one million words. We evaluate the dataset by employing location aware vision-language recurrent transformer framework to elaborate on the efficacy and significance of the visio-linguistics research for autonomous vehicles. We provided base line results to evaluate the dataset by employing three existing state-of-the-art recurrent models. The memory augmented transformer performed superior due to its highly summarized memory state for visual information and the sentence history while generating the trip description. Our proposed dataset opens a new dimension of diverse and exciting applications, such as self-driving vehicle reporting, driver and vehicle safety, inter-vehicle road intelligence sharing, and travel occurrence reports.

The control architecture consists of three layers: team control, vehicle supervision and maneuver control. It is shown that the controller implementation is consistent with the system specification on the desired team behaviour. Computer simulations with accurate models of autonomous underwater vehicles illustrate the overall approach in the co-ordinated search for the minimum of a scalar field.

AB In mixed traffic with autonomous vehicles, the relationship between speed and lane-changing behavior is an important basis for mixed traffic control. In this study, we use empirical, simulation, and data-driven methods to study the relationship between speed and lane change rates in mixed traffic under different autonomous vehicle penetration rates. We use the empirical data to establish the corresponding road simulation models. Based on the simulation model, the traffic flow simulation experiments under the conditions of 10%, 20%, 30%, 40%, 50%, 60%, 70%, 80%, and 90% penetration rate of autonomous vehicles were carried out. The analysis of the simulation results found that: (1) the penetration of autonomous vehicles into the road has a positive impact on the lanes far away from the entrance and exit, while the impact on the lanes closer to the entrance and exit is not obvious. (2) Lane-changing behavior has effectively decreased with the penetration of autonomous vehicles, but it is not obvious when the penetration rate exceeds 10%, and there is no significant drop in the lane connecting the entrance and exit. (3) There is a linear relationship between speed and lane-changing rate. Under different penetration rates, the data-driven analysis is used to perform multiple linear regressions, and the regression formula fits are all above 0.7. Based on the above findings, the linear formula of the fitting is proposed, and the value interval of the parameters in different states is given as well. Due to the small changes in the parameter values under different permeability conditions, the model has a certain degree of stability. The speed-lane change rate model proposed in this study can better describe the relationship between the speed of the ring-shaped urban expressway and the lane-changing behavior in the mixed traffic environment with the larger traffic flow.

AB Architecture design is one of the most important problems for an intelligent system. In this paper, a practical framework of hardware and software is proposed to reveal the external configuration and internal mechanism of an autonomous vehicle-a typical intelligent system. The main contributions of this paper are as follows. First, we compare the advantages and disadvantages of three typical sensor plans and introduce a general autopilot for a vehicle. Second, we introduce a software architecture for an autonomous vehicle. The perception and planning performances are improved with the help of two inner loops of simultaneous localization and mapping. An algorithm to enlarge the detection range of the sensors is proposed by adding an inner loop to the perception system. A practical feedback to restrain mutations of two adjacent planning periods is also realized by the other inner loop. Third, a cross-platform virtual server (named project cocktail) for data transmission and exchange is presented in detail. Through comparisons with the robot operating system, the performance of project cocktail is proven to be considerably better in terms of transmission delay and throughput. Finally, a report on an autonomous driving test implemented using the proposed architecture is presented, which shows the effectiveness, flexibility, stability, and low-cost of the overall autonomous driving system.

AB Path planning is a fundamental problem in the aspect of autonomous driving. A-star (A*) algorithm is a heuristic algorithm for path planning. However, there are two problems need to be solved in the traditional A-star algorithm: firstly, the tracking error caused by vehicle speed and vehicle size are not considered in path planning; secondly, the kinematics constraints of the vehicle itself and the smoothness of the path in the actual driving process are not considered. Therefore, this paper proposes an improved A-star algorithm to address the above deficiencies. By designing the collision cost heuristic function based on the position of obstacles, the vehicle contour and speed are considered and the vehicle safety is improved by setting a safe space around the vehicle, and establishing a steering cost heuristic function based on the control of heading angle difference, the vehicle dynamics constraints are satisfied, so as to improve the feasibility of path planning. The experimental results show that the improved A-star algorithm can avoid vehicle contours collision at different speeds and output a smoother path, and effectively generate higher quality path.

AB There is significant interest in harvesting ocean energy for powering the autonomous vehicles that can conduct surveillance for long durations. In this paper, we analyze the applicability of solar cells as a power source for medusa-inspired biomimetic vehicles. Since these vehicles will be operating under ocean waters and may need to dive at various depths, a systematic investigation was conducted to determine the variation of output power as a function of depth and salinity levels. We modeled solar energy harvested by flexible amorphous solar cell coated jellyfish vehicles by considering the variables bell diameter, turbidity, depth, and fineness ratio. Low fineness ratio shapes were found to be better for solar energy powered vehicles. Study of three representative species, Aurelia aurita (AA), Mastigias sp., and Cyanea capillata indicates that harvested power was proportional to bell diameter. Optimum power can be harvested by tilting the vehicle axis to face refracted sunrays. Depending on a swimming pattern, power harvested in charging mode and in propulsion mode could vary significantly. The model indicates that, under some circumstances, amorphous silicon solar cell may be a cost-effective way to power autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) operating in shallow-water conditions with large lateral travel distances.

AB This paper proposes a flexible multi-layer and multi-controller architecture for a dynamic navigation in the formation of a group of autonomous vehicles in constrained environments. The main objectives of this architecture are to ensure reliable navigation in the formation of the vehicles and to guarantee the stable and smooth reconfiguration of the fleet shape. A precise review and analysis of the main used leader- follower modeling for the control of a fleet of autonomous vehicles is conducted. After highlighting their advantages and drawbacks, an appropriate leader-follower approach based on deformable shape is proposed. At each sample time, the leader's state (pose and velocity), defined as the main dynamic target, is taken as a reference to guide the overall fleet dynamic. In addition, an analytic formulation of the maximum linear and angular velocities of the leader is proposed in order to guarantee the asymptotic stability of the navigation in formation as well as the fleet reconfiguration phases (between different formation shapes). An important focus of this paper corresponds to the proposition of a reliable strategy for the fleet reconfiguration, according to the environmental context (when, for instance, obstacles are detected). The safety of the fleet is formally demonstrated using an appropriate reconfiguration matrix, which takes into account the vehicles' set-points inter-distances to avoid any inter-vehicles collisions. In addition, an estimation of the formation parameters, according to an authorized minimum distance between the vehicles, is given. Simulations and experiments in different scenarios are performed to demonstrate the flexibility, reliability, and efficiency of the proposed dynamic navigation of a fleet of vehicles in formation.

AB This paper investigates the finite-time sliding mode trajectory tracking control problem for the autonomous surface vehicle (ASV). A prescribed performance function is introduced to improve the transient and steady-state tracking performance simultaneously. Two PID-type sliding surfaces are constructed such that the closed-loop system can reach the sliding surface with good performance, on which the developed sliding mode controllers can make the system error go to zero. In order to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithms, an application example of the surface vehicle CyberShip II is borrowed from Skjetne et al., (2005), for which detailed comparisons are made between finite-time second-order sliding mode control (2-SMC) and finite-time first-order sliding mode control (1-SMC). A large number of simulations show that the proposed 2-SMC algorithm can achieve better control accuracy in comparison with 1-SMC algorithm and existing results.

AB Accurate and consistent vulnerable road user detection remains one of the most challenging perception tasks for autonomous vehicles. One of the most complex outstanding issues is partial occlusion, where a sensor has only a partial view of the target object due to a foreground object that partially obscures the target. A review of occlusion detection and handling solutions for the automotive environment is presented by this research. This article first discusses object detection by the human visual system, provides an overview of occlusion reasoning in computer vision, presents a summary of occlusion handling strategies in pedestrian, vehicle and object detection applications in the automotive environment. A selection of the remaining challenges to achieving the required level of object detection performance for safe autonomous driving are also discussed.

AB Blockchain (BC) technologies and cutting-edge artificial intelligence (AI) have the capability of reforming transport systems' sustainability, safety, and efficiency. AI-powered solutions allow autonomous vehicles (AVs) to respond to potential hazards, navigate complex environments, make intelligent decisions, and examine real-time data. BC technologies offer secure and decentralized platforms for data management and sharing, fostering trust and cooperation among different stakeholders in the transportation system. An Autonomous Transport System (ATS) for secure vehicle and cargo matching intends to enhance and optimize transportation by using AVs and ensuring the secure transportation of goods. This mechanism combined AV technology, secure matching, and cargo tracking methods to securely and efficiently transport goods from one place to another. In this aspect, this article presents a Blockchain Assisted Vehicle and Cargo Matching using Optimal Fuzzy Restricted Boltzmann Machine (BAVCM-OFRBM) technique for Autonomous Transport System. The major aim of the BAVCM-OFRBM technique lies in the development of an automated vehicle and cargo matching approach using an optimal DL model. In addition, the BAVCM-OFRBM technique makes use of BC technology to secure transportation details such as order and shipment information. Moreover, the BAVCM-OFRBM technique exploits the FRBM model for the selection of appropriate vehicles and cargo for transportation purposes. Finally, the efficacy of the FRBM model can be improved by the use of Ingenious Crow Search Algorithm (ICSA) based hyperparameter tuning process. The simulation results of the BAVCM-OFRBM technique are tested under different aspects. The experimental outcomes emphasized the betterment of the BAVCM-OFRBM method in vehicle and cargo matching process.

AB Sooner than later, the growing development of Autonomous Vehicles (AVs) will represent not only an imminent transformation of transportation dynamics, but also further advantages for their users, including many improvements in road crash prevention, efficiency and sustainability. However, different concerns and constraints may affect the intention of adopting this technology among its potential customers, especially for what concerns those constraints related to safety, viability and stability. The objective of this study was to examine the influence of perceived safety and value attributed to the AV in the drivers' intention to use it, considering the drivers' demographic factors, driving habits, interaction with information technologies and self-reported safety records (using conventional vehicles) as potential predictors. For this cross-sectional study, data from 1205 drivers of conventional vehicles were analyzed through a structural equation modeling (SEM) approach. The intention to use autonomous vehicles could be predicted through demographic and driving-related factors, as well as by the level of interaction of individuals with information and communication technologies (ITCs). It was also found that the perceived safety of AVs and their attributed value for transport and road safety mediate the associations between drivers' features and the final intention of using (or not) autonomous vehicles. The results of this study suggest that perceived safety and the value attributed to AVs significantly influence the intention of adopting it. In other words, a deeper emphasis on the safety, causality prevention and efficiency-related benefits may strengthen the acceptance of this new technology and enhance its progressive inclusion in transport dynamics among drivers.

AB Although autonomous vehicles (AV) have been rapidly developed, their control technology is not sufficiently mature for daily use, yet not human-centred enough. Some studies regarding trajectory planning are overly conservative and the vehicle avoids obstacles in an unhuman-like trajectory which causes discomfort to passengers; meanwhile, other studies are overly simplistic, the transport scenario, and vehicle trajectory are disregarded. The potential field (PF) algorithm is one of the most frequently used methods for the trajectory planning of AVs; however, most studies regarding the PF algorithm do not consider driving comfort and smoothness. This paper introduces optimised human-centred dynamic trajectory planning for AVs. The PF algorithm is implemented in a vehicle simulation model, which is integrated with model predictive control (MPC). The reference path is planned by PF algorithm and improved by MPC. The human-centred AV control is proposed in a simulation environment. The proposed planning method achieves a trade-off between safety, driving comfort, and driving smoothness and is validated with several driving simulation scenarios.

AB Autonomous vehicles are a research area of active interest. Collision avoidance system (CAS) is one of the central concerns to provide security protection for autonomous vehicles. This paper proposes a multi-mode collision avoidance system (mCAS), which combines a trajectory prediction module, a risk assessment module and a motion planning module into the closed-loop system. At each step, the trajectory prediction module predicts the trajectories of the vehicle and surrounding vehicles. The risk assessment model calculates the collision probability and chooses reasonable control mode. Then the motion planning module designs the desired deceleration profile based on it. The car takes the first step of the planned deceleration and repeats this cycle, achieving closed-loop control. The mCAS is tested in a closed-loop simulation setup and the results show that the proposed mCAS is of good effectiveness and feasibility, which can significantly reduce collision probability as well as false alarms.

AB Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV) are increasingly becoming a popular tool in the observation and study of marine mammals. However, the potential capabilities of these vehicles regarding autonomous operations are not being fully exploited for passive underwater acoustic monitoring in marine mammal research. This article presents results from the development of a UAV system equipped with an underwater acoustic recorder aimed at assisting with the monitoring of harbour porpoises in Special Areas of Conservation in the United Kingdom. The UAV is capable of autonomous navigation, persistent landing, take-off and automatic data acquisition at specified waypoints. The system architecture that enables autonomous UAV flight including waypoint planning and control is described. A bespoke lightweight underwater acoustic recorder (named the PorpDAQ) capable of transmitting the results of fast Fourier transforms (FFT) applied to incoming signals from a hydrophone was also designed. The system's operation is successfully validated with a combination of outdoor experiments and indoor simulations demonstrating different UAVs capable of autonomously navigating and landing at specific waypoints while recording data in an indoor tank. Results from the recorder suggest that lightweight, relatively low-cost systems can be used in place of heavier more expensive alternatives.

ID TRAFFIC FLOW; TRAVEL; SYSTEMS
AB Autonomous and connected vehicle technologies have the potential to bring profound changes in travel behavior and transportation network performance with moderate to significant market penetration rates (MPRs) within the next few decades. To better understand the long-term impacts of these technologies, this study predicts the network-level effects of privately owned autonomous vehicles (AVs) and connected and autonomous vehicles (CAVs) for the Triangle Region, North Carolina, in the year 2045. Market penetration scenarios of personal AVs and CAVs along with results from microscopic mixed-traffic simulations and travel behavior assumptions are incorporated into a regional travel demand model. Results indicate that a 75% MPR of personal AVs deteriorates the performance of the network, leading to a 5.4% increase in vehicle-hours traveled, and a 17.2% increase in hours of delay. The opposite holds for private CAV adoption, which is found to result in higher peak-period link speed and less congestion. The results of this research help planners and engineers to make informed transportation planning decisions and work toward harnessing the benefits of these technologies while minimizing any negative impacts.

AB Establishment of effective cooperation between vehicles and transportation infrastructure improves travel reliability in urban transportation networks. Lack of collaboration, however, exacerbates congestion due mainly to frequent stops at signalized intersections. It is beneficial to develop a control logic that collects basic safety message from approaching connected and autonomous vehicles and guarantees efficient intersection operations with safe and incident free vehicle maneuvers. In this paper, a signal-head-free intersection control logic is formulated into a dynamic programming model that aims to maximize the intersection throughput. A stochastic look-ahead technique is proposed based on Monte Carlo tree search algorithm to determine the near-optimal actions (i.e., acceleration rates) over time to prevent movement conflicts. Our numerical results confirm that the proposed technique can solve the problem efficiently and addresses the consequences of existing traffic signals. The proposed approach, while completely avoids incidents at intersections, significantly reduces travel time (ranging between 59.4% and 83.7% when compared to fixed-time and fully-actuated control strategies) at intersections under various demand patterns.

AB There is a large amount of research currently being done on autonomous micro-aerial vehicles (MAV), such as quadrotor helicopters or quadcopters. The ability to create a working autonomous MAV depends mainly on integrating a simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) solution with the rest of the system. This paper provides an introduction for creating an autonomous MAV for enclosed environments, aimed at students and professionals alike. The standard autonomous system and MAV automation are discussed, while we focus on the core concepts of SLAM systems and trajectory planning algorithms. The advantages and disadvantages of using remote processing are evaluated, and recommendations are made regarding the viability of on-board processing. Recommendations are made regarding best practices to serve as a guideline for aspirant MAV designers.

TI Complex attack detection scheme using history trajectory in internet of

SO EGYPTIAN INFORMATICS JOURNAL

DT Article
ID AUTONOMOUS VEHICLE; AUTHENTICATION; SYSTEMS
AB The internet of vehicles technology provides convenience to drivers and prevents traffic accidents via wireless communication between road infrastructure and autonomous vehicles by sharing real-time traffic information. However, attackers can easily penetrate networks by exploiting the vulnerabilities of wireless communications. An attacker can falsify real-time traffic information and transmit it to a vehicle, causing traffic jams or preventing autonomous vehicles from receiving legitimate real-time traffic information. If autonomous vehicles do not receive accurate information, the arrival time at the destination can be affected, and accidents due to incorrect driving can occur. Because traffic accidents can cause casualties, they must be prevented. Various schemes have been proposed to detect attacks that occur on the internet of vehicles, and these security schemes can prevent traffic accidents by detecting attacks at high speeds. However, the existing schemes focus on quickly identifying a single attack but encounter difficulties when attempting to detect complex attacks that occur simultaneously. The proposed scheme uses a history trajectory to detect complex attacks. The proposed scheme stores behavioral information on all vehicles and road infrastructure using a control center. This information becomes a history trajectory that is used to detect attacks. Thereafter, when the vehicle is abnormally driven, the control center analyzes its driving path. When analyzing the vehicle driving process, the control center determines that an attack is being attempted when the road infrastructure or a vehicle makes an erroneous state transition. In addition, the type of attack is analyzed to identify compromised vehicles or road infrastructure and take measures to prevent further problems. Thus, the proposed scheme can detect complex attacks through history trajectory analysis. The experimental results demonstrate that in 80% of attempted attacks, the proposed scheme detects complex attacks with a probability of 97.56%. (C) 2022 THE AUTHORS.

AB Autonomous pilot is crucial in integrally promoting the autonomy of an unmanned surface vehicle (USV). However, the integration mechanism of decision and control is still unclear within the entire autonomy. In this paper, by organically bridging path planning and tracking, an autonomous pilot framework with waypoints generation, path smoothing and policy guidance of a USV in congested waters is established, for the first time. Incorporating elite and diversity operations into the genetic algorithm (GA), an elite-duplication GA (EGA) strategy is devised to optimally generate sparse waypoints in a constrained space. The B-spline technique is further deployed to make flexibly smooth interpolation facilitating path smoothing supported by optimal sparse-waypoints. Seamlessly bridged by the parametric smooth path, deep reinforcement learning (DRL) technique is resorted to continuously extract in-depth pilotage policies, i.e., mappings from path tracking errors, collision risks and control constraints to continuous control forces/torques. Eventually, the entire spline-bridged EGA-DRL (SED) framework merits autonomous global-pilotage and local-reaction in an organically modular manner. Comprehensive validations and comparisons in various real-world geographies demonstrate the effectiveness and superiority of the proposed SED autonomous pilot framework.

AB Recent advances in Intelligent Transport Systems (ITS) and Artificial Intelligence (AI) have stimulated and paved the way toward the widespread introduction of Autonomous Vehicles (AVs). This has opened new opportunities for smart roads, intelligent traffic safety, and traveler comfort. Autonomous Vehicles have become a highly popular research topic in recent years because of their significant capability to reduce road accidents and human injuries. This paper is an attempt to survey all recent AI based techniques used to deal with major functions in AVs, namely scene understanding, motion planning, decision making, vehicle control, social behavior, and communication. Our survey focuses solely on deep learning and reinforcement learning based approaches; it does not include conventional (shallow) shallow based techniques, a subject that has been extensively investigated in the past. Our survey builds a taxonomy of DL and RL algorithms that have been used so far to bring solutions to the four main issues in autonomous driving. Finally, this survey highlights the open challenges and points out possible future research directions. (c) 2022 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V. on behalf of King Saud University.

ID INFORMATION
AB New robotic sensor platforms have computing resources that enable a rich set of tasks for adaptive monitoring of the environment. But to substantially augment the toolbox of environmental sensing, such platforms must be embedded with realistic statistical models and coherent methodologies for designing experiments and assimilating the data. In this article, we develop myopic and hybrid strategies for autonomous underwater vehicle sampling in space and time. These strategies are based on a stochastic advection-diffusion Gaussian process model for the mine tailings concentration in a Norwegian fjord, and the goal is to monitor the excursion set (ES) of high concentrations. Closed form expressions for the expected misclassification probabilities of the ES enable real-time operation on board the autonomous vehicle, and this is used to guide the spatio-temporal sampling. Simulation studies show that the suggested strategies outperform other approaches that either (i) simplify the models for spatio-temporal variation, or (ii) simplify the design criterion. A field test shows how autonomous underwater sampling is useful for refining an initial stochastic advection-diffusion model. These experiments further show that the vehicle can adapt to focus on regions with intermediate concentrations where it is natural to improve the ES prediction.

ID INDUSTRY
AB With the development of machine perception and multimodal information decision-making techniques, autonomous driving technology has become a crucial area of advancement in the transportation industry. The optimization of vehicle navigation, path planning, and obstacle avoidance tasks is of paramount importance. In this study, we explore the use of attention mechanisms in a end-to-end architecture for optimizing obstacle avoidance and path planning in autonomous driving vehicles. We position our research within the broader context of robotics, emphasizing the fusion of information and decision-making capabilities. The introduction of attention mechanisms enables vehicles to perceive the environment more accurately by focusing on important information and making informed decisions in complex scenarios. By inputting multimodal information, such as images and LiDAR data, into the attention mechanism module, the system can automatically learn and weigh crucial environmental features, thereby placing greater emphasis on key information during obstacle avoidance decisions. Additionally, we leverage the end-to-end architecture and draw from classical theories and algorithms in the field of robotics to enhance the perception and decision-making abilities of autonomous driving vehicles. Furthermore, we address the optimization of path planning using attention mechanisms. We transform the vehicle's navigation task into a sequential decision-making problem and employ LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) models to handle dynamic navigation in varying environments. By applying attention mechanisms to weigh key points along the navigation path, the vehicle can flexibly select the optimal route and dynamically adjust it based on real-time conditions. Finally, we conducted extensive experimental evaluations and software experiments on the proposed end-to-end architecture on real road datasets. The method effectively avoids obstacles, adheres to traffic rules, and achieves stable, safe, and efficient autonomous driving in diverse road scenarios. This research provides an effective solution for optimizing obstacle avoidance and path planning in the field of autonomous driving. Moreover, it contributes to the advancement and practical applications of multimodal information fusion in navigation, localization, and human-robot interaction.

AB Ride-sharing services, that have been growing in recent years with the start of network service companies, will be further enhanced by the recently emerging trend of applications for autonomous vehicles for future traveler mobility. One fundamental question that transportation managers should address is how to capture the endogenous traffic patterns involving the new and uncertain elements facing future transportation planning and management. By concentrating on one ideal system optimal (SO) scenario, in which (i) all vehicles are autonomous, or can be centrally guided and (ii) all passengers' pickup/drop-off trip requests can be given at the beginning, this paper aims to integrate travel demand, vehicle supply, and limited infrastructure. Available ride-shared and autonomous vehicles, from different (real/virtual) depots, can be optimally assigned to satisfy passengers' trip requests, while considering the endogenous congestion in capacitated networks. A number of decomposition approaches are adopted in this research. Focusing on this primal problem, we propose an arc-based vehicle-based integer linear programming model in space-time-state (STS) networks, which is solved by Dantzig-Wolfe decomposition. From the perspective of dynamic traffic assignment, a space-time-state (STS) path-based flow-based linear programming model is also provided as an approximation according to the mapping information between vehicle and passenger, and between a vehicle and the space-time arc in each STS path in our priori-generated column pool. Finally, numerical experiments are performed to demonstrate our decomposition approaches and their computation efficiency. From our preliminary experiments, we have a few interesting observations: (i) without considering road congestion, the network performance/efficiency could be overestimated; (ii) passengers' required pickup and drop-off time windows could be a buffer to mitigate road congestion, without impacting system performance; (iii) the ride-sharing service could reduce the total transportation system cost under centralized control.

AB Virtual simulation testing (VST) has become the main testing method for autonomous driving systems (ADSs) and autonomous driving assistance algorithms (ADAAs). The behavior and trajectory (B&T) information of a background vehicle in VST can provide different test scenarios for ADSs and ADAAs. Also, the B&T data on a differentiated vehicle can expand the test scope, increasing the reliability of the tested ADSs and ADAAs. Since human drivers have different driving styles, human-driven vehicles are one of the best choices for background vehicles. However, the VST based on natural driving data injection faces the problems of a small amount of data and difficult extraction of key samples and scenarios. Moreover, some of the current B&T generation methods are mostly targeted at autonomous vehicles, which are difficult to transfer to background vehicles. To address the mentioned shortcomings, this study proposes a method for generating human-like B&T data in batch. First, a uniformized velocity and trajectory sampling method with equal-length high-fidelity properties is developed for unequal-length natural driving data. Next, the lane-level vehicle entrance velocity is obtained, and a two-level probability-limited vehicle behavior generation and filtering method is developed. The generated behaviors are used as input to the trajectory generation model. Then, an enhanced learning-based trajectory generation model is designed, and trajectory generation is performed for different motion states using the generated behavior data. Finally, the coverage analysis of the proposed B&T generation model is performed, and the proposed model is compared with state-of-the-art B&T generation models. The results show that the proposed B&T generation model can achieve lateral and longitudinal TFRs of 87.85% and 88.45%, performing better than the other models. In addition, the proposed method can generate B&T data that are not included in the original data, solving the problem of the B&T data gaps and thus improving the B&T coverage of the VST background vehicles.

AB Due to the advent of active safety features and automated driving capabilities, the scope and complexity of embedded computing systems within automobiles continue to increase. Moreover, with the introduction of communication technologies like dedicated short range communications (DSRC), autonomous vehicles can also communicate with each other, pedestrians and the infrastructure. As the number of applications and levels of autonomy within such connected and autonomous vehicles (CAVs) increase the inherent safety-critical nature of CAVs imposes strict requirements in terms of testing and verification of system correctness. Hence, appropriate tools and methodologies are to manage these increasing complexity and testing requirements. In this paper, we present a standard reference architecture for CAVs and the tools and methodologies we use to model, design, develop and test systems to realize CAV applications.

AB The current approach to connected and autonomous driving function development and evaluation uses model-in-the-loop simulation, hardware-in-the-loop simulation and limited proving ground use, followed by public road deployment of the beta version of software and technology. The rest of the road users are involuntarily forced into taking part in the development and evaluation of these connected and autonomous driving functions in this approach. This is an unsafe, costly and inefficient method. Motivated by these shortcomings, this paper introduces the Vehicle-in-Virtual-Environment (VVE) method of safe, efficient and low-cost connected and autonomous driving function development, evaluation and demonstration. The VVE method is compared to the existing state-of-the-art. Its basic implementation for a path-following task is used to explain the method where the actual autonomous vehicle operates in a large empty area with its sensor feeds being replaced by realistic sensor feeds corresponding to its location and pose in the virtual environment. It is possible to easily change the development virtual environment and inject rare and difficult events which can be tested very safely. Vehicle-to-Pedestrian (V2P) communication-based pedestrian safety is chosen as the application use case for the VVE in this paper, and corresponding experimental results are presented and discussed. A no-line-of-sight pedestrian and vehicle moving towards each other on intersecting paths with different speeds are used in the experiments. Their time-to-collision risk zone values are compared for determining severity levels. The severity levels are used to slow down or brake the vehicle. The results show that V2P communication of pedestrian location and heading can be used successfully to avoid possible collisions. It is noted that actual pedestrians and other vulnerable road users can be used very safely in this approach.

AB A new approach to autonomous land vehicle (ALV) navigation by the person following is proposed. This approach is based on sequential pattern recognition and computer vision techniques, and maintenance of smoothness for indoor navigation is the main goal. The ALV is guided automatically to follow a person who walks in front of the vehicle. The vehicle can be used as an autonomous handcart, go-cart, buffet car, golf cart, weeder, etc. in various applications. Sequential pattern recognition is used to design a classifier for making decisions about whether the person in front of the vehicle is walking straight or is too right or too left of the vehicle. Multiple images in a sequence are used as input to the system. Computer vision techniques are used to detect and locate the person in front of the vehicle. By sequential pattern recognition, the relation between the location of the person and that of the vehicle is categorized into three classes. Corresponding adjustments of the direction of the vehicle are computed to achieve smooth navigation. The approach is implemented on a real ALV, and successful and smooth navigation sessions confirm the feasibility of the approach. (C) 1999 John Wiley & Sons, Inc.

AB This paper presents a novel observer-based gain-scheduling path following control algorithm for autonomous electric vehicles subject to time delay. Firstly, the lateral dynamic model of the autonomous electric vehicle is constructed by a polytope with four vertices, in which the issues of the time-varying longitudinal velocity and nonlinear tyre dynamics are accurately described. Secondly, taking the time delay encountered in the process of signal transmission into consideration, the observer-based path following controller is proposed by using easily measured vehicle states. In the algorithm, the observer and controller gains are gain scheduled according to the actual longitudinal velocity. Thirdly, based on Lyapunov stability theory, an appropriate Lyapunov-Krasovskii functional is constructed to derive sufficient conditions of the controller, which is effective to ensure the asymptotical stability of the closed-loop path following error system with a guaranteed H-infinity performance. Specially, for ease of computation, the sufficient conditions of controller design are developed in terms of a set of linear matrix inequalities. Finally, numerical simulations are implemented to illustrate the efficiency and superiority of the proposed method in comparison with the existing method.

AB Focusing on the crossing scenarios of pedestrians and autonomous vehicles (AVs) at unsignalized road sections, this study proposes an evolutionary game model considering the related benefits of AVs, pedestrians and traffic managers, and it explores the impact of policy intervention. The game analysis results indicate that strategies of the three agents are closely associated with pedestrians' trust in driverless technology, human-vehicle communication and government regulation. In cases where regulation exists, increasing the AV supervision threat would facilitate the equilibrium to evolve toward pedestrians crossing and AVs yielding. In addition, we unexpectedly find that the introduction of crash probability information cannot boost the equilibrium outcomes in the expected direction, which may be related to information overload. Finally, this study verifies the validity of the model through numerical simulations and provides managerial implications with respect to driverless technology promotion, communication device design and regulatory policy formulation.

AB This paper investigates the path-following control problem for four-wheel independently actuated autonomous ground vehicles through integrated control of active front-wheel steering and direct yaw-moment control. A modified composite nonlinear feedback strategy is proposed to improve the transient performance and eliminate the steady-state errors in path-following control considering the tire force saturations, in the presence of the time-varying road curvature for the desired path. Path following is achieved through vehicle lateral and yaw control, i.e., the lateral velocity and yaw rate are simultaneously controlled to track their respective desired values, where the desired yaw rate is generated according to the path-following demand. CarSim-Simulink joint simulation results indicate that the proposed controller can effectively improve the transient response performance, inhibit the overshoots, and eliminate the steady-state errors in path following within the tire force saturation limits.

AB In this study, we concentrate on the random capacity of a single lane in the context of mixed traffic flow with both autonomous vehicles (AVs) and human-driven vehicles (HVs). We first revisit and enrich the bound estimation of the random lane capacity. We proceed to rigorously investigate the non-negligible gap between two widely-used approximate mean capacity functions and their generalized function. The analysis results show that the improper use of approximate mean capacity functions in AV-HV traffic assignment and road network planning could lead to biased and even misleading decisions. Lastly, we explore the probability distribution of the random lane capacity using simulation and distribution fitting techniques, where both fixed and random headway scenarios with different AV shares are addressed. Six suitable probability distributions for the random lane capacity are identified, and the top three are Log-Pearson 3, Log-Gamma, and Lognormal distributions.

AB This article proposes an integrated control strategy of autonomous distributed drive electric vehicles. First, to handle the multi-constraints and integrated problem of path following and the yaw motion control, a model predictive control technique is applied to determine optimal front wheels' steering angle and external yaw moment synthetically and synchronously. For ensuring the desired path-tracking performance and vehicle lateral stability, a series of imperative state constraints and control references are transferred in the form of a matrix and imposed into the rolling optimization mechanism of model predictive control, where the detailed derivation is also illustrated and analyzed. Then, the quadratic programming algorithm is employed to optimize and distribute each in-wheel motor's torque output. Finally, numerical simulation validations are carried out and analyzed in depth by comparing with a linear quadratic regulator-based strategy, proving the effectiveness and control efficacy of the proposed strategy.

AB The path-following problem for autonomous vehicles is investigated in this paper. The desired vehicle heading is commonly chosen as the tangent direction on the desired path. This paper points out that the traditional definition of the desired heading may deteriorate the path-following performance, particularly when the vehicle is tracking a path with large curvature. That is because the sideslip angle control and the yaw rate control are conflicting in the presence of sliding effects, and the sideslip angle does not equal to zero when the vehicle is tracking a curve path. This paper further provides an amendment to the definition of the desired heading, which realizes a more accurate path-following maneuver. In the controller design phase, backstepping is used to generate the required yaw rate, and an LQR controller is adopted to obtain the optimal active front steering input. The CarSim-Simulink joint simulation verifies the reasonability of the amendment to the desired heading.

AB Autonomous navigation is a complex problem that involves different tasks, such as location of the mobile robot in the scenario, robotic mapping, generating the trajectory, navigating from the initial point to the target point, detecting objects it may encounter in its path, etc. This paper presents a new optimal trajectory planning algorithm that allows the assessment of the energy efficiency of autonomous light vehicles. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time in the literature that this is carried out by minimizing the travel time while considering the vehicle's dynamic behavior, its limitations, and with the capability of avoiding obstacles and constraining energy consumption. This enables the automotive industry to design environmentally sustainable strategies towards compliance with governmental greenhouse gas (GHG) emission regulations and for climate change mitigation and adaptation policies. The reduction in energy consumption also allows companies to stay competitive in the marketplace. The vehicle navigation control is efficiently implemented through a middleware of component-based software development (CBSD) based on a Robot Operating System (ROS) package. It boosts the reuse of software components and the development of systems from other existing systems. Therefore, it allows the avoidance of complex control software architectures to integrate the different hardware and software components. The global maps are created by scanning the environment with FARO 3D and 2D SICK laser sensors. The proposed algorithm presents a low computational cost and has been implemented as a new module of distributed architecture. It has been integrated into the ROS package to achieve real time autonomous navigation of the vehicle. The methodology has been successfully validated in real indoor experiments using a light vehicle under different scenarios entailing several obstacle locations and dynamic parameters.

ID CHANGING MODELS
AB Lane-merging scenarios pose highly challenging problems for autonomous vehicles due to conflicts of interest between the human-driven and cutting-in autonomous vehicles. Such conflicts become severe when traffic increases, and cut-in algorithms suffer from a steep trade-off between safety and cut-in performance. In this study, a reinforcement learning (RL)-based cut-in policy network nested within a finite state machine (FSM)--which is a high-level decision maker, is proposed to achieve high cut-in performance without sacrificing safety. This FSM-RL hybrid approach is proposed to obtain 1) a strategic and adjustable algorithm, 2) optimal safety and cut-in performance, and 3) robust and consistent performance. In the high-level decision making algorithm, the FSM provides a framework for four cut-in phases (ready for safe gap selection, gap approach, negotiation, and lane-change execution) and handles the transitions between these phases by calculating the collision risks associated with target vehicles. For the lane-change phase, a policy-based deep-RL approach with a soft actor-critic network is employed to get optimal cut-in performance. The results of simulations show that the proposed FSM-RL cut-in algorithm consistently achieves a high cut-in success rate without sacrificing safety. In particular, as the traffic increases, the cut-in success rate and safety are significantly improved over existing optimized rule-based cut-in algorithms and end-to-end RL algorithm.

TI Security Architecture for Swarms of Autonomous Vehicles in Smart Farming
SO APPLIED SCIENCES-BASEL
LA English
DT Article
DE security; autonomous vehicles; smart farming
AB Featured Application
   The security architecture proposed can be implemented in any application that involves the use of autonomous vehicles, both terrestrial and aerial, e.g., monitoring of crops and livestock behaviour with UAVs (Unmanned Aerial Vehicles); autonomous control of implements in tractors to prepare the ground, to sow the seeds, to apply precise amounts of fertilizer or to maintain the crops; surveillance of areas with UAVs to detect intruders or wild animals; UAV-based sampling systems; etc.
   Nowadays, autonomous vehicles are incorporated into farms to facilitate manual labour. Being connected vehicles, as IoT systems, they are susceptible to cyber security attacks that try to cause damage to hardware, software or even living beings. Therefore, it is important to provide sufficient security mechanisms to protect both the communications and the data, mitigating any possible risk or harm to farmers, livestock or crops. Technology providers are aware of the importance of ensuring security, and more and more secure solutions can be found on the market today. However, generally, these particular solutions are not sufficient when they are part of complex hybrid systems, since there is no single global solution proposal. In addition, as the number of technologies and protocols used increases, the number of security threats also increases. This article presents a cyber-security architecture proposal for swarms of heterogeneous vehicles in smart farming, which covers all of the aspects recommended by the ISO 7798-2 specification in terms of security. As a result of this analysis, a detailed summary of the possible solutions and available technologies for each of the communication channels of the target system as well as some recommendations are presented.

AB Accurate knowledge of the vehicle states is the foundation of vehicle motion control. However, in real implementations, sensory signals are always corrupted by delays and noises. Network induced time-varying delays and measurement noises can be a hazard in the active safety of over-actuated electric vehicles (EVs). In this paper, a brain-inspired proprioceptive system based on state-of-the-art deep learning and data fusion technique is proposed to solve this problem in autonomous four-wheel actuated EVs. A deep recurrent neural network (RNN) is trained by the noisy and delayed measurement signals to make accurate predictions of the vehicle motion states. Then unscented Kalman predictor, which is the adaption of unscented Kalman filter in time-varying-delay situations, combines the predictions of the RNN and corrupted sensory signals to provide better perceptions of the locomotion. Simulations with a high-fidelity, CarSim, full-vehicle model are carried out to show the effectiveness of our RNN framework and the entire proprioceptive system.

AB In this work we present a multiagent deep reinforcement learning approach for autonomous driving vehicles that is able to operate in traffic networks with unsignalized intersections. The key aspects of the proposed study are the introduction of route-agents as the main building block of the system, as well as a collision term that allows the cooperation among vehicles and the construction of an efficient reward function. These have the advantage of establishing an enhanced collaborative multiagent deep reinforcement learning scheme that manages to control multiple vehicles and navigate them safely and efficiently-economically to their destination. In addition, it provides the beneficial flexibility to lay down a platform for transfer learning and reusing knowledge from the agents' policies in handling unknown traffic scenarios. We provide several experimental results in simulated road traffic networks of variable complexity and diverse characteristics using the SUMO environment that empirically illustrate the efficiency of the proposed multiagent framework.

AB This paper proposes an efficient neural network (NN) approach to tracking control of an autonomous surface vehicle (ASV) with completely unknown vehicle dynamics and subject to significant uncertainties. The proposed NN has a single-layer structure by utilising the vehicle regressor dynamics that expresses the highly nonlinear dynamics in terms of the known and unknown dynamic parameters. The learning algorithm of the NN is simple yet computationally efficient. It is derived from Lyapunov stability analysis, which guarantees that all the error signals in the control system are uniformly ultimately bounded (UUB). The proposed NN approach can force the ASV to track the desired trajectory with good control performance through the on-line learning of the NN without any off-line learning procedures. In addition, the proposed controller is capable of compensating bounded unknown disturbances. The effectiveness and efficiency are demonstrated by simulation and comparison studies.

AB The objective of this study was to investigate the impact of connected and autonomous vehicles (CAVs) on traffic flow under various parameters. For this purpose, we propose a mixed CAV and conventional vehicle (CV) model to investigate a bidirectional two-lane traffic flow under the periodic boundary condition. The traffic flux and the phase diagrams of the system in the (rho(1), rho(2)) area are constructed in both cases: with and without CAVs. The overtaking frequency is also calculated. The simulation findings show that the traffic capacity is greatly enhanced with the increase in the CAV penetration ratio. Owing to the cooperative driving strategy, with the increase in penetration ratio of the CAV, the portion of smooth overtaking is boosted. Furthermore, it is found that the traffic throughput is positively correlated to the speed limit of the fast vehicle where the flux increases as Vmax-F increases. Also, even if there is a low rate of slow moving vehicles in the system, it will have an appreciable and a significant negative influence.

SO TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH PART A-POLICY AND PRACTICE
LA English
DT Article
DE Agent-based modeling; Carsharing; Electric vehicles; Autonomous vehicles
AB There are natural synergies between shared autonomous vehicle (AV) fleets and electric vehicle (EV) technology, since fleets of AVs resolve the practical limitations of today's non-autonomous EVs, including traveler range anxiety, access to charging infrastructure, and charging time management. Fleet-managed AVs relieve such concerns, managing range and charging activities based on real-time trip demand and established charging station locations, as demonstrated in this paper. This work explores the management of a fleet of shared autonomous electric vehicles (SAEVs) in a regional, discrete-time, agent based model. The simulation examines the operation of SAEVs under various vehicle range and charging infrastructure scenarios in a gridded city modeled roughly after the densities of Austin, Texas.
   Results based on 2009 NHTS trip distance and time-of-day distributions indicate that fleet size is sensitive to battery recharge time and vehicle range, with each 80-mile range SAEV replacing 3.7 privately owned vehicles and each 200-mile range SAEV replacing 5.5 privately owned vehicles, under Level II (240-volt AC) charging. With Level III 480-volt DC fast-charging infrastructure in place, these ratios rise to 5.4 vehicles for the 80-mile range SAEV and 6.8 vehicles for the 200-mile range SAEV. SAEVs can serve 96-98% of trip requests with average wait times between 7 and 10 minutes per trip. However, due to the need to travel while "empty" for charging and passenger pick-up, SAEV fleets are predicted to generate an additional 7.1-14.0% of travel miles. Financial analysis suggests that the combined cost of charging infrastructure, vehicle capital and maintenance, electricity, insurance, and registration for a fleet of SAEVs ranges from $0.42 to $0.49 per occupied mile traveled, which implies SAEV service can be offered at the equivalent per-mile cost of private vehicle ownership for low-mileage households, and thus be competitive with current manually-driven carsharing services and significantly cheaper than on-demand driver-operated transportation services. When Austin-specific trip patterns (with more concentrated trip origins and destinations) are introduced in a final case study, the simulation predicts a decrease in fleet "empty" vehicle-miles (down to 3-4% of all SAEV travel) and average wait times (ranging from 2 to 4 minutes per trip), with each SAEV replacing 5-9 privately owned vehicles.

AB In this study, the authors present an effective online tube-based model predictive control (T-MPC) solution for autonomous driving that aims at improving the computational load while ensuring robust stability and performance in fast and disturbed scenarios. They focus on reformulating the non-linear original problem into a pseudo-linear problem by transforming the non-linear vehicle equations to be expressed in a linear parameter varying (LPV) form. An scheme composed by a nominal controller and a corrective local controller is proposed. First, the local controller is designed as a polytopic LPV-H-infinity controller able to reject external disturbances. Moreover, a finite number of accurate reachable sets, also called tube, are computed online using zonotopes taking into account the system dynamics, the local controller and the disturbance-uncertainty bounds considered. Second, the nominal controller is designed as an MPC where the LPV vehicle model is used to speed up the computational time while keeping accurate vehicle representation. They test the presented scheme and compared the local controller performance against the LQR design as state-of-the-art approach. They demonstrate its effectiveness in a disturbed fast driving scenario being able to reject strong exogenous disturbances and fulfilling imposed constraints at a very reduced computational cost.

AB Design of autonomous underwater vehicles is deeply influenced by required mission specifications. In particular, some activities like inspection of offshore plants or harsh marine environments require underwater vehicle with high autonomy, good propulsion performances and manoeuvrability. These features are deeply influenced by design and performances of the propulsion system. In particular, performances of underwater vehicles (both remotely operated and autonomous) are deeply influenced by four quadrants performances of propellers and by complex fluid dynamics interactions that are difficult to be, even roughly, evaluated. In this work, a study of a reconfigurable propulsion layout and its comparison with a conventional one is introduced. In particular, this study is also focused on modelling techniques that should really represent a reasonable trade-off in terms of accuracy and involved computational resources for fast prototyping and simulation of this kind of mechatronic systems.

AB Automated mobility on demand is foreseen as the future of urban passenger mobility. While mixed-traffic for autonomous and conventional vehicles could be considered, separation amplifies the benefits of automation. Combined with mobility as a service, separation also opens new possibilities in terms of demand management. We consider in this paper a single bottleneck dynamic framework, in which the capacity of a freeway is dedicated either to conventional or to autonomous vehicles. Users of conventional vehicles freely choose their departure time from home and compete for the best departure times from the bottleneck. Users of autonomous vehicles need to book their trip in advance. As the number of time slots available for booking does not exceed the capacity, booking users are guaranteed no delay at the bottleneck. An individual-specific cooperation cost is introduced in the modeling framework. We then investigate how a central planner should allocate the capacity to these two vehicle types depending on the regime (laissez-faire, welfare- or profit-maximizing). Two major findings are that the equilibrium demand split Pareto-dominates the case with only conventional cars and that the social cost difference between equilibrium and socially optimal demand splits is small compared to their benefits. Although the Pareto-improvement result may not hold for every single user in the case of richer heterogeneity, it remains a key advantage of our booking scheme. Profit-maximizing strategies however turn out to be hardly compatible with welfare maximization. (C) 2017 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB Long-range Marine Autonomous Systems (MAS), operating beyond the visual line-of-sight of a human pilot or research ship, are creating unprecedented opportunities for oceanographic data collection. Able to operate for up to months at a time, periodically communicating with a remote pilot via satellite, long-range MAS vehicles significantly reduce the need for an expensive research ship presence within the operating area. Heterogeneous fleets of MAS vehicles, operating simultaneously in an area for an extended period of time, are becoming increasingly popular due to their ability to provide an improved composite picture of the marine environment. However, at present, the expansion of the size and complexity of these multi-vehicle operations is limited by a number of factors: (1) custom control-interfaces require pilots to be trained in the use of each individual vehicle, with limited cross-platform standardization; (2) the data produced by each vehicle are typically in a custom vehicle-specific format, making the automated ingestion of observational data for near-real-time analysis and assimilation into operational ocean models very difficult; (3) the majority of MAS vehicles do not provide machine-to-machine interfaces, limiting the development and usage of common piloting tools, multi-vehicle operating strategies, autonomous control algorithms and automated data delivery. In this paper, we describe a novel piloting and datamanagement system (C2) which provides a unified web-based infrastructure for the operation of long-range MAS vehicles within the UK's National Marine Equipment Pool. The system automates the archiving, standardization and delivery of near-real-time science data and associated metadata from the vehicles to end-users and Global Data Assembly Centers mid-mission. Through the use and promotion of standard data formats and machine interfaces throughout the C2 system, we seek to enable future opportunities to collaborate with both the marine science and robotics communities to maximize the delivery of high-quality oceanographic data for world-leading science.

AB Connected Autonomous Vehicles (CAVs) are Not-So-Futuristic. CAVs will be highly dynamic by intelligently exploiting multipath communication over several radio technologies, such as high-speed WiFi and 5G and beyond networks. Yet, the likelihood of data communication loss can be very high and/, or packets arrive at the destination not in correct working order due to erratic and mixed time-varying wireless links. Furthermore, the vehicular data traffic is susceptible to loss and delay variation, which recommends the need to investigate new multipath TCP (MPTCP) protocols for ultra-reliable low latency communication (URLLC) over such heterogeneous networks while reassuring CAVs' needs. We undertake the challenge by jointly considering network coding and balanced linked adaptation for performing coupled congestion control across multiple wireless paths. Consequently, the proposed low delay MPTCP framework for connecting autonomous vehicles is efficient and intelligent by design. We conduct a rigorous convergence analysis of the MPTCP design framework. In summation, we provide a detailed mathematical study and demonstrate that the latency penalty for the URLLC-MPTCP developed over these networks becomes negligible when considering the possible benefits that multiple network convergence could offer. Our extensive emulation results demonstrate all these lucrative features of URLLC-MPTCP.

AB This paper presents the implementation of an autonomous electric vehicle (EV) project in the National Taiwan University of Science and Technology (NTUST) campus in Taiwan. The aim of this work was to integrate two important practices of realizing an autonomous vehicle in a campus environment, including vehicle positioning and path tracking. Such a project is helpful to the students to learn and practice key technologies of autonomous vehicles conveniently. Therefore, a laboratory-made EV was equipped with real-time kinematic GPS (RTK-GPS) to provide centimeter position accuracy. Furthermore, the model predictive control (MPC) was proposed to perform the path tracking capability. Nevertheless, the RTK-GPS exhibited some robust positioning concerns in practical application, such as a low update rate, signal obstruction, signal drift, and network instability. To solve this problem, a multisensory fusion approach using an unscented Kalman filter (UKF) was utilized to improve the vehicle positioning performance by further considering an inertial measurement unit (IMU) and wheel odometry. On the other hand, the model predictive control (MPC) is usually used to control autonomous EVs. However, the determination of MPC parameters is a challenging task. Hence, reinforcement learning (RL) was utilized to generalize the pre-trained datum value for the determination of MPC parameters in practice. To evaluate the performance of the RL-based MPC, software simulations using MATLAB and a laboratory-made, full-scale electric vehicle were arranged for experiments and validation. In a 199.27 m campus loop path, the estimated travel distance error was 0.82% in terms of UKF. The MPC parameters generated by RL also achieved a better tracking performance with 0.227 m RMSE in path tracking experiments, and they also achieved a better tracking performance when compared to that of human-tuned MPC parameters.

AB Autonomous vehicle (AV) is an innovative transport option that has the potential to disrupt all industries tied to transportation systems. The advent of AV technology will bring a novel on-demand mobility pattern such as shared autonomous vehicle (SAV). To promote AV technology, it is important to understand which factors influence travelers' intention to use AVs and SAVs. This paper collected literature from databases such as Scopus, Web of Science and ScienceDirect, and made a systematic review. The study aims to explore the determinants that influence travelers' behavioral intentions towards use AVs and SAVs based on an extended version of the theory of planned behavior, which incorporates knowledge and perceived risk. This study was tested empirically using a valid survey sample collected from 906 respondents in China. Structural equation model was conducted to investigate the predictors of intentions to use AVs and SAVs. Results showed that knowledge about AV technology and perceived risk are the two main potential obstacles for travelers to use AVs and SAVs. Attitude significantly affects AVs and SAV choice intentions. Subjective norm is the most critical factor affecting the travelers' intention to use AVs. Perceived behavioral control potentially stymie the travelers' intention to use SAVs. The findings will enhance the understanding of travelers' choice motivation from psychological and service perspectives, and provide data support for governments and companies in improving travel management strategies and product services.

AB This article proposes a dynamic wireless charging scheme for electric vehicles (EVs) using autonomous frequency control. The key is to make the receiver circuit of an EV always operate in the splitting region by adopting proper transmitter coils and displacement between adjacent transmitter coils. Then, by sensing the primary current, the autonomous frequency control can achieve constant charging power in the splitting region even the EV is moving. The operating frequency of the system is monitored online. When the operating frequency indicates that the EV is leaving the current transmitter coil and approaching the next transmitter coil, the current transmitter circuit stops working and the next transmitter circuit starts to work, thus achieving continuous charging on the road. Both theoretical calculations and experimental results are given to validate the feasibility of the proposed scheme.

AB In this paper, we present a control strategy design technique for an autonomous underwater vehicle based on solutions to the motion planning problem derived from differential geometric methods. The motion planning problem is motivated by the practical application of surveying the hull of a ship for implications of harbor and port security. In recent years, engineers and researchers have been collaborating on automating ship hull inspections by employing autonomous vehicles. Despite the progresses made, human intervention is still necessary at this stage. To increase the functionality of these autonomous systems, we focus on developing model-based control strategies for the survey missions around challenging regions, such as the bulbous bow region of a ship. Recent advances in differential geometry have given rise to the field of geometric control theory. This has proven to be an effective framework for control strategy design for mechanical systems, and has recently been extended to applications for underwater vehicles. Advantages of geometric control theory include the exploitation of symmetries and nonlinearities inherent to the system.
   Here, we examine the posed inspection problem from a path planning viewpoint, applying recently developed techniques from the field of differential geometric control theory to design the control strategies that steer the vehicle along the prescribed path. Three potential scenarios for surveying a ship's bulbous bow region are motivated for path planning applications. For each scenario, we compute the control strategy and implement it onto a test-bed vehicle. Experimental results are analyzed and compared with theoretical predictions.

SO JOURNAL OF FIELD ROBOTICS

AB This paper is concerned with the in-field autonomous operation of unmanned marine vehicles in accordance with convention for safe and proper collision avoidance as prescribed by the Coast Guard Collision Regulations (COLREGS). These rules are written to train and guide safe human operation of marine vehicles and are heavily dependent on human common sense in determining rule applicability as well as rule execution, especially when multiple rules apply simultaneously. To capture, the flexibility exploited by humans, this work applies a novel method of multiobjective optimization, interval programming, in a behavior-based control framework for representing the navigation rules, as well as task behaviors, in a way that achieves simultaneous optimal satisfaction. We present experimental validation of this approach using multiple autonomous surface craft. This work represents the first in-field demonstration of multiobjective optimization applied to autonomous COLREGS-based marine vehicle navigation. (C) 2006 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

AB In this paper, we present the development of autonomous navigation capabilities for small cruise boats, and their verification by field experiments in a canal and its surrounding waters. A cruise boat was converted to an autonomous surface vehicle (ASV) by installing various sensors and actuators to enable autonomous navigation. Navigation and perception sensors, such as global positioning system, attitude and heading reference system, radar, light detection and ranging (LiDAR), and cameras, were mounted on the ASV to estimate its motion and perceive the surrounding environment. Motors and potentiometers were installed for active control of the ASV. Software system components including navigation filters, object-detection, path-planning, and control algorithms were designed and implemented. In the narrow canal region, LiDARs were used to detect the side walls and boundaries of the canal. In open areas outside the canal, obstacles and object features were detected using various combinations of onboard sensors. A model-based path-planning algorithm was designed to avoid the detected obstacles, and the line-of-sight guidance was employed to control the vehicle. The performance of the developed system was verified through a field experiment in a real-world maritime environment.

AB 5G heterogeneous networks have become a promising platform to connect a growing number of Internet-of-Things (IoT) devices and accommodate a wide variety of vertical services. IoT has not been limited to traditional sensing systems since the introduction of 5G, but also includes a range of autonomous moving platforms, e.g., autonomous flying vehicles, autonomous underwater vehicles, autonomous surface vehicles as well as autonomous land vehicles. These platforms can be used as an effective means to connect air, space, ground, and sea mobile networks for providing a wider diversity of Internet services. Deep learning has been widely used to extract useful information from network big data for enhancing network quality-of-service and user quality-of-experience. Privacy preservation for user and network data is a burning concern in 5G heterogeneous networks due to various attacks in this environment. In this paper, we conduct an in-depth investigation on how deep learning can cope with privacy preservation issues in 5G heterogeneous networks, in terms of heterogeneous radio access networks (RANs), beyond-RAN networks, and end-to-end network slices, followed by a set of key research challenges and open issues that aim to guide future research.

AB Research on the autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) has been gaining more interest in the recent past. AUVs have been envisioned as a cost effective and safe solution for various underwater missions including but are not limited to underwater scientific test-bed, deep oceanic surveillance, environmental monitoring and underwater structures inspection. The control for such autonomous vehicles, however, continues to pose a serious challenge due to its complex dynamics and uncertain environment. As an alternative of direct tuning PID controllers which has several limitations, Model Predictive Control is proposed in this work. Characteristic of AUV where the dynamics is sluggish and linear around the region of operation makes the application of MPC amenable. In addition, the ability of the method to handle constraints inherent in the control inputs of AUV is appropriately exploited. Overall effectiveness of the new approach is evaluated based on the tracking performance, disturbance rejection and robustness.

AB In this paper, we investigate how field programmable gate arrays can serve as hardware accelerators for real-time semantic segmentation tasks relevant for autonomous driving. Considering compressed versions of the ENet convolutional neural network architecture, we demonstrate a fully-on-chip deployment with a latency of 4.9 ms per image, using less than 30% of the available resources on a Xilinx ZCU102 evaluation board. The latency is reduced to 3 ms per image when increasing the batch size to ten, corresponding to the use case where the autonomous vehicle receives inputs from multiple cameras simultaneously. We show, through aggressive filter reduction and heterogeneous quantization-aware training, and an optimized implementation of convolutional layers, that the power consumption and resource utilization can be significantly reduced while maintaining accuracy on the Cityscapes dataset.

AB Autonomous vehicles are expected to display human-like behavior, at least to the extent that their decisions can be intuitively understood by other road users. If this is not the case, the coexistence of manual and autonomous vehicles in a mixed environment might affect road user interactions negatively and might jeopardize road safety. To this end, it is highly important to design algorithms that are capable of analyzing human decision-making processes and of reproducing them. In this context, lane-change maneuvers have been studied extensively. However, not all potential scenarios have been considered, since most works have focused on highway rather than urban scenarios. We contribute to the field of research by investigating a particular urban traffic scenario in which an autonomous vehicle needs to determine the level of cooperation of the vehicles in the adjacent lane in order to proceed with a lane change. To this end, we present a game theory-based decision-making model for lane changing in congested urban intersections. The model takes as input driving-related parameters related to vehicles in the intersection before they come to a complete stop. We validated the model by relying on the Co-AutoSim simulator. We compared the prediction model outcomes with actual participant decisions, i.e., whether they allowed the autonomous vehicle to drive in front of them. The results are promising, with the prediction accuracy being 100% in all of the cases in which the participants allowed the lane change and 83.3% in the other cases. The false predictions were due to delays in resuming driving after the traffic light turned green.

AB In this paper, an improved Model Predictive Control (MPC) controller based on fuzzy adaptive weight control is proposed to solve the problem of autonomous vehicle in the process of path tracking. The controller not only ensures the tracking accuracy, but also considers the vehicle dynamic stability in the process of tracking, i.e., the vehicle dynamics model is used as the controller model. Moreover, the problem of driving comfort caused by the application of classical MPC controller when the vehicle is deviated from the target path is solved. This controller is mainly realized by adaptively improving the weight of the cost function in the classical MPC through the fuzzy adaptive control algorithm. A comparative study which compares the proposed controller with the pure-pursuit controller and the classical MPC controller is made: through the CarSim-Matlab/Simulink co-simulations, the results show that this controller presents better tracking performance than the latter ones considering both tracking accuracy and steering smoothness.

AB The safety of autonomous vehicles (AVs) is considered a high-priority area that has yet to be fully understood and more comprehensively addressed to enable their large-scale adoption. The current literature lacks a cohesive conceptual framework for a holistic understanding of AVs implications. This paper develops a framework that conceptualises the safety impacts of AVs more holistically. Through the theoretical lens of a 'mobilities' paradigm, the conceptual framework encompasses four dimensions - social, political, technological, and economic mobilities - unveiling a range of hidden complexities and challenges in adopting AVs. It suggests that a successful transition towards safer AV systems would initially require greater understanding of how these four dimensions are interrelated, interdependent, and complex. The value of this framework is to enable policymakers, planners, and engineers to navigate the future of autonomous mobilities optimally.

AB Autonomous vehicles equipped with numerous advanced sensors are capable of obtaining road preview information, creating new opportunities for vehicle suspension systems. This article proposes a novel preview suspension control method from adaptive nonlinear control perspectives with less computational burden and is more realistic, unlike optimization-based works or existing linear state-space models-based results that neglected nonlinear terms. The X-shaped bio-inspired dynamics derived from animal or insect skeleton structures are introduced to reduce energy consumption by utilizing beneficial geometrical nonlinearities. Meanwhile, optimal velocity planning approach is investigated to balance vehicle passage time, vibration suppression, and longitudinal comfort by solving a multi-objective optimization problem with the aid of road preview information. Moreover, acceleration constraint reduces the search space and computing requirements, while ensuring planned velocity optimality. Simulation and experiment results are provided to demonstrate the effectiveness and advantages of the constructed energy-saving adaptive preview control framework with constrained velocity planning.

AB Vehicle detection is an important part of robot environmental perception. In this paper, a 3D vehicle detection method using a single image is proposed to generate the 3D space coordinate information of the object using monocular vision for autonomous driving. The proposed method works under the multi-task framework and integrates 2D object detection, 3D object detection, orientation estimation and key point detection into one unified deep convolution neural network (DCNN) which could be trained by end-to-end learning. Besides, our proposed method is built by modifying Fast R-CNN using multi-task learning, and thus our proposed method is named multi-task Faster R-CNN (MT-Faster R-CNN). The experiments on KITTI dataset are conducted to evaluate our proposed method and the other 3D vehicle detection methods. The experimental results demonstrate that our proposed method is competitive and could significantly assist autonomous driving. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB In this study, an obstacle avoidance controller based on nonlinear model predictive control is designed in autonomous vehicle navigation. The reference trajectory is predefined using a sigmoid function in accordance with road conditions. When obstacles suddenly appear on a predefined trajectory, the reference trajectory should be adjusted dynamically. For dynamic obstacles, a moving trend function is constructed to predict the obstacle position variances in the predictive horizon. Furthermore, a risk index is constructed and introduced into the cost function to realize collision avoidance by combining the relative position relationship between vehicle and obstacles in the predictive horizon. Meanwhile, lateral acceleration constraint is also considered to ensure vehicle stability. Finally, trajectory dynamic planning and tracking are integrated into a single-level model predictive controller. Simulation tests reveal that the designed controller can ensure real-time trajectory tracking and collision avoidance.

AB Much research on automation in agriculture has been presented in recent years at the annual meetings of the Japanese Society of Agricultural Machinery (JSAM). This research has been performed in universities and government institutes, and by agricultural machinery manufacturers. Because of funding limitations, research in universities has concentrated on methodologies, such as navigation, sensing, and application of control theory. Development of a one dimensional image sensor, and application of neural networks and genetic algorithms, has taken place at Hokkaido University; vision guidance and fuzzy logic application at the University of Tokyo; an automatic follow-up vehicle has been developed at Kyoto University; and an automatic transport vehicle at Ehime University. At research institutes and manufacturers, with their greater financial freedom, more practical systems have been developed. A tilling robot and a driver-less air blast sprayer is being developed in the Bio-oriented Technology Research Advancement Institute (BRAIN); and an autonomous rice planter, a tillage robot and autonomous forage tractor in the research institute of the Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry, and Fishery (MAFF). Kubota Co. Ltd has developed autonomous rice planting and husbandry vehicles. In Asian countries an autonomous speed sprayer is under study in Korea and an autonomous power sprayer in Taiwan, but little research is performed elsewhere in Asia. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V.

AB The combination of a small unmanned ground vehicle (UGV) and a large unmanned carrier vehicle allows more flexibility in real applications such as rescue in dangerous scenarios. The autonomous recovery system, which is used to guide the small UGV back to the carrier vehicle, is an essential component to achieve a seamless combination of the two vehicles. This study proposes a novel autonomous recovery framework with a low-cost monocular vision system to provide accurate positioning and attitude estimation of the UGV during navigation. First, the authors introduce a light-weight convolutional neural network called UGV-KPNet to detect the keypoints of the small UGV form the images captured by a monocular camera. UGV-KPNet is computationally efficient with a small number of parameters and provides pixel-level accurate keypoints detection results in real-time. Then, six degrees of freedom (6-DoF) pose is estimated using the detected keypoints to obtain positioning and attitude information of the UGV. Besides, they are the first to create a large-scale real-world keypoints data set of the UGV. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed system achieves state-of-the-art performance in terms of both accuracy and speed on UGV keypoint detection, and can further boost the 6-DoF pose estimation for the UGV.

A landing approach vector field is proposed to guide the vehicle to a passing point near the runway. Dubin's Vehicle model-based 2D pre-simulation is used to predict the time remaining to the passing point and to generate the altitude command. The performance of the proposed algorithm is verified by simulations and flight tests.

AB The paper presents a cognitive strategy that enables an interconnected group of autonomous vehicles (moving robots) to search and localise a source of hazardous emissions (gas, biochemical particles) in a coordinated manner. Dispersion of the emitted substance is assumed to be affected by turbulence, resulting in the absence of concentration gradients. The key feature of the proposed search strategy is that it can be applied in a completely decentralised manner as long as the communication network of autonomous vehicles forms a connected graph. By decentralised operation we mean that each moving robot performs computations (i.e. source estimation and robot motion control) locally. Coordination is achieved by exchanging the data with the neighbours only, in a manner which does not require global knowledge of the communication network topology.

AB Connected and autonomous vehicle (CAV) technologies are expected to change driving/vehicle behavior on freeways. This study investigates the impact of CAVs on freeway capacity using a microsimulation tool. A four-lane basic freeway segment is selected as the case study through the Caltrans Performance Measurement System (PeMS). To obtain valid results, various driving behavior parameters are calibrated to the real traffic conditions for human-driven vehicles. In particular, the calibration is conducted using genetic algorithm. A revised Intelligent Driver Model (IDM) is developed and used as the car-following model for CAVs. The simulation is conducted on the basic freeway segment under different penetration rates of CAVs and different freeway speed limits. The results show that with an increase in the market penetration rate, freeway capacity increases, and will increase significantly as the speed limit increases.

AB The path planning of an autonomous surface vehicle in a lake for environmental monitoring has been modeled as a constrained case of the traveling salesman problem, in which the vehicle should visit a ring of beacons deployed at the shore of the lake for data exchange. The problem is solved using a genetic algorithm. The algorithm searches for the maximization of the area covered by the vehicle. Three types of fitness functions are studied related to each of the following cases: the unconstrained case, the constrained case with death penalty and the constrained case with a penalty factor. Moreover, the proposed approach is compared with other algorithms, such as brute force algorithms, the randomized algorithm and the greedy algorithm. The results show that genetic algorithm outperforms the other approaches by 15 and 3%, respectively.

AB This paper describes the 2008 and 2009 Antarctic deployments of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration ENDURANCE autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV). The goal of this project was to conduct three autonomous tasks beneath the ice cap 4m thick of West Lake Bonney: first, to measure the three-dimensional (3D) water chemistry of the lake at prespecified coordinates; second, to map the underwater face of the Taylor Glacier; third, to chart the bathymetry of the lake bottom. At the end of each mission the AUV had to locate and return through a hole in the ice slightly larger than the outer diameter of the vehicle. During two 10-week deployments to Antarctica, in the austral summers of 2008 and 2009, ENDURANCE logged 243 h of sub-ice operational time, conducted 275 aqueous chemistry sonde casts, completed a 3D bathymetry survey over an area of 1.06 km(2) at a resolution of 22 cm, and traversed 74 km beneath the ice cap of West Lake Bonney. Many of the characteristics and capabilities of ENDURANCE are similar to the behaviours that will be needed for sub-ice autonomous probes to Europa, Enceladus, and other outer-planet icy moons. These characteristics are also of great utility for terrestrial operations in which there is a need for an underwater vehicle to manoeuvre precisely to desired positions in 3D space or to manoeuvre and explore complicated 3D environments.

The proposed framework produces the fastest discrete-time trajectory for vehicles who want to cross an intersection. Constraints for safety are designed carefully in the optimization problem formulation to prevent potential collisions during intersection crossings. A novel vehicle-to-intersection (V2I) interaction mechanism is designed to handle imperfect communication characteristics such as packet delivery delay and loss. The proposed intersection management framework is evaluated by running extensive simulations using an open source vehicular network and microscopic traffic simulation software, Veins. The results show that the overall traffic control performance of the proposed framework is substantially better than conventional traffic light control framework, in particular when traffic volume is light and medium, even in situations with a realistic wireless vehicular network setting where packet delivery delays and drops occasionally occur.

AB At present, the topic of automated vehicles is one of the most promising research areas in the field of Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS). The use of automated vehicles for public transportation also contributes to reductions in congestion levels and to improvements in traffic flow. Moreover, electrical public autonomous vehicles are environmentally friendly, provide better air quality and contribute to energy conservation. The driverless public transportation systems, which are at present operating in some airports and train stations, are restricted to dedicated roads and exhibit serious trouble dynamically avoiding obstacles in the trajectory. In this paper, an electric autonomous mini-bus is presented. All datasets used in this article were collected during the experiments carried out in the demonstration event of the 2012 IEEE Intelligent Vehicles Symposium that took place in Alcala de Henares (Spain). The demonstration consisted of a route 725 metres long containing a list of latitude-longitude points (waypoints). The mini-bus was capable of driving autonomously from one waypoint to another using a GPS sensor. Furthermore, the vehicle is provided with a multi-beam Laser Imaging Detection and Ranging (LIDAR) sensor for surrounding reconstruction and obstacle detection. When an obstacle is detected in the planned path, the planned route is modified in order to avoid the obstacle and continue its way to the end of the mission. On the demonstration day, a total of 196 attendees had the opportunity to get a ride on the vehicles. A total of 28 laps were successfully completed in full autonomous mode in a private circuit located in the National Institute for Aerospace Research (INTA), Spain. In other words, the system completed 20.3 km of driverless navigation and obstacle avoidance.

DE Autonomous vehicles; computer vision; vehicle; safety; simulation.
AB Even though virtual testing of Autonomous Vehicles (AVs) has been well recognized as essential for safety assessment, AV simulators are still undergoing active development. One particular challenge is the problem of including the Sensing and Perception (S&P) subsystem into the virtual simulation loop in an efficient and effective manner. In this article, we define Perception Error Models (PEM), a virtual simulation component that can enable the analysis of the impact of perception errors on AV safety, without the need to model the sensors themselves. We propose a generalized data-driven procedure towards parametric modeling and evaluate it using Apollo, an open-source driving software, and nuScenes, a public AV dataset. Additionally, we implement PEMs in SVL, an open-source vehicle simulator. Furthermore, we demonstrate the usefulness of PEM-based virtual tests, by evaluating camera, LiDAR, and camera-LiDAR setups. Our virtual tests highlight limitations in the current evaluation metrics, and the proposed approach can help study the impact of perception errors on AV safety.

Many researchers have tried to make use of UAVs as an ideal platform for inspection, delivery, surveillance, and so on. In particular, machine learning has been applied to UAVs for autonomous flight that enables UAVs do designated task more efficiently. In this paper, we review the history and the classification of machine learning, and discuss the state-of-the-art machine learning that has been applied to UAVs for autonomous flight. We provide control strategies including parameter tuning, adaptive control for uncertain environment, and real-time path planning, and object recognition that have been described in the literature.

AB This paper describes a real-time motion planning algorithm, based on the rapidly-exploring random tree (RRT) approach, applicable to autonomous vehicles operating in an urban environment. Extensions to the standard RRT are predominantly motivated by: 1) the need to generate dynamically feasible plans in real-time; 2) safety requirements; 3) the constraints dictated by the uncertain operating (urban) environment. The primary novelty is in the use of closed-loop prediction in the framework of RRT. The proposed algorithm was at the core of the planning and control software for Team MIT's entry for the 2007 DARPA Urban Challenge, where the vehicle demonstrated the ability to complete a 60 mile simulated military supply mission, while safely interacting with other autonomous and human driven vehicles.

ID AUTONOMOUS UNDERWATER VEHICLE
AB Roll control of the Autonomous Underwater Vehicles (AUVs) is a significant issue in the current field of research for many researchers in the subject of AUV control system designation. Especially at higher speeds, the roll angle generated by a single rotating propeller or other external disturbances can considerably influence the whole dynamics and therefore the operation of the vehicle. In this paper, the utilisation of a system of contra-rotating-propellers (CRP) to enhance the roll dynamics of an AUV is evaluated by developing a six-degrees-of-freedom (6DOF) dynamics and control systems' simulator. The results show that: 1. The single propeller system can cause roll angle deflections affecting the heading angle and depth of AUV depending on the forward speed. 2. Using the contra-rotating system with a proper roll controller can enhance the roll dynamics of the vehicle, particularly for the real-time roll stabilisation and maneuvering goals.

ID MODEL-PREDICTIVE CONTROL; CHALLENGE
AB One approach to motion control of autonomous vehicles is to divide control between path planning and path tracking. This paper introduces an alternative control framework that integrates local path planning and path tracking using model predictive control (MPC). The controller plans trajectories, consisting of position and velocity states, that best follow a desired path while remaining within two safe envelopes. One envelope corresponds to conditions for stability and the other to obstacle avoidance. This enables the controller to safely and minimally deviate from a nominal path if necessary to avoid spinning out or colliding with an obstacle. A long prediction horizon allows action in the present to avoid a dangerous situation in the future. This motivates the use of a first-order hold discretization method that maintains model fidelity and computational feasibility. The controller is implemented in real-time on an experimental vehicle for several driving scenarios. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The aim of this paper is to develop robust control schemes for the lateral motion of underactuated autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs). The AUV complex dynamics makes their control a challenging task. These challenges include the AUV nonlinear dynamics, unmodeled dynamics, system uncertainties and environmental disturbances. The objective of the proposed control schemes is to solve the trajectory tracking problem of AUVs. These controllers are designed using the concepts of terminal sliding mode control. The control performance of an example AUV (the REMUS AUV), using the proposed control schemes, is evaluated through computer simulations. The simulation results show that the proposed control schemes work well. Moreover, simulation studies are given to evaluate the performance of the proposed control schemes when bounded disturbances are acting on the vehicle. These studies indicate that the proposed control schemes are robust under bounded disturbances.

ID ARCHITECTURE; SYSTEMS
AB This paper reports our results in using a discrete fault diagnosis system Livingstone 2 (L2), onboard an autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) Autosub 6000. Due to the difficulty of communicating between an AUV and its operators, AUVs can benefit particularly from increased autonomy, of which fault diagnosis is a part. However, they are also restricted in their power consumption. We show that a discrete diagnosis system can detect and identify a number of faults that would threaten the health of an AUV, while also being sufficiently lightweight computationally to be deployed onboard the vehicle. Since AUVs also often have their missions designed just before deployment in response to data from previous missions, a diagnosis system that monitors the software as well as the hardware of the system is also very useful. We show how a software diagnosis model can be built automatically that can be integrated with the hardware model to diagnose the complete system. We show empirically that on Autosub 6000 this allows us to diagnose real vehicle faults that could potentially lead to the loss of the vehicle.

AB Vehicle localisation is an important and challenging task in achieving autonomous driving. This work presents a box particle filter framework for vehicle self-localisation in the presence of sensor and map uncertainties. The proposed feature-refined box particle filter incorporates line features extracted from a multi-layer Light Detection And Ranging (LiDAR) sensor and information from OpenStreetMap to estimate vehicle states. A particle weight balance strategy is incorporated to account for the OpenStreetMap positional inaccuracy, which is assessed by comparing it to a high definition road map. The performance of the proposed framework is evaluated on a LiDAR dataset and compared with box particle filter variants. Experimental results show that the proposed framework achieves respectively 10% and 53% localisation performance improvement with reduced box volumes of 25% and 41%, when compared with the state-of-the-art interval analysis based box regularisation particle filter and the box particle filter.

AB Delay and lag deteriorate path tracking accuracy and system stability. If not properly compensated, they can cause instability or limit the driving speed of autonomous vehicles. This paper presents a preview steering control design considering both communication delay and steering lag to achieve accurate, smooth, and computationally efficient path tracking for highly automated vehicles. Two strategies are adopted for the delay: forward state predictor and delay augmentation. The steering lag is approximated by a first-order lag system. The path tracking problem with delay and lag is solved by the preview control theory. The resulted controller is in an analytical form and is computationally efficient for online implementation. We also analyze the system stability and closed-loop responses in both the time and frequency domain. The control is implemented on an automated vehicle platform and tested inside Mcity and on open roads. Experimental results showed lower tracking errors and significantly improved stability margin compared to the controls ignoring delay and lag.

AB Autonomous driving has gained momentum in recent years. To help create a sustainable future, an autonomous vehicle should take into account its carbon footprint. This work proposes a new, portable, cost-effective carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions sensor installed in a Light Duty Vehicle (LDV), as a novel enabler towards carbon footprint aware autonomous driving. This work achieves the ability to report real-time metrics about the instantaneous CO2 emissions whilst satisfying non-invasive procedures (weight <1 kg) by means of Unified Diagnostic Services (UDS) compliant interrogators. The proposed solution is validated in compliance with European Union's official emissions test procedures, and compared with other commercial off-the-shelf solutions. During the test, a 50 km trip divided in 3 driving cycles is performed to obtain the instantaneous CO2 emission, achieving a measuring rate similar to other commercial, non-portable and expensive alternatives.

ID LATERAL CONTROL
AB Steering angle and driving force saturations are inevitable in autonomous vehicle motions, which will degrade the motion control performance and even deteriorate the driving safety. In addition, the strong coupling of lateral and longitudinal motions of autonomous vehicles also contributes to the saturations damage and increases the control difficulty. To reduce these negative impacts on motion control, a novel motion controller for automated vehicles is presented in this paper. Firstly, an extended 3 degree of freedom vehicle dynamic model is built with the unknown saturations, strong-coupled motion characteristics and external disturbance considered simultaneously. Then, a coordinated controller is designed to complete motion control task based on sliding-mode control (SMC) and non-singular fast terminal sliding-mode control (NFTSM). Moreover, a three-layer radial basis function neural network (RBFNN) is adopted as a compensator to approximate modelling uncertainties. Based on Lyapunov stability theory, the uniform ultimate boundednesses of motion control errors are guaranteed. Simulation results show that the proposed controller owns smaller steady-state errors and faster convergence speed.

AB Unmanned aerial vehicles capable of hazardous terrain landing are desirable for intelligence collection. A crucial point is the landing gear's autonomous adaptation to the rough surface, which is especially difficult in an unknown and constrained environment. To enable this capability, this paper proposes a novel biomimetic system that ascertains terrain appearances like large obstacles and precipitous slope using a monocular camera and adjusts the mechatronics landing structure according to the terrain. A dynamic model including the ground effect is provided and a time-to-contact theory-based backstepping non-linear controller is designed to reject uncertainty disturbances as well as implement a bio-inspired guidance strategy for soft landing in hazardous terrain. The mechatronic architecture and cascade control structure using custom-built unmanned air vehicle platform are presented. Experimental results and video footage demonstrate this biomimetic approach efficiently controls a vehicle successfully landing in an unknown and unstructured constrained environment.

AB By deploying unmanned surface vehicles (USVs), the efficiency and reliability of mission execution can be improved. This paper is concerned with the problem of formation autonomous navigation system (FANS) for USVs. The decision layer of the system is composed of path planning subsystem and navigation control subsystem to realize fast and effective autonomous navigation system. The FANS is constructed by leader-follower structure and distributed control strategy, which make the individuals in the formation have certain autonomy. The dynamic domain tunable fast marching square algorithm proposed in the path planning subsystem can not only adjust the safety and length of the path planned, but also continuously re-plan the path according to the motion information of the USV formation and target-vessels. Navigation control subsystem based on finite control set model predictive control can quickly and safely guide and control formation in local sea environment. The simulation tests are carried out in static and dynamic harbor environments respectively, which verifies the ability of the FANS to achieve stable formation tracking and autonomous safe navigation.

AB Autonomous driving has become a prevalent research topic in recent years, arousing the attention of many academic universities and commercial companies. As human drivers rely on visual information to discern road conditions and make driving decisions, autonomous driving calls for vision systems such as vehicle detection models. These vision models require a large amount of labeled data while collecting and annotating the real traffic data are time-consuming and costly. Therefore, we present a novel vehicle detection framework based on the parallel vision to tackle the above issue, using the specially designed virtual data to help train the vehicle detection model. We also propose a method to construct large-scale artificial scenes and generate the virtual data for the vision-based autonomous driving schemes. Experimental results verify the effectiveness of our proposed framework, demonstrating that the combination of virtual and real data has better performance for training the vehicle detection model than the only use of real data.

AB This paper addresses the development of the remote of autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV), and proposes an energy conservation control strategy of AUV for ocean search. Combining the expected effect of motion planning and control execution, we build optimal "planning-control" systems of AUV based on rolling optimization, and propose the optimization methods: multi-step forecast planning and single-step control execution. At every moment, planner outputs target quantities, and the AUV model and controller give forecast outputs. Optimization is made to get optimal quantities of the state sequence, according to which a beat control is performed. Simulations are conducted, and the results show that the path is of optimal energy consumption, and the control strategy reduces the volatility of the control quantities and the risk of autonomous obstacle avoidance caused by external disturbances.

DE Autonomous navigation; evolutionary artificial neural network
AB This work addresses the evolution of an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) to assist in the problem of autonomous navigation of a vehicle in urban environments. We propose a system architecture based on the use of two ANNs, one is trained for image processing, in charge of road recognition and employing template matching. The other ANN is evolved to perform the navigation control. The paper focuses on the evolved ANN, which provides steering and speed control to the autonomous vehicle, corroborating with the Evolutionary Robotic research area and showing its practical viability. The proposed system was tested in several experiments, evaluating not only the impact of different evolutionary computation parameters but also the role of the transfer functions on the evolution of the ANN. Results show that slight variations in the parameters lead to huge differences on the accuracy of the evolutionary process.

AB Lateral dynamics are critical for high-level autonomous driving, and multistep forecasting can significantly improve vehicle safety. However, the dynamics prediction method is rarely announced due to the difficulty of accurate prediction. In contrast to conventional time-series prediction, this article proposes a novel method for predicting a dynamical system with implicit parameters. Specifically, we construct an echo state model (ESM) incorporating a rational data organization and an efficient neural network structure. We observe the fading information property (FIP) of dynamic vehicle parameters and use temporal data to construct equivalent states for implicit parameters. Finally, a gated recurrent unit (GRU) neural network is designed and trained to accomplish the complex mapping of a vehicle dynamical system. Its performance is compared to that of several benchmark networks. The proposed method is capable of performing four-step-ahead prediction with high accuracy in both dry and slippery road conditions, implying the increased potential for some safe and comfortable driving applications of autonomous vehicles.

AB This study presents a novel method that can be used to perform dynamic motion planning for a nonholonomic four-wheeler vehicle according to actual dynamic constraints to achieve a rapid response in the driving environment and obtain optimal vehicle performance. The proposed intuitive steering model employs inferential heuristics of driving behavior and relevant two-direction indices obtained from a driver's-perspective view instead of traditional path planning to quickly and efficiently generate target paths without the requirement of complicated mathematical calculations. In the full model of a nonholonomic vehicle, a chassis with Ackerman steering geometry and double-wishbone suspension, lateral and longitudinal forces from contact strains, and forces due to the suspension system are considered to verify the motion of an autonomous vehicle from its starting position to its destination. Simulations of lane changes and U-turn maneuvers reveal that the proposed method provides a feasible trajectory in real time. The path planning method is effective for many driving scenarios, provides high dynamic performance, and maintains high maneuverability. This method is intuitive and extensible, thus allowing vehicles to navigate in real time and adapt to dynamic environmental conditions.

ID TRAJECTORY PREDICTION
AB Predicting the trajectories of surrounding vehicles plays an important role in the driving safety of autonomous vehicles. It impacts the decision making, path planning, and vehicle motion control process in autonomous vehicles. However, due to the uncertainty of vehicle dynamics, driving intention, and the complexity of the surrounding environment, there are interactions between vehicles and other issues, and their motion prediction faces great challenges. This paper proposes a trajectory prediction algorithm combining driving intention classification and environmental interaction correction to overcome the leading vehicle movement prediction problem. In order to solve the problems of uncertainty in predicting vehicle driving intention and nonlinearity between future vehicle movements and the environment, a driving intention recognition based on the Fuzzy C-mean algorithm and a forward vehicle motion prediction algorithm combining multi-model prediction results are proposed. The artificial potential field method is also used to model vehicle interaction and correct the trajectory prediction results. Finally, the real vehicle data validation proves that this algorithm has high prediction accuracy.

This handshake of electronics and mechanical systems makes a vehicle smart, and comfortable; driver assistance for achieving this involves data exchange and surroundings sensing. Devices such as sensors, telematics, protocols, etc., are responsible for data exchange and data sensing. This process contains some loopholes that are the preliminary sources for the attacker to attack the vulnerable devices to control the vehicle. This article provides a review of possible attacks and defenses on autonomous and connected vehicles. The attacker's area of autonomous and connected vehicles is classified into three categories that are safety system attacks, connectivity attacks, and diagnostics attacks, and provided all possible defenses for those attacks. In addition, we provided an analysis of the domain to understand the scenarios in this domain, recommendations, and future scope in this area for further work.

AB Connected and autonomous vehicles (CAVs) have witnessed significant attention from industries, and academia for research and developments towards the on-road realisation of the technology. State-of-the-art CAVs utilise existing navigation systems for mobility and travel path planning. However, reliable connectivity to navigation systems is not guaranteed, particularly in urban road traffic environments with high-rise buildings, nearby roads and multi-level flyovers. In this connection, this paper presents TAKEN-Traffic Knowledge-based Navigation for enabling CAVs in urban road traffic environments. A traffic analysis model is proposed for mining the sensor-oriented traffic data to generate a precise navigation path for the vehicle. A knowledge-sharing method is developed for collecting and generating new traffic knowledge from on-road vehicles. CAVs navigation is executed using the information enabled by traffic knowledge and analysis. The experimental performance evaluation results attest to the benefits of TAKEN in the precise navigation of CAVs in urban traffic environments.

AB Driving experiences provided by the introduction of new vehicle technologies are directly impacting the criteria for road network design. New criteria should be taken into consideration by designers, researchers and car owners in order to assure traffic safety in changed conditions that will appear with, for example, introduction of Autonomous Vehicles (AVs) in everyday traffic. In this paper, roundabout safety level is analysed on the originally developed microsimulation model in circumstances where different numbers of AVs vehicles are mixed with Conventional Vehicles (CVs). Field data about speed and traffic volumes from existing roundabouts in Croatia were used for development of the model. The simulations done with the Surrogate Safety Assessment Model (SSAM) give some relevant highlights on how the introduction of AVs could change both operational and safety parameters at roundabouts. To further explore the effects on safety of roundabouts with the introduction of different shares of AVs, hypothetical safety treatments could be tested to explore whether their effects may change, leading to the estimation of a new set of Crash Modification Factors.

ID MODEL-PREDICTIVE CONTROL; SCHEME; SET
AB This article addresses the tracking control problem of 3-D trajectories for underactuated underwater robotic vehicles operating in a constrained workspace including obstacles. More specifically, a robust nonlinear model predictive control (NMPC) scheme is presented for the case of underactuated autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) (i.e., unicycle-like vehicles actuated only in the surge, heave, and yaw). The purpose of the controller is to steer the unicycle-like AUV to the desired trajectory with guaranteed input and state constraints (e.g., obstacles, predefined vehicle velocity bounds, and thruster saturations) inside a partially known and dynamic environment where the knowledge of the operating workspace is constantly updated via the vehicle's onboard sensors. In particular, considering the sensing range of the vehicle, obstacle avoidance with any of the detected obstacles is guaranteed by the online generation of a collision-free trajectory tracking path, despite the model dynamic uncertainties and the presence of external disturbances representing ocean currents and waves. Finally, realistic simulation studies verify the performance and efficiency of the proposed framework. Note to Practitioners-This article was motivated by the problem of robust trajectory tracking for an autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) operating in an uncertain environment where the knowledge of the operating workspace (e.g., obstacle positions) is constantly updated online via the vehicle's onboard sensors (e.g., multibeam imaging sonars and laser-based vision systems). In addition, there may be other system limitations (e.g., thruster saturation limits) and other operational constraints, induced by the need of various common underwater tasks (e.g., a predefined vehicle speed limit for inspecting the seabed, and mosaicking), where it should also be considered into the control strategy. However, based on the existing trajectory tracking control approaches for underwater robotics, there is a lack of an autonomous control scheme that provides a complete and credible control strategy that takes the aforementioned issues into consideration. Based on this, we present a reliable control strategy that takes into account the aforementioned issues, along with dynamic uncertainties of the model and the presence of ocean currents. In future research, we will extend the proposed methodology for multiple AUV performing collaborative inspection tasks in an uncertain environment.

AB A motion planning method for autonomous vehicles confronting emergency situations where collision is inevitable, generating a path to mitigate the crash as much as possible, is proposed in this paper. The Model predictive control (MPC) algorithm is adopted here for motion planning. If avoidance is impossible for the model predictive motion planning system, the potential crash severity, and artificial potential field are filled into the controller objective to achieve general obstacle avoidance and the lowest crash severity. Furthermore, the vehicle dynamic is also considered as an optimal control problem. Based on the analysis mentioned earlier, the model predictive controller can optimize the command following, obstacle avoidance, vehicle dynamics, road regulation, and mitigate the inevitable crash based on the predicted values. The proposed MPC algorithm has been proved by simulation to have the ability to avoid obstacles and mitigate the crash if collision is inevitable.

AB Trajectory planning and trajectory tracking constitute two important functions of an autonomous overtaking system and a variety of strategies have been proposed in the literature for both functionalities. However, uncertainties in environment perception using the current generation of sensors has resulted in most proposed methods being applicable only during low-speed overtaking. In this paper, trajectory planning and trajectory tracking approaches for autonomous overtaking systems are reviewed. The trajectory planning techniques are compared based on aspects such as real-time implementation, computational requirements, and feasibility in real-world scenarios. This review shows that two important aspects of trajectory planning for high-speed overtaking are: (i) inclusion of vehicle dynamics and environmental constraints and (ii) accurate knowledge of the environment and surrounding obstacles. The review of trajectory tracking controllers for high-speed driving is based on different categories of control algorithms where their respective advantages and disadvantages are analysed. This study shows that while advanced control methods improve tracking performance, in most cases the results are valid only within well regulated conditions. Therefore, existing autonomous overtaking solutions assume precise knowledge of surrounding environment which is not representative of real-world driving. The paper also discusses how in a connected driving environment, vehicles can access additional information that can expand their perception. Hence, the potential of cooperative information sharing for aiding autonomous high-speed overtaking manoeuvre is identified as a possible solution. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

DE Motion Control; Kinematics; Field Robots
AB Moving path frames assigned to spatial curves are commonly used in the development of motion control laws for autonomous vehicles. This work presents the Gravity Normal frame, a novel navigation reference frame developed specifically for autonomous vehicle applications. This moving path frame incorporates the knowledge that many autonomous vehicles operate in a gravitational field, and control strategies must account for this. Given a curve in space that represents a desired trajectory, the proposed strategy generates a navigation frame that is well defined regardless of path curvature, while guaranteeing the normal vector is always normal to gravity and hence constrained to the horizontal plane, regardless of path torsion. Due to these characteristics, the Gravity Normal path frame is ideally suited for vehicles with distinct longitudinal and lateral dynamics since the resulting cross-track errors have a precise physical interpretation. The properties of the navigation frame are derived, and its usefulness is showcased through simulation. Finally, its applicability is demonstrated with flight experiments on a fixed-wing unmanned aerial vehicle.

AB This paper addresses the problem of mapping likely locations of a chemical source using an autonomous vehicle operating in a fluid flow. The paper reviews biological plume-tracing concepts, reviews previous strategies for vehicle-based plume tracing, and presents a new plume mapping approach based on hidden Markov methods (HMMs). HMMs provide efficient algorithms for predicting the likelihood of odor detection versus position, the likelihood of source location versus position, the most likely path taken by the odor to a given location, and the path between two points most likely to result in odor detection. All four are useful for solving the odor source localization problem using an autonomous vehicle. The vehicle is assumed to be capable of detecting above threshold chemical concentration and sensing the fluid flow velocity at the vehicle location. The fluid now is assumed to vary with space and time, and to have a high Reynolds number (Re > 10).

AB This paper presents a novel cooperative trajectory planning approach for semi-autonomous driving. The machine interacts with the driver at the decision level and the trajectory generation level. To minimize conflicts between the machine and the human, the trajectory planning problem is decomposed into a high-level behavior decision-making problem and a low-level trajectory planning problem. The approach infers the driver's behavioral semantics according to the driving context and the driver's input. The trajectories are generated based on the behavioral semantics and driver's input. The feasibility of the proposed approach is validated by real vehicle experiments. The results prove that the proposed human-machine cooperative trajectory planning approach can successfully help the driver to avoid collisions while respecting the driver's behavior.

AB This paper addresses the stabilization of a class of nonlinear systems in the presence of disturbances, using switching controllers. To this effect we introduce two new classes of switched systems and provide conditions under which they are input-to-state practically stable (lSpS). By exploiting these results, a methodology for control systems design-called switched seesaw control-is obtained that allows for the development of nonlinear control laws yielding input-to-state stability. The range of applicability and the efficacy of the methodology proposed are illustrated via two nontrivial design examples. Namely, stabilization of the extended nonholonomic double integrator (ENDI) and stabilization of an underactuated autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) in the presence of input disturbances and measurement noise.

AB A simultaneous path following and lateral stability control method was presented for four-wheel independent drive and four-wheel independent steering (4WD-4WS) autonomous electric vehicles based on Hamilton energy function with the actuator saturation being considered in this paper. The hierarchical control strategy including upper layer controller and lower layer controller is used for simultaneous path following and lateral stability control. In the upper layer controller, the vehicle motion controller is designed using Hamilton energy function control theory and the convergence and stability of controller was proved, the control demand of simultaneous path following and lateral stability was obtained and messaged to the lower layer controller. In the lower layer controller, the orientated tire force allocation method was used to execute the control demand by real-time tire force allocation control of four wheels. The simulations are performed in the CarSim-Simulink co-simulation platform, and the effectiveness of proposed control method was verified.

AB Safe driving and minimizing the number of casualties are the main motivations of researchers and car companies for decades. They also care very much on saving fuel consumption and high comfort-level trips. With the help of advanced driver assistance systems (ADAS) applications, safer, more comfortable, and greener trips are very likely at the present time. However, today humankind is very close to make a very old dream, namely, driverless vehicles, to come true. In this paper, we address the concept of next-generation vehicles, their requirements, challenges, advantages, and problems. Regarding Society of Automotive Engineers (SAE), levels (1-5), we first define the crucial contexts for next-generation vehicles. We then discuss existing ADAS, their abilities, and available platforms which they run on from past to present. Next, we introduce a novel vehicle intelligence (VI) architecture consisting of ADAS modules and VI services which would pave the way for fully autonomous vehicles regarding not only driving issue, but also human-centric new demands such as entertainment and comfort level of the journey. The proposed conceptual design is built on sensors, vehicle ad hoc networks (VANETs), and big data. Afterward, we describe how current ADAS applications would transform on the way toward SAE Level 5 cars. We finally discuss the open issues for next-generation vehicles.

AB In this paper a method for detecting and estimating the distance of a vehicle driving in front using a single black-box camera installed in a vehicle was proposed. In order to apply the proposed method to autonomous vehicles, it was required to reduce the throughput and speed-up the processing. To do this, the proposed method decomposed the input image into multiple-resolution images for real-time processing and then extracted the aggregated channel features (ACFs). The idea was to extract only the most important features from images at different resolutions symmetrically. A method of detecting an object and a method of estimating a vehicle's distance from a bird's eye view through inverse perspective mapping (IPM) were applied. In the proposed method, ACFs were used to generate the AdaBoost-based vehicle detector. The ACFs were extracted from the LUV color, edge gradient, and orientation (histograms of oriented gradients) of the input image. Subsequently, by applying IPM and transforming a 2D input image into 3D by generating an image projected in three dimensions, the distance between the detected vehicle and the autonomous vehicle was detected. The proposed method was applied in a real-world road environment and showed accurate results for vehicle detection and distance estimation in real-time processing. Thus, it was showed that our method is applicable to autonomous vehicles.

AB This article investigates the completely unknown autonomous vehicle tracking issues with actuator faults through model-free adaptive dynamic programming (MFADP) approaches. Because partial parameters are measured difficultly or inaccurately, the model-based control theories are imperfect for the vehicles. Therefore, the proposed multiplayer optimal control method in this work, which is not necessary to know the prior system knowledge, achieves the purpose of unknown vehicle tracking control via a novel MFADP theory. Besides, the control strategies are robust, which contain adaptive regulators to eliminate the disturbance of the vehicle systems caused by actuator faults, modeling errors, and curvature interference. To reduce the computational burden of control, a single neural network (NN) architecture is constructed with minimal computational cost and fast response speed. In addition, the convergence analysis of the NN structure, the stability and robustness analysis of identification, and the control schemes in this work are supplied. Finally, two driving scenario simulations are shown to prove the effectiveness of the established controller.

AB The aim of this article is to describe estimates of data difficulty and aspects of the data viewpoint within Vehicle-to-Infrastructure (V2I) communication in the Smart Mobility concept. The historical development of the database system's architecture, that stores and processes a larger amount of data, is currently sufficient and effective for the needs of today's society. The goal of vehicle manufacturers is the continual increase in driving comfort and the use of multiple sensors to sense the vehicle's surroundings, as well as to help the driver in critical situations avoid danger. The increasing number of sensors is directly related to the amount of data generated by the vehicle. In the automotive industry, it is crucial that autonomous vehicles can process data in real time or can locate itself in precise accuracy, for the decision-making process. To meet these requirements, we will describe HD maps as a key segment of autonomous control. It alerts the reader to the need to address the issue of real-time Big Data processing, which represents an important role in the concept of Smart Mobility.

AB Traffic congestion relates to an excess of vehicles on a portion of the road at a particular time, and generates slower speeds, longer trip times, pollution and increased vehicular queueing. Traffic congestions at intersection areas are a significant problem in many cities around the world. One aspect which can be taken into consideration for road traffic optimization is the moment the vehicles accelerate at traffic lights. Because most automobiles implement the standard AUTOSAR (Automotive Open System Architecture), the paper presents in the beginning a synopsis of the functionality and usability of the AUTOSAR time synchronization concept which allows each individual vehicle to have all the electronic control units time-synchronized within it. Therefore, each vehicle would be able to activate in an optimized way the acceleration feature. The MATLAB Simulink simulation results illustrate what is expected from the implementation of the concept in such a scenario: combining the advanced driver-assistance systems with the current concept would seem beneficial in reducing traffic congestion in traffic light intersections for autonomous vehicles by taking advantage of the knowledge of the precise time when the lights will change.

AB As the number of vehicles in traffic is increasing day by day, the accident rates and driving effort are significantly raising. For this reason, ensuring safety and driving comfort is becoming more and more important. Driver assistance systems are the most common systems that are adopted for this purpose. With the development of technology, lane tracking support and adaptive cruise control systems are now being sold as standard equipment. More advanced research is being done for fully autonomous driving. One of the most critical parts of autonomous driving is speed profile planning. In this paper, a curvature-based predictive speed planner is designed using a fuzzy logic strategy. In addition to the predictive curvature value, lateral error to the planned path is considered for the final decision. With the help of the proposed predictive nature, which is not included in classical curvature-based planners, the vehicle is able to reduce the speed before cornering. Similarly, it starts increasing the speed when it is still in a curve but very near to the straight part of the road. In order to illustrate the efficiency of the proposed method and compare it with other approaches, the simulations are performed using realistic vehicle dynamics models of CarMaker software. After the comparative analysis, the designed planner is utilized on a real 1/10 scaled autonomous vehicle platform to show its real-world performance. The results show that the proposed speed planner is an effective and promising algorithm for both the comfort and path tracking performance.

AB Autonomous control of UAVs has become a popular research topic in recent years. This paper is concerned with the flight of UAVs (Unmanned Aerial Vehicles) and proposes fuzzy logic based autonomous flight and landing system controllers. Three fuzzy logic modules are developed under the main navigation control system and three more for the autonomous landing control system to control of the altitude, the speed, and the position against the runway, through which the global position (latitude-longitude) of the air vehicle is controlled A SID (Standard Instrument Departure) and TA CAN (Tactical Air Navigation) approach is used and the performance of the fuzzy-based controllers is evaluated with time based diagrams under MATLAB's standard configuration and the Aerosim Aeronautical Simulation Block Set which provides a complete set of tools for rapid development of detailed 6 degree-of-freedom nonlinear generic manned/unmanned aerial vehicle models. The Aerosonde UAV model is used in the simulations in order to demonstrate the performance and the potential of the controllers. Additionally, some visual tools are deployed in order to get visual outputs that aid the designer in the evaluation of the controllers. Despite the simple design procedure, the simulated test flights indicate the capability of the approach in achieving the desired performance.

DE Autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV); altitude-keeping; control; variable
   ballast system (VBS)
AB This paper proposes a novel proportional-integral-derivative (PID) control approach that enables variable ballast systems on an autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) to complement the underwater vehicle's hydroplanes when altitude-keeping over a variable seabed. This control approach is tested on an AUV computer simulator that features a variable ballast system model, which includes the capacity for free flow of seawater into and out of the ballast tank. The new control approach uses hydroplane deflection angle feedback as inputs to the variable ballast system controller in combination with a lowpass filter to ensure that the variable ballast system does not react to high hydroplane deflection rates and unnecessarily deplete the underwater vehicle's onboard energy supply. For the conditions modeled in this research, the resulting simulation case studies showed that this control approach enables the variable ballast system to effectively return control authority back to the hydroplanes while altitude-keeping to a variable seabed.

AB This paper designed an end-to-end image segmentation method for side-scan sonar mounted on Autonomous Underwater Vehicle (AUV) to obtain accurate results. Accurate segmentation results depend on precise feature extraction, and an effective segmentation network can guarantee the autonomous recognition ability of Autonomous Underwater Vehicle (AUV) when performing tasks. In this paper, the R-2 CNN module is used to obtain accurate sonar image features, which reduces errors and improves accuracy. Besides, the Self-guidance module was introduced to ensure the network's stability and optimize the segmentation results. The experimental results show that the proposed method can achieve better segmentation results than UNet, SegNet and their derivative networks and has better generalization ability.

ID SIMULATION
AB With the advent of self-driving autonomous vehicles, vehicle controllers are free to drive their own velocities. This feature can be exploited to drive an optimal velocity trajectory that minimizes fuel consumption. Two typical approaches to drive cycle optimization are velocity smoothing and tractive energy minimization. The former reduces accelerations and decelerations, and hence, it does not require information of vehicle parameters and resistance forces. On the other hand, the latter reduces tractive energy demand at the wheels of a vehicle. In this work, utilizing an experimentally validated full vehicle simulation software, we show that for conventional gasoline vehicles the lower energy velocity trajectory can consume as much fuel as the velocity smoothing case. This implies that the easily implementable, vehicle agnostic velocity smoothing optimization can be used for velocity optimization rather than the nonlinear tractive energy minimization, which results in a pulse-and-glide trajectory.

AB Autonomous vehicles-based storage and retrieval systems (AVS/RS) have been shown to offer greater flexibility to improve cycle time and throughput capacity in the transfer of unit loads in high-density storage areas of warehouses. In these systems, loads are transferred by autonomous vehicles that move horizontally along aisles and cross-aisles within a tier, while lifts support vertical movement of loads between tiers. For analytical tractability, prior studies on performance evaluation of AVS/RS have ignored the blocking effects of vehicles and lifts while estimating throughput capacity and cycle times. To evaluate the effects of blocking on system performance, this paper first develops protocols to address vehicle blocking that are subsequently incorporated in a detailed simulation model. The blocking effects are studied for a variety of tier configurations that differ in depth/width ratio, number of locations, number of available vehicles, and transaction arrival rates. Results suggest that blocking delays could account for 2%-20% of the transaction cycle times.

AB Autonomous guided vehicles are becoming extremely important in the mining industry. The underground environment is unique and complex in that the lighting conditions are poor, the roads are difficult to traverse, and no GPS can accurately receive signals in these areas. This paper analyzes the characteristics of commonly used positioning methods given that ordinary positioning and navigation methods do not work effectively underground. We outline the composition and principles in underground guidance of autonomous vehicles using the laser-based positioning system. This system is unique in that it draws on the premise of barcode theory, which allows for a feasible relative navigation system even without a GPS. Algorithms were developed to provide real-time control for an autonomous guided scraper. In the vehicle experiment, the scraper was able to autonomously move along the simulated laneway, and the trial average range longitudinal error was only 15 cm in a 40-m distance. Hence, this new type of positioning and navigation system can accurately and reliably guide vehicles. Crown Copyright (C) 2011 Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB A novel approach to location estimation by omni-directional vision for autonomous vehicle navigation in indoor environments using circular landmark information is proposed. A circular-shaped landmark is attached on a ceiling and an omni-directional camera is equipped on a vehicle to take upward-looking omni-directional images of the landmark. This way of image taking reduces possible landmark shape occlusion and image noise creation, which come from the existence of nearby objects or humans surrounding the vehicle. It is shown that the perspective shape of the circular landmark in the omnidirectional image may be approximated by an ellipse by analytic formulas with good shape-fitting effect and fast computation speed. The parameters of the ellipse are then used for estimating the location of the vehicle with good precision for navigation guidance. Both simulated and real images were tested and good experimental results confirm the feasibility of the proposed approach. (c) 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Obstacle avoidance and available road identification technologies have been investigated for autonomous driving of an unmanned vehicle. In order to apply research results to autonomous driving in real environments, it is necessary to consider moving objects. This article proposes a preprocessing method to identify the dynamic zones where moving objects exist around an unmanned vehicle. This method accumulates three-dimensional points from a light detection and ranging sensor mounted on an unmanned vehicle in voxel space. Next, features are identified from the cumulative data at high speed, and zones with significant feature changes are estimated as zones where dynamic objects exist. The approach proposed in this article can identify dynamic zones even for a moving vehicle and processes data quickly using several features based on the geometry, height map and distribution of three-dimensional space data. The experiment for evaluating the performance of proposed approach was conducted using ground truth data on simulation and real environment data set.

AB Pedestrian understanding of driver intent is key to pedestrian safety on the road and in parking lots. With the development of autonomous vehicles (AVs), the human driver will be removed, and with it, the exchange that occurs between drivers and pedestrians (e.g., head nods, hand gestures). One possible solution for augmenting that communication is an array of high-intensity light-emitting diodes (LEDs) to project vehicle-to-pedestrian (V2P) messages on the ground plane behind a reversing vehicle. This would be particularly beneficial to elderly pedestrians, who are at particular risk of being struck by reversing cars in parking lots. Their downward gaze and slower reaction time make them particularly vulnerable. A survey was conducted to generate designs, and a simulator experiment was conducted to measure detection and reaction times. The study found that elderly pedestrians are significantly more likely to detect an additional projected message on the ground than detect the existing brake light alone when walking in a parking lot.

AB This paper addresses the design of an adaptive sliding mode control for an autonomous underwater vehicle with the objective to reject bounded internal and external perturbations. The proposed control is used to achieve velocity regulation and autonomous path-following using waypoints. Each task is successfully performed in the presence of parametric uncertainties and irrotational water currents. Due to complex dynamics and random external perturbations, underwater vehicles need robust control. The closed-loop stability and finite-time convergence of the system are demonstrated using the Lyapunov direct method. To provide a detailed and realistic testing environment for the proposed adaptive controller, a dynamic model of the vehicle using the Lagrange method is derived where all underwater effects are included. On that basis, the proposed adaptive sliding mode controller is compared to its non-adaptive equivalent and PD (Proportional Derivative) computed torque control. The simulation results demonstrate that the proposed adaptive control has better robustness and precision for this particular type of vehicle.

AB This paper is concerned with the leader-follower formation control of multiple underactuated autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs). In the proposed leader-follower control, the follower tracks a reference trajectory based on the leader position and predetermined formation without the need for leader's velocity and dynamics. This is desirable in marine robotics due to weak underwater communication and low bandwidth. A virtual vehicle is constructed such that its trajectory converges to the reference trajectory of the follower. Position tracking control is designed for the follower to track the virtual vehicle using Lyapunov and backstepping synthesis. Approximation-based control technique is employed to handle the model parametric uncertainties and unknown disturbances for the follower. The residual error between vehicles within the formation is proven to converge to a bounded compact set and control performance is guaranteed by suitably choosing the design parameters. Extensive simulations are provided to demonstrate the effectiveness of the approaches presented. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

ID BOUNDEDNESS; LIMITATIONS
AB Grouping vehicles into platoon is an effective method of increasing the road capacity of vehicles. Thereby there are autonomous vehicle platoon systems. In this paper, a platoon system consisting of a leading vehicle and N following vehicles is considered. The dynamic model containing the uncertainty is established subject to the physical laws. The uncertainty is time-varying and bounded with unknown bound. Our objective is to design a control to guarantee uniform ultimate boundedness and collision avoidance. This is then formulated as a one-sided constraint-following control problem. Employing swarm properties, Udwadia-Kalaba theory and a state transformation, an exponential type adaptive robust control approach for each following vehicle is brought forward. The proposed control renders the platoon system uniform boundedness and uniform ultimate boundedness in the presence of the uncertainty. The performances of compact formation and collision avoidance are also achieved.

AB With the rapid development of various new types of services, autonomous driving has received extensive attention. Due to the dense traffic flow, the limited battery life and computing power of the vehicles, intelligent vehicles are unable to support some computationally intensive and urgent tasks. Autonomous driving imposes strict requirements on the response time of the task. Due to the strong computing power and proximity to the terminal of mobile edge computing (MEC) and the arrival of 5G, the task can be unloaded to MEC, and data can be exchanged in milliseconds, which can reduce the task execution time. However, the resources of the MEC server are still very limited. Therefore we proposed a scheduling algorithm that takes into account the special task of the autopilot. Tasks will select the appropriate edge cloud execution and schedule the execution sequence on the edge cloud by the scheduling algorithm. At the same time, we take the mobility of high-speed vehicles into consideration. The position of the vehicle can be obtained by the prediction algorithm, and the task results are returned to the vehicle by means of other edge clouds. The experimental results show that with the increase of the task amount, the algorithm can effectively schedule more tasks to be completed within the specified time, and in different time slots; it can also predict the location of the vehicle and return the result to the vehicle.

ID DIMENSIONAL ANALYSIS; WIND ESTIMATION
AB With advances in the development of autonomous vehicles (AVs), more attention has been paid to the effects caused by adverse weather conditions. It is well known that the performance of self-driving vehicles is reduced when they are exposed to stressors that impair visibility or cause water or snow accumulation on sensor surfaces. This paper proposes a model to quantify weather precipitation, such as rain and snow, perceived by moving vehicles based on outdoor data. The modeling covers a wide range of parameters, such as varying the wind direction and realistic particle size distributions. The model allows the calculation of precipitation intensity on inclined surfaces of different orientations and on a circular driving path. The modeling results were partially validated against direct measurements carried out using a test vehicle. The model outputs showed a strong correlation with the experimental data for both rain and snow. Mitigation strategies for heavy precipitation on vehicles can be developed, and correlations between precipitation rate and accumulation level can be traced using the presented analytical model. A dimensional analysis of the problem highlighted the critical parameters that can help the design of future experiments. The obtained results highlight the importance of the angle of the sensing surface for the perceived precipitation level. The proposed model was used to analyze optimal orientations for minimization of the precipitation flux, which can help to determine the positioning of sensors on the surface of autonomous vehicles.

ID PERFORMANCE
AB There is a large gap between current AI-based autonomous-driving cars and fully autonomous cars, where the remote control of vehicles can be a unique solution to fill the gap. The remote control enables valuable operational data to be obtained, thus laying the groundwork for gradually increasing autonomous driving performance in the future. Moreover, human assistance through remote driving can offer more flexibility and intelligence than a single artificial intelligence. However, the real-time transmission of data and images is particularly crucial for remotely driven vehicles. The latency between a vehicle and the controller depends on the video streaming communication methods and transport protocols. Furthermore, the control or driving performance also depends on the vehicle speed likewise. Therefore, in this paper, we explore the impact of different communication methods of video streaming and vehicle "speed" on the performance of remote driving. We design a vehicle remote driving system based on ROS (Robot Operating System) with ROS as the core communication architecture to realize remote control of vehicles. The video stream is transmitted using three different streaming methods: ROS multi-computer communication, TCP protocol, and UDP protocol. To be specific, we implement a simple remote driving system for a "model" car, drive it at different speeds, and analyze how the drivers perform in terms of whether the vehicle gets off the track while driving. Based on the results, we find that "UDP-based video streaming" achieves 720P video streaming with a latency of less than 50ms, which is helpful for further research on remote driving. The experiment by "directly" observing the vehicle with eyes instead of using video streaming is also conducted to remove the video streaming latency. The experiment results show that the speed of the vehicle and the video streaming methods have a significant impact on the driving performance, and UDP protocol-based video streaming method is better suited for remote driving. The results imply that remote driving should be used in a low-speed environment rather than at high speed.

AB Autonomous vehicles must be able to navigate freely in a constrained and unknown environment while performing a desired task. To increase its autonomy, a vehicle must be provided by sophisticated software navigators. Traditionally, navigators build a convenient model of the vehicle's environment and plan feasible paths by reasoning about what actions must be performed to control the vehicle in that environment. This paper presents a genetic algorithm for adaptive navigation of a robot-like simulated vehicle. The proposed algorithm evolves feasible paths by performing an adaptive search on populations of candidate actions. The performance of the algorithm is demonstrated on problems with vehicles moving in two-dimensional grids and compared with that of a simple greedy algorithm and a random search technique.

AB Achieving fully autonomous driving requires seamless collaboration between advanced autonomous driving and road infrastructure technologies. As the proportion of autonomous vehicles (AVs) increases, challenges may arise from their insufficient knowledge of the behavior of traffic objects and inability to effectively drive short distances. Therefore, traffic control centers that can proactively control these issues in real time are essential. In this study, first, the terminology is defined and the types of AV-mixed Traffic Information that a traffic control center needs to efficiently collect, store, and analyze to accommodate the coexistence of AVs and conventional vehicles are identified. Second, a generic notation for an AV-mixed Traffic Information model is defined and the results of modeling each AV-mixed Traffic Information type are presented. Third, an AV-mixed Traffic Information services model that included the names, operations, input/output messages, and relationships of all services is suggested. Finally, the importance of the service functionalities is evaluated through a survey. This study will serve as an initial guideline for the design, construction, and operation of traffic control centers and will help proactively address issues that may arise from the interaction between AVs and conventional vehicles on the road. Moreover, it contributes to identifying the types of traffic information and services that traffic control centers must provide in the era of AV-mixed traffic and suggests future directions for analysis and utilization of traffic information.

DE Autonomous vehicles; highway merging; traffic effciency; fairness in
   merging times; traffic congestion
AB Recently, vehicle-to-infrastructure (V2I) communication-based scheduling schemes for connected and automated vehicles (CAVs) on highway on-ramps have received attention because the schemes assign optimal merging times to CAVs based on their criteria, such as first-in first-out order or minimizing CAV total travel time. However, these schemes cause traffic congestion due to the criteria when the vehicle inflow traffic becomes high. To mitigate traffic congestion, a scheduling scheme should assign merging times to CAVs to decrease road vehicle density. In this paper, we propose a scheduling scheme for autonomous vehicle highway merging with an outflow traffic and fairness analysis. We formulate a multiobjective function that achieves both outflow traffic maximization and fairness in assigned merging times. Since more vehicles pass a highway on-ramp as highway on-ramp outflow traffic increases, the proposed scheme decreases vehicle density on roads by maximizing the outflow traffic. Furthermore, the proposed scheme distributes the vehicle density on both the main and ramp roads by fairly assigning their merging times. Simulation results show that the proposed scheme mitigates the potential traffic congestion of previous scheduling schemes. Furthermore, the proposed scheme improves outflow traffic from highway on-ramps by more than 200 veh/h compared with the previous scheduling schemes.

ID OPTIMIZATION
AB A reservation-based intersection control algorithm was implemented for hurricane evacuation in a connected and autonomous vehicle environment. The autonomous reservation-based intersection control (AReBIC) algorithm receives and processes reservation requests from approaching vehicles in real-time and routes them free of conflict. The proposed algorithm was implemented in a simulation model of a road network in Hampton Roads, Virginia. The AReBIC algorithm outperformed the next best optimal signal control on all operational measures. The average speeds more than doubled and total delay decreased by 80%. While the total number of conflicts were comparable for AReBIC and optimal signal control, AReBIC traded the more severe crossing conflicts with less severe rear-end conflicts. The same superior performance of AReBIC was realized when transit signal priority was implemented in the study network. While the results are promising, a few practical issues should be addressed prior to any real-world implementation of reservation-based intersection control during evacuation. These issues include, latency and accuracy of communications, accommodation of pedestrians, accounting for incidents, and cybersecurity.

AB The population of older Americans with cognitive impairments, especially memory loss, is growing. Autonomous vehicles (AVs) have the potential to improve the mobility of older adults with cognitive impairment; however, there are still concerns regarding AVs' usability and accessibility in this population. Study objectives were to (1) better understand the needs and requirements of older adults with mild and moderate cognitive impairments regarding AVs, and (2) create a prototype for a holistic, user-friendly interface for AV interactions. An initial (Generation 1) prototype was designed based on the literature and usability principles. Based on the findings of phone interviews and focus group meetings with older adults and caregivers (n = 23), an enhanced interface (Generation 2) was developed. This generation 2 prototype has the potential to reduce the mental workload and anxiety of older adults in their interactions with AVs and can inform the design of future in-vehicle information systems for older adults.

AB Widespread adoption of green vehicles in urban logistics may contribute to the alleviation of problems such as environmental pollution, global warming, and oil dependency. However, the current adoption of green vehicles in the last mile logistics is relatively low despite many actions taken by public authorities to overcome the negative externalities of distributing goods in cities. This paper presents a comprehensive literature review on studies investigating the adoption of green vehicles in urban freight transportation, paying specific attention to e-commerce. To shed light on the adoption of green vehicles in city logistics, the paper conducts a systematic review of the empirical literature on the topic. The 159 articles reviewed were classified into the following: (a) Optimization and scheduling (67 papers); (b) policy (55 papers); (c) sustainability (37 papers). Among the 159 articles, a further selection of 17 papers dealing with e-commerce, i.e., studies that highlight the most relevant aspects related to the integration of green vehicles in e-commerce urban logistics, was performed. Our findings indicate that green vehicles are competitive in urban deliveries characterized by frequent stop-and-go movements and low consolidation levels while incentives are still necessary for their adoption. The use of autonomous vehicles results the most promising and challenging solution for last-mile logistics.

AB In this paper, we present an application of L-1 adaptive control for the vehicle lateral control problem. The main objective is to design a controller that ensures the vehicle follows the reference trajectory (center of the lane) with robustness to uncertain parameters of the vehicle lateral dynamics. The designed L-1 adaptive control signal compensates the uncertainties and variations in model parameters in the presence of disturbances. A bicycle model for vehicle lateral dynamics is considered. We will demonstrate the desirable performance of the proposed adaptive controller at steady-state as well as the transient response. The simulation results confirm that the controller significantly improves the transient response of the vehicle lateral controller in the presence of wind gusts, road bank angle, icy or slippery road conditions, and other parameter uncertainties and unknown disturbances.

AB Autonomous vehicle path tracking accuracy faces challenges in being accomplished due to the assumption that the longitudinal speed is constant in the prediction horizon in a model predictive control (MPC) control frame. A model predictive control path tracking controller with longitudinal speed compensation in the prediction horizon is proposed in this paper, which reduces the lateral deviation, course deviation, and maintains vehicle stability. The vehicle model, tire model, and path tracking model are described and linearized using the small angle approximation method and an equivalent cornering stiffness method. The mechanism of action of longitudinal speed changed with state vector variation, and the stability of the path tracking closed-loop control system in the prediction horizon is analyzed in this paper. Then the longitudinal speed compensation strategy is proposed to reduce tracking error. The controller designed was tested through simulation on the CarSim-Simulink platform, and it showed improved performance in tracking accuracy and satisfied vehicle stability constrains.

AB The main goal of the H2020-CARAMEL project is to address the cybersecurity gaps introduced by the new technological domains adopted by modern vehicles applying, among others, advanced Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning techniques. As a result, CARAMEL enhances the protection against threats related to automated driving, smart charging of Electric Vehicles, and communication among vehicles or between vehicles and the roadside infrastructure. This work focuses on the latter and presents the CARAMEL architecture aiming at assessing the integrity of the information transmitted by vehicles, as well as at improving the security and privacy of communication for connected and autonomous driving. The proposed architecture includes: (1) multi-radio access technology capabilities, with simultaneous 802.11p and LTE-Uu support, enabled by the connectivity infrastructure; (2) a MEC platform, where, among others, algorithms for detecting attacks are implemented; (3) an intelligent On-Board Unit with anti-hacking features inside the vehicle; (4) a Public Key Infrastructure that validates in real-time the integrity of vehicle's data transmissions. As an indicative application, the interaction between the entities of the CARAMEL architecture is showcased in case of a GPS spoofing attack scenario. Adopted attack detection techniques exploit robust in-vehicle and cooperative approaches that do not rely on encrypted GPS signals, but only on measurements available in the CARAMEL architecture.

AB To reduce the amount of transmitted data, feature map-based fusion is recently proposed as a practical solution to cooperative 3-D object detection by autonomous vehicles (AVs). The precision of object detection, however, may require significant improvement, especially for objects that are far away or occluded. To address this critical issue for the safety of AVs and human beings, we propose a cooperative spatial feature fusion (CoFF) method for AVs to effectively fuse feature maps for achieving a higher 3-D object detection performance. Especially, CoFF differentiates weights among feature maps for a more guided fusion, based on how much new semantic information is provided by the received feature maps. It also enhances the inconspicuous features corresponding to far/occluded objects to improve their detection precision. The experimental results show that CoFF achieves a significant improvement in terms of both detection precision and effective detection range for AVs, compared to previous feature fusion solutions.

AB Research in the field of autonomous vehicle technology focuses on its enhanced safety and convenience for vehicle occupants. The present paper seeks to establish a line of inquiry that addresses the implications of autonomous vehicle technology for nonmotorized road users, in the present case, bicyclists. Studies show that motorized traffic volume and speed affect nonmotorized agents' behavior and facility preference, but the degree to which this will apply to a driverless environment requires further study. We developed a stated-preference survey that had respondents select their preferred facility in a variety of hypothetical scenarios with and without the presence of driverless vehicles and on street types of varying motorized traffic volumes and speeds. A Random Parameters Logit Model is estimated to analyze the links between facility preferences, sociodemographics, street types, and the existence of driverless vehicles. The model results suggest that increases in motorized traffic volumes and speeds correlate with a greater preference for separated facilities. The presence of driverless vehicles amplifies this preference. Controlling for other factors, under driverless vehicle conditions, the odds of selecting protected facilities, such as buffered bicycle lanes and cycle tracks, were more than double the odds found under current conditions. We conclude with recommendations for infrastructure and policy and suggestions for future research in this nascent field of study.

AB Autonomous platforms already make observations over a wide range of temporal and spatial scales, measuring salinity, temperature, nitrate, pressure, oxygen, biomass, and many other parameters. However, the observations are not comprehensive. Future autonomous systems need to be more affordable, more modular, more capable and easier to operate. Creative new types of platforms and new compact, low power, calibrated and stable sensors are under development to expand autonomous observations. Communications and recharging need bandwidth and power which can be supplied by standardized docking stations. In situ power generation will also extend endurance for many types of autonomous platforms, particularly autonomous surface vehicles. Standardized communications will improve ease of use, interoperability, and enable coordinated behaviors. Improved autonomy and communications will enable adaptive networks of autonomous platforms. Improvements in autonomy will have three aspects: hardware, control, and operations. As sensors and platforms have more onboard processing capability and energy capacity, more measurements become possible. Control systems and software will have the capability to address more complex states and sophisticated reactions to sensor inputs, which allows the platform to handle a wider variety of circumstances without direct operator control. Operational autonomy is increased by reducing operating costs. To maximize the potential of autonomous observations, new standards and best practices are needed. In some applications, focus on common platforms and volume purchases could lead to significant cost reductions. Cost reductions could enable order-of-magnitude increases in platform operations and increase sampling resolution for a given level of investment. Energy harvesting technologies should be integral to the system design, for sensors, platforms, vehicles, and docking stations. Connections are needed between the marine energy and ocean observing communities to coordinate among funding sources, researchers, and end users. Regional teams should work with global organizations such as IOC/GOOS in governance development. International networks such as emerging glider operations (EGO) should also provide a forum for addressing governance. Networks of multiple vehicles can improve operational efficiencies and transform operational patterns. There is a need to develop operational architectures at regional and global scales to provide a backbone for active networking of autonomous platforms.

AB Connected and Autonomous Vehicles (CAVs) may exhibit different driving and route choice behaviours compared to Human-Driven Vehicles (HDVs), which can result in a mixed traffic flow with multiple classes of route choice behaviour. Therefore, it is necessary to solve the Multiclass Traffic Assignment Problem (TAP) for mixed traffic flow. However, most existing studies have relied on analytical solutions. Furthermore, simulation-based methods have not fully considered all of CAVs' potential capabilities. This study presents an open-source solution framework for the multiclass simulation-based TAP in mixed traffic of CAVs and HDVs. The proposed model assumes that CAVs follow system optimal with rerouting capabilities, while HDVs follow user equilibrium. It also considers the impact of CAVs on road capacity at both micro and meso scales. The proposed model is demonstrated through three case studies. This study provides a valuable tool that can consider several assumptions for better understanding the impact of CAVs on mixed traffic flow.

AB Image processing and control technologies have been widely studied and autonomous vehicles have become an active research area. For autonomous driving, it is essential to generate a safe obstacle avoidance path considering the surrounding environment. This paper devised an algorithm based on a real-time output constrained model predictive control for obstacle avoidance path planning in high speed driving situations. The proposed algorithm was compared with the normal model predictive control algorithm by simulation, including operation times to verify robustness for high speed driving situations. We used the ISO 2631-1 comfort level standard to quantify driver comfort fo r both cases.

AB Stated preference experiments have been criticized for lack of realism. This issue is particularly visible when the scenario does not have a well understood prior reference, as in the case of research into demand for autonomous vehicles. The paper presents Virtual Immersive Reality Environment (VIRE), which is capable of developing highly realistic, immersive, and interactive choice scenarios. We demonstrate the use of VIRE in researching pedestrian preferences related to autonomous vehicles and associated infrastructure changes on urban streets in Montreal, Canada. The results are compared with predominantly used approaches: text-only and visual aid. We show that VIRE results in respondents having better understanding of the scenario and it yields more consistent results.

ID UNCERTAIN NONLINEAR-SYSTEMS; MULTIAGENT SYSTEMS; MODEL; STABILITY;

AB Responsive and highly controlled autonomous vehicles (AVs) on the road easily form platoons with small inter-vehicle gaps to increase traffic throughput and reduce energy consumption. Unlike human drivers, AVs typically employ discrete quantization signals and only generate finite discrete acceleration. Finite discrete acceleration easily causes unstable inter-vehicle gaps and inter-vehicle collisions, especially when there are inaccurate quantization parameters due to quantizer aging. Based on the backstepping technique, this paper proposes the cooperative constrained control algorithm under unknown quantization parameters for AVs with nonuniform input quantization and motion uncertainties. The control laws of each AV in the platoon only depend on the state information of its consecutive AVs. The position trajectories of consecutive AVs are constructed as inter-vehicle collision-free constraints to avoid emergency braking and inter-vehicle collisions. In addition, the consistent characteristic of two types of nonuniform quantizers (i.e., logarithmic quantizers and hysteresis quantizers) is proposed, and unknown disturbances in vehicle motion are compensated. The Lyapunov based local stability and string stability are proved. Numerical simulation shows that the control algorithm is applicable to AVs with either logarithmic quantizers or hysteresis quantizers. Compared with the previous control algorithms without considering input quantization and inter-vehicle collision avoidance, the control algorithm proposed reduces inter-vehicle spacing errors, avoids high acceleration, and avoids inter-vehicle collisions.

AB This paper describes a navigation and guidance system (NGS) with real-time path planning and obstacle avoidance capabilities that has been developed for the autonomous underwater vehicle RAIS. The vehicle is designed to accomplish two missions: pre-deployment survey of sea bottom, and visual inspection of pipelines. In the first mission, the Nos must be able to track a predefined path while avoiding the unplanned occurrence of obstacles. In the second mission, the NGS must track a pipeline by locally reconstructing its location from visual information; also in this case, the unplanned occurrence of obstacles must be handled. Furthermore, the NGS must properly take into account the presence of ocean current and some drastic constraints due to sensor and actuator characteristics. Numerical and hardware-in-the-loop simulations have been developed to verify the effectiveness of the proposed NGS.

TI Detection of dangerously approaching vehicles over onboard cameras by
   speed estimation from apparent size
SO NEUROCOMPUTING
LA English
DT Article
DE Object detection; Speed estimation; Deep learning
AB Autonomous driving requires information such as the velocity of other vehicles to prevent potential hazards. This work proposes a real-time deep learning-based framework to estimate vehicle speeds from image captures through an onboard camera. Vehicles are detected and tracked by the proposed deep neural networks and a tracking algorithm, which analyzes the trajectories. Finally, a linear regression model estimates the speed of a vehicle based on its position and size in the camera frame. This proposal has been tested with two sequences of the Prevention dataset with satisfactory results. The system can estimate the speed of multiple vehicles simultaneously. It can be integrated easily with onboard computer systems, thus allowing to development of a low-cost solution for speed estimation in an everyday vehicle. The potential applications include vehicle safety systems, driver assistance, and autonomous driving technologies.

AB Parking is a major constraint for car users and therefore an important factor in mode choice decisions. In this paper we introduce a model to simulate parking search behavior for cars within a multiagent transport simulation, including full simulation of all steps of parking search, such as walking to and from the vehicle. This is combined with the capabilities of privately owned autonomous vehicles (AVs), which may park automatically, often in other locations than conventional cars, once they are not in use. Three different strategies for AVs to park are developed: (1) Conventional parking search, (2) parking at a designated AV lot, and (3) empty cruising, where vehicles do not use any parking space, but keep on driving. We apply the simulation model to a residential neighborhood in central Berlin, where parking pressure is generally high and apply different shares of AV usage to the synthetic population used. This allows a detailed evaluation of effects for both AV and conventional vehicle owners. Results suggest that the usage of designated parking lots may be the most beneficial solution for most users, with both vehicle wait times and parking search durations being the lowest.

AB Innovative technologies and naturalistic driving data sources provide a great potential to develop reliable autonomous driving systems. Understanding the behaviors of surrounding vehicles is essential for improving safety and mobility of autonomous vehicles. Onboard sensors like Radar, Lidar and Camera are able to track surrounding vehicles motion and to get different features like position, velocity and yaw. This paper proposes a hybrid approach to integrate maneuver classification using neural networks and trajectory prediction using Long Short-term Memory (LSTM) networks to get the future positions of adjacent vehicles. In this study we use the Next Generation Simulation (NGSIM) public dataset that provides a real driving data. The proposed approach is validated experimentally using VEDECOM demonstrator data. The results demonstrate that the proposed approach is able to predict driver intention to change lanes on average 2.2 seconds in advance. The Root Mean Square (RMS) errors of lateral and longitudinal positions are 0.30 m and 3.1 m respectively. The results demonstrate a high performance compared to various existing methods.

AB Path tracking as an essential function of an autonomous vehicle ensures it tracks the desired path. Its performance could be degraded by wind, road conditions, vehicle parameter uncertainty and signal delay. This study proposes a path tracking control framework for autonomous vehicle by combining tube model predictive control (MPC) and time delay motion prediction (TDMP). Tube MPC with N-step reachable set is proposed to handle disturbances. A robust invariant set is computed efficiently using supporting function and guarantees state constraints in the presence of disturbances. In TDMP, a path during the signal delay is presented and a vehicle kinematics model is adopted to predict changes of vehicle position and yaw. Simulations show that the computational cost with support function for a robust positively invariant set is less than that with Multi-Parametric Toolbox. In addition, the proposed control framework not only addresses disturbances like wind, road conditions and vehicle parameter uncertainty, but also handles the steering signal delay through motion prediction.

AB This paper presents a nonlinear robust H-infinity control strategy for improving trajectory following performance of autonomous ground electric vehicles (AGEV) with active front steering system. Since vehicle trajectory dynamics inherently influenced by various driving maneuvers and road conditions, the main objective is to deal with the trajectory following control challenges of parametric uncertainties, system nonlinearities, and external disturbance. The AGEV system dynamics and its uncertain vehicle trajectory following system are first modeled and constructed, in which parameter uncertainties related to the physical limits of tire are considered and handled, then the control-oriented vehicle trajectory following augmented system with dynamic error is developed. The resulting nonlinear robust H-infinity state-feedback controller (NHC) of vehicle trajectory-following system is finally designed by H-infinity performance index and nonlinear compensation under AGEV system requirements, and solved utilizing a set of linear matrix inequalities derived from quadratic H -infinity performance and Lyapunov stability. Simulations for double lane change and serpentine scenes are carried out to verify the effectiveness of the proposed controller with a high-fidelity, CarSim & REG;, full -vehicle model. It is found from the results that the proposed NHC provides improved vehicle trajectory following performance compared with the linear quadratic regulator (LQR) controller and robust H -infinity state-feedback controller (RHC).

AB In this study, an eco-driving strategy is proposed to enhance the fuel efficiency of the connected autonomous vehicle (CAV) in car-following scenarios. First, the longitudinal dynamic model and fuel-consumption model of the vehicle are established. The speed trajectory of the preceding vehicles is obtained via vehicle-to-vehicle/vehicle-to-infrastructure communication function of CAVs, which is used as the reference of the following vehicles. Second, a model predictive controller is presented to optimise fuel consumption of the following vehicle. Finally, simulations in urban and highway driving conditions demonstrate that the proposed controller enables effective tracking of the preceding vehicle in an energy-efficient way. Comparisons between the second and the third following vehicles verify the fuel-saving benefits of the proposed method.

AB We address the problem of autonomous tracking and state estimation for marine vessels, autonomous vehicles, and other dynamic signals under a (structured) sparsity assumption. The aim is to improve the tracking and estimation accuracy with respect to the classical Bayesian filters and smoothers. We formulate the estimation problem as a dynamic generalized group Lasso problem and develop a class of smoothing-and-splitting methods to solve it. The Levenberg-Marquardt iterated extended Kalman smoother-based multiblock alternating direction method of multipliers (LM-IEKS-mADMMs) algorithms are based on the alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMMs) framework. This leads to minimization subproblems with an inherent structure to which three new augmented recursive smoothers are applied. Our methods can deal with large-scale problems without preprocessing for dimensionality reduction. Moreover, the methods allow one to solve nonsmooth nonconvex optimization problems. We then prove that under mild conditions, the proposed methods converge to a stationary point of the optimization problem. By simulated and real-data experiments, including multisensor range measurement problems, marine vessel tracking, autonomous vehicle tracking, and audio signal restoration, we show the practical effectiveness of the proposed methods.

AB Autonomous capabilities in Unmanned Maritime Vehicles (UMVs) have been pushing the technology beyond imaginable limits in order to deal with more and more complex ocean and sea missions. However, there is still no agreement on the aspects that should be evaluated to know whether a UMV satisfies the degree or level of autonomy expected. This paper reviews current approaches to assess autonomous behavior in UMVs. It also recaps the different development and operation aspects taken into account by researchers and practitioners to evaluate autonomy in unmanned systems from diverse domains. This provides a baseline to study methodologies to assess maritime autonomy so that metrics and assessment criteria can be defined for UMVs. This paper also presents statistical results from a comparison of existing assessment frameworks for autonomy in different domains. Outcomes from this study are critical to devise guidelines for metric autonomy assessment in UMVs. In addition, a discussion on relevant aspects of a autonomy assessment process for UMVs, and future research directions are presented. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved,

AB Stable maneuverability is extremely important for the overall safety and robustness of autonomous vehicles under extreme conditions, and automated drift is able to ensure the widest possible range of maneuverability. However, due to the strong nonlinearity and fast vehicle dynamics occurring during the drift process, drift control is challenging. In view of the drift parking scenario, this paper proposes a segmented drift parking method to improve the handling ability of vehicles under extreme conditions. The whole process is divided into two parts: the location approach part and the drift part. The model predictive control (MPC) method was used in the approach to achieve consistency between the actual state and the expected state. For drift, the open-loop control law was designed on the basis of drift trajectories obtained by professional drivers. The drift monitoring strategy aims to monitor the whole drift process and improve the success rate of the drift. A simulation and an actual vehicle test platform were built, and the test results show that the proposed algorithm can be used to achieve accurate vehicle drift to the parking position.

AB We address the problem of position trajectory-tracking and path-following control design for underactuated autonomous vehicles in the presence of possibly large modeling parametric uncertainty. For a general class of vehicles moving in either 2- or 3-D space, we demonstrate how adaptive switching supervisory control can be combined with a nonlinear Lyapunov-based tracking control law to solve the problem of global boundedness and convergence of the position tracking error to a neighborhood of the origin that can be made arbitrarily small. The desired trajectory does not need to be of a particular type (e.g., trimming trajectories) and can be any sufficiently smooth bounded curve parameterized by time. We also show how these results can be applied to solve the path-following problem, in which the vehicle is required to converge to and follow a path, without a specific temporal specification. We illustrate our design procedures through two vehicle control applications: a hovercraft (moving on a planar surface) and an underwater vehicle (moving in 3-D space). Simulations results are presented and discussed.

AB The autonomous driving aims at ensuring the vehicle to effectively sense the environment and use proper strategies to navigate the vehicle without the interventions of humans. Hence, there exist a prediction of the background scenes and that leads to discontinuity between the predicted and planned outputs. An optimal prediction engine is required that suitably reads the background objects and make optimal decisions. In this paper, the author(s) develop an autonomous model for vehicle driving using ensemble model for large Sport Utility Vehicles (SUVs) that uses three different modules involving (a) recognition mod-el, (b) planning model and (c) prediction model. The study develops a direct realization method for an autonomous vehicle driving. The direct realization method is designed as a behavioral model that incorporates three different modules to ensure optimal autonomous driving. The behavioral model includes recognition, planning and prediction modules that regulates the input trajectory processing of input video datasets. A deep learning algorithm is used in the proposed approach that helps in the classification of known or unknown objects along the line of sight. This model is compared with conventional deep learning classifiers in terms of recall rate and root mean square error (RMSE) to estimate its efficacy. Simulation results on different traffic environment shows that the Ensemble Convolutional Network Reinforcement Learning (E-CNN-RL) offers increased accuracy of 95.45%, reduced RMSE and increased recall rate than existing Ensemble Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) and Ensemble Stacked CNN.

AB Localisation and navigation of autonomous vehicles (AVs) in static environments are now solved problems, but how to control their interactions with other road users in mixed traffic environments, especially with pedestrians, remains an open question. Recent work has begun to apply game theory to model and control AV-pedestrian interactions as they compete for space on the road whilst trying to avoid collisions. But this game theory model has been developed only in unrealistic lab environments. To improve their realism, this study empirically examines pedestrian behaviour during road crossing in the presence of approaching autonomous vehicles in more realistic virtual reality (VR) environments. The autonomous vehicles are controlled using game theory, and this study seeks to find the best parameters for these controls to produce comfortable interactions for the pedestrians. In a first experiment, participants' trajectories reveal a more cautious crossing behaviour in VR than in previous laboratory experiments. In two further experiments, a gradient descent approach is used to investigate participants' preference for AV driving style. The results show that the majority of participants were not expecting the AV to stop in some scenarios, and there was no change in their crossing behaviour in two environments and with different car models suggestive of car and last-mile style vehicles. These results provide some initial estimates for game theoretic parameters needed by future AVs in their pedestrian interactions and more generally show how such parameters can be inferred from virtual reality experiments.

AB Operating an autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) in close proximity to terrain typically relies solely on the vehicle sensors for terrain detection, and challenges the manoeuvrability of energy efficient flight-style AUVs. This paper gives new results on altitude tracking limits of such vehicles by using the fully understood environment of a lake to perform repeated experiments while varying the altitude demand, obstacle detection and actuator use of a hover-capable flight-style AUV. The results are analysed for mission success, vehicle risk and repeatability, demonstrating the terrain following capabilities of the overactuated AUV over a range of altitude tracking strategies and how these measures better inform vehicle operators. A major conclusion is that the effects of range limits, bias and false detections of the sensors used for altitude tracking must be fully accounted for to enable mission success. Furthermore it was found that switching between hover- and flight-style actuations based on speed, whilst varying the operation speed, has advantages for performance improvement over combining hover- and flight-style actuators at high speeds.

AB In this paper, nonlinear model predictive control (NMPC) is proposed for autonomous vehicle drifting, that is, stabilizing the vehicle at a desired unstable equilibrium point. Firstly, a three-degree-of-freedom vehicle model with a nonlinear tire model is introduced, and the equilibrium points are calculated. The relationship between the desired unstable equilibrium point and the lateral stability region is analyzed based on the phase plane method. Secondly, NMPC is designed to force vehicle states to stay around the desired unstable equilibrium point, that is, to keep the vehicle in sustained drifting. The terminal region and terminal constraint of NMPC are determined off-line to guarantee stability. Thirdly, Koopman operator theory and dynamic mode decomposition with control are introduced to obtain an approximately linear model, by which the nonlinear optimization problem is converted to a quadratic programming problem. Finally, comparative experiments are conducted by simulation, in which various model uncertainties are considered. The effectiveness of the proposed approach to achieve sustained autonomous drifting and to ensure vehicle safety is illustrated, and the efficient implementation of the proposed approach is also shown.

AB A robust trajectory tracking controller is designed for autonomous vehicles based on a hierarchical architecture to make the autonomous vehicle track a given reference trajectory. The controller consists of two sub controllers: kinematic controller and dynamic controller. Based on the kinematics of tracking reference trajectory, a desired yaw rate is calculated by kinematic controller to make the lateral deviation global asymptotic stable. Then, steering wheel angle is calculated by a vehicle dynamic controller to make the vehicle yaw rate converge to the desired value and make the vehicle dynamic stable. Conditional integration method is used in the sub controllers. This method guarantees global asymptotic stability of tracking reference values and considers the uncertainty of parameters and constraints of desired yaw rate and actuators. Then based on small-gain theorem, the condition of the finite-gain L stability is given to the hierarchical controller to ensure the interconnected sub systems stable and prevent the amplification of system disturbance. Finally, the effectiveness and robustness of the controller are validated by real vehicle experiments.

AB Autonomous vehicles operate in real time traffic scenarios and aim to reach their destination from their source in the most efficient manner possible. Research in mobile robotics provides a variety of sophisticated means with which to plan the path of these vehicles. Conversely professional human drivers usually drive using instinctive means, which enables them to reach their goal almost optimally whilst still obeying all traffic laws. In this paper we propose the use of fuzzy logic for novel motion planning. The planner is generated using an evolutionary algorithm which resembles the learning stage of professional drivers. Whether to overtake or not, is a decision which affects one's driving and the decision is made using some deliberation. We further extend the approach to perform decision making regarding overtaking for all vehicles. Further we coordinate the motion of the vehicles at a traffic crossing to avoid any potential jam or collision. Experimental results prove that by using this approach we have been able to make the vehicles move in an optimal manner in a variety of scenarios.

AB Autonomous ground/aerial vehicles (UGVs/UAVs) boost many potential applications over past few years, but it usually takes a long time or a large price to fully recharge or refuel a vehicle, so it is extremely important to make efficient routing decisions for autonomous vehicles with limited fuel capacity. This paper elaborates the uninterrupted cruising requirements for autonomous vehicles and the influence of limited fuel capacity on the routing policies. We provide a proof that the basic cruising problem is NP-hard in the general case, though the previous work formulated it as a polynomial problem based on some oversimplified assumptions, which result in a degraded performance under the condition of limited fuel capacity. This is formulated as a mixed-integer non-convex optimization problem, which is difficult to solve in general. Furthermore, we observed that the nature of the limited fuel capacity is a limitation on the solution space of the cruising problem, which motivated us to construct an efficient heuristic solution by applying the fuel constraints iteratively on the shortest path that can be obtained in polynomial time. Since targets are usually requested in an online way in real cruising applications, we design a sliding window-based algorithm, so that a tradeoff can be made between the routing efficiency and the computation complexity by adjusting the window size. Finally, the simulation results show that the proposed scheme reduces the computation complexity by at least 13 times, simultaneously with performance improvements by about 7% in terms of fuel consumption than the alternative algorithms.

AB Constrained autonomous vehicle overtaking trajectories are usually difficult to generate due to certain practical requirements and complex environmental limitations. This problem becomes more challenging when multiple contradicting objectives are required to be optimized and the on-road objects to be overtaken are irregularly placed. In this article, a novel swarm intelligence-based algorithm is proposed for producing the multiobjective optimal overtaking trajectory of autonomous ground vehicles. The proposed method solves a multiobjective optimal control model in order to optimize the maneuver time duration, the trajectory smoothness, and the vehicle visibility, while taking into account different types of mission-dependent constraints. However, one problem that could have an impact on the optimization process is the selection of algorithm control parameters. To desensitize the negative influence, a novel fuzzy adaptive strategy is proposed and embedded in the algorithm framework. This allows the optimization process to dynamically balance the local exploitation and global exploration, thereby exploring the tradeoff between objectives more effectively. The performance of using the designed fuzzy adaptive multiobjective method is analyzed and validated by executing a number of simulation studies. The results confirm the effectiveness of applying the proposed algorithm to produce multiobjective optimal overtaking trajectories for autonomous ground vehicles. Moreover, the comparison to other state-of-the-art multiobjective optimization schemes shows that the designed strategy tends to be more capable in terms of producing a set of widespread and high-quality Pareto-optimal solutions.

ID ROUTING PROBLEM
AB The emerging customized bus system based on modular autonomous electric vehicles (MAEVs) shows tremendous potential to improve the mobility, accessibility and environmental friendliness of a public transport system. However, the existing studies in this area almost focus on human-driven vehicles which face some striking limitations (e.g., restricted crew scheduling and fixed vehicle capacity) and can weaken the overall benefits. This paper proposes a two-phase optimization procedure to fully unleash the potential of MAEVs by leveraging the strengths of MAEVs, including automatic allocation and charging of modules. In the first phase, a mixed integer programming model is established in the space-time-state framework to jointly optimize the MAEV routing and charging, passenger-to-vehicle assignment and vehicle capacity management for reserved passengers. A Lagrangian relaxation algorithm is developed to solve the model efficiently. In the second phase, three dispatching strategies are designed and optimized by a dynamic dispatching procedure to properly adapt the operation of MAEVs to emerging travel demands. A case study conducted on a major urban area of Beijing, China, demonstrates the high efficiency of the MAEV adoption in terms of resource utilization and environmental friendliness across a range of travel demand distributions, vehicle supply and module capacity scenarios.

AB In today's competitive environment with increasingly faster deliveries and smaller order sizes, material handling providers are progressively developing new solutions. A more recent development in automated material-handling technology for unit load storage and retrieval is the autonomous vehicle storage and retrieval system (AVS/RS). The paper investigates the main design trade-offs for this new solution using simulation, and proposes a comprehensive design framework. Using data from a recently implemented AVS/RS, the application of the proposed framework is presented and the key design differences between the two types of AVS/RS configuration (i.e. tier-captive versus tier-to-tier) are identified.

ID BEHAVIOR
AB One of the main safety concerns associated with semi-autonomous vehicles is the sharing of control between a human driver and an autonomous driving system. Even with an attentive driver, such switches in control may pose a threat to the safety of the driver and the surrounding vehicles. The aim of this study is to develop an indicator that can measure the level of safety during a driver take-over, using knowledge about the system known a priori. A model-based approach is used to analyse the system with special focus on the lateral dynamics of the vehicle. The driver and the vehicle are modelled as linear systems, and a path tracking controller is used to serve as an autonomous system. With this structure, shared control is studied as a switched system, in which the vehicle's lateral control switches between the autonomous system and the driver. A bound on the transient dynamics that arise due to a switch is derived, using the induced L infinity norm. This bound is then used to formulate an indicator that checks if the states/outputs of interest are within acceptable limits. A comparison with simulation results has shown that the indicator successfully captures the effect of different system parameters on take-over safety, although in a slightly conservative manner. This indicator can be further developed as a tool to be used in the design and evaluation of shared-/multi-modal control systems in future vehicles.

AB With the increasing need for road lane detection used in lane departure warning systems and autonomous vehicles, many studies have been conducted to turn road lane detection into a virtual assistant to improve driving safety and reduce car accidents. Most of the previous research approaches detect the central line of a road lane and not the accurate left and right boundaries of the lane. In addition, they do not discriminate between dashed and solid lanes when detecting the road lanes. However, this discrimination is necessary for the safety of autonomous vehicles and the safety of vehicles driven by human drivers. To overcome these problems, we propose a method for road lane detection that distinguishes between dashed and solid lanes. Experimental results with the Caltech open database showed that our method outperforms conventional methods.

ID PROBABILISTIC MODEL
AB The technology for autonomous vehicles is close to replacing human drivers by artificial systems endowed with high-level decision-making capabilities. In this regard, systems must learn about the usual vehicle's behavior to predict imminent difficulties before they happen. An autonomous agent should be capable of continuously interacting with multi-modal dynamic environments while learning unseen novel concepts. Such environments are not often available to train the agent on it, so the agent should have an understanding of its own capacities and limitations. This understanding is usually called self-awareness. This paper proposes a multi-modal self-awareness modeling of signals coming from different sources. This paper shows how different machine learning techniques can be used under a generic framework to learn single modality models by using Dynamic Bayesian Networks. In the presented case, a probabilistic switching model and a bank of generative adversarial networks are employed to model a vehicle's positional and visual information respectively. Our results include experiments performed on a real vehicle, highlighting the potentiality of the proposed approach at detecting abnormalities in real scenarios.

AB Connected autonomous vehicles (CAVs) will be deployed over the next decade with autonomous functionalities supported by new sensing and communication capabilities. Such functionality exposes CAVs to new attacks that current vehicles will not face. To ensure the safety and security of CAVs, it is important to be able to identify the ways in which the system could be attacked and to build defences against these attacks. One possible approach is to use reference architectures to perform an attack surface analysis. Existing research has developed a variety of reference architectures but none for the specific purpose of attack surface analysis. Existing approaches are either too simple for sufficiently detailed modelling or require too many details to be specified to easily analyse a CAV's attack surface. Therefore, we propose a reference architecture using a hybrid Functional-Communication viewpoint for attack surface analysis of CAVs, including the Devices, Edge and Cloud systems CAVs interact with. Using two case studies, we demonstrate how attack trees can be used to understand the attack surface of CAV systems.

AB Proper evaluation of traffic operations integrating connected and autonomous vehicles (CAVs) requires accurate representation of these emerging technologies in microscopic simulation. This paper evaluates the ability of microscopic simulator PTV-VISSIM (Version 10.0) to simulate CAVs, and presents a comprehensive CAV model extension. In addition, emissions modeling is integrated with VISSIM to calculate real-time energy and emission estimates. The evaluation of VISSIM revealed that its internal CAV modeling has several limitations, such as modeling connectivity and complex vehicle behavior. For external modeling, there are two available VISSIM interfaces. The Component Object Model (COM) Application Programming Interface (API) is the superior approach for fetching data and modeling connectivity, whereas the External Driver Model (EDM) is a better tool for lateral and longitudinal control. The simulation extension developed leveraged both interfaces. An isolated signalized intersection was simulated to demonstrate the impact of connected vehicle (CV), autonomous vehicle (AV), and CAV traffic on speed, delay, and travel time. In addition, trajectory data, combined with the Motor Vehicle Emission Simulator (MOVES) method, were utilized to obtain energy, fuel consumption, and greenhouse gas emissions. The results show that CAVs result in net improvement in travel time and speed. However, emissions did not follow the same trend. While increasing AV penetration rates resulted in emissions reductions, increasing CV and CAV penetration rates resulted in higher emissions. While the CV logic chosen for testing seeks to maximize the likelihood of vehicle arrival-on-green, the algorithm likely results in increased variations in second-by-second accelerations, leading to overall higher emissions.

AB The current paper proposes a data analysis method to evaluate the impact of vehicle-technology evolution on road safety based on a recent and extensive accident dataset (1.3 million vehicles in 2017 and 1.7 million in 2018, Italy). Seventeen models of vehicles equipped with an event data recorder were selected for acquiring data, including the distances travelled by the vehicles during the year, and were aggregated by their year of initial registration and model. This unique information in conjunction with the accident datasets enabled a consistent estimation of risk exposure and accident rates for various subsets of vehicles. Thereafter, the comparative analysis of accident rates revealed an improvement in the road safety along with a significant variation between various vehicle models that approximately ranged from 5-10 accidents per million kilometres. Moreover, the accident rate reduced after the electronic stability control system was mandated for vehicles in the market, exhibiting variations in the range of 15-30% for serious accidents that were dependent on the vehicle model. Further safety improvements were identified for the latest generation of vehicles equipped with more advanced technologies such as the autonomous emergency braking that can reduce the accident rate up to 38%.

AB Path planning and trajectory design for autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) is of great importance to the oceanographic research community because automated data collection is becoming more prevalent. Intelligent planning is required to maneuver a vehicle to high-valued locations to perform data collection. In this paper, we present algorithms that determine paths for AUVs to track evolving features of interest in the ocean by considering the output of predictive ocean models. While traversing the computed path, the vehicle provides near-real-time, in situ measurements back to the model, with the intent to increase the skill of future predictions in the local region. The results presented here extend preliminary developments of the path planning portion of an end-to-end autonomous prediction and tasking system for aquatic, mobile sensor networks. This extension is the incorporation of multiple vehicles to track the centroid and the boundary of the extent of a feature of interest. Similar algorithms to those presented here are under development to consider additional locations for multiple types of features. The primary focus here is on algorithm development utilizing model predictions to assist in solving the motion planning problem of steering an AUV to high-valued locations, with respect to the data desired. We discuss the design technique to generate the paths, present simulation results and provide experimental data from field deployments for tracking dynamic features by use of an AUV in the Southern California coastal ocean.

AB This paper presents a data-driven model-based control system for autonomous underwater vehicles (or AUVs) subject to input delays. This work is motivated by the input time delays that can arise in underwater robotics due to communication restrictions and sensor malfunctions. Such delays can highly degrade the performance of classical control structures resulting in unpredictable system behaviours. The proposed control architecture addresses such limitations. The approach incorporates a linear dynamic representation of the system obtained using the Koopman operator in an observer/state prediction formulation. The proposed control architecture is designed based on discrepancies between the data-driven estimation of the system's behaviour and the actual AUV performance using chain predictors. The capabilities of the proposed approach are shown through experiments performed with a 4 degrees-of-freedom autonomous underwater vehicle. The results demonstrate stable behaviours without steady-state errors, even in the presence of long delay.

AB In order to improve the comfort performance and reduce the planning algorithm complexity in autonomous vehicle, an intelligent longitudinal velocity planning method based on fuzzy neural network (FNN) is proposed. With the manual driving experience, fuzzy planning model is established. By utilizing the self-learning function of neural network, fuzzy planning model is modified, which is attempted to establish FNN planning model. The planning method is applied to velocity planning. Three kinds of driving scenes are analyzed, and velocity planning models based on FNN are established accordingly. The simulation and experiment results indicate that acceleration generated by FNN planning model has good smooth property, and it is easy to be tracked by the subsequent control module. Compared with traditional method, the proposed method has certain anti-disturbance ability and self-adaptability. Also, the proposed method is convenient for engineering application, which ensures both the real-time performance and stability of the algorithm.

AB Although Fully Autonomous Vehicles (FAVs) will bring huge benefits to society, it seems that public acceptance tends to be mixed. This study, based on affective reactions and knowledge, develops a research framework to explain the general acceptance. The model also examines the mediating effects of perceived benefit/risk on the relationships between explanatory variables with general acceptance, to better comprehend consumers' psy-chological mechanism behind acceptance. Based on a survey of 1582 respondents, our study offers robust evi-dence that pleasure, anxiety, and subjective knowledge are surely the key factors in influencing consumers' acceptance of FAVs. In addition, our findings reveal a significant mediation. Specifically, compared to perceived risk, perceived benefit manifested a greater mediation on the pleasure-general acceptance as well as subjective knowledge-general acceptance relationship. It is also emphasized that practitioners should improve emotional design and publicity strategies to improve users' perception of FAV benefits and thus improve acceptance.

ID ASSISTANCE
AB This paper presents a novel coordinated path following system (PFS) and direct yaw moment control (DYC) of autonomous electric vehicles via hierarchical control technique. In the high-level control law design, a new fuzzy factor is introduced based on the magnitude of longitudinal velocity of vehicle, a linear time varying (LTV)-based model predictive controller (MPC) is proposed to acquire the wheel steering angle and external yaw moment. Then, a pseudo inverse (PI) low-level control allocation law is designed to realize the tracking of desired external moment torque and management of the redundant tire actuators. Furthermore, the vehicle sideslip angle is estimated by the data fusion of low-cost GPS and INS, which can be obtained by the integral of modified INS signals with GPS signals as initial value. Finally, the effectiveness of the proposed control system is validated by the simulation and experimental tests. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Environment perception is a basic and necessary technology for autonomous vehicles to ensure safety and reliable driving. A lot of studies have focused on the ideal environment, while much less work has been done on the perception of low-observable targets, features of which may not be obvious in a complex environment. However, it is inevitable for autonomous vehicles to drive in environmental conditions such as rain, snow and night-time, during which the features of the targets are not obvious and detection models trained by images with significant features fail to detect low-observable target. This article mainly studies the efficient and intelligent recognition algorithm of low-observable targets in complex environments, focuses on the development of engineering method to dual-modal image (color-infrared images) low-observable target recognition and explores the applications of infrared imaging and color imaging for an intelligent perception system in autonomous vehicles. A dual-modal deep neural network is established to fuse the color and infrared images and detect low-observable targets in dual-modal images. A manually labeled color-infrared image dataset of low-observable targets is built. The deep learning neural network is trained to optimize internal parameters to make the system capable for both pedestrians and vehicle recognition in complex environments. The experimental results indicate that the dual-modal deep neural network has a better performance on the low-observable target detection and recognition in complex environments than traditional methods.

TI Trajectory planning for autonomous aerospace vehicles amid known

SO JOURNAL OF GUIDANCE CONTROL AND DYNAMICS
LA English
DT Article
AB A discrete search strategy is presented for potential real-time generations of four-dimensional trajectories for a single autonomous aerospace vehicle amid known obstacles and conflicts. A model of autonomous operation is first developed. The problem of and requirements on real-time trajectory generations for autonomous aerospace vehicles are discussed. After an overview of various potential solution frameworks, a discrete search strategy is developed. In this strategy, a four-dimensional search space is defined and discretized. Potential obstacles and conflicts are represented by several basic geometric shapes and their combinations. Mathematical conditions are developed for a trajectory segment to be outside of an obstacle or conflict. Then, the A* search technique is used to obtain trajectory solutions, in which successor points are selected that avoid obstacles and conflicts and that satisfy dynamic motion constraints of the vehicle. A linear combination of flight distance and flight time is optimized in the trajectory generation process. A heuristic function that approximates this performance index is developed for the A* search procedure. Examples are provided that illustrate the application of the proposed method.

AB This paper presents a method for identification of the hydrodynamic coefficients of the dive plane of an autonomous underwater vehicle. The proposed identification method uses the governing equations of motion to estimate the coefficients of the linear damping, added mass and inertia, cross flow drag and control. Parts of data required by the proposed identification method are not measured by the onboard instruments. Hence, an optimal fusion algorithm is devised which estimates the required data accurately with a high sampling rate. To excite the dive plane dynamics and obtain the required measurements, diving maneuvers should be performed. Hence, a reliable controller with satisfactory performance and stability is needed. A cascaded controller is designed based on the coefficients obtained using a semi-empirical method and its robustness to the uncertainties is verified by the mu-analysis method. The performance and accuracy of the identification and fusion algorithms are investigated through 6-DOF numerical simulations of a realistic autonomous underwater vehicle.

AB Chemical plume tracing based on autonomous underwater vehicle uses chemical as a guidance to navigate and search in the unknown environments. To solve the key issue of tracing and locating the source, this article proposes a path-planning strategy based on partially observable Markov decision process algorithm and artificial potential field algorithm. The partially observable Markov decision process algorithm is used to construct a source likelihood map and update it in real time with environmental information from the sensors on autonomous underwater vehicle in search area. The artificial potential field algorithm uses the source likelihood map for accurately planning tracing path and guiding the autonomous underwater vehicle to track along the path until the source is detected. This article carries out simulation experiments on the proposed algorithm. The experimental results show that the algorithms have good performance, which is suitable for chemical plume tracing via autonomous underwater vehicle. Compared with the bionic method, the simulation results show that the proposed method has higher success rate and better stability than the bionic method.

AB This paper presents a review of sliding mode control for autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs). The AUVs are used under water operating in the presence of uncertainties (due to hydrodynamics coefficients) and external disturbances (due to water currents, waves, etc.). Sliding mode controller is one of the nonlinear robust controllers which is robust towards uncertainties, parameter variations and external disturbances. The evolution of sliding mode control in motion control studies of autonomous underwater vehicles is summarized throughout for the last three decades. The performance of the controller is examined based on the chattering reduction, accuracy (steady state error reduction), and robustness against perturbation. The review on sliding mode control for AUVs provides insights for readers to design new techniques and algorithms, to enhance the existing family of sliding mode control strategies into a new one or to merge and re-supervise the control techniques with other control strategies, in which, the aim is to obtain good controller design for AUVs in terms of great performance, stability and robustness.

AB Emerging mobility services, such as ridehailing and shared autonomous vehicles, provide the transportation sector with new tools to improve system efficiency and mitigate costs to the environment. However, recent history has shown that these same technologies can have reverse effects if they are not strategically deployed and intelligently managed. This study identifies one important component of the greater transportation system - first-mile last-mile (FMLM) services - where both ridehailing services and shared autonomous electric vehicles (SAEV) are thought to excel. Results indicated that while ridehailing services contributed to higher daily VMT, their daily fuel needs were 12%-45% less compared to on-demand transit shuttles. We also show that current prevailing SAEV technology is insufficient for widespread deployment in many real-world FMLM systems due to battery range limitations and travel speed constraints. However, improving battery range or travel speed beyond a threshold, 125 miles and 45 mph in the study, would outperform driver-based shuttle solutions.

AB Increasing technological innovation means level 5 fully autonomous vehicle pods (AVPs) that do not require a human driver are approaching reality. However, the adoption of AVPs continues to lag behind predictions. In this paper, we draw on Mowen's (2000) 3M model taking a multi-analytical approach utilising PLS-SEM and fuzzy set qualitative comparative analysis, to investigate how personality trait sets motivate consumers to adopt AVPs. Based on a survey of 551 US respondents, we identify four necessary traits and five combinations of traits that predict adoption. We contribute to consumer psychology theory by advancing the understanding of the moti-vational mechanisms of consumers' adoption of autonomous vehicles that are triggered and operationalised by personality traits and conceptualising innovativeness as a complex multidimensional construct. From a mana-gerial perspective, our findings highlight the significance of incorporating elements that are congruent with target customers' personality traits, when designing, manufacturing and commercializing innovative products.

AB Typically, it is not trivial for an autonomous ground vehicle (AGV) to navigate in rough terrain due to lots of unexpectable uncertainties. Because the performance of the autonomous navigation can be degraded by the uncertainties, the AGV requires a robust control system against them. To handle the necessity, this study proposes the robust path controller by utilizing a disturbance observer (DOB)-based control method. The proposed controller is developed by two steps: the first step is to design a controller for handling a nominal system of the AGV, and the other is to add the DOB to the nominal controller. Then, the determined control input is distributed into tire forces because the tire forces are final resource enabling the AGV to move. The tire force distribution is defined as an optimization problem with some constraints, and the solution is obtained by the CVXGEN. Finally, numerical simulations and field tests with a skid-type ground vehicle, developed by the authors' laboratory, are conducted to validate the performance of the proposed method.

AB In this paper, a high performance procedure for estimating of hydrodynamic coefficients in Autonomous Underwater Vehicles (AUV's) is proposed. In modeling of an AUV, experimental data should be verified and validated using appropriate techniques. Due to implementation complexity in calculating methods, computation of hydrodynamic parameters is challenging. This paper presents analytical approaches for estimating an AUV's hydrodynamic coefficients. Nonlinear Kalman Filter (KF) algorithms are implemented to estimate unknown augmented states (coefficients). A comparative study is conducted which shows the superior performance of Unscented Kalman.

AB This paper presents a study on the application of Autonomous Delivery Vehicles (ADVs) in last-mile delivery for urban logistics. Specifically, we focus on a routing problem using multi-stop ADVs, with the goal of minimizing route and vehicle usage costs while satisfying several constraints associated with load and battery capacities, maximum route duration for ADVs, and maximum walking distance for customers. We refer to this problem as the Autonomous Delivery Vehicle Routing Problem (ADVRP) and present its mixed-integer linear programming formulation. Due to the NP-hardness of the problem, we propose a two-phase metaheuristic approach that first clusters customers and determines stopping locations for the ADVs, followed by a phase that determines the optimal routes for the ADVs using hybrid variable neighborhood search and simulated annealing. To evaluate our proposed solution methodology, we conduct computational experiments on various related Vehicle Routing Problems (VRPs) from the literature and newly generated ADVRP instances. The results show that the proposed two-phase metaheuristic approach can produce high-quality solutions with minimal computational effort while outperforming an exact solver in 26 medium-and large-sized instances of ADVRP and reaching optimal solutions in most VRP instances and related problems. Furthermore, we conduct sensitivity analyses on selected problem parameters and present a case study in Istanbul, Turkey to provide managerial insights for implementing ADVs in urban logistics.

AB Nowadays, autonomous driving has been attracted widespread attention from academia and industry. As we all know, deep learning is effective and essential for the development of AI components of Autonomous Vehicles (AVs). However, it is challenging to adopt multi-source heterogenous data in deep learning. Therefore, we propose a novel data-driven approach for the delivery of high-quality Spatio-Temporal Trajectory Data (STTD) to AVs, which can be deployed to assist the development of AI components with deep learning. The novelty of our work is that the meta-model of STTD is constructed based on the domain knowledge of autonomous driving. Our approach, including collection, preprocessing, storage and modeling of STTD as well as the training of AI components, helps to process and utilize huge amount of STTD efficiently. To further demonstrate the usability of our approach, a case study of vehicle behavior prediction using Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks is discussed. Experimental results show that our approach facilitates the training process of AI components with the STTD.

AB Autonomous vehicles leverage the data provided by a suite of sensors, combining measurements in order to provide precise and robust position estimation to localization and navigation systems. In this paper, an Adaptive Monte Carlo Localization algorithm is applied to an autonomous golf car, where data from wheel odometry, an inertial measurement unit, a Global Positioning System (GPS) and laser scanning is combined to estimate the pose of a vehicle in an outdoor environment. Monte Carlo Localization techniques allow the compensation of the technical flaws of different sensors by fusing the information delivered by each one. However, one of the main problems of fusing GPS data are sudden decreases of accuracy and sudden jumps on positions due to phenomenons like multi-path signal reception. In this paper, a particle weighting MCL model which integrates GPS measurements is proposed, and its performance is compared in several experiments with a particle generation approach when a GPS sensor suddenly provides erroneous data.

AB Dimensional analysis has been very helpful in experimentation of very large or small-scale engineering systems. A good example would be experimentation on the aircrafts and ships, which was made cost-effective and simple by dimensional analysis. The history of dimensional analysis mentioned in the introduction section of the present document includes many of such applications. Automotive industry, however, never felt the need as the price or the size of land vehicles did not make experimentation so far-fetched; therefore, there are many crash tests which every new vehicle has to go through before mass production This changed with the imminent introduction of autonomous vehicles, which brought all the risks involved in experimenting with them. Many cost-effective experimental platforms are introduced, such as QCar https://www.quanser.com/products/qcar/or laboratories, such as Scaled Autonomous Vehicles Indoor (SAVI) https://cast.tamu.edu/research/technology-demonstrator-platforms/scaled-autonomous-vehicles-indoor-tdp/. The present study will enable the results taken from such platforms to be translated to real-sized vehicles, enabling researchers to study dynamics of various vehicles. Classical vehicle equations of motion including constant velocity, accelerating bicycle model and roll model have been made dimensionless. The case of steady-state responses is also calculated in a dimensionless form. Some practical numerical examples are also mentioned as a proof of theory.

AB The longitudinal collision avoidance controller can avoid or mitigate vehicle collision accidents effectively via auto brake, and it is one of the key technologies of autonomous vehicles. Moreover, the vehicle lateral stability is very crucial in emergency scenarios. Due to complex traffic conditions and various road frictions, emergency brake may cause a vehicle to lose its lateral stability. Therefore, this paper proposes a lateral-stability-coordinated collision avoidance control system (LSCACS) based on the model predictive control (MPC). First, the proposed LSCACS decides which control mode to be implemented based on vehicle dynamics states, including a normal driving mode, a full auto brake mode, and a brake and stability mode. The MPC is used in the upper controller to calculate the desired deceleration and additional yaw moment. The lower controller calculates the desired tire forces of four wheels and realizes them by certain wheel cylinder hydraulic pressures. The LSCACS is validated by hardware-in-the-loop (HIL) tests, and the results show LSCACS's effectiveness and great performance of the collision avoidance and lateral stability.

AB Swift decision-making based on visual environment perception is crucial for autonomous control of visual underwater vehicles (VUVs) during underwater missions. However, learning perception and decision models individually might result in weak robustness of overall control system as the mismatched state extraction and control decision making are asynchronous. As a remedy, we will introduce in this paper an end-to-end monocular autonomous reinforcement control (MARC) framework for autonomous control of VUVs, which is performed in two cascaded procedures, i.e., 1) perception, where a geometric network (GeoNet) is designed based on a convolutional encoder-decoder network to generate depth maps from input environmental videos; 2) decision, where with depth maps as input, a reinforcement control network (CtrlNet) integrates a convolutional neural network into a deep deterministic policy gradient network and outputs action decisions, which are refined by reinforcement learning algorithm for obstacle-avoiding based autonomous control. Numerical and experimental results demonstrate that the proposed MARC exhibits high-quality depth prediction and is capable of conducting obstacle-avoiding navigation and autonomous control of VUVs with high accuracy and strong robustness.

AB An Autonomous Underwater Vehicle (AUV) is a nonlinear nonholonomic dynamical system. Tracking control of AUVs in the presence of disturbances and uncertainties is a challenging problem. In this paper, an adaptive passivity-based algorithm is proposed for tracking control of an AUV. Also, a disturbance estimator has been used to attenuate the effects of unknown disturbances. A proper adaptive rule is designed to estimate unknown parameters and disturbances. The stability of the proposed method is analyzed using passivity properties and the Lyapunov theory. Obtained comparative results show the advantages of the proposed Adaptive Computed Torque Method ACTM plus disturbance estimator.

AB The smart city embraces gradual adoption of autonomous vehicles (AVs) into the intelligent transportation system. Contributed by their full-fledged controllability, AVs can respond to instantaneous situations with high efficiency and flexibility. In this paper, we propose a novel AV logistic system (AVLS) to accommodate logistic demands for smart cities. We focus on determining the optimal routes for the governed AVs in consideration of various requirements imposed by the vehicles, logistic requests, renewable generations, and the underlying transportation system. By coordinating their routes and charging schedules, the system can effectively utilize the renewable energy generated by distributed generations. We formulate the joint routing and charging problem in the form of quadratic-constrained mixed integer linear program. To improve its scalability, we develop a distributed solution method via dual decomposition. We conduct extensive simulations to evaluate the performance of proposed system and solution methods. The results show that AVLS can effectively utilize excessive renewable energy while accomplishing all logistic requests. The distributed solution can develop near-optimal solutions with compelling improvement in computational speed.

AB The 2005 DARPA Grand Challenge required teams to design and build autonomous off-road vehicles capable of handling harsh terrain at high speeds while following a loosely defined path. This paper discusses the critical subsystems of Cornell University's entry, an autonomous Spider Light Strike Vehicle. An attitude and position estimator is presented with modifications for specific problems associated with high-speed autonomous ground vehicles, including Global Positioning System signal loss and reacquisition. A novel terrain estimation algorithm is presented to combine attitude and position estimates with terrain sensors to generate a detailed elevation model. The elevation model is combined with a spline-based path planner in a sensing/action feedback loop to generate smooth, human-like paths that are consistent with vehicle dynamics. The performance of these subsystems is validated in a series of demonstrative experiments, along with an evaluation of the full system at the Grand Challenge. (c) 2006 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

AB We propose a fully distributed control system architecture, amenable to in-vehicle implementation, that aims to safely coordinate connected and automated vehicles (CAVs) at road intersections. For control purposes, we build upon a fully distributed model predictive control approach, in which the agents solve a nonconvex optimal control problem (OCP) locally and synchronously, and exchange their optimized trajectories via vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) communication. To accommodate a fast solution of the nonconvex OCPs, we apply the penalty convex-concave procedure which solves a convexified version of the original OCP. For experimental evaluation, we complement the predictive controller with a localization layer, being in charge of self-localization, and an estimator, which determines joint collision points with other agents. Experimental tests reveal the efficacy of the proposed control system architecture.

AB The arrival of autonomous systems powered by artificial intelligence (AI) offers new possibilities for life, yet the focus tends to be more on the technology than the people it serves. Planners should consider the likely reception awaiting emerging intelligent systems. Using an online survey of 3,249 faculty, staff, and students at a major research university, we tested perceptions of autonomy, including domotics and autonomous vehicles. Embracing the new technology with variations in attitude associated with age, gender, and familiarity with new technology, people's openness to AI-enabled devices applies if they remain a tool to support work and not replace human-centered interactions.

AB In this paper, we propose the concept of underwater docking of an autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) for power supply and data transfer to conduct the continuous operation of the AUV without launch and recovery operations. Our basic concept of docking involves the use of a 3D imaging sonar as the autonomous homing sensor for AUV and a remotely operated vehicle (ROV) as the docking station, which has maneuverability to compensate for the homing error of the AUV. On the basis of this concept, we use a 3D imaging sonar as a homing sensor during docking. The 3D imaging sonar has a potential for advanced AUV operation and will be the versatile "eye" of the AUV.

AB Autonomous vehicles (AVs) provide a new mobility option and have been becoming widespread around the world. They can be used not only as automobiles but also as public transport vehicles in the form of shuttles, buses and pods. One of the problem areas in implementing AVs as a public transport vehicle is to choose a suitable road for operating them. A fuzzy decision model combining analytic hierarchy process (AHP) and technique for order of preference by similarity to ideal solution (TOPSIS) techniques with intuitionistic fuzzy sets is used to solve this problem. The results show that the BRT corridor is the most suitable option for operating AVs according to the decision criteria. Furthermore, operating AVs on a BRT corridor provides an unprecedented service provision approach.

AB This paper presents a linearization method for the vehicle and tire models under the model predictive control (MPC) scheme, and proposes a linear model-based MPC path-tracking steering controller for autonomous vehicles. The steering controller is designed to minimize lateral path-tracking deviation at high speeds. The vehicle model is linearized by a sequence of supposed steering angles, which are obtained by assuming the vehicle can reach the desired path at the end of the MPC prediction horizon and stay in a steady-state condition. The lateral force of the front tire is directly used as the control input of the model, and the rear tire's lateral force is linearized by an equivalent cornering stiffness. The course-direction deviation, which is the angle between the velocity vector and the path heading, is chosen as a control reference state. The linearization model is validated through the simulation, and the results show high prediction accuracy even in regions of large steering angle. This steering controller is tested through simulations on the CarSim-Simulink platform (R2013b, MathWorks, Natick, MA, USA), showing the improved performance of the present controller at high speeds.

AB The path-following problem for four-wheel independently actuated autonomous ground vehicles is investigated in this paper. A novel output constraint controller is proposed to deal with the lateral offset control in path following and maintain the vehicle lateral stability in the presence of tire sliding effects. The innovations of this work lie in the following two aspects: 1) A novel output constraint control strategy, namely, the hyperbolic projection method, is proposed to strictly bound the lateral offset to prevent the vehicle from transgressing the safety bound in path following; 2) an adaptive and robust linear quadratic regulator controller is adopted to obtain the optimal active front-wheel steering and direct yaw-moment control inputs with vehicle lateral stability consideration and to eliminate the effect of parameter uncertainties. CarSim-Simulink joint simulation results indicate that the proposed controller can compactly bound the lateral offset to avoid transgressing the safe boundary during path following, particularly in extreme driving conditions, in the presence of tire sliding effects and system uncertainties.

AB Visibility is a critical factor for transportation, even if we refer to air, water, or ground transportation. The biggest trend in the automotive industry is autonomous driving, the number of autonomous vehicles will increase exponentially, prompting changes in the industry and user segment. Unfortunately, these vehicles still have some drawbacks and one, always in attention and topical, will be treated in this paper-visibility distance issue in bad weather conditions, particularly in fog. The way and the speed with which vehicles will determine objects, obstacles, pedestrians, or traffic signs, especially in bad visibility, will determine how the vehicle will behave. In this paper, a new experimental set up is featured, for analyzing the effect of the fog when the laser and LIDAR (Light Detection And Ranging) radiation are used in visibility distance estimation on public roads. While using our experimental set up, in the laboratory, the information offered by these measurement systems (laser and LIDAR) are evaluated and compared with results offered by human observers in the same fog conditions. The goal is to validate and unitarily apply the results regarding visibility distance, based on information arrives from different systems that are able to estimate this parameter (in foggy weather conditions). Finally, will be notifying the drivers in case of unexpected situations. It is a combination of stationary and of moving systems. The stationary system will be installed on highways or express roads in areas prone to fog, while the moving systems are, or can be, directly installed on the vehicles (autonomous but also non-autonomous).

AB Although mixed traffic, including both autonomous vehicles (AV) and human-driven vehicles (HV), is expected to prevail in the foreseeable future, our current understanding of the longitudinal characteristics of mixed traffic is limited and, in particular, lacks evidence from field experiments. To bridge this gap, we designed and conducted a set of field experiments to reveal differences in carfollowing behaviors between a human driver following-AV and following-HV on both constant speed traffic characteristics with discrete speeds ({10,20, ..., 60}km/h) and dynamic car-following behaviors with continuous speeds (within 0-60 km/h) in both the indifferentiable and differentiable appearance settings of the AV. We recruited 10 drivers for the experiment (14 runs for each driver and collected position and speed data of the tested vehicles along their complete trajectories based on vehicle gaps, headways, and standard deviations of vehicle speed. A K-means clustering algorithm was applied to classify drivers based on their responses in following-AV vs. following-HV with both constant speed and dynamic speed characteristics. The analyses of the differentiable appearance setting show that different drivers exhibit different behaviors in following-AV vs. following-HV: some are AV-believers, some are AV-skeptics, and the others are insensitive. Yet in the indifferentiable appearance setting, there is no significant difference between following a lead AV and following a lead HV. This reveals that drivers' response to the lead vehicle depends on their subjective trusts on AV technologies rather than the actual driving behavior. The results suggest that, depending on the characteristics and composition of the drivers, classic car-following behavior in pure HV traffic may need to be updated for modeling mixed traffic in the near future.

DT Article
DE autonomous vehicle; morality; agency; blame; praise
ID OMISSION; CHARACTER; INTENTION; DILEMMA; BLAME
AB With the imminent advent of autonomous vehicles (AVs) comes a moral dilemma: How do people assign responsibility in the event of a fatal accident? AVs necessarily create conditions in which "drivers" yield agency to a machine. The current study examines how people make attributions of blame and praise in this context. Varying the features of AV technology affected how responsible a "driver" (who purchased the vehicle) is perceived to be following a deadly crash. The findings provide support for agency and commission as crucial bases of moral judgment. They also raise questions about how morally contradictory actions are perceived and underscore the need for research examining how moral responsibility is distributed among multiple potentially culpable agents. Pragmatically, these findings suggest that regulating (or declining to regulate) how AVs are programmed may strongly influence perceptions of moral and legal culpability.

AB This paper develops a trajectory tracking control law for autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) with the effect of states and control input quantization. A sliding mode control (SMC) scheme is proposed to conquer the quantization effect by introducing the bound of quantization error into the switching term of the SMC. A finite time disturbance observer is proposed to observe the unknown time-varying disturbances. The stability analysis demonstrates that the designed tracking controller can force the AUV to track the reference trajectory and guarantee the asymptotic stability of the closed system. Simulation results illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed control method.

Autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) capable of such chemical plume tracing feats would have applicability in searching for environmentally interesting phenomena, unexploded ordinance, undersea wreckage, and sources of hazardous chemicals or pollutants. This article presents an approach and experimental results using a REMUS AUV to find a chemical plume, trace the chemical plume to its source, and maneuver to reliably declare the source location. The experimental results are performed using a plume of Rhodamine dye developed in a turbulent, near-shore, oceanic fluid flow.

AB This paper addresses the robust fuzzy control with mixed performance of autonomous surface vehicle (ASV) via T-S model approach. The nonlinear model demonstrates the motion of autonomous surface vehicle. The dynamics of this model is governed by a six-dimensional differential equation with nonlinear behavior. A robust fuzzy control is proposed to guarantee the mixed performance of uncertain T-S fuzzy model under consideration. Linear matrix inequality (LMI) optimization approach is developed to achieve the design of controller for parallel distributed compensator (PDC) and minimization the H-2 measure or H-infinity performance. The mixed H-2/H-infinity performance can be used to achieve the disturbance attenuation and motion reduction of ASV. Finally, an example is illustrated to show the main contribution of our results. The proposed PDC is provided to guarantee the mixed performance for the nonlinear model of ASV.

AB Autonomous vehicle navigation is challenging since various types of road scenarios in real urban environments have to be considered, particularly when only perception sensors are used, without position information. This paper presents a novel real-time optimal-drivable-region and lane detection system for autonomous driving based on the fusion of light detection and ranging (LIDAR) and vision data. Our system uses a multisensory scheme to cover the most drivable areas in front of a vehicle. We propose a feature-level fusion method for the LIDAR and vision data and an optimal selection strategy for detecting the best drivable region. Then, a conditional lane detection algorithm is selectively executed depending on the automatic classification of the optimal drivable region. Our system successfully handles both structured and unstructured roads. The results of several experiments are provided to demonstrate the reliability, effectiveness, and robustness of the system.

AB Connected and Automated Vehicles (CAVs) is an inspiring technology that has an immense prospect in minimizing road upsets and accidents, improving quality of life, and progressing the effectiveness of transportation systems. Owing to the advancements in the intelligent transportation system, CAV plays a vital role that can keeping life lively. CAV also offers to use to transportation care in producing societies protected more reasonable. The challenge over CAV applications is a newfangled to enhance safety and efficiency. Cloud autonomous vehicles rely on a whole range of machine learning and data mining techniques to process all the sensor data. Supervised, Unsupervised, and even reinforcement learning are also being used in the process of creating cloud autonomous vehicles with the aim of error-free ones. At first, specialized algorithms have not been used directly in the cloud autonomous vehicles which need to be trained with various traffic environments. The creation of a traffic model environment to test the cloud autonomous vehicles is the prime motto of this paper. The deep Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) has been proposed under the traffic model to drive in a heavy traffic condition to evaluate the algorithm. This paper aims to research an insightful school of thought in the current challenges being faced in CAVs and the solutions by applying CNN. From the simulation results of the traffic model that has traffic and highway parameters, the CNN algorithm has come up with a 71.8% of error-free prediction.

AB Autonomous vehicles are perhaps the most encountered element in a driving simulator. Their effect on the realism of the simulator is critical. For autonomous vehicles to contribute positively to the realism of the hosting driving simulator, they need to have a realistic appearance and, possibly more importantly, realistic behavior. Addressed is the problem of modeling realistic and humanlike behaviors on simulated highway systems by developing an abstract framework that captures the details of human driving at the microscopic level. This framework consists of four units that together define and specify the elements needed for a concrete humanlike driving model to be implemented within a driving simulator. These units are the perception unit, the emotions unit, the decision-making unit, and the decision-implementation unit. Realistic models of humanlike driving behavior can be built by implementing the specifications set by the driving framework. Four humanlike driving models have been implemented on the basis of the driving framework: (a) a generic normal driving model, (b) an aggressive driving model, (c) an alcoholic driving model, and (d) an elderly driving model. These driving models provide experiment designers with a powerful tool for generating complex traffic scenarios in their experiments. These behavioral models were incorporated along with three-dimensional visual models; and vehicle dynamics models into one entity, which is the autonomous vehicle. Subjects perceived the autonomous vehicles with the described behavioral models as having a positive effect on the realism of the driving simulator. The erratic driving models were identified correctly by the subjects in most cases.

AB Trajectory following of autonomous vehicle is a challenging task because of the multiple constraints imposed on the plant. Therefore, Model Predictive Control (MPC) is becoming prevail in vehicle motion control as it can explicitly handle system constraints. However, MPC, grounded in real-time iterative optimization, entails a considerable computational burden for current electronic control units. To mitigate the MPC execution load, a popular strategy is to linearize the original (nonlinear) system around the current working point and then design a Linear Time-Varying MPC (LTVMPC). Nevertheless, the successive linearization introduces extra modeling errors, which may impair the control performance. Indeed, if the plant model satisfies the 'differential flatness' condition, it can be exactly linearized to the Brunovsky's canonical form. In contrast to the LTV model, this newly appeared linear form reserves all the nonlinear features of the native plant model. Based on this equivalent linear system, a Flatness Model Predictive Controller (FMPC) can be formulated. FMPC on the one hand, improves the control performance over an LTVMPC because it avoids extra modeling errors from the local linearization. On the other hand, it entails a much lighter computational load versus a nonlinear MPC thanks to its linear nature. Real-time simulations conducted on a hardware-in-the-loop system indicate the advantages of the proposed FMPC in autonomous vehicle trajectory following.

AB Intelligent connected vehicles are autonomous vehicles. With the increasing degree of automation of autonomous vehicles and the development of open applications in the future, the computing tasks of autonomous vehicles are becoming more and more complex. In practice, the computing resources of vehicles are limited and the processing of data is not always guaranteed to be completed in time. However, the timely processing and integrity of the data are very important for vehicles because it affects the path selection of the traveling vehicle and the passenger experience. Therefore, it is necessary to reduce latency in processing data and verify the integrity of data for vehicles. In this paper, a novel message authentication scheme for multiple mobile devices in intelligent connected vehicles based on edge computing is proposed. The task of processing data in the vehicle is migrated to mobile devices, and tasks are executed utilizing the computing resources of multiple mobile devices in the edge computing model. The vehicle use certificateless ring signature technology to ensure the integrity of data processed by mobile devices. A security analyses show that our proposed schemes are secure in the random oracle model and can resist two types of adversaries under certificateless public key encryption. One type of adversary may be able to replace the mobile device's public key and the other type of adversary has access to the system master key. The results of performance analysis indicate the proposed scheme has high efficiency and applicability in practical intelligent connected vehicles system.

AB We present a two-lane path planning of autonomous vehicles in two-and-a-half-dimensional (2.5D) environments. Our method builds on collision-free two-dimensional (2D) path-planning techniques from our previous work, and extends these techniques to 2.5D by mapping a 2D path in the parameter space onto a terrain graph surface, as a curve on the surface in the object space. Based on this path on the terrain surface, we propose a novel method of designing cross slopes in high curvature regions of the path, such that vehicles need not slow down in these regions. Furthermore, we apply time-optimal control techniques developed in robotics to compute the minimal-time speed control along the specified path. Examples are provided to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm.

AB This paper reports on an integrated inference and decision-making approach for autonomous driving that models vehicle behavior for both our vehicle and nearby vehicles as a discrete set of closed-loop policies. Each policy captures a distinct high-level behavior and intention, such as driving along a lane or turning at an intersection. We first employ Bayesian changepoint detection on the observed history of nearby cars to estimate the distribution over potential policies that each nearby car might be executing. We then sample policy assignments from these distributions to obtain high-likelihood actions for each participating vehicle, and perform closed-loop forward simulation to predict the outcome for each sampled policy assignment. After evaluating these predicted outcomes, we execute the policy with the maximum expected reward value. We validate behavioral prediction and decision-making using simulated and realworld experiments.

AB A novel regional path tracking description is presented in this manuscript, and the moving horizon control method that is model predictive control (MPC) is proposed to discuss the regional path tracking issue which could avoid colliding road boundary when tracking a more complex road effectively. The feasible region for autonomous ground vehicles (AGVs) running is determined first according to the detected road boundaries. Then, in order to keep the actual trajectory of AGVs in the region and satisfy the safety requirements, MPC method is employed to design the path tracking controller considering actuator and road boundary constraints. In order to verify the effectiveness of the proposed method, experiments based on Hongqi AGV HQ430 are carried out, and the results illustrate that the presented method could be successfully applied to Hongqi AGV vehicle HQ 430.

AB In this article, tube-based model predictive control (MPC) is investigated for a linear parameter-varying (LPV) system with external disturbances. The LPV system comes from an autonomous vehicle with external disturbances and scheduling parameters in trajectory tracking. An interval predictor is designed for state constraints under external disturbances and scheduling parameters. With a robust controller based on the nominal state obtained by solving MPC, antidisturbance ability and dynamic performance are improved for the LPV system with external disturbances. Both recursive feasibility and input-to-state stability are analyzed for the closed-loop system using the tube-based MPC with the interval predictor. The effectiveness of the tube-based MPC is shown by numerical simulation on trajectory tracking for the autonomous vehicle.

AB Autonomous vehicles drive according to the expected trajectory to achieve horizontal and longitudinal control of the vehicle. Therefore, the research on path planning is of great significance. This paper mainly analyzes the road behavior of the car, studies the five-fold polynomial algorithm model, simulates the path trajectory of different behavior, and analyzes the rate of change of lateral and vertical velocity and lateral and vertical acceleration under different behaviors, to get the car prediction time. Using the optimal control theory, the linear space expression is established to study the variation of transverse velocity, transverse velocity and transverse de-flection angle, and the expression of the system to achieve the steady-state response is given. The simulation results are compared and analyzed to find out the optimal path of different scenes and different driving beha-viors, which provides theoretical basis for real vehicle debugging.

AB With the widespread application of deep learning methodologies, many fields including Intelligent Transporta-tion Systems (ITS) have integrated neural network-based models. In return, the promising performance of neural network-based models attracts more research efforts being paid to the deep learning area. Autonomous vehicles, as the future ITS participants, have achieved tremendous development with the help of convolutional neural network (CNN)-based detectors (e.g., vehicle detectors, lane detectors, pedestrian detectors, traffic sign detectors, etc.) in recent years. However, we have noticed that researchers leveraged different computing power when publishing their experimental results, which could lead to unfair comparisons. In this paper, we focus on CNN-based pedestrian detectors. We conduct a comprehensive comparative study of the representative CNN-based pedestrian detectors, aiming to investigate the influence of experimental settings by eliminating the bias of different experimental environments.

AB Autonomous vehicles can profoundly change parking behaviour in the future. Instead of searching for parking, the occupants alight at their final destination and send their occupant-free cars to a parking spot. This paper studies the impact of parking in a morning commute problem with autonomous and regular vehicles. We simplify the complex problem with distinct cost functions to a classic bi-class problem that can be analytically solved. To optimize the system, we develop temporal and spatial parking pricing strategies and a new parking supply design scheme, as practical alternatives for the conventional dynamic congestion pricing.

AB The influence of surface waves on the hydrodynamic performance of an autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) could be significant when the AUV sails near the water surface. In this paper, the hydrodynamic performance of an axisymmetric AUV in coupled wave-current flows is numerically studied using a two-phase computational fluid dynamics (CFD) method. The CFD method is validated with existing experimental data. The influences of waves are quantitatively analyzed for different wave heights, Reynolds numbers and submerged depths of the AUV. The flow structures are characterized to better understand the interaction mechanism between the AUV and the waves. It is found that the variation of the lift of the AUV is significantly affected by the wave and that the average drag increases with the increased wave height and decreased submerged depth.

AB We present a cooperative bathymetry-based localization approach for a team of low-cost autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs), each equipped only with a single-beam altimeter, a depth sensor and an acoustic modem. The localization of the individual AUV is achieved via fully decentralized particle filtering, with the local filter's measurement model driven by the AUV's altimeter measurements and ranging information obtained through inter-vehicle communication. We perform empirical analysis on the factors that affect the filter performance. Simulation studies using randomly generated trajectories as well as trajectories executed by the AUVs during field experiments successfully demonstrate the feasibility of the technique. The proposed cooperative localization technique has the potential to prolong AUV mission time, and thus open the door for long-term autonomy underwater.

AB AUVs are the most suitable tool for conduction survey concerning with global environmental problems. AUVs maneuverability should be carefully checked so as to improve energy efficiency of the vehicle and avoid unexpected motion. Oblique towing test (OTT) is simulated virtually in a computational fluid dynamic (CFD) environment to obtain hydrodynamic damping coefficients of a full-scale autonomous underwater vehicle. Simulations are performed for bare hull and hull equipped with four different hydroplanes. The hydrodynamic forces and moment are obtained to calculate hydrodynamic coefficients. Nonlinear damping coefficients are also obtained by using suitable curve fitting. Experiments of resistance and OTT are carried out in specific condition, for validation purpose. Following the extracting numerical results a mathematical model is developed to calculate hydrodynamic force for different sail type in order to predict autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) maneuverability. The results shows good agreement between theory and experiment.

AB Autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) have gained more interest in recent years for military as well as civilian applications. One potential application of AUVs is for the purpose of undersea surveillance. As research into undersea surveillance using AUVs progresses, issues arise as to how an AUV acquires, acts on, and shares information about the undersea battle space. These issues naturally touch on aspects of vehicle autonomy and underwater communications, and need to be resolved through a spiral development process that includes at sea experimentation. This paper presents a recent AUV implementation for active anti-submarine warfare tested at sea in the summer of 2010. On-board signal processing capabilities and an adaptive behavior are discussed in both a simulation and experimental context. The implications for underwater surveillance using AUVs are discussed.

DE autonomous driving; control non-linearities
AB In this paper, the authors investigate the issue of constructing and incorporating an accurate vehicle dynamic model for model predictive control (MPC) with an application to autonomous vehicle path following. To achieve the desired performance, MPC employs a precise dynamic model. However, the uncertainty of complex systems and their operating environments presents a challenge to the development of an adequately accurate vehicle dynamic model. This paper proposes a Deep Gaussian Process Regression (DGPR) method to improve model precision. Meanwhile, the learning model is incorporated into a novel MPC framework to enhance closed-loop performance. High-fidelity simulations using CarSim-MATLAB demonstrate the validity of the proposed approach in terms of enhancing the path following performance and lateral stability under the condition of large curvature at medium to high speeds on roads with different friction coefficients when compared to the nominal MPC approach.

AB This paper presents model predictive control of an autonomous vehicle. Simulation and experimental results have been shown and compared with input-output linearization method. The results obtained show that the MPC is an efficient method that allows for accurate control and navigation of an autonomous vehicle. Model based predictive control is tested in simulations for motion on an inclined plane. This is done to prepare future work regarding the avoidance of the violation of the smoothness condition for exact linearization, while at the same time by modifying the input commands the geometric path planning results are conserved. The approach is presented for the wheel-ground slippage and tip-over avoidance of the three-wheeled vehicle for inclined plane motion. A complete three-dimensional dynamic model using Newtonian dynamics is also presented. Simulation results using a three-wheeled vehicle built in our laboratory illustrate the performance of the proposed controller.

AB This work presents a monitoring system for the environmental conditions of rose flower-cultivation in greenhouses. Its main objective is to improve the quality of the crops while regulating the production time. To this end, a system consisting of autonomous quadruped vehicles connected with a wireless sensor network (WSN) is developed, which supports the decision-making on type of action to be carried out in a greenhouse to maintain the appropriate environmental conditions for rose cultivation. A data analysis process was carried out, aimed at designing an in-situ intelligent system able to make proper decisions regarding the cultivation process. This process involves stages for balancing data, prototype selection, and supervised classification. The proposed system produces a significant reduction of data in the training set obtained by the WSN while reaching a high classification performance in real conditions-amounting to 90% and 97.5%, respectively. As a remarkable outcome, it is also provided an approach to ensure correct planning and selection of routes for the autonomous vehicle through the global positioning system.

AB This article focuses on the time-minimum path planning problem of autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) with the constraint of simultaneous arrival in an ocean environment. The overall framework can be divided into two successive modules, and both of them are solved by the biased min-consensus (BMC) method, which introduces the edge weight into the standard min-consensus protocol. The first module plans each AUV's path under the BMC protocol, respectively, along which the AUV will avoid obstacles and navigate to the destination with the minimum time through the ocean current. Incorporating the cooperative constraint of simultaneous arrival, the second part chooses the AUV path with the maximal voyage time as a benchmark, and replans other AUVs' paths using the BMC method until their corresponding voyage time is approximately equal to the benchmark. The simulation results in various scenarios demonstrate the strong applicability and high effectiveness of our method.

AB This paper describes the development of a small unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) with autonomous flight capability. It is the result of integrating a commercial off-the-shelf autopilot system with a low-cost gas-powered RC helicopter. Researchers face several challenges when developing UAVs using gas-powered RC helicopters. To avoid the corruption of the structural vibration to the avionics hardware system, an innovative vibration isolation technique is developed to mechanically isolate the vibrations from the gas engine and rotors. Furthermore, a dynamics model for the vehicle is created to support the autonomous flight control development work. Further, a loss-recover method using Kalman filter is employed for estimating the attitude and position statuses when GPS signal is lost. Several other key challenges related to electromagnetic interference shielding and safe flight testing are also effectively solved in the project. The integration work has been completed and the test flights done so far show that the developed autonomous UAV works well under the integration of the mechanical system, electronic system, and controller software.

AB In this study, the roll, yaw and depth fuzzy control of at Autonomous Underwater Vehicle (AUV) are addressed. Yaw and roll angles are regulated only using their errors and rates, but due to the complexity of depth dynamic channel, additional pitch rate quantity is used to improve the depth loop performance. The discussed AUV has Four flaps at the rear of the vehicle as actuators. Two rule bases and membership functions based on Mamdani type and Sugeno type fuzzy rule have been chosen in each loop. By invoking the normalized steepest descent optimization method, the optimum values for the membership function parameters are found. Though the AUV is a. highly nonlinear system, the simulation of the designed fuzzy logic control system based on the equations of motion shows desirable behavior of the AUV specially when the parameters of the fuzzy membership functions are optimized.

TI Formation Reconfiguration for Mobile Robots with Network Connectivity
   Constraints
SO IEEE NETWORK
LA English
DT Article
AB Future systems of networked autonomous vehicles, such as unmanned aerial or ground vehicles, may rely on peer-to-peer wireless communication to coordinate their actions. The physical formation of the network may need to be reconfigured at times based on the specified missions. However, reconfiguring the physical formation also impacts the link connectivity and hence the connectivity of the network. If the network is partitioned, the autonomous vehicles can no longer coordinate their movements, and the mission may fail. In this article, we discuss techniques to transform the formation of a system of autonomous vehicles while preserving network connectivity. Several different approaches to address this problem are presented, with the focus on a method that utilizes ideas from routing packets in networks. We also briefly discuss the problem of formation selection and give an example of formation optimization in which communication costs are minimized under constraints on preserving network connectivity and the amount of movement required.

AB Autonomous unmanned aerial vehicles are complex systems of hardware, software, and human input. Understanding this complexity is key to their development and operation. Information visualizations already exist for exploring flight logs but comprehensive analyses currently require several disparate and custom tools. This design study helps address the pain points faced by autonomous unmanned aerial vehicle developers and operators. We contribute: a spiral development process model for grounded evaluation visualization development focused on progressively broadening target user involvement and refining user goals; a demonstration of the model as part of developing a deployed and adopted visualization system; a data and task abstraction for developers and operators performing post-flight analysis of autonomous unmanned aerial vehicle logs; the design and implementation of DATA COMETS, an open-source and web-based interactive visualization tool for post-flight log analysis incorporating temporal, geospatial, and multivariate data; and the results of a summative evaluation of the visualization system and our abstractions based on in-the-wild usage.

AB There is a lot of hype about autonomous vehicles (AV) but there are few studies on how people feel about this innovative product. To fill this research gap and to provide richer insights on this subject, this study crawled 10,374 AV-related comments from a microblogging website and used sentiment analysis to evaluate people's feelings and perceptions. The results show that people's sentiments depend not just on the AVs (e.g., their safety and convenience) but also AVs' impact on society, such as unemployment and legislation. The sentiments therefore transcend beyond in-dividual considerations. The paper discusses the implications of the results and the contributions to the AV literature.

DT Article
DE autonomous driving; children; parent decision making; vehicle design;
   intelligent vehicle systems; human-automation interaction
AB Objective: Identify factors that impact parents' decisions about allowing an unaccompanied child to ride in an autonomous vehicle (AV). Background: AVs are being tested in several U.S. cities and on highways in multiple states. Meanwhile, suburban parents are using ridesharing services to shuttle children from school to extracurricular activities. Parents may soon be able to hire AVs to transport children. Method: Nineteen parents of 8- to 16-year-old children, and some of their children, rode in a driving simulator in autonomous mode, then were interviewed. Parents also participated in focus groups. Topics included minimum age for solo child passengers, types of trips unaccompanied children might take, and vehicle features needed to support child passengers. Results: Parents would require two-way audio communication and prefer video feeds of vehicle interiors, seatbelt checks, automatic locking, secure passenger identification, and remote access to vehicle information. Parents cited convenience as the greatest benefit and fear that AVs could not protect passengers during unplanned trip interruptions as their greatest concern. Conclusion: Manufacturers have an opportunity to design family-friendly AVs from the outset, rather than retrofit them to be safe for child passengers. More research, especially usability studies where families interact with technology prototypes, is needed to understand how AV design impacts child passengers. Application: Potential applications of this research include not only designing vehicles that can be used to safely transport children, seniors who no longer drive, and individuals with disabilities but also developing regulations, policies, and societal infrastructure to support safe child transport via AVs.

AB Regenerative braking is an important feature to increase the driving range of electric vehicles (EVs). For an autonomous EV, the deceleration profile and portion of regenerative braking torque can be control variables affecting the regenerative braking energy recovery. To design a control algorithm maximizing the energy recovery, knowledge of the maximum performance of the control system and the optimal control inputs for the maximum performance is very useful. This paper presents how to extract the maximum performance and corresponding optimal control variables for maximizing the energy recovery. As an exemplary application of the extracted optimal solutions, a simple braking strategy was designed and validated in a simulation environment. It outperformed the maximum generation torque strategy that is generally considered as the best strategy for maximizing energy recovery.

AB Traffic accidents cause harm to the society. Future technology in autonomous vehicles is expected to eliminate the human factor as one important cause of failure. However, in the near future, autonomous vehicles and human drivers will coexist and downside risk still needs to be tolerated in exchange for mobility. Unsignalized intersections are particularly prone to accidents, as lots of potential conflicts between traffic participants occur. Motorists need to anticipate these on the basis of their perception of the environment and react accordingly. Yet, perceptional errors affect human drivers, and it is important to understand their impact on traffic safety and traffic efficiency. We develop a microscopic model of traffic dynamics at single-lane unsignalized intersections subject to random misperception that may cause accidents. Perceptional errors can be modeled by stochastic processes, e.g., Ornstein-Uhlenbeck processes. We present suitable simulation techniques and characterize the behavior of the traffic system in various case studies. We discuss the impact of errors and safety margins on traffic flow, the number of accidents, and the number of collided vehicles. In terms of perception errors, we consider both homogeneous and heterogeneous traffic participants, reflecting the coexistence of human drivers and autonomous vehicles. The model captures the real-world tradeoff between safety and efficiency for potential future traffic systems.

Data from a high-precision navigation system, five cameras, 12 SICK planar laser range scanners, and a Velodyne high-density laser range scanner were synchronized and logged to disk for 90 km of travel. In addition to documenting a number of large loop closures useful for developing mapping and localization algorithms, this data set also records the first robotic traffic jam and two autonomous vehicle collisions. It is our hope that this data set will be useful to the autonomous vehicle community, especially those developing robotic perception capabilities.

AB Autonomous driving in public roads requires precise localization within the range of few centimeters. Even the best current precise localization system based on the Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) can not always reach this level of precision, especially in an urban environment, where the signal is disturbed by surrounding buildings and artifacts. Laser range finder and stereo vision have been successfully used for obstacle detection, mapping and localization to solve the autonomous driving problem. Unfortunately, Light Detection and Ranging (LIDARs) are very expensive sensors and stereo vision requires powerful dedicated hardware to process the cameras information. In this context, this article presents a low-cost architecture of sensors and data fusion algorithm capable of autonomous driving in narrow two-way roads. Our approach exploits a combination of a short-range visual lane marking detector and a dead reckoning system to build a long and precise perception of the lane markings in the vehicle's backwards. This information is used to localize the vehicle in a map, that also contains the reference trajectory for autonomous driving. Experimental results show the successful application of the proposed system on a real autonomous driving situation.

AB The basis of an electrified highway or eHighway is an intelligent current collector combined with a hybrid drive system, where the eHighway trucks collect power from the overhead cables. The first prototype for these vehicles has been developed by Siemens, but these vehicles need drivers. This paper presents a conceptual model that is an evolution of this approach, proposing a fully electrical vehicle with autonomous driving. This idea has been analyzed through simulations by using a model composed by an articulated truck and its electrical powertrain system, including a control system as well, based the on the model predictive control (MPC), widely used in autonomous vehicles. The vehicle model consists of a 2D model with 10 degrees of freedom, corresponding to the longitudinal and lateral displacements of the tractor, the tractor yaw angle, the semi-trailer yaw angle, and the rotations of the six equivalent wheels. Besides, an electric powertrain system, batteries, and a regenerative brake have been integrated into the model. Several simulation cases have been developed corresponding to an adaptive cruise control, a trajectory tracking, and an overtaking maneuver. The aim of these simulations is also to obtain the minimum size of the battery and its autonomy for an overtaking maneuver, since it is necessary to disconnect the truck from the overhead contact line during this maneuver. The simulations show the viability of this conceptual proposal, obtaining results similar to those expected.

AB In this paper, we present a control strategy for trajectory tracking and path following of generic paths for under-actuated marine vehicles. Our work is inspired and motivated by previous works on ground vehicles. In particular, we extend the definition of the hand position point, introduced for ground vehicles, to autonomous surface vehicles and autonomous underwater vehicles, and then use the hand position point as output for a control strategy based on the input-output feedback linearization method. The presented strategy is able to deal with external disturbances affecting the vehicle, e.g., constant and irrotational ocean currents. Using the Lyapunov analysis, we are able to prove that the closed-loop system has an external dynamics that is globally exponentially stable and an internal dynamics that has ultimately bounded states, both for the trajectory tracking and the path following control problems. Finally, we present a simulation case study and experimental results in order to validate the theoretical results.

AB This work investigates the robust lateral tracking control problem of autonomous vehicles subject to unmodeled system uncertainties, external disturbances as well as input constraints that commonly exist in the vehicle dynamics. The tracking controller design under such uncertain environments is challenging due to the under-actuated characteristics of the vehicle dynamics. Targeting at this issue, a nonlinear vehicle model is firstly established and transformed into a novel parametric model to facilitate the controller design. A robust adaptive learning control (RALC) approach is then proposed based on the parametric vehicle model, where an input-dependent auxiliary system is employed to compensate the influence of the input constraints. The convergence of the tracking errors is rigorously analyzed based on the framework of composite energy function. The proposed RALC scheme is proven to be able to achieve an impressive path tracking performance under perturbed and constrained scenarios. Moreover, the proposed technique in tackling the under-actuated dynamics is novel that can be applied to deal with other generic non-square systems. The proposed controller is validated with case studies under various conditions.

AB Autonomous vehicle following systems are playing a decisive role to increase vehicle density on roads by shortening intervehicle time gaps. However, disturbance attenuation along a platoon of vehicles, i.e., string stability, is being a challenging task while time gap is getting shorter. In order to guarantee the string stability of a vehicle platoon, a multiobjective H-infinity control formulation for adaptive cruise control and cooperative adaptive cruise control structures has been investigated in this paper. The proposed control method solves an optimization problem and achieves a controller that is able to provide not only the system stability, but also the string stability as distinct from the traditional H-infinity control.

AB Autonomous vehicles are being developed to replace the conventional, manned surface vehicles that tow mine hunting towed platforms. While a wide body of work exists that describes numerical models of towed systems, they usually include relatively simple models of the towed bodies and neglect the dynamics of the towing vehicle. For systems in which the mass of the towing vehicle is comparable to that of the towed vehicle, it becomes important to consider the dynamics of both vehicles, In this work, we describe the development of a numerical model that accurately captures the dynamics of these new mine hunting systems. We use a lumped mass approximation for the towcable and couple this model to non-linear numerical models of an autonomous surface vehicle and an actively controlled towfish. Within the dynamics models of the two vehicles, we include non-linear controllers to allow accurate maneuvering of the towed system. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB This paper describes an obstacle detection device for autonomous vehicles, such as LHDs and trucks, navigating in mine drifts at speeds of about 15 km/h.
   The system proposed in this paper uses a structured-light range finder and is based upon the direct extraction from images of features related to the obstacle rather than upon a 3D reconstruction of the scene's geometry. The system exploits the temporal evolution of image profiles in order to detect the presence of obstacles and lakes into account phenomena such as ground and wall irregularities, perturbations of the vehicle's trajectory and impaired visibility conditions.

AB To improve the performance and robustness of autonomous electric ground vehicles, we present a novel triple-step control architecture employing a lateral prescribed performance scheme to design an adaptive fault-tolerant controller to realize the nonlinear path-tracking manoeuvers against uncertainties, disturbances and even a total failure of steering capability. It is proved that the closed-loop system based on the developed control framework guarantees a regulation of the lateral offset with prescribed performance. The major advantage over conventional path-tracking control frameworks is that our approach can guarantee both the transient and the steady-state performance of the system under a broad range of driving conditions with robustness to model uncertainties, disturbances and even faults. Finally, simulation results are presented to demonstrate the superiority of the proposed scheme.

AB The current research of autonomous vehicle motion control mainly focuses on trajectory tracking and velocity tracking. However, numerous studies deal with trajectory tracking and velocity tracking separately, and the yaw stability is seldom considered during trajectory tracking. In this research, a combination of the longitudinal-lateral control method with the yaw stability in the trajectory tracking for autonomous vehicles is studied. Based on the vehicle dynamics, considering the longitudinal and lateral motion of the vehicle, the velocity tracking and trajectory tracking problems can be attributed to the longitudinal and lateral control. A sliding mode variable structure control method is used in the longitudinal control. The total driving force is obtained from the velocity error in order to carry out velocity tracking. A linear time-varying model predictive control method is used in the lateral control to predict the required front wheel angle for trajectory tracking. Furthermore, a combined control framework is established to control the longitudinal and lateral motions and improve the reliability of the longitudinal and lateral direction control. On this basis, the driving force of a tire is allocated reasonably by using the direct yaw moment control, which ensures good yaw stability of the vehicle when tracking the trajectory. Simulation results indicate that the proposed control strategy is good in tracking the reference velocity and trajectory and improves the performance of the stability of the vehicle.

AB In this paper, the concept of symmetry is utilized in the promising trajectory-following control design of autonomous ground electric vehicles-that is, the construction and the solution of active disturbance rejection controllers are symmetrical. This paper presents an active disturbance rejection controller (ADRC) for improving the trajectory-following performance of autonomous ground electric vehicles (AGEV) with an advanced active front steering system. Since AGEV trajectory dynamics are inherently affected by complex traffic conditions, various driving maneuvers, and other road environment, the main control objective is to deal with the AGEV trajectory control challenges of system uncertainties, system nonlinearities, and external disturbance. First, the vehicle dynamics trajectory-following model and its state space representation system are established. Then, the augmented control-oriented vehicle-trajectory-following system with dynamic error is developed. The resulting active disturbance rejection controller of the vehicle-trajectory-following system is finally designed using the trajectory performance index and active disturbance compensation, and the stability of the active disturbance rejection controller is also analyzed and derived via Lyapunov stability theory. The effectiveness of the proposed controller is validated through double lane change and serpentine maneuvers under the co-simulation platform of MATLAB/Simulink-Carsim (R). Simulation results show that the designed controller provides enhanced vehicle-trajectory-following performance compared to the linear quadratic regulator controller (LQR) and model predictive controller (MPC). It will provide a certain guidance for the controller engineering design of the AGEV trajectory-following system.

AB Inequality is a problem facing the world community, especially in developing countries, that affects urban transport and vice versa. Which possible urban transportation mode will cause the least inequality? This is a vital question. The development of Autonomous vehicles (AV) has made Shared Autonomous Vehicles (SAV) one of the future transport modes. Active and public transport are also mentioned as applicable future modes, based on the literature. This paper aims to compare inequality in active transportation, public transport and SAV as the most important alternatives to private cars in the future. In this regard, we use doughnut economic concepts as the framework for our comparison. First, the inequality concept is expanded and then literature demonstrates the future desirability of modes. We show why doughnut economics could be a beneficial alternative for comparing that resulted in the superiority of active and public transport over SAV in terms of future inequality.

AB Realizing autonomous vehicles is one of the ultimate dreams for humans. However, perceptual information collected by sensors in dynamic and complicated environments, in particular, vision information, may exhibit various types of degradation. This may lead to mispredictions of context followed by more severe consequences. Thus, it is necessary to improve degraded images before employing them for context prediction. To this end, we propose a generative adversarial network to restore images from common types of degradation. The proposed model features a novel architecture with an inverse and a reverse module to address additional attributes between image styles. With the supplementary information, the decoding for restoration can be more precise. In addition, we develop a loss function to stabilize the adversarial training with better training efficiency for the proposed model. Compared with several state-of-the-art methods, the proposed method can achieve better restoration performance with high efficiency. It is highly reliable for assisting in context prediction in autonomous vehicles.

AB This paper is concerned with a new control method for path tracking of autonomous ground vehicles. We exploit the fuzzy model-based control framework to deal with the time-varying feature of the vehicle speed and the highly uncertain behaviors of the tire-road forces involved in the nonlinear vehicle dynamics. To avoid using costly vehicle sensors for feedback control while favoring the simplest control structure for real-time implementation, a new fuzzy static output feedback (SOF) scheme is proposed. In particular, though the robust set-invariance property and Lyapunov-based arguments, the physical constraints on the steering input saturation and the vehicle state can be taken into account in the control design to improve the driving safety and comfort. The theoretical development relies on the use of fuzzy Lyapunov functions and the non-parallel distributed compensation control concept to reduce the design conservatism. Exploiting some specific convexification techniques, the control design is reformulated as an optimization problem under linear matrix inequalities with a single line search, which are efficiently solved via semidefinite programming techniques. The proposed fuzzy path tracking controller is evaluated through various dynamic driving tests conducted with high-fidelity CarSim/Matlab co-simulations. Moreover, to emphasize the advantages of the new fuzzy SOF controller, a performance comparison with the CarSim driver model is also performed.

AB This paper studies the lateral control problem for intelligent vehicles based on the concept of shared control. Considering the participation of drivers in the control loop, a shared control-based lateral controller is designed, which consists of two differed controllers: one is an LQR-based autonomous driving controller and the other is a driver's intention-based fuzzy controller. For the vehicle dynamic model with two-degrees of freedom, an autonomous driving controller based on LQR and a driver's intention-based fuzzy controller are designed. Then, the lateral controller based on shared control is constructed, which integrates the aforementioned two controllers. Finally, the co-simulation by MATLAB/Simulink and Carsim is presented. Furthermore, simulation results show that the designed lateral controller can track the desired path with better performance than the LQR-based autonomous driving controller.

AB Purpose of Review We summarize recent progress on autonomous observations of ocean carbonate chemistry and the development of a network of sensors capable of observing carbonate processes at multiple temporal and spatial scales.
   Recent Findings The development of versatile pH sensors suitable for both deployment on autonomous vehicles and in compact, fixed ecosystem observatories has been a major development in the field. The initial large-scale deployment of profiling floats equipped with these new pH sensors in the Southern Ocean has demonstrated the feasibility of a global autonomous open-ocean carbonate observing system.
   Summary Our developing network of autonomous carbonate observations is currently targeted at surface ocean CO2 fluxes and compact ecosystem observatories. New integration of developed sensors on gliders and surface vehicles will increase our coastal and regional observational capability. Most autonomous platforms observe a single carbonate parameter, which leaves us reliant on the use of empirical relationships to constrain the rest of the carbonate system. Sensors now in development promise the ability to observe multiple carbonate system parameters from a range of vehicles in the near future.

AB In this paper, we develop an adaptive control algorithm for addressing security for a class of networked vehicles that comprise a formation of n<^> human-driven vehicles sharing kinematic data and an autonomous vehicle in the aft of the vehicle formation receiving data from the preceding vehicles through wireless vehicle-to-vehicle communication devices. Specifically, we develop an adaptive controller for mitigating time-invariant state-dependent adversarial sensor and actuator attacks while guaranteeing uniform ultimate boundedness of the closed-loop networked system. Furthermore, an adaptive learning framework is presented for identifying the state space model parameters based on input-output data. This learning technique utilizes previously stored data as well as current data to identify the system parameters using a relaxed persistence of excitation condition. The effectiveness of the proposed approach is demonstrated by an illustrative numerical example involving a platoon of connected vehicles.

AB Currently, road surface conditions ahead of autonomous vehicles are not well detected by the existing sensors on those autonomous vehicles. However, driving safety should be ensured for the weather-induced road conditions for day and night. An investigation into deep learning to recognize the road surface conditions in the day is conducted using the collected data from an embedded camera on the front of the vehicles. Deep learning models have only been proven to be successful in the day, but they have not been assessed for night conditions to date. The objective of this work is to propose deep learning models to detect on-line road surface conditions caused by weather ahead of the autonomous vehicles at night with a high accuracy. For this study, different deep learning models, namely traditional CNN, SqueezeNet, VGG, ResNet, and DenseNet models, are applied with performance comparison. Considering the current limitation of existing night-time detection, reflection features of different road surfaces are investigated in this paper. According to the features, night-time databases are collected with and without ambient illumination. These databases are collected from several public videos in order to make the selected models more applicable to more scenes. In addition, selected models are trained based on a collected database. Finally, in the validation, the accuracy of these models to classify dry, wet, and snowy road surface conditions at night can be up to 94%.

AB Autonomous navigation in GPS-denied environments is a challenging task for MAV (Micro-Aerial Vehicle). That needs the MAV to do localization quickly and robustly while avoiding obstacles without the priori knowledge of environment. The limited onboard resources also restrict perceptive capability and computation. In this paper, a completed solution about platform design and software architecture is proposed. The perception system is proposed for localization and perceiving the environment. The motion planning and control system are presented for collision avoidance. Experimental testing reveals that the proposed solution can achieve fast and robust MAV autonomous navigation in GPS-denied environments.(c) 2022 Elsevier Masson SAS. All rights reserved.

AB Reduction of the propulsive power requirement by efficient hull form design is one of the important requirements for the successful operation of autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs). In the absence of reliable and sufficiently accurate experimental data this will require experimental analysis of a large number of hull forms, a task which is both expensive and time-consuming. Recent developments in computational fluid dynamics (CFD) can offer a cost-effective solution to this problem. In this paper such a method is developed to simulate the flow past axisymmetric AUVs. Its application is discussed for four different hull forms. (C) 1997 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB Autonomous Vehicles (AVs) have the potential to transform the transportation industry with significant economic, social and environmental benefits. However, the mass deployment of AVs depends on public desire to use them. This study aims to examine the effect of instrumental, symbolic, and affective motives on the behavioural intention to use fully AVs. Based on a survey of 240 U.S. residents, a structural equation modeling analysis was performed. Our results suggest the behavioural intention to use fully AVs depends on fulfilling instrumental (i.e., performance expectancy and hedonic motivation), symbolic (i.e., personal innovativeness and social influence) and affective motives (i.e., trust and performance risk). These results have implication for designing policy interventions to increase the deployment of AVs.

AB Autonomous vehicles (AVs) can be stacked behind each other like valet parking due to their self-parking capability to increase land utilization and decrease the parking space allocation. However, such parking arrangements cause blockage and necessitate AVs relocation inside the car-park whenever a blocked AV is summoned. In this paper, we investigate AV parking spot selection based on their arrival and departure times to minimize the number of such relocation movements. We study both full and partial information scenarios in which we have exactly a priori information, and no a priori information about arrival and departure time, respectively. The results show that parking in the spot with the lowest blockage probability can decrease the number of relocation movements. Also, our analysis shows that retrieving vehicles from the rear side does not have a significant impact on the number of relocation movements.

AB This study develops an online unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) path-planning strategy for autonomous search and localisation of targets in a risky environment that simultaneously optimises two objectives: (i) search and (ii) survival. The authors formulate two rewards (objective) functions corresponding to the two objectives and compute the Pareto front, formed by taking convex combinations of these rewards. In the extreme case of pure search, using entropy reduction as the reward, the trajectory of the UAV is reminiscent of a systematic search pattern. When combined with the survival objective, the search pattern appears more random, as the UAV intelligently trades off the reward of finding targets with the risk of being destroyed.

It can be used for autonomous intelligent cruise control including stop-and-go traffic situations. The network itself consists of a simple multilayer feedforward perceptron network. A special training method is used, where the neural network is trained on a detailed nonlinear dynamic vehicle model. Practical road tests with the Daimler Bent experimental vehicle OSCAR (MB 300 TE station wagon) show good results for both high- and low-speed control.

AB This paper investigates the problem of path following control for an autonomous vehicle subject to the localization errors and the tire slip effects. First, by analyzing the effects of localization errors, a loss-of-effectiveness actuator model is formulated, and a new chain form model is constructed for path following system of the vehicle. Then, the polytopic model is proposed to characterize the nonlinearity of the system, and an observer-based path following controller is designed by satisfying both the H-infinity, criterion and L-1 criterion. Finally, the path following controller design problem is converted into an optimization problem, which can be solved readily through convex optimization techniques. The effectiveness of the proposed control strategy is verified by simulation results.

AB A homography-based dynamic control approach applied to station keeping of autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) without relying on linear velocity measurements is proposed. The homography estimated from images of a planar target scene captured by a downward-looking camera is directly used as feedback information. The full dynamics of the AUV are exploited in a hierarchical control design with inner and outer loop architectures. Enhanced by integral compensation actions and disturbance torque estimation, the proposed controller is robust with respect to model uncertainties and unknown currents. The performance of the proposed control approach is illustrated using both comparative simulation results conducted on a realistic AUV model and experimental validations on an in-house AUV.

DE Artificial kinematic field; Automatic optical inspection;

AB A novel approach to the autonomous generation of trajectories for multiple aerial vehicles is presented, whereby an artificial kinematic field provides autonomous control in a distributed and highly scalable manner. The kinematic field is generated relative to a central target and is modified when a vehicle is in close proximity of another to avoid collisions. This control scheme is then applied to the mock visual inspection of a nuclear intermediate level waste storage drum. The inspection is completed using two commercially available quadcopters, in a laboratory environment, with the acquired visual inspection data processed and photogrammetrically meshed to generate a three-dimensional surface-meshed model of the drum. This paper contributes to the field of multi-agent coverage path planning for structural inspection and provides experimental validation of the control and inspection results. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

AB Recently, the advancement of deep learning (DL) in discriminative feature learning from 3-D LiDAR data has led to rapid development in the field of autonomous driving. However, automated processing uneven, unstructured, noisy, and massive 3-D point clouds are a challenging and tedious task. In this article, we provide a systematic review of existing compelling DL architectures applied in LiDAR point clouds, detailing for specific tasks in autonomous driving, such as segmentation, detection, and classification. Although several published research articles focus on specific topics in computer vision for autonomous vehicles, to date, no general survey on DL applied in LiDAR point clouds for autonomous vehicles exists. Thus, the goal of this article is to narrow the gap in this topic. More than 140 key contributions in the recent five years are summarized in this survey, including the milestone 3-D deep architectures, the remarkable DL applications in 3-D semantic segmentation, object detection, and classification; specific data sets, evaluation metrics, and the state-of-the-art performance. Finally, we conclude the remaining challenges and future researches.

AB This paper deals with the leader-follower formation control of underactuated autonomous surface vehicles in the presence of model uncertainties and input constraints. In a leader-follower formation, an autonomous surface vehicle (ASV) called leader tracks a pre-described trajectory and other ASVs called followers that are controlled to follow the leader with a desired distance and desired relative bearing. To this end, some adaptive robust techniques are adopted to guarantee the robustness of the closed-loop system against model uncertainties, external disturbances, and input saturation constraints. Based on the Lyapunov synthesis, it is proven that with the developed formation controllers, the closed-loop system is stable and all the formation errors converge to a small neighborhood of zero. Simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.

AB Recent advances in digital twin and parallel intelligence (DTPI) enable the mapping of the physical world to a high-fidelity virtual representation and facilitate intelligent prediction and decision-making for autonomous vehicles and intelligent transportation systems. In the context of DTPI, in this study, we investigate trajectory-prediction-enabled motion planning for autonomous vehicles using deep neural networks. We first implement a motion planner using a neural network as an approximation of traditional planners. The inputs to the baseline planner include the current states of the ego and its surrounding agents and a shared map. The planner produces a five-second trajectory for the ego vehicle considering the current situation. Subsequently, we generalize the baseline to consider the historical states of the ego and its surrounding agents. Using the generalized planner, we investigate the impacts of the history horizon on planning performance. We next investigate how the future motions of the surrounding agents of the ego affect the planner and observe improvement in planning. This demonstrates that knowledge of the future trajectories of other agents is useful for planning. However, we do not have access to ground-truth future motions for inference. Finally, we investigate how the future can be approximated through prediction and how the prediction quality affects planning performance.

AB A fully autonomous vehicle must ensure not only fully autonomous driving but also the safety and comfort of its passengers. However, the self-driving technology that is currently completed focuses only on perfect driving and does not guarantee the safety and comfort of passengers. This paper proposes a braking-pressure and driving-direction determination system (BDDS), which computes the brake pressure and steering angle optimized for passenger safety by utilizing more diverse information than existing autonomous vehicles. The BDDS proposed in this paper consists of two modules. The road roughness classification module (RRCM) classifies the roughness of the road by using the pressure data applied to the suspension and the K-NN algorithm and computes the optimal brake pressure. The passenger recognition and sharing module (PRSM) identifies the current occupant status of the vehicle by using a body pressure sensor and CNN, shares the information with surrounding vehicles, and computes the optimal steering angle using passenger information and road information. As a result of the simulations described in this paper, the parameters of AI models were optimized.

AB Just after sunrise and before sunset the sun can shine directly into driver's eyes making it more difficult to see the road ahead. The direct sunlight problem creates a serious risk for human drivers as well as machine vision systems for autonomous vehicles. In 2016, the on-board cameras of a Tesla level 2 autonomy vehicle were unable to detect the side of a white truck due to bright sunlight. In order to solve the direct sunlight problem, we apply high dynamic range (HDR) imaging algorithms to the machine vision system of Lawrence Technological University's autonomous electric research vehicle and measure how well the system performs in direct sunlight. A Raspberry Pi is used to capture several manual exposure frames and compose HDR frames using three HDR algorithms provided by OpenCV 3. The resulting frames are supplied as input to the autonomous vehicle. Standard dynamic range (SDR) images captured using auto exposure are compared to equivalent HDR frames using various quality metrics. Objective assessment metrics are also performed to compare the color and contrast of HDR and SDR frames. Results show the system performs best when using HDR frames generated by the Mertens algorithm. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB There is a debate on the importance of autonomous vehicles (AVs) and the methods for ensuring AV safety. This paper analyses collision reports to determine the association between risk factors and the level of damage to an AV due to collisions. Association rule mining was used to develop methodologies that can advance result interpretability, which is crucial in the transportation field. Twenty-one rules were discovered to reveal the factors that co-occur with AV damage. This study demonstrates that collision data, when analysed using appropriate machine learning algorithms, can generate useful insights that complement current policies to enhance AV safety.

AB Making proper decisions at intersections that are one of the most dangerous and sophisticated driving scenarios is full of challenges, especially for autonomous vehicles (AVs). The existing decision-making approaches for AVs at intersections are limited as they only consider driving safety in simple intersection scenarios while sacrificing travel efficiency and driving comfort. To solve this issue, a decision-making structure motivated by deep reinforcement learning was proposed for autonomous driving at complex intersection scenarios based on long short-term memory (LSTM). The mapping relationship between traffic images collected from camera sensors and AVs' actions was established by constructing convolutional-recurrent neural networks in a decision-making framework. Traffic images collected from camera sensors at two different timesteps were used to understand the relative motion information between AVs and other vehicles. To model the interaction between the AV and other vehicles, Markov decision process was used. The deep Q-network (DQN) algorithm was applied to generate the optimal driving policy that could comprehensively consider driving safety, travel efficiency and driving comfort. Three crash-prone complex intersection scenarios were reconstructed in CARLA (car learning to act) to evaluate the performance of our proposed method. The results indicate that our method can make AV drive through intersections safely and efficiently with desirable driving comfort in all the examined scenarios.

AB In the future complex intelligent transportation environments, lane-changing behavior of surrounding vehicles is a significant factor affecting the driving safety. It is necessary to predict the lane-changing behaviors accurately. The driving environments and drivers are the main factors of lane-changing. To comprehensively consider their relationship, this article proposes a prediction method based on a fuzzy inference system (FIS) and a long short-term memory (LSTM) neural network. First, to highly integrate driving environments with drivers, drivers' cognitive processes of driving environments are simulated using FIS. Fuzzy rules are formulated based on drivers' cognition, and then driving environments information can be transformed into lane-changing feasibility. Second, the obtained lane-changing feasibility and corresponding vehicle trajectory are designed as input variables of LSTM neural network to predict the lane-changing behavior. Third, based on the above prediction results, an intelligent decision-making strategy is designed for path planning of autonomous vehicle to ensure driving safety. The prediction method is trained and tested by the next generation simulation (NGSIM) dataset, which is made up of real vehicle trajectories. The accurate rate of the method is 92.40%. Moreover, the decision strategy is simulated and verified in hardware-in-the-loop system. Results show that the strategy can significantly improve the performance of driving in dealing with lane-changing behaviors.

AB Road shoulders and slopes often appear in unstructured environments. They make 2.5D vehicle trajectory planning commonly seen in our daily life, which lies on a 2D manifold embedded in a 3D space. The height difference of these terrains brings spatially dependent constraints on vehicle maneuvers, such as the limit on vehicle steering for vehicle tire protection when a vehicle approaches a road shoulder edge. These constraints have an ``if-else'' structure since they are activated only when the vehicle passes through the local area with a height difference, making the restriction on variables coupled with the judgment of variables. This makes the application of state-of-art optimization-based planners challenging. To solve this problem, we devise an approximation formulation for these constraints in the trajectory planning optimization problem, whose solution depends on a proper initial guess for the optimizer. We propose a two-stage trajectory planning framework, where the first stage improves the hybrid A* algorithm by adding spatially dependent constraints into node expansion to provide the initial guess. Then, the optimization problem with the formulated spatially dependent constraints is solved for further trajectory smoothness and quality. Finally, the simulation results validate the fast and high-quality planning performance of our proposed framework.

AB Oceans exploration and inspection are a great challenge for the industry nowadays. The underwater instrumentation and measurements are improving due to the current technologies, or by development of new ones, to cover the demand of the new industry offshore. The Autonomous Underwater Vehicle (AUV), a subcategory of submarine, is used to perform subaquatic tasks. This vehicle provides advantages for underwater works, e.g., safety and reliability inspections, but it also offers limitations for sensors systems, monitoring and communications systems, autonomous operational endurances, propulsion systems or mapping designs, etc. The main scientific contributions of this paper are: a review of the state of art in novel and main instrumentation and measurement systems embedded in AUVs; an illustration of their future uses and development; and a synthesis of the main and current navigation, mapping and sampling technologies, together with different applications.

AB As the use of robotic mechanisms in various fields increases, the dynamics of many kinds of mechanism have to be thoroughly understood and analysed for safe and stable operation. This study is concerned with the enhancement of floor-driving ability for a two-wheeled inverted-pendulum-type autonomous vehicle. This type of robotic mechanism is innately unstable, therefore stabilization of the robot's body posture is primarily needed. For more stable driving at high speeds, the exact dynamics of this robotic mechanism was investigated using Kane's dynamic modelling. By analysing the dynamics and the system as a whole, the vehicle's stability at higher speeds was improved. The experimental results with various types of motion confirmed the enhancement of the robot's driving ability.

AB Reliable SONAR-performance prediction in shallow water requires knowledge of the seabed reflectivity, or its geoacoustic properties, which is expensive and difficult to acquire in situ. This paper illustrates two sea trials conducted in different shallow water areas to investigate the feasibility of acquiring such knowledge efficiently from measurements of naturally occurring ambient noise by an array that is compact enough to be mounted on a small autonomous underwater vehicle. The system relies on a previous technique for passively estimating the bottom reflection loss from the acoustic noise field generated by wind and breaking waves at the sea surface. Results from these experiments supported by numerical modeling are presented and compared with independent measurements of the relevant seabed reflectivity properties. The results obtained from both experiments demonstrate the potential of using autonomous underwater vehicles for seabed characterization.

AB Underwater acoustic localization (UWAL) of the black box for a sunken airplane utilizing an autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) is a useful technique in ensuring traffic safety. Aiming at improving localization precision, this article proposes a new path-planning algorithm based on the improved artificial potential field (APF). Compared with the conventional APF, we modify the conventional gravitation force and introduce a new localization precision force. Therefore, a balance between localization precision and obstacle avoidance is achieved, and the localization precision is significantly improved. The lake trial result validates the effectiveness of the proposed method.

AB This paper studies a guidance and control framework of multiple autonomous surface underwater vehicles (multi-ASUV) based on deep reinforcement learning (DRL) for target tracking. The framework enables the vehicles to complete the standoff tracking and sampling tasks in a predetermined circular trajectory centered on the target and maintain predetermined relative positions during the process to obtain high-precision spatiotemporal synchronization data. We design an end-to-end architecture that maps the sensor inputs to control commands and develop autonomous capable of achieving the hybrid objective of cooperative guidance, standoff tracking, and dynamic obstacle avoidance without having prior knowledge about the goal or the environment. The results demonstrate the feasibility of the end-to-end DRL method with higher accuracy than the traditional "guidance-control"two-step method. Meanwhile, the obstacle avoidance and standoff tracking experiment for swarm and the sampling experiment in the mesoscale eddy area are stimulated further to verify the proposed framework's effectiveness and robust ability.

AB This paper presents a robust H-infinity path following control strategy for autonomous ground vehicles with delays and data dropouts. The state measurements and signal transmissions usually suffer from inevitable delays and data packet dropouts, which may degrade the control performance or even deteriorate the system stability. A robust H-infinity state-feedback controller is proposed to achieve the path following and vehicle lateral control simultaneously. A generalized delay representation is formulated to include the delays and data dropouts in the measurement and transmission. The uncertainties of the tire cornering stiffnesses and the external disturbances are also considered to enhance the robustness of the proposed controller. Two simulation cases are presented with a high-fidelity and full-car model based on the CarSim-Simulink joint platform, and the results verify the effectiveness and robustness of the proposed control approach.

AB The scheduling, for autonomous refueling, of multiple unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) is posed as a combinatorial optimization problem. An efficient dynamic programming (DP) algorithm is introduced for finding the optimal initial refueling sequence. The optimal sequence needs to be recalculated when conditions change, such as when UAVs join or leave the queue unexpectedly. We develop a systematic shuffle scheme to reconfigure the UAV sequence using the least amount of shuffle steps. A similarity metric over UAV sequences is introduced to quantify the reconfiguration effort which is treated as an additional cost and is integrated into the DP algorithm. Feasibility and limitations of this novel approach are also discussed.

TI Integrating Shared Autonomous Vehicles into Existing Transportation

AB This study investigates the potential benefits of integrating shared autonomous vehicles and an existing transportation system by exploring a recently initiated project that integrates autonomous vehicles (AVs) with an existing on-demand ridesharing service, Via, in Arlington, Texas. We first identified the spatial patterns of the ridership on a localized scale, using geographically weighted regression (GWR) for the existing paratransit service, Handitran. Assuming that the existing ridership will be combined in the future with shared autonomous vehicles, we looked at integration options, based on the spatial patterns of supply and demand and payment options for the riders. The results suggest that the paratransit service, Handitran, is currently used by a small proportion of the eligible population, whose travel patterns differ based on their age. For instance, younger users usually ride Handitran for traveling to work, recreational activities, and routine chores, while senior riders often use the service for medical and recreational trips. The results of the GWR model indicate that the major determinants of Handitran usage are the population's percentage of older adults, racial distribution, and household vehicle ownership; the coefficients of these factors vary across the city. Hot-spot analyses' results reveal that integrating the services will improve the efficiency of the existing transportation system by responding to the excess rider demand, particularly in the downtown area. Finally, we describe the implications of implementing policies for AV integration for cities, service providers, and other stakeholders and suggest future research topics.

ID ENERGY
AB Environmental pollution and energy use in the light-duty transportation sector are currently regulated through fuel economy and emissions standards, which typically assess quantity of pollutants emitted and volume of fuel used per distance driven. In the United States, fuel economy testing consists of a vehicle on a treadmill, while a trained driver follows a fixed drive cycle. By design, the current standardized fuel economy testing system neglects differences in how individuals drive their vehicles on the road. As autonomous vehicle (AV) technology is introduced, more aspects of driving are shifted into functions of decisions made by the vehicle, rather than the human driver. Yet the current fuel economy testing procedure does not have a mechanism to evaluate the impacts of AV technology on fuel economy ratings, and subsequent regulations such as Corporate Average Fuel Economy targets. This paper develops a method to incorporate the impacts of AV technology within the bounds of current fuel economy test, and simulates a range of automated following drive cycles to estimate changes in fuel economy. The results show that AV following algorithms designed without considering efficiency can degrade fuel economy by up to 3%, while efficiency-focused control strategies may equal or slightly exceed the existing EPA fuel economy test results, by up to 10%. This suggests the need for a new near-term approach in fuel economy testing to account for connected and autonomous vehicles. As AV technology improves and adoption increases in the future, a further reimagining of drive cycles and testing is required. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB In outdoor fields such as construction, mining and agriculture, there is an increasing demand for autonomous vehicles to reduce labor costs. Also, a positioning system is one key technology required for autonomous vehicle systems. For the purpose of expanding the potential of millimeter-wave applications, we have developed a positioning system in the 77-79 GHz frequency band, using the hyperbolic radio navigation method. This system operates in a restricted area with a radius of about a few hundred meters: A spread spectrum with a PN code is used as the ranging signals. We realized about +/- 0.1 m in positioning accuracy.

AB Human intelligence has the advantage for making high-level decisions in the remote control of underwater vehicles, while autonomous control is superior for accurate and fast close-range pose adjustment. Combining the advantages of both remote and autonomous control, this paper proposes a visual-aided shared-control method for a semi-autonomous underwater vehicle (sAUV) to conduct flexible, efficient and stable underwater grasping. The proposed method utilizes an arbitration mechanism to assign the authority weights of the human command and the automatic controller according to the attraction field (AF) generated by the target objects. The AF intensity is adjusted by understanding the human intention, and the remote-operation command is fused with a visual servo controller. The shared controller is designed based on the kinematic and dynamic models, and model parameter uncertainties are also addressed. Efficient and stable control performance is validated by both simulation and experiment. Faster and accurate dynamic positioning in front of the target object is achieved using the shared-control method. Compared to the pure remote operation mode, the shared-control mode significantly reduces the average time consumption on grasping tasks for both skilled and unskilled operators.

AB A mathematical model is developed for the study of cooperative control problems for multiple uninhabited autonomous vehicles (UAVs). This model includes a representation for the vehicles, environment, and communication network. Then, we introduce a simple integer programming (IP) approach that allows the UAVs to cooperatively decide where to go, and compare it with a strategy with no cooperation between vehicles. The main contribution here is the model, its representation of the many challenges presented in cooperative control, and the analysis methodology, where there is a focus on verification of closed-loop system properties and identification of principles and design trade-offs.

AB Autonomous vehicle (AV) technology can provide a safe and convenient transportation solution for the public, but the complex and various environments in the real world make it difficult to operate safely and reliably. A connected autonomous vehicle (CAV) is an AV with vehicle connectivity capability, which enhances the situational awareness of the AV and enables the cooperation between AVs. Hence, CAV technology can enhance the capabilities and robustness of AV to be a promising transportation solution in the future. This paper introduces a representative architecture of CAVs and surveys the latest research advances, methods, and algorithms for sensing, perception, planning, and control of CAVs. It reviews the state-of-the-art and state-of-the-practice (when applicable) of a multi-layer Perception-Planning-Control architecture including on-board sensors and vehicular communications, the methods of sensor fusion and localization and mapping in the perception layer, the algorithms of decision making and trajectory planning in the planning layer, and the control strategies of trajectory tracking in the control layer. Furthermore, the implementations and impact of vehicle connectivity and the corresponding consequential challenges of cooperative perception, complex connected decision making, and multi-vehicle controls are summarized and their significant research issues enumerated. Most importantly, the critical review in this paper provides a list and discussion of the remaining challenges and unsolved problems of CAVs in each Section which would be helpful to researchers in the field. The comprehensive coverage of this paper makes it particularly useful to academic researchers, practitioners, and students alike.

AB In this paper, a dynamic mathematical model of an autonomous ground vehicle was used to analyse its transient response and to design a heading-angle controller for the vehicle. A suitable control-oriented model' that could accurately characterize the phenomenon of interest was used to design the controller. The efficacy of this model was evaluated by corroborating its results with experimental data. This model included the cornering stiffness of the tyres as an unknown parameter, and two approaches were attempted to estimate its value. The dynamics of the actuator were included in the analysis since the response time to steer the front wheel is of the same order as that of the heading-angle dynamics of the vehicle. The performance of two controllers (namely a classical transfer-function-based controller and an optimal linear quadratic regulator) were evaluated using the IPG: CarMaker((R)) simulation platform over a range of speeds. The transfer-function-based controller was also implemented on the experimental test vehicle at low speeds (high-speed experimental implementation was not possible because of safety concerns). It was found that control gain scheduling helped to track the desired heading angles of the vehicle at various speeds. Subsequently, a lane-change manoeuvre using the test vehicle was performed to evaluate the controller further. It was found that the transfer-function-based heading-angle controller could provide a comparable performance with that of the linear quadratic regulator, while keeping the sensing requirements to a minimum; thus, it was suitable for real-time implementation in an autonomous ground vehicle.

AB Low-power embedded technology offers a roadmap for enabling deep learning (DL) applications in mobile scenarios, like future autonomous vehicles. However, the lack of breakthrough power efficiency improvements can jeopardize the realization of truly "cognitive" mobile systems that meet real-time deadlines. This work focuses on the new generation cloud-backed mobile cognition system architecture where vehicles execute DL applications with dynamic assistance from the cloud. We unveil opportunities for power-efficient inferencing at the edge through a technique that balances inference execution across the cloud and the vehicle. This level of adaptation results in significant power efficiency improvements compared to all or nothing solutions, where inferences execute either completely on the vehicle or completely in the cloud. In addition, the cloud can have an active role in helping the vehicle to improve its DL capabilities by communicating relevant model updates, with up to 63% bandwidth savings and negligible accuracy degradation when the proposed relevance-driven federated learning technique is used. Finally, the cloud-backed mobile cognition concept is extended to the case of "flying clouds" where vehicles connect to flying drones that provide services while in flight. Although their capabilities are not on par with the stationary cloud, the flying cloud reduces services' latency significantly and enables critical functionalities.

AB Autosub Long Range 6000 is a 6000-m-rated autonomous underwater vehicle capable of 2- to 3-month-long deployments covering a range of up to 1800 km. This high endurance is achieved through a combination of the use of high energy-density lithium primary cells and energy optimization for all subsystems. This article uses theory and initial trial results to quantify the power consumption of the system and make predictions for ultimate range and endurance. An overview of early science deployments is also presented.

AB In this paper, we investigate a novel driveway management strategy, namely deploying au-tonomous vehicle/credit charging links in mixed-autonomy transportation networks. Such links are freely accessible for (connected) autonomous vehicles, while charging credits for human-driven vehicles. We formulate the mixed traffic equilibrium as a variational in-equality problem, based on which a bi-level programming model is proposed to simultane-ously determine the optimal location as well as the credit charge of these links. Then a ge-netic algorithm is applied to solve the bi-level problem, within which a gradient projection method is used to solve the lower-level problem. Numerical results reveal that deployment of such links further improves the network performance compared with the case where only a tradable credit scheme is implemented. We also find that different strategies are employed to deploy the differentiated charging links under different scenarios, which pro-vides useful insight for the practical implementation. Moreover, we investigate the credit trading market and find that connected autonomous vehicle users are more likely to be the beneficiary in the proposed scheme. In this regard, the proposed scheme also has the potential to propel the market penetration of connected autonomous vehicles. (c) 2022 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB We present a novel collaborative mapping and autonomous parking system for semi-structured multistory parking garages, based on cooperative 3-D LiDAR point cloud registration and Bayesian probabilistic updating. First, an inertial-enhanced (IE) generalized iterative closest point (G-ICP) approach is presented to perform high accuracy registration for LiDAR odometry, which is loosely coupled with inertial measurement unit using multi-state extended Kalman filter fusion. Second, the IE G-ICP is utilized to reconstruct the 3-D point cloud model for each vehicle, and then the individual model maps are merged and updated into a global probabilistic 2-D grid map. A collaborative multiple layer semantic map is constructed to support autonomous parking. Finally, we propose a collaborative navigation approach for path planning when there are multiple vehicles in the parking garage through vehicle-tovehicle communication. A global path planner is designed to explore the minimum cost path based on the semantic map, and local motion planning is performed using a random exploring algorithm for obstacle avoidance and path smoothing. Our pilot experimental evaluation provides a proof of concept for indoor autonomous parking by collaborative perception, map merging, and updating methodologies.

AB This article investigates the stability analysis and the fuzzy dynamic positioning (DP) controller design for an autonomous surface vehicle (ASV) based on sampled-data. Firstly, the Takagi-Sugeno (T-S) fuzzy model for the ASV with dynamic positioning system (DPS) is established. Then the criteria for asymptotically stability analysis and controller synthesis are provided by means of linear matrix inequalities. And less conservative results can be obtained by introducing convex reciprocal inequalities. Finally, simulation result is shown that the fuzzy sampled-data controller is effective to guarantee that the states of the ASV are stable and have good DP performance under the external disturbance.

AB In the face of external disturbances, the autonomous vehicle with a high center of gravity is exposed to the risk of roll instability during trajectory tracking. To this end, this paper aims to propose a vector-extended-state-observer (VESO)-based adaptive fixed-time terminal sliding mode prescribed performance control strategy, which coordinates the front wheel steering angle and external roll moment to ensure the roll stability of the high center of gravity autonomous vehicle while improving the tracking dynamic and steady state performances. The VESO for estimating the external disturbance is designed to enhance the robustness outside the sliding mode surface, based on which the adaptive updating laws compensate the estimation errors to provide the control system's dynamic performance. A fixed-time sliding mode control with prescribed performance is proposed, which combines a fixed-time prescribed performance control method to further improve the transient performance and steady-state accuracy. The double lane-changing reference trajectory tracking conditions under different vehicle driving speeds and initial errors settings are verified by simulation in MATLAB/Simulink environment, and the results show that the proposed control strategy can ensure the rolling stability of the vehicle, can track the reference trajectory accurately and quickly, and has strong robustness.

TI Unified Command and Control for Heterogeneous Marine Sensing Networks
SO JOURNAL OF FIELD ROBOTICS
LA English
DT Article
AB Successful command and control (C2) of autonomous vehicles poses challenges that are unique to the marine environment, primarily highly restrictive acoustic communications throughput. To address this, the Unified C2 architecture presented here uses a highly compressed short message encoding scheme (Dynamic Compact Control Language or DCCL) to transfer commands and receive vehicle status. DCCL is readily reconfigurable to provide the flexibility needed to change commands on short notice. Furthermore, operation of multiple types of vehicles requires a C2 architecture that is both scalable and flexible to differences among platform hardware and abilities. The Unified C2 architecture uses the MOOS-IvP autonomy system to act as a "backseat driver" of the vehicle. This provides a uniform interface to the control system on all the vehicles. Also, a hierarchical configuration system is used to allow single changes in configuration to propagate to all vehicles in operation. Status data from all vehicles are displayed visually using Google Earth, which also allows a rapid meshing of data from other sources (sensors, automatic identification system, radar, satellites) from within, as well as outside of, the MOOS-IvP architecture. Results are presented throughout from the CCLNET08, SQUINT08, GLINT08, GLINT09, SWAMSI09, and DURIP09 experiments involving robotic marine autonomous surface craft (ASCs) and Bluefin, OceanServer, and NATO Undersea Research Centre (NURC) autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs). 0 2010 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

AB Understanding the 3D space is crucial for autonomous vehicles for planning and navigation. Traditionally autonomous vehicles use LiDAR sensor to 3D map its environment. LiDAR sensor data are often noisy and sparse making it not fully reliable for real-time applications like autonomous driving, thus redundant such sensors are used for the purpose. The array of cameras in an autonomous vehide purposed for detection and tracking can be reused for depth estimation as well. In this paper, an unsupervised monocular depth estimation approach for autonomous vehicles which can be used as redundant depth estimators replacing multiple LiDAR sensors. Here, a deep learning based method is used with a multiscale encoder-decoder network to estimate depth. Target view among the stereo pairs is reconstructed by inverse warping the source view using geometric camera projection. The network is guided by the stereo positive-negative(SPN) loss which minimizes the loss between reconstructed view and corresponding stereo ground truth and, also maximizes the loss between reconstructed views and corresponding opposite stereo ground truth. The proposed approach shows state of the art accuracy in autonomous driving dataset KITTI. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Obstacle avoidance is a key aspect for any autonomous vehicles, and their usage in agriculture must overcome additional challenges such as handling interactions with agricultural workers and other tractors in order to avoid severe accidents. The simultaneous presence of autonomous vehicles and workers on foot definitely calls for safer designs, vehicle management systems and major developments in personal protective equipment (PPE). To cope with these present and future challenges, the "SMARTGRID" project described in this paper deploys an integrated wireless safety network infrastructure based on the integration of Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) devices and passive radio frequency identification (RFID) tags designed to identify obstacles, workers, nearby vehicles and check if the right PPE is in use. With the aim of detecting workers at risk by scanning for passive RFID-integrated into PPE in danger areas, transmitting alerts to workers who wear them, tracking of near-misses and activating emergency stops, a deep analysis of the safety requirements of the obstacle detection system is shown in this study. Test programs have also been carried out on an experimental farm with detection ranging from 8 to 12 meters, proving that the system might represent a good solution for collision avoidance between autonomous vehicles and workers on foot.

AB Rear-end collision detection and avoidance is one of the most crucial driving tasks of self-driving vehicles. Mathematical models and fuzzy logic-based methods have recently been proposed to improve the effectiveness of the rear-end collision detection and avoidance systems in autonomous vehicles (AVs). However, these methodologies do not tackle real-time object detection and response problems in dense/dynamic road traffic conditions due to their complex computation and decision-making structures. In our previous work, we presented an affective computing-inspired Enhanced Emotion Enabled Cognitive Agent (EEEC_Agent), which is capable of rear-end collision avoidance using artificial human driver emotions. However, the architecture of the EEEC_Agent is based on an ultrasonic sensory system which follows three-state driving strategies without considering the neighbor vehicles types. To address these issues, in this paper we propose an extended version of the EEEC_Agent which contains human driver-inspired dynamic driving mode controls for autonomous vehicles. In addition, a novel end-to-end learning-based motion planner has been devised to perceive the surrounding environment and regulate driving tasks accordingly. The real-time in-field experiments performed using a prototype AV demonstrate the effectiveness of this proposed rear-end collision avoidance system.

ID EXPERIENCE; FRAMEWORK
AB Autonomous driving has received widespread attention in recent years, while the limited battery life and computing capability of autonomous vehicles cannot support some necessary computation-intensive and urgent tasks with strict response time requirements. The results of the tasks would be useless and may cause serious safety hazards if the given time constraints are exceeded. On the other side, mobile edge computing (MEC) offers the possibility of autonomous vehicles to complete these time-constraint tasks due to its proximity and strong computing capabilities, with the faster 5G wireless networks to enable vehicles and MEC servers to exchange data in milliseconds. Then, it is a key issue to make the MEC servers to execute and complete these time-constraint autonomous-driving tasks as many as possible. So, we propose a task scheduling algorithm that can consider characteristics of autonomous-driving tasks and select more suitable MEC servers with task migration, based on an improved earliest deadline first algorithm through the replacement and recombination of tasks. From the experimental results, it can be concluded that the algorithm can schedule more tasks and benefit the urgent tasks effectively with the increase of the task amounts.

This procedure can be carried out quickly and routinely to maximize vehicle effectiveness. A hydrodynamic model of the vehicle was first developed from theory and bench-top laboratory tests. Using this initial model, a controller was developed from basic principles. Then, using this initial controller to reach a desired typical operating condition, a very compact set of open-loop maneuvers was performed in the field. The vehicle model was optimized using the Nelder-Mead simplex method, and a revised controller was then implemented and tested successfully.

ID TRAJECTORY TRACKING
AB The path-following problem for four-wheel independent driving and four-wheel independent steering electric autonomous vehicles is investigated in this paper. Owing to the over-actuated characters of four-wheel independent driving and four-wheel independent steering autonomous vehicles, a novel yaw rate tracking-based path-following controller is proposed. First, according to the kinematic relationships between vehicle and the reference path, the yaw rate generator is designed by linear matrix inequality theory, with the ability to minimize the disturbances caused by vehicle side slip and varying curvature of path. Considering that the path-following objective and dynamics stability are in conflict with each other in some extreme path-following conditions, a coordinating mechanism based on yaw rate prediction is proposed to satisfy the two conflicting objectives. Then, according to the desired yaw rate and longitudinal velocity, a hierarchical structure is introduced for motion control. The upper-level controller calculates the generalized tracking forces while the allocation layer optimally distributes the generalized forces to tires considering tire vertical load and adhesive utilization. Finally, simulation results indicate that the proposed method can achieve excellent path-following performances in different driving conditions, while both path-following objective and dynamics stability can be satisfied.

AB In recent times, the autonomous systems have gained considerable interest due to their improved performance and lesser requirements for manual support. The autonomous systems have been extensively implemented in various domains such as logistics, industries, health care, finance, and so on. Intelligence control is the incorporation of autonomous and Artificial Intelligence (AI) systems that assist in critical decision-making steps. Autonomous driving is a new field in intel-ligent transportation systems that requires automated classification, detection, and the ranging of on-road difficulties. Therefore, the current study develops an Improved Metaheuristics technique with Deep Learning-based Object Detectors for Intelligent Control in Autonomous Vehicles (IMDLOD-ICAV). The presented technique mainly detects the objects to assist, in driving the autonomous vehicles. In the current research work, the RetinaNet model is applied as an object detector whereas the hyperparameter tuning process is executed with the help of the Nadam optimizer. Besides, the Elman Neural Network (ENN) model is also exploited to recognize the objects with a high accuracy. The parameter tuning process is performed with the help of the Improved Dragonfly Algorithm (IDFA). The authors conducted a comprehensive set of experi-ments to establish the superior performance of the proposed IMDLOD-ICAV technique. The outcomes confirmed the enhanced performance of the IMDLOD-ICAV technique with a maximum accuracy of 99.38%.

AB In the model (m:n), to improve the autonomous collaborative interception capability for air vehicle, a new autonomous cross-collaborative interception algorithm based on GTSMC (Global Terminal Sliding Mode Control) and real-time virtual geometry is proposed in this paper. Firstly, the conception of an autonomous cross-collaboration is defined and the multi-air vehicle for the multi- object interception problem is formulated. Then, this paper presents the dynamic situation assessment function, which considers the real-time flight status and cooperative status of the air vehicle during the interception of the object. At the same time, this paper states the condition of whether the air vehicle is in a cooperative state and proves it. After completing the dynamic situation assessment, and considering the dynamic of the air vehicles, a new controller is designed by using GTSMC and the idea of backstepping method. Simultaneously, this paper gives a stability analysis of the closed-loop system by using Lyapunov theory. Finally, to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm, several simulation cases which consider different interception scenarios are given. The simulation results show that the new collaborative interception algorithm can provide better autonomous cross-collaborative interception capability and higher accuracy.

AB Autonomous berthing is the last step to achieving the autonomous operation of unmanned surface vehicles (USVs). Due to the significant disturbance of wind, waves, and currents and the uncertainties of the model, it is difficult to realize autonomous berthing. For the case of obstacles and dynamics of USVs, it is transformed into three steps including path planning, path tracking, and motion control of USVs in the paper. A new advanced Dubins-RRT algorithm is proposed for path planning, which improves the capacity of obstacle avoidance and path smoothness level. A virtual target guidance method is used to guide and track the planned path. In addition, a finite-time disturbance observer and a non-singular terminal sliding mode controller are designed to control the autonomous USVs. Observing and estimating the uncertainty terms in the model can ensure the convergence of the tracking error in a finite time. Finally, the feasibility of the designed method is verified through simulation and experimentation.

AB This paper presents a distributed constant bearing guidance and model-free disturbance rejection control method for formation tracking of autonomous surface vehicles subject to fully unknown kinetic model. First, a distributed constant bearing guidance law is designed at the kinematic level to achieve a consensus task. Then, by using an adaptive extended state observer (AESO) to estimate the total uncertainties and unknown input coefficients, a simplified model-free kinetic controller is designed based on a dynamic surface control (DSC) design. It is proven that the closed-loop system is input-to-state stable The stability of the closed-loop system is established. A salient feature of the proposed method is that a cooperative behavior can be achieved without knowing any priori information. An application to formation control of autonomous surface vehicles is given to show the efficacy of the proposed integrated distributed constant bearing guidance and model-free disturbance rejection control.

AB Wetlands, the geographic areas where water meets the earth, are ecosystems essential for life and an increasing number of conventions, directives and research projects recognise the necessity of protecting them. Nevertheless the number, quality and spacial resolution of surveys is modest due to the absence of expressly addressed tools. In this paper the design, construction and testing of the first prototype of an innovative class of Autonomous Surface Vehicles (ASVs) for the extremely shallow water and remote areas of wetlands is presented. SWAMP (Shallow Water Autonomous Multipurpose Platform) is a full y electric, modular, portable, lightweight, and highly-controllable ASV. It is a catamaran, equipped with four thrusters azimuth Pump-Jet thrusters that are flush with the hull and specifically designed for this vehicle. SWAMP is also characterised by small draft soft-foam, unsinkable hull structure with high modularity and a flexible hardware/software architecture. Each hull can be considered as a single vehicle, being equipped with a full navigation, guidance and control package, as well as propulsion, power and communication systems. The extreme modularity is also guaranteed thanks to the adoption of on-board Wi-Fi communication architecture: the two mono-hull vehicles are connected via Wi-Fi as well as all the modules aboard each of them.

AB In order to decide a safe and reliable trajectory for autonomous driving vehicles, the threat of surrounding vehicles need to be assessed quantitatively and consider the potential risk. This paper proposes a novel integrated threat assessment algorithm for the decision-making system. First, the motion of the surrounding vehicle is predicted probabilistic based on the interact multiple model (IMM) to consider the potential threat. Then, we build an integrated threat assessment function to assess the threat in each state quantitatively and objectively, which synthesizes the existing time-to-collision (TTC), time-headway (TH), and the original proposed time-to-front (TTF). Based on this, the decision-making system is established according to the Markov decision process (MDP) and the feedback value of each decision sequence is calculated by the integrated threat assessment function, thus the safest trajectory for the current moment can be determined by optimal search. Finally, the decision-making system is verified in the overtaking and cut-in scenario by Carsim and Simulink co-simulation. The results show that the proposed threat assessment algorithm for the decision-making system can help autonomous vehicles decide a safe trajectory in real-time and maintain good maneuverability.

AB In recent years, various functions such as advanced driver assistance systems (ADAS) and infotainment systems are being mounted in vehicles for safety and convenience to drivers. Among the various functions, autonomous driving-related technologies are being added to all vehicles, from low options to high options. For autonomous driving, hundreds of new electronic control units (ECUs) including various advanced sensors would be needed. Adding more ECUs would enhance safety and convenience for the driver. On the other hand, wiring between these ECUs would be more complex and heavier. The wiring harness is essential for communication and power supply. Currently, the in-vehicle network (IVN) uses the domain-based IVN architecture (DIA) that separates ECUs into domains based on their functions. Recently, in order to minimize the complexity of wiring harness and IVN, zone-based IVN architecture (ZIA) that groups ECUs according to their physical locations is attracting attention. In this paper, we propose a new DIA and ZIA for autonomous driving in the context of time-sensitive networking (TSN). These two new IVN architectures are simulated using the OMNeT++ network simulator. In the simulation process, a mid-size vehicle is assumed. It is shown in this paper that ZIA not only reduces wiring harnesses in both lengths and weights by approximately 24.6% compared to the DIAs, but also reduces data transmission delay.

AB We study the shared autonomous vehicle (SAV) routing problem while considering congestion. SAVs essentially provide a dial-a-ride service to travelers, but the large number of vehicles involved (tens of thousands of SAVs to replace personal vehicles) results in SAV routing causing significant congestion. We combine the dial-a-ride service constraints with the linear program for system optimal dynamic traffic assignment, resulting in a congestion-aware formulation of the SAV routing problem. Traffic flow is modeled through the link transmission model, an approximate solution to the kinematic wave theory of traffic flow. SAVs interact with travelers at origins and destinations. Due to the large number of vehicles involved, we use a continuous approximation of flow to formulate a linear program. Optimal solutions demonstrate that peak hour demand is likely to have greater waiting and in-vehicle travel times than off-peak demand due to congestion. SAV travel times were only slightly greater than system optimal personal vehicle route choice. In addition, solutions can determine the optimal fleet size to minimize congestion or maximize service.

AB To address the challenges of coordinating path tracking, maneuverability, and stability control in real-time during actual driving of autonomous vehicles, this paper proposes an adaptive coordinated control strategy for four-wheel steering and four-wheel drive autonomous vehicles based on the model predictive control algorithm. First, an approach utilizing a recursive least square method with an adaptive forgetting factor is proposed to estimate and update the cornering stiffness of the prediction model in real-time, aiming to enhance the control accuracy of the controller. Second, the phase plane method is employed to divide the vehicle stability domain, incorporating indicators based on maneuverability and lateral stability to facilitate effective vehicle stability control. Next, the control priority is designed, and the weight of the objective function is adaptively adjusted to achieve the overall coordination between path tracking and handling stability control. Finally, co-simulation of Carsim and MATLAB/Simulink demonstrates that under high-speed and large curvature conditions, the proposed control strategy can further enhance the overall performance of the vehicle. On high-adhesion roads, compared to the general fixed weight strategies, the proposed control strategy has improved path tracking accuracy by 50.57% and 18.41%, respectively. Additionally, on low-adhesion roads, the proposed control strategy still maintains precise trajectory control, with path tracking accuracy improvements of 47.04% and 5.8%, while further enhancing the vehicle's maneuverability and stability.

AB To evaluate the effects of anticipative driving behavior based on the motion information of two leading vehicles, we first propose a new car-following model which integrates space and velocity changes of two leading vehicles implemented through V2X wireless communication in autonomous and connected vehicles environment. We then derive a corresponding macroscopic viscous continuum traffic flow model, more realistic and meaningful than those coming directly from an analogy of Navier-Stokes equations as the new macroscopic model does not exhibit a wrong-way travel phenomenon. It is revealed that taking into account motion information of two leading vehicles leads to a viscosity parameter in macroscopic traffic flow equation. The viscosity parameter is proportional to a unique quantity, which is featured with two parameters: the delay time of vehicle motion and the kinematic wave velocity at jam density. Linear and nonlinear stability analysis using the method of perturbation is carried out to study traffic characteristics. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI A Robust Fuzzy Autonomous Underwater Vehicle (AUV) Docking Approach for
   Unknown Current Disturbances

   estimation; docking; fuzzy; Kalman filtering
AB In this paper, a robust autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) docking approach that can handle unknown water currents is presented. Several assumptions and design considerations are made in our work. First, there is no onboard velocity sensor, and thus water currents will need to be estimated and compensated online. Second, the vehicle uses its ultrashort baseline (USBL) system to home itself toward an acoustic source situated at a rigidly bottom-mounted underwater docking station. Third, the dock is oriented at a preknown heading, and its absolute position is a priori known. Our docking approach incorporates a Tagaki-Sugeno-Kang (TSK) fuzzy inference system (FIS) that assists the vehicle with high level guidance maneuvers in the form of fuzzified commanded heading and speed vector fields. A current compensator is designed and applied to the fuzzy docking guidance to allow the vehicle to maintain its course in the presence of current disturbance. An extended Kalman Filter (EKF) is formulated to estimate the current and vehicle states. Extensive Monte Carlo simulations were performed to evaluate the current estimator and vehicle docking performance under various docking conditions. The simulation results demonstrated the inherent robustness of this designed fuzzy docking approach against unknown current disturbances, without any real-time velocity measurements.

AB Shared autonomous electric vehicle systems will be a promising alternative for sustainable urban mobility. This study investigates an integrated optimization problem for shared autonomous electric vehicle systems that determines the long-termcharging facility deployment at the planning level (e.g., the sizing and configurations of charging facilities), while the vehicle assignment, relocation, and charging decisions in the short term are also optimized at the operational level. A two-stage stochastic integer program is formulated to capture the demand uncertainty, in which an event-activity space-time-battery network is proposed for tracking the charging choices and battery states of vehicles and determining the optimal operational decisions. For dealing with a large number of scenarios in the stochastic program, the sample average approximation scheme is applied as the sampling strategy. An accelerated two-phase Benders decomposition-based algorithm is proposed for solving the two-stage program. The modeling and algorithm approach is tested on a large-scale case in Shanghai City in China. Extensive experiments show that the proposed approach can always find high-quality solutions in an efficient way. Numerical results indicate that deployment of both normal- and fast-charging infrastructure can increase the systemprofit and improve its operational performance.

AB Autonomous vehicles (AVs) will revolutionarize ground transport and take a substantial role in the future transportation system. Most AVs are likely to be electric vehicles (EVs) and they can participate in the vehicle-to-grid (V2G) system to support various V2G services. Although it is generally infeasible for EVs to dictate their routes, we can design AV travel plans to fulfill certain system-wide objectives. In this paper, we focus on the AVs looking for parking and study how they can be led to appropriate parking facilities to support V2G services. We formulate the coordinated parking problem (CPP), which can be solved by a standard integer linear program solver but requires long computational time. To make it more practical, we develop a distributed algorithm to address CPP based on dual decomposition. We carry out a series of simulations to evaluate the proposed solution methods. Our results show that the distributed algorithm can produce nearly optimal solutions with substantially less computational time. A coarser time scale can improve computational time but degrade the solution quality resulting in possible infeasible solution. Even with communication loss, the distributed algorithm can still perform well and converge with only little degradation in speed.

AB Micro-sized autonomous underwater vehicles (mu AUVs) are well suited to various applications in confined underwater spaces. Acoustic communication is required for many application scenarios of mu AUVs to enable data transmission without surfacing. This paper presents the integration of a compact acoustic communication device with a mu AUV prototype. Packet reception rate (PRR) and bit error rate (BER) of the acoustic communication link are evaluated in a confined pool environment through experiments while the mu AUV is either stationary or moving. We pinpoint several major factors that impact the communication performance. Experimental results show that the multi-path effect significantly affects the synchronization signals of the communication device. The relative motion between the vehicle and the base station also degrades the communication performance. These results suggest future methods towards improvements.

AB In this paper, a new controller for the path-following problem of a car-like autonomous vehicle is proposed. This controller is based on a new transformation that, for the case of roll with no slip, transfers the model to a chain form. However, in many practical cases, due to the strong effects of tire slip angles, a roll with no slip assumption is invalid. To cope with the presence of slip, a novel controller is proposed. The new method is based on a vehicle kinematical model, where the tire slip angles are taken into account. The control design method utilizes a peak-to-peak criterion and linear matrix inequality (LMI) tools to attenuate tire slip angle effects on the closed-loop performance.

AB It is a striking fact that the characteristics of parametric uncertainties, external disturbance, time-varying and nonlinearities are available in the constructed model of autonomous independent-drive vehicles; therefore, in this paper, the robust model predictive control (MPC) with the finite time horizon is proposed to realize the coordinated path tracking and direct yaw moment control (DYC) for autonomous four in-wheel motor independent-drive electric vehicles (AMIDEV). Firstly, considering the time-varying and uncertain feature of the tire cornering stiffness and the vehicle velocity in the state space equation constructed by 2 degrees of freedom (DoF) vehicle model and the path tracking preview model, the linear parameter varying (LPV) discrete model with four polytypic vertexes is constructed. Then, based on the linear matrix inequality (LMI) method, the novel robust MPC theory with the finite time horizon is put forward to solve the min-max optimization problem after updating four polytypic vertexes in real time, which could deal with the inevitable model mismatch problem caused by the time-varying, uncertain vehicle dynamic characteristics and external disturbance. Finally, the simulation and experimental results have verified that the proposed novel robust MPC theory could emerge from the stranglehold exercised by the conservativeness of the traditional robust MPC theory with the infinite time horizon, which strengthens the robustness of this control system as well as achieves better path tracking accuracy and handling ability of AMIDEV.

TI Flight testing of the T-wing tail-sitter unmanned air vehicle
SO JOURNAL OF AIRCRAFT
LA English
DT Article
AB Since October 2005, the T-wing tail-sitter unmanned air vehicle has undergone an extensive program of flight tests, resulting in a total of more than 50 flights, many under autonomous control from takeoff to landing. Starting in August 2006, free flights with conversion between vertical and horizontal flight modes have also been undertaken. Although the latter flights have required some guidance-level ground-pilot input, significant portions of them were performed in autonomous mode, including the transitions between horizontal and vertical flight. This paper considers the overall control architecture of the vehicle, including the different control modes that the vehicle was flown under during the recent series of tests. Although the individual controllers for each flight mode are unremarkable in themselves, it is notable that the aggregate system allows the vehicle to fly throughout its entire flight envelope, which is considerably broader than that of conventional fixed- or rotary-wing vehicles. The performance of the controllers for the different flight modes will also be considered, with a particular focus on hover dispersion results, in differing wind conditions. The majority of these flights were performed on a tether test rig during autonomous control development, to ensure vehicle safety with minimal impact on vehicle dynamics. The demonstration of autonomous flight under the constraints imposed by the tether system in winds up to 18 kt is a significant achievement. Results from the more recent horizontal flight tests with conversions between vertical and horizontal flight are also presented. Most important, these results confirm the basic feasibility of tail-sitter vehicles that use control surfaces submerged in propeller wash for vertical flight control.

AB The adoption of autonomous demand-responsive transit (ADRT) to support regular public transport has the potential to enhance sustainable mobility. There is a dearth of research on the socio-demographic characteristics associated with perceived opportunities and challenges regarding ADRT adoption in Australia. In this research, we fill this knowledge gap by determining socio-demographic predictors of perceptions and attitudes towards ADRT, specifically autonomous shuttle buses (ASBs), among adult residents of South East Queensland. This study incorporates a review of prior global studies, a stated preference survey distributed across the case study region, and descriptive and logistic regression analysis. We found that the main perceived opportunity of ASBs is reduced congestion/emissions, while the primary anticipated challenge relates to unreliable technology. Fully employed respondents are likely to be more familiar with autonomous vehicles. Females and those from lower-income households are less likely to have ridden in an autonomous vehicle. Males, those who are younger, have high employment, hail from higher-income households, and with no driver's licence are all more favourable towards ASBs. Males, those with high employment, and without driver's licence are likely to be more concerned about traffic accidents when using ASBs. Less-educated respondents and those living in peri-urban areas are likely to be more concerned about fares. Insights are drawn from the current study to inform policymakers to consider key challenges (e.g., trust issues) and target groups (particularly females) in planning public communication strategies to enhance receptiveness to ADRT.

AB Vehicle coordination at road intersections to prevent collisions has recently drawn a lot of research attention, but still remains challenging due to a large volume of traffic composed of autonomous and human-driven vehicles. In this paper, we present the design and validation of a supervisory algorithm for collision avoidance at road intersections, in the simultaneous presence of measurement errors, unmodeled dynamics, and vehicles that are not equipped with autonomous driving features. We design a supervisor that takes control of vehicles that are capable of communication and autonomous actions, only when necessary to avoid a collision, or otherwise leaves control to their drivers. This supervisor is least restrictive, that is, it takes control away from drivers only when necessary to avoid future collisions. Since the complexity of the supervisor algorithm is combinatorial with the number of vehicles, we also design an approximate supervisor that can handle more realistic scenarios with a larger number of vehicles in polynomially bounded time at the expense of an additional, yet quantified, restrictiveness. The least restrictive supervisor is validated through experimental testings using three small-scale vehicles, and the approximate supervisor is validated through computer simulations.

AB Developing aerial robots that can both safely navigate and execute assigned mission without any human intervention - i.e., fully autonomous aerial mobility of passengers and goods - is the larger vision that guides the research, design, and development efforts in the aerial autonomy space. However, it is highly challenging to concurrently operationalize all types of aerial vehicles that are operating fully autonomously sharing the airspace. Full autonomy of the aerial transportation sector includes several aspects, such as design of the technology that powers the vehicles, operations of multi-agent fleets, and process of certification that meets stringent safety requirements of aviation sector. Thereby, Autonomous Advanced Aerial Mobility is still a vague term and its consequences for researchers and professionals are ambiguous. To address this gap, we present a comprehensive perspective on the emerging field of autonomous advanced aerial mobility, which involves the use of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) and electric vertical takeoff and landing (eVTOL) aircraft for various applications, such as urban air mobility, package delivery, and surveillance. The article proposes a scalable and extensible autonomy framework consisting of four main blocks: sensing, perception, planning, and controls. Furthermore, the article discusses the challenges and opportunities in multi-agent fleet operations and management, as well as the testing, validation, and certification aspects of autonomous aerial systems. Finally, the article explores the potential of monolithic models for aerial autonomy and analyzes their advantages and limitations. The perspective aims to provide a holistic picture of the autonomous advanced aerial mobility field and its future directions.

AB Energy awareness and fault tolerance are important aspects for extending the autonomy levels of today's autonomous vehicles. With the aim of preparing the way for persistent autonomous operations of underwater vehicles this work focusses its efforts on investigating the effects of actuator failures, on an autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) capable of long-term inspection missions. This paper introduces an energy-aware architecture that by observing the use of the on-board resources is capable of detecting faults and monitors the performance of the thruster subsystem in modern AUVs. The effect is an increased autonomy level in presence of unexpected events like performance degradations or sudden failures. Moreover an important contribution of this work is to process the great volume of information, collected at the lower sensor levels, into operational parameters that can be treated by higher level modules. These parameters form part of an abstract representation of concepts and capabilities that are available at a given time during the mission's execution. Once this representation has been updated it is made available to the planning and execution components that can adapt the mission's behaviour using the most recent knowledge about the vehicle's state. To validate the proposed approach we evaluate our system on a real platform, Nessie VIII AUV, in both in real sea conditions and in a controlled test tank.

AB High-performance path tracking is a key technology for autonomous vehicles. Feedforward-feedback control architectures are suitable for accurate path tracking with adequate margins of stability. For system modelling in the feedforward component, the learning-based method has been proven to be a promising approach owing to its model-free framework. However, the offline-learned data model trained with collection data is confined by its feature space, resulting in insufficient generalization. As a solution, in this study, we introduce an online learning network - the recurrent high-order neural network (RHONN) - to characterize vehicle behaviors. The RHONN is used to feature vehicle behaviors in a timely manner with a high fidelity and flexible form. The equilibrium at the preview point on the desired path is found based on the online-identified RHONN model, and its induced steering angle is taken as the feedforward command. For the feedback steering controller, the preview point position-based control law incorporating the steady vehicle sideslip angle is adopted to enhance the stability performance. Finally, in the CarSim/Simulink environment, the performance of the designed RHONN-informed feedforward and feedback controller is validated in two typical scenarios - double-lane change and single-turn. The validation results reveal that the proposed approach offers better tracking accuracy in linear and nonlinear regions than other techniques. More notably, the average execution time (3.55 ms) is less than the sampling frequency of the controller (50 ms), which further confirms the applicability and efficiency of the proposed approach.

AB Autonomous vehicles (AV) are expected to improve, reshape, and revolutionize the future of ground transportation. It is anticipated that ordinary vehicles will one day be replaced with smart vehicles that are able to make decisions and perform driving tasks on their own. In order to achieve this objective, self-driving vehicles are equipped with sensors that are used to sense and perceive both their surroundings and the faraway environment, using further advances in communication technologies, such as 5G. In the meantime, local perception, as with human beings, will continue to be an effective means for controlling the vehicle at short range. In the other hand, extended perception allows for anticipation of distant events and produces smarter behavior to guide the vehicle to its destination while respecting a set of criteria (safety, energy management, traffic optimization, comfort). In spite of the remarkable advancements of sensor technologies in terms of their effectiveness and applicability for AV systems in recent years, sensors can still fail because of noise, ambient conditions, or manufacturing defects, among other factors; hence, it is not advisable to rely on a single sensor for any of the autonomous driving tasks. The practical solution is to incorporate multiple competitive and complementary sensors that work synergistically to overcome their individual shortcomings. This article provides a comprehensive review of the state-of-the-art methods utilized to improve the performance of AV systems in short-range or local vehicle environments. Specifically, it focuses on recent studies that use deep learning sensor fusion algorithms for perception, localization, and mapping. The article concludes by highlighting some of the current trends and possible future research directions.

AB Commercialization of autonomous vehicle technology is a major goal of the automotive industry, thus research in this space is rapidly expanding across the world. However, despite this high level of research activity, literature detailing a straightforward and cost-effective approach to the development of an AV research platform is sparse. To address this need, we present the methodology and results regarding the AV instrumentation and controls of a 2019 Kia Niro which was developed for a local AV pilot program. This platform includes a drive-by-wire actuation kit, Aptiv electronically scanning radar, stereo camera, MobilEye computer vision system, LiDAR, inertial measurement unit, two global positioning system receivers to provide heading information, and an in-vehicle computer for driving environment perception and path planning. Robotic Operating System software is used as the system middleware between the instruments and the autonomous application algorithms. After selection, installation, and integration of these components, our results show successful utilization of all sensors, drive-by-wire functionality, a total additional power* consumption of 242.8 Watts (*Typical), and an overall cost of $118,189 USD, which is a significant saving compared to other commercially available systems with similar functionality. This vehicle continues to serve as our primary AV research and development platform.

AB The connected and autonomous vehicles (CAV) applications and services-based traffic make an extra burden on the already congested cellular networks. Offloading is envisioned as a promising solution to tackle cellular networks' traffic explosion problem. Notably, vehicular traffic offloading leveraging different vehicular communication network (VCN) modes is one of the potential techniques to address the data traffic problem in cellular networks. This paper surveys the state-of-the-art literature for vehicular data offloading under a communication perspective, i.e., vehicle to vehicle (V2V), vehicle to roadside infrastructure (V2I), and vehicle to everything (V2X). First, we pinpoint the significant classification of vehicular data/traffic offloading techniques, considering whether data is to download or upload. Next, for better intuition of each data offloading's category, we sub-classify the existing schemes based on their objectives. Then, the existing literature on vehicular data/traffic is elaborated, compared, and analyzed based on approaches, objectives, merits, demerits, etc. Finally, we highlight the open research challenges in this field and predict future research trends.

ID RESPONSES
AB In order to safely use autonomous vehicle technologies, it is important to understand the state of drivers' attention as they ride in Level 3 self-driving vehicles, because they might be required to take manual control of the vehicle in certain situations. We assumed that the attentional state of a driver who has perfect confidence in a self-driving system, and as a result, who is unready to take control of the vehicle is similar to that of a passenger riding in a vehicle driven by another person. Therefore, we compared electrophysiological signals from drivers and passengers that were riding a vehicle in real road environments. Results indicated the following differences: (1) The number of small saccadic eye-movements was greater in drivers than in passengers, whereas the number of large saccadic eye-movements was greater in passengers than in drivers, indicating that passengers tended to look at information irrelevant to safe driving. (2) The amplitude of the P1 component of eye-fixation-related brain potentials time-locked to the offset of large saccadic eye-movements was greater in drivers than in passengers, indicating that visual information processing load was lower in passengers. (3) The duration of eye-blinks was longer in passengers than in drivers, indicating that the arousal level of passengers was relatively low. These findings suggest that these electrophysiological indices can be useful measures for evaluating the attention of drivers while riding in Level 3 autonomous vehicles. Possible differences in the attentional state between drivers and passengers are discussed. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Electric, autonomous vehicles promise to address technical consumption inefficiencies associated with gasoline use and reduce emissions. Potential realization of this prospect has prompted considerable interest and investment in the technology. Using publicly available data from a select market, we examine the magnitude of the envisioned benefits and the determinants of the financial payoff of investing in a tripartite innovation in motor vehicle transportation: vehicle electrification, vehicle automation, and vehicle sharing. In contrast to previous work, we document that (a) the technology's envisioned cost effectiveness may be impeded by previously unconsidered parameters, (b) the inability to achieve cost parity with the status quo does not necessarily preclude net increases in energy consumption and emissions, (c) these increases are driven primarily by induced demand and mode switches away from pooled personal vehicles, and (d) the aforementioned externalities may be mitigated by leveraging a specific set of technological, behavioral and logistical pathways. We quantify-for the first time-the thresholds required for each of these pathways to be effective and demonstrate that pathway stringency is largely influenced by heterogeneity in trip timing behavior. We conclude that enacting these pathways is crucial to fostering environmental stewardship absent impediments in economic mobility.

AB This paper deals with the reconfiguration of an intelligent autonomous vehicle that utilizes an automatic navigation method and online supervision system and thus can be used to improve the safety, traffic management and space optimization inside the confined space of a port. The bond graph model of the vehicle's dynamic system is developed in a modular and hierarchical modelling environment. An over-actuated intelligent autonomous vehicle with redundant actuators has four independent driven wheels, four independent braking wheels and a four-wheel steering system. This vehicle can be safely operated with appropriate control law restructuring even when some of its actuators are unusable due to a fault. For actuator fault detection, analytical redundancy relations, which are constraint relations that describe nominal system behaviour and are written in terms of the measured system variables, are derived from the bond graph model. Analytical redundancy relations are continuously evaluated to generate residual signals and the symptoms in these signals are monitored for actuator fault detection and isolation. Once one or more actuator faults are isolated, the system is reconfigured via the selection of an appropriate operating mode to prevent critical or accidental situations. This procedure is validated by considering a fault scenario with two reconfiguration options.

The authors propose a triple-step control scheme to realise the objective of the path following irrespective of the uncertain kinematics and dynamics. The proposed control strategy has the desirable modularisation property that yields an explicit expression without the expense of complicated control structure. The performance of the proposed controller is shown by benchmark simulations.

AB Connected Autonomous Vehicles (CAVs) are transformational technologies that have demonstrated significant potential for shaping the future of transportation systems. CAV research has been conducted extensively, both in academic and industrial pursuits. The intention was to put CAVs on the road, but the safety and efficiency of CAVs must be prioritized for this purpose to come to fruition. This technology is built upon sensors, and network communications have the potential to improve automotive infrastructure, reduce traffic and accidents, and facilitate a unified transportation system. Although the auspiciousness of these vehicles is clear, persistent threats exist in terms of cybersecurity attacks, which jeopardize the safety and effectiveness of CAVs. Our study provides a comprehensive dissection of cyberattacks and digital forensics on CAVs. We begin by discussing each element of a standard CAV network and then illustrate the current security. The three main components of CAVs- sensors, communication networks, and actuators -were analyzed in detail. The expansion of cybersecurity and forensic issues is presented with additional investigations into traditional and artificial intelligence-based cyber-defense techniques. Our work concludes by discussing the open challenges and potential research areas for developing robust cybersecurity and forensic solutions exclusively for CAVs.

AB Nowadays, with the increasing popularity of quadcopter unmanned aerial vehicles in several real-world applications, achieving a fully autonomous quadcopter flight has become an imperative topic investigated in many studies. One of the most pressing issues in such a topic is the precision landing task, which always is devastatingly influenced by the ground effect and external disturbances. In this paper, we present an autonomous quadcopter landing algorithm allowing the vehicle to land robustly and precisely onto a heaving platform. Firstly, a robust control algorithm addressing the altitude flight under the ground effect and external disturbances is derived. We strictly prove the closed-loop system stability by using the Lyapunov theory. Secondly, a landing target state estimator is proposed to provide state estimations of the moving landing target. In addition, we propose a landing procedure to ensure the landing task is achieved safely and reliably. Finally, we use a DJI-F450 drone equipped with an infrared sensor and a laser ranging sensor as the experimental quadcopter platform and conduct experiments to evaluate the performance of our new algorithm in real flight conditions. The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.

AB Collaborative driving can significantly reduce the computation offloading from autonomous vehicles (AVs) to edge computing devices (ECDs) and the computation cost of each AV. However, the frequent information exchanges between AVs for determining the members in each collaborative group will consume a lot of time and resources. In addition, since AVs have different computing capabilities and costs, the collaboration types of the AVs in each group and the distribution of the AVs in different collaborative groups directly affect the performance of the cooperative driving. Therefore, how to develop an efficient collaborative autonomous driving scheme to minimize the cost for completing the driving process becomes a new challenge. To this end, we regard collaboration as a service and propose a digital twins (DT)-based scheme to facilitate the collaborative and distributed autonomous driving. Specifically, we first design the DT for each AV and develop a DT-enabled architecture to help AVs make the collaborative driving decisions in the virtual networks. With this architecture, an auction game-based collaborative driving mechanism (AG-CDM) is then designed to decide the head DT and the tail DT of each group. After that, by considering the computation cost and the transmission cost of each group, a coalition game-based distributed driving mechanism (CG-DDM) is developed to decide the optimal group distribution for minimizing the driving cost of each DT. Simulation results show that the proposed scheme can converge to a Nash stable collaborative and distributed structure and can minimize the autonomous driving cost of each AV.

AB Vehicle Edge Computing (VEC)-assisted computational offloading brings cloud computing closer to user equipment (UEs) at the edge of the access network by delivering various services to the UEs with limited processing power and battery. However, in fifth-generation and beyond 5G (B5G) networks, where UEs' service requests and locations change dynamically, the deployment of static edge server deployments may lead to an increase in latency and total energy consumption. This paper presents a latency-energy-aware, efficient task offloading scheme for connected autonomous vehicular networks. Firstly, vehicles are assembled into clusters, in which vehicle can transmit tasks to the other vehicle, while on the other hand, the VEC server is used for processing the data. We developed a joint resource allocation and offloading decision optimization problem to minimize network latency and total energy usage. Due to the non-convex character of the optimization issue, we employed the Markov decision process (MDP) to convert it to a reinforcement learning (RL) problem. Then, we used a soft-actor critic-based scheme to achieve the optimal policy for resource allocation and task offloading to reduce the total latency and energy consumption for connected autonomous vehicles. Simulation analysis reveals that the proposed scheme attains 46.6% and 17.2% lesser delay, and 28.8% and 20.0% consumes less energy than the Hybrid DRL with Genetic Algorithm (HDRL-GA) and DRL based collaborative Data Scheduling (DRL-CDSS) state-of-art schemes.

AB Autonomous carrier landing is regarded as a crucial problem among the flight stages of carrier-based unmanned aerial vehicle. In recent years, vision-based guidance has become a promising solution for unmanned aerial vehicle autonomous carrier landing. In this paper a new vision-based navigation scheme is proposed for unmanned aerial vehicle autonomous carrier landing. The scheme aims at dealing with two core problems: searching the carrier by using the images obtained from the airborne forward-looking camera and estimating the relative position and attitude between the unmanned aerial vehicle and the carrier. In order to solve the first problem, the spectral residual-based saliency analysis method is firstly adopted to obtain the Region of Interest. Then the locality-constraint linear coding-based feature learning method is proposed for feature extraction, and the region of interest containing the carrier is finally recognized by the linear support vector machine. In order to solve the second problem, five feature points are firstly selected on the surface of the carrier. Then, a new carrier-fixed moving reference coordinate system is set up. The six landing parameters including three attitude parameters and three position parameters are finally obtained by using orthogonal iteration. The experiment results verify the superiority and effectiveness of the algorithms proposed in this paper.

ID PREVENTION
AB The expansion of roads and the development of new road infrastructures have increased in recent years, linked to the population growing in large cities. In the last two decades, roundabouts have largely replaced traditional intersections in many countries. They have the advantage of allowing drivers continuous flow when traffic is clear, without the usual delay caused by traffic lights. Although roundabouts with and without traffic-signal control have been widely used and considered in the literature, driverless control on roundabouts has not been studied in depth yet. The behavior of autonomous vehicles in roundabouts can be divided into three stages: entrance, inside, and exit. The first and last may be handled as an extension of intersections. However, autonomous driving on the roundabout requires special attention. In this paper, the design and implementation of a fuzzy logic system for the steering control of autonomous vehicles inside the roundabout is proposed. Cascade architecture for lateral control and parametric trajectory generation are used. Fuzzy control has proved to be easy to define using expert knowledge. Experiments with a real prototype have been carried out, taking into account different speed profiles and lane change maneuvers inside the roundabout, with very satisfactory results.

AB The fast emergence of autonomous vehicles promises a drastic change on how road traffic congestion is detected, controlled, and mitigated. To this end, we believe that it is beneficial to explore different ways of collaboration between autonomous vehicles, with the aid of modern road infrastructure, to optimize the commuters' travel time. We, therefore, propose in this paper a novel solution based on a multi-parties collaboration framework and built upon the WAVE standard to optimize the usage of the road network and lower commuters' travel time. Our solution, which is based on a Belief-Desire-Intention architecture, enables autonomous vehicles to opt for selfish or collaborative behaviors depending on their goals and current situations. The results obtained from our preliminary prototype under three representative road maps demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in dealing with traffic congestion.

AB Excessive training time is a major issue face when training autonomous vehicle agents with neural networks by using images as input. This paper proposes a deep time-economical Q network (DQN) input image preprocessing method to train an autonomous vehicle agent in a virtual environment. The environmental information is extracted from the virtual environment. A top-view image of the entire environment is then redrawn according to the environmental information. During training of the DQN model, the top-view image is cropped to place the vehicle agent at the center of the cropped image. The current frame top-view image is combined with the images from the previous two training iterations. The DQN model use this combined image as input. The experimental results indicate higher performance and shorter training time for the DQN model trained with the preprocessed images compared with that trained without preprocessing.

AB The advancement of autonomous technology in Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) has piloted a new era in aviation. While UAVs were initially utilized only for the military, rescue, and disaster response, they are now being utilized for domestic and civilian purposes as well. In order to deal with its expanded applications and to increase autonomy, the ability for UAVs to perform autonomous landing will be a crucial component. Autonomous landing capability is greatly dependent on computer vision, which offers several advantages such as low cost, self-sufficiency, strong anti-interference capability, and accurate localization when combined with an Inertial Navigation System (INS). Another significant benefit of this technology is its compatibility with LiDAR technology, Digital Elevation Models (DEM), and the ability to seamlessly integrate these components. The landing area for UAVs can vary, ranging from static to dynamic or complex, depending on their environment. By comprehending these characteristics and the behavior of UAVs, this paper serves as a valuable reference for autonomous landing guided by computer vision and provides promising preliminary results with static image photogrammetry.

AB The vibratory roller is a piece of vital construction machinery in the field of road construction. The unmanned vibratory roller efficiently utilizes the automated driving technology in the vehicle engineering field, which is innovative for the unmanned road construction. This paper develops and implements the autonomous construction system for the unmanned vibratory roller. Not only does the roller have the function of remote-controlled driving, but it also has the capability of autonomous road construction. The overall system design uses the Programmable Logic Controller (PLC) as the kernel controller. It establishes the communication network through multiple Input/Output (I/O) modules, Recommended Standard 232 (RS232) serial port, Controller Area Network (CAN) bus, and wireless networks to control the roller vehicle completely. The locating information is obtained through the Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) satellite navigation equipment group to support the process of autonomous construction. According to the experimental results, the autonomous construction system can finally enable the roller to perform driving operations and construction independently, which was a significant step forward in engineering application.

AB Reinforcement learning-based controllers for safety-critical applications, such as autonomous driving, are typically trained in simulation, where a vehicle model is provided during the learning process. However, an inaccurate parameterization of the vehicle model used for training heavily influences the performance of the reinforcement learning agent during execution. This inaccuracy is either caused by changes due to environmental influences or by falsely estimated vehicle parameters. In this work, we present our approach of combining dynamics randomization with reinforcement learning to overcome this issue for a path-following control task of an autonomous and over-actuated robotic vehicle. We train three independent agents, where each agent experiences randomization for a different vehicle dynamics parameter, i.e., the mass, the yaw inertia, and the road-tire friction. We randomize the parameters uniformly within predefined ranges to enable the agents to learn an equally robust control behavior for all possible parameter values. Finally, in a simulation study, we compare the performance of the agents trained with dynamics randomization to the performance of an agent trained with the nominal parameter values. Simulation results demonstrate that the former agents obtain a higher level of robustness against model uncertainties and varying environmental conditions than the latter agent trained with nominal vehicle parameter values.

AB This work presents in detail the fuzzy control design for yaw tracking of an autonomous underwater vehicle. This control has been developed from the mathematical description of the hydrodynamic model of the vehicle, which is studied and discussed from different situations both in surge velocity as in changes in yaw reference. The model is linearized and several linear controls are designed for their actuation at certain situations, in a way that the fuzzy control allows to handle those controls globally.

AB Underwater vehicles are being increasingly employed in exploring the world's oceans. The communications mechanism used by these autonomous underwater vehicles (AUV's) plays a vital roll mission planning. This paper presents a procedure for constructing optimal controllers that limit and route information flow in a network of AUVs. Particular attention is paid to the objectives of maximizing throughput and bandwidth efficiency while minimizing power consumption and queue length. A receding horizon control approach is adopted and shown to yield piecewise continuous optimal controllers that are unique.

AB The integration of shared mobility and autonomous vehicles (AVs) could potentially change the way parents decide to transport their children to and from school. A better understanding of the factors influencing parents' intentions to use shared autonomous vehicles (SAVs) for school transportation is necessary to enhance their children's mobility. Unlike prior research, this paper significantly contributes to the literature by exploring the impacts of socioeconomic, travel-related, and psychological factors and their interactions. Using Google Forms for an online survey, the authors collected 1435 valid responses from parents in Kerman city schools in Iran. The estimation results of the generalized ordered logit model indicate the significant impact of parents' socioeconomic status (occupation, education, income), travel behavior (accident experience, crash severity, travel cost), and attitude (innovativeness, perceived usefulness, environmental concern, pro-driving, safety), and their children-related factors (gender, the most frequently used travel mode, the possibility of tracking the child). The findings show that an increase in parents' education, perceived usefulness, and environmental concern increase the likelihood of their intentions to use SAVs. Finally, based on the findings, several implications are suggested to increase parents' intentions to use SAVs for transporting their children and to make SAVs a safe, affordable, and sustainable transport solution.

AB Extended Kalman Filtering (EKF) is proposed for: (i) the extraction of a fuzzy model from numerical data; and (ii) the localization of an autonomous vehicle. In the. rst case, the EKF algorithm is compared to the Gauss-Newton nonlinear least- squares method and is shown to be faster. An analysis of the EKF convergence is given. In the second case, the EKF algorithm estimates the state vector of the autonomous vehicle by fusing data coming from odometric sensors and sonars. Simulation tests show that the accuracy of the EKF- based vehicle localization is satisfactory.

AB Autonomous electric vehicles (EVs) are being widely studied nowadays as the future technology of ground transportation, while their conventional powertrain systems limit their energy efficiencies and may hinder their broad applications in the future. Here, we report a study on the energy consumption, efficiency improvement, and greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions of a mid-size autonomous EV (AEV) driven by in-wheel motors (IWMs), through the development of a numerical energy model, validated and implemented in a case study. The energy analysis was conducted under three driving conditions: flat road, upslope, and downslope driving, considering autonomous driving patterns, motor efficiency optimization, and regenerative braking. The case study based on the baseline EV driving data in West Los Angeles showed that an IWM-driven AEV can save up to 17.5% of energy during slope driving. In addition, it can reduce around 5.5% of GHG emissions annually in each state in the United States. Using the efficiency maps of a commercial IWM, the energy model and validated results in this study are in line with actual situations and can be used to support the future development of energy-efficient AEVs and sustainable energy transitions in ground transportation.

AB Phytoplankton (microscopic algae) play an important role in marine ecology. Resulting from a combination of physical, chemical, and biological processes, the distribution of phytoplankton is patchy, particularly in coastal marine ecosystems. Patches of high chlorophyll represent areas where enhanced primary productivity and biogeochemical cycling can occur. The scientific goal is to place observations within these biological hotspots to enable more extensive characterization of the environment and plankton populations. Aerial or satellite remote sensing can detect optical signal originating from phytoplankton within a limited depth range only near the ocean surface, and application of remote sensing is limited by atmospheric clarity. To observe the development of patchy phytoplankton communities in situ, we need the ability to locate and track individual patches. In this article, we present a method for an autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) to autonomously find and climb on a positive horizontal gradient of chlorophyll to locate and track a phytoplankton patch. In two experiments in 2021, a Tethys-class long-range AUV autonomously located and tracked phytoplankton patches in southern Monterey Bay, CA, USA. The experiments demonstrated effectiveness of the method and pointed to the need for increased onboard adaptiveness in autonomous patch finding and tracking.

DE autonomous oceanographic sampling networks; autonomous underwater

AB Autonomous oceanographic sampling networks (AOSNs) are groups of autonomous underwater vehicles and other instrument platforms. They were envisioned to address the serious undersampling problem that exists for the ocean. Advanced AOSNs will include numerous heterogeneous components and perform complex, long-duration missions. They will have to cope with vehicles failing, new vehicles arriving, and changes in the mission and environment. Controlling such a system is a very challenging task. The Cooperative Distributed AOSN control (CoDA) project focuses on developing intelligent control mechanisms for advanced AOSNs. CoDA treats AOSN components as agents that follow protocols to create an effective organization to carry out the mission. CoDA is a two-level approach. A meta-level organization (MLO) first self-organizes from a subset of the agents to discover the AOSNs' total capability repertoire, then designs a task-level organization (TLO) to efficiently carry out the mission. When changes occur, the MLO can step in to reorganize the AOSN to fit the changed situation. This two-level approach allows the AOSN to be both efficient and flexible in the face of change. In addition to describing CoDA, this paper also presents simulation results to show its behavior, both normally and when agents fail.

TI Collision Avoidance of Low Speed Autonomous Shuttles with Pedestrians

DE Pedestrian collision avoidance; Connected collision avoidance; Elastic
   band method
AB This paper is on a pedestrian collision avoidance system for low speed autonomous shuttles based on Vehicle-to-Pedestrian (V2P) communication. When pedestrians cannot be detected using line-of-sight sensors like camera, radar and LIDAR, V2P communication with the Dedicated Short Range Communication (DSRC) enabled pedestrian smartphone is used to detect and localize them through the in-vehicle DSRC radio used for Vehicle-to-Everything (V2X) communication. The vehicle, then, either stops or, if possible, goes around the pedestrian in a socially acceptable manner using the elastic band method for locally modifying the vehicle trajectory in real time. The elastic band method of collision avoidance is modified for fast real time execution in this paper. Along with model-in-the-loop simulations, a hardware-in-the-loop simulator using an automated driving vehicle model in the high fidelity vehicle dynamics simulation program Carsim Real Time with Sensors and Traffic with two DSRC modems emulating the vehicle and pedestrian communications is introduced and used in this paper as a prerequisite to real world experiments. Both stationary and moving pedestrians are considered in the model and hardware-in-the-loop simulations. Two real world experiments are also presented to demonstrate the V2P based avoidance of crashes between low speed autonomous shuttles and pedestrians.

AB In order to improve the efficiency and comfort of autonomous vehicles while ensuring safety, the decision algorithm needs to interact with human drivers, infer the most probable behavior and then makes advantageous decision. This paper proposes a Nash-Q learning based motion decision algorithm to consider the interaction. First, the local trajectory of surrounding vehicle is predicted by kinematic constraints, which can reflect the short-term motion trend. Then, the future action space is built based the predicted local trajectory that consists of five basis actions. With that, the Nash-Q learning process can be implemented by the game between these basis actions. By elimination of strictly dominated actions and the Lemke-Howson method, the autonomous vehicle can decide the optimal action and infer the behavior of surrounding vehicle. Finally, the lane merging scenario is built to test the performance contrast to the existing methods. The driver in loop experiment is further designed to verify the interaction performance in multi-vehicle traffic. The results show that the Nash-Q learning based algorithm can improve the efficiency and comfort by 15.75% and 20.71% to the Stackelberg game and the no-interaction method respectively while the safety is ensured. It can also make real-time interaction with human drivers in multi-vehicle traffic.

AB This paper is concerned with designing and numerically implementing a V2X (Vehicle-to-Vehicle and Vehicle-to-Infrastructure) control system architecture for a platoon of autonomous vehicles. The V2X control architecture integrates the well-known Intelligent Driver Model (IDM) for a platoon of Autonomous Driving Vehicles (ADVs) with Vehicle-to-Infrastructure (V2I) Communication. The main aim is to address practical implementation issues of such a system as well as the safety and security concerns for traffic environments. To this end, we first investigated a channel estimation model for V2I communication. We employed the IEEE 802.11p vehicular standard and calculated path loss, Packet Error Rate (PER), Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR), and throughput between transmitter and receiver end. Next, we carried out several case studies to evaluate the performance of the proposed control system with respect to its response to: (i) the communication infrastructure; (ii) its sensitivity to an emergency, inter-vehicular gap, and significant perturbation; and (iii) its performance under the loss of communication and changing driving environment. Simulation results show the effectiveness of the proposed control model. The model is collision-free for an infinite length of platoon string on a single lane road-driving environment. It also shows that it can work during a lack of communication, where the platoon vehicles can make their decision with the help of their own sensors. V2X Enabled Intelligent Driver Model (VX-IDM) performance is assessed and compared with the state-of-the-art models considering standard parameter settings and metrics.

AB Autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) have become attractive and essential for underwater search and exploration because of the advantages they offer over manned underwater vehicles. Hence the need to improve AUV technologies. One crucial area of AUV technology involves efficiently solving the path planning problem. Several approaches have been identified from the literature for AUV global and local path planning. The use of machine learning (ML) techniques in overcoming some of the challenges associated with AUV path planning problems such as safety and obstacle avoidance, energy consumption, and optimal time and distance travelled remains an active research area. While there is literature on global and local path planning that explores different techniques, there is still a lack of paper that provides an overview of the application of ML for local path planning. Hence the main objective of this paper is to present an overview of the state-of-the-art application of ML techniques on local path planning for AUVs. The ML algorithms are discussed under supervised, unsupervised, and reinforcement learning. The challenges faced in real-life deployment, simulated scenarios, computational issues, and application of ML algorithms are discussed, with future research directions presented.

AB In many cities traffic jams, accidents and air pollution are part of the daily reality. One of the solutions offered for this is the autonomous or driverless car. However, one of the main obstacles to the introduction of this vehicle is the fear felt by its potential users. Based on studies showing how the personality of the user promotes their online experience, we suggest that if the travel experience in an autonomous car was individualized to fit the personality of the user, people would relate to it with more confidence. We discuss a number of personality theories and assess how they may impact on people's preferences with regard to three important components of the autonomous car: information, entertainment, and work. It is our belief that designing the autonomous car around the different personality types of users and enabling them to choose the components that best fit them, may go a long way to solving the impediment of trust. Therefore, the personalization of the driverless car is expected to enhance the use and engagement of users, in addition to promoting its acceptance by other road-users.

TI Parking Lot Pricing Optimization Strategy Considering Autonomous Vehicle

AB The unbalanced distribution of parking demand is a primary source of parking problems. The autonomous driving system and parking assist system of fully autonomous vehicles provide a possibility to alleviate the uneven distribution of parking demand in the city. Exploring the parking behavior of autonomous vehicle (AV) users is necessary for assessing parking pricing policies. In turn, the distribution of parking demand and people's preference for parking lots may be impacted by the change in the AV parking lot's parking charge. Thus, this paper aims to provide an effective optimization method for AV parking lot price strategy, based on the analysis of the parking behavior of AV users. A stated choice experiment is designed to understand AV users' parking behavior. To estimate the impact of attributes and social-demographic factors, the multinomial logit model is adopted. From the results, we find a farther but cheaper parking lot is more attractive than a closer but more expensive parking lot to AV users. Based on the estimated results, a bilayer optimization model based on parking behavior is built to optimize AV parking lot prices. The Lagrangian relaxation method is employed to solve the model. By empirical testing, the AV parking price optimization model based on parking behavior is proven to be feasible and effective. According to the case study's findings, the parking lot pricing optimization model and algorithm proposed in this paper can not only meet the benefits of parking lots and the utility of autonomous vehicle users, but also alleviate the demand for parking concentrated in the city center, which means the parking difficulties caused by the distribution of parking demand can be alleviated through the optimization of AV parking lots' parking price.
   Parking difficulties in the city center are a major problem in urban traffic. Higher demand for parking in the city center may cause a series of problems, such as traffic congestion, emissions, and traffic safety. The autonomous driving system and parking assist system of fully autonomous vehicles provide a possibility to alleviate these problems. by exploring of AV users' choice preference on parking lots, we find a farther but cheaper parking lot is more attractive than a closer but more expensive parking lot. This indicates that people may change their parking lot choice behavior. However, it is not enough to balance parking demand by relying on autonomous vehicles and user choice preferences alone. Without the guidance of reasonable parking lot prices, parking lots far away from the city center cannot attract users who originally choose parking lots in the city center. As a result, by the research on the parking lot selection preferences of autonomous vehicle users, the pricing optimization of autonomous vehicle parking lots can effectively adjust the distribution of urban parking demand, thus alleviating urban parking difficulties.

AB Autonomous vehicles (AVs) hold great promise to contribute to global sustainability by expanding access to mobility. The introduction of autonomous buses and shuffles could be a turning point for public mobility in the USA, but how autonomous public transit is perceived remains largely unknown. To fill this gap, this study analyzes the willingness to use autonomous buses and shuffles based on two surveys conducted in Michigan. These surveys were a phone-based random-sampling survey of the general public and an on-board intercept survey of public transit riders. We found that autonomous buses might increase willingness to use public transit. 15% of people, who occasionally ride or do not ride public transit, embrace the idea of using autonomous bus service, while fixed-route riders were more likely to accept AVs than demand-response transit riders. However, about half of the public transit riders were hesitant about riding in autonomous buses citing concerns over safety, no human, and distrust in technology. Willingness to ride was higher among younger males than it was for females, seniors, and people with mobility disabilities. In addition, our data suggests that riders' satisfaction with their drivers - be it skill, professionalism, or friendliness - had no impact on willingness to ride in AVs. As AVs become ready for deployment, policymakers and public transportation service providers should consider AV acceptance among vulnerable individuals to bring AV benefits to all.

The proposed flight hardware is composed of a general-purpose computing module connected to a low-cost inertial measurement, an real-time kinematics GPS, motor speed controller, and a camera, through a custom-made printed circuit board. The flight software is developed in C++ with multi-threading such that the multiple tasks of control, estimation, and communication are executed simultaneously. The proposed flight system is verified with autonomous flight experiments on a United States Naval Academy research vessel operating in Chesapeake Bay. Two types of flight experiments are performed: autonomous flight utilizing real-time kinematics GPS for relative positioning, and vision-based autonomous flight, both for shipboard launch and landing.

AB This paper studies the purchase subsidy design problem for human-driven electric vehicles (HDEVs) and autonomous electric vehicles (AEVs). The proposed range- and mode-specific purchase subsidy aims to maximize the social benefits from vehicle electrification and automation. In this study, we first classify electric vehicles (EVs) into several classes based on electric driving ranges. Each EV class contains two driving modes, i.e., human driving and automated driving. We provide a simplified model to estimate the greenhouse gas (GHG) emission and the inconvenience costs of vehicle charging. The nested logit model is used to characterize users' vehicle choice behaviors. A mixed integer nonlinear programming (MINLP) model is formulated for the purchase subsidy design problem. A customized branch-and-bound (B&B) method is developed to seek a globally optimal solution to the formulated MINLP model. The numerical examples show that the developed solution method can effectively solve the proposed problem in a reasonable time. The local search strategy embedded in the customized B&B method helps reduce 7% computation time on average. Some managerial insights obtained from the numerical experiments are discussed, which can help the government agency to achieve a reasonable budget allocation between HDEVs and AEVs with different electric driving ranges.

AB The rapid development of Advanced Driver Assistance Systems (ADAS) and Autonomous Vehicle (AV) technology has raised concerns about the ability of ordinary drivers to safely interact with these systems without formal training or practice sessions. This study investigates the impact of training on drivers' ability to interact with ADAS functions, aiming to enhance road safety and prepare drivers for future autonomous driving. To do so the study compared novice and experienced drivers' performance across various driving training sessions separated by different time intervals. Using a simulation-based driving scenario, a diverse group of participants with different ages, genders, driving experience, and ADAS usage frequencies was recruited. Participants were instructed to drive a virtual subject vehicle (SV) multiple times with different time intervals and various ADAS functions being activated and/or deactivated. Data on steering wheel input, acceleration, braking, event triggering time, response time, and vehicle lateral position were collected and analysed. Participants' performance, measured in terms of accuracy, reaction time in interacting with ADAS functions, and vehicle control when they are interacting with those functions, was assessed after each training session. Results revealed significant improvements in accuracy, reaction time, and vehicle control for both novice and experienced drivers' performance following training. The results highlight the importance of appropriate training for drivers to safely operate ADAS and autonomous functions, providing valuable insights for policymakers, vehicle manufacturers, and driver education institutions. Furthermore, the findings emphasise the need for further investigations on the effectiveness of various training modalities and the potential benefits of integrating real-time feedback systems or Artificial Intelligence (AI)-assisted coaching. This study has important ramifications for the future design and implementation of driver training programs, as well as the development of policies and regulations to promote the safe use of ADAS and AV technology in the future.

AB This paper describes model-based separated fault detection and fault tolerant control of longitudinal autonomous driving using dual-sliding mode observer for functional safety. Internal and environment sensors such as camera or radar are required to measure the acceleration information of the subject vehicle and the relative distance and velocity information between the preceding and subject vehicles in longitudinal autonomous driving. In order to detect the independent fault of each sensor, a dual-sliding mode observer (SMO) is used for fault reconstruction under the assumption that V2V (Vehicle to Vehicle) communication for vehicle driving state is available. The each SMO reconstructs the expected fault in sensor based on discontinuous injection term used for converging output error to zero. Based on the reconstructed fault by each SMO, faults are detected using threshold approach. When the fault is detected, the reconstructed fault is used for fault tolerant control by subtracting to faulty data. The proposed fault detection (FD) and fault tolerant control (FTC) algorithms were evaluated using actual driving data and a three-dimensional (3D) vehicle model with a linear quadratic regulator for following control. The evaluation results are presented and analyzed with regard to fault reconstruction, detection, and tolerant control in four cases wherein two types of faults were applied.

Therefore, correlating the time dimension and the space dimension through prediction to create a spatio-temporal navigation map can make decision-making and path planning in such kinds of environment much easier. In this article, NGSIM data is analysed and processed from the perspective of the ego-vehicle (using the data as an ego-vehicle's perception results). Based on the data, we develop an LSTM (Long-Short Term Memory)based framework to predict possible trajectories of multiple surrounding vehicles within a certain range of the ego-vehicle. Then, the multiple predicted trajectories in a series of continuous dynamic highway scenes are projected into a spatio-temporal domain to create an octree map. Thus, dynamic targets and static obstacles can be unified into the same domain or map so that the dynamic disturbance problem for autonomous driving in highway environments can be resolved. Experimental results show that the proposed model is capable of predicting all the future trajectories around the ego-vehicle efficiently and the corresponding spatiotemporal map can be generated accurately in different dynamic scenarios.

AB We consider the problem of optimal maneuvering, where an autonomous vehicle, an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) for example, must maneuver to maximize or minimize an objective function. We consider a vehicle navigating in a Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS)-denied environment that self-localizes in two dimensions using angle-of-arrival (AOA) measurements from stationary beacons at known locations. The objective of the vehicle is to travel along the path that minimizes its position and heading estimation error. This article presents an informative path planning (IPP) algorithm that (i) uses the determinant of the self-localization estimation error covariance matrix of an unscented Kalman filter as the objective function; (ii) applies an l-step look-ahead (LSLA) algorithm to determine the optimal heading for a constant-speed vehicle. The novel algorithm takes into account the kinematic constraints of the vehicle and the AOA means of measurement. We evaluate the performance of the algorithm in five scenarios involving stationary and mobile beacons and we find the estimation error approaches the lower bound for the estimator. The simulations show the vehicle maneuvers to locations that allow for minimum estimation uncertainty, even when beacon placement is not conducive to accurate estimation.

AB In a surface vehicle ride, the passenger's comfort is desirable, ensuring safety under various tight constraints. To consider this requirement, this article has proposed a lateral control for autonomous vehicle considering the lateral offset error constraints. A reduced-order dynamics of the vehicle has been considered for improving and easy implementation of backstepping. A nonlinear control has been developed by utilizing the Time-varying Asymmetric Barrier Lyapunov Function via the Active Disturbance Rejection Control (ADRC) approach. The Extended State Observer, a component of applied ADRC, estimates all unknown system states as well as the unknown disturbance. The desired trajectories (smooth and non-smooth) based on the yaw rate profile have been synthesized to test the performance of the vehicle. Simulation results are presented to show the effectiveness of the proposed closed-loop control strategy. The vehicle performance has been compared using the proposed method, the conventional Quadratic Lyapunov Function and Symmetric Barrier Lyapunov Function based control. The proposed control provides a smoother control signal, small tracking error and robustness in presence of hard road constraints for smooth/non-smooth vehicle motion.

AB Pedestrians are arguably one of the most safety-critical road users to consider for autonomous vehicles in urban areas. In this paper, we address the problem of jointly detecting pedestrians and recognizing 32 pedestrian attributes from a single image. These encompass visual appearance and behavior, and also include the forecasting of road crossing, which is a main safety concern. For this, we introduce a Multi-Task Learning (MTL) model relying on a composite field framework, which achieves both goals in an efficient way. Each field spatially locates pedestrian instances and aggregates attribute predictions over them. This formulation naturally leverages spatial context, making it well suited to low resolution scenarios such as autonomous driving. By increasing the number of attributes jointly learned, we highlight an issue related to the scales of gradients, which arises in MTL with numerous tasks. We solve it by normalizing the gradients coming from different objective functions when they join at the fork in the network architecture during the backward pass, referred to as fork-normalization. Experimental validation is performed on JAAD, a dataset providing numerous attributes for pedestrian analysis from autonomous vehicles, and shows competitive detection and attribute recognition results, as well as a more stable MTL training.

AB In this paper, the control of autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) in six-degrees-of-freedom (6-DOFs) is analyzed in a comparison study among several controllers. At steady state, the vehicle needs to compensate for two dynamic effects, the ocean current and the restoring forces; the appropriateness of the adaptive/integral action designed with respect to the persistent effects is discussed. Moreover, for each controller, an adaptive/integral proportional derivative (PD) plus gravity compensation-like version is derived and eventually modified so as to achieve null steady-state error under modeling uncertainty and presence of ocean current. Numerical simulations are presented to better illustrate the controllers' behavior.

AB This paper focuses on the development of real-time decision-making criteria for an autonomous vehicle whose tasks to be performed are competing under limited sensory resources. More specifically, we are interested in the search and classification of multiple static objects of unknown number and positions given a single autonomous sensor vehicle. In this case, search and classification are two competing demands since an autonomous vehicle can perform either task but not both at the same time. During a search task, once the vehicle finds an object of interest, it has to decide on whether to neglect the found object and continue searching, or stop and observe that object. If the vehicle decides to stop and classify the object, it has to decide on how much time it can afford to do so. This is a very critical decision as choosing one option over the other may mean missing other, more important objects not yet found, or missing the opportunity to satisfactorily classify a found critical object. Building on previous deterministic work by the authors, in this paper we develop Bayesian-based probabilistic and information-theoretic search versus classification decision-making criteria that result in guaranteed detection and classification of all the unknown objects in the domain. Simulation-based results are provided to study the performance of the proposed decision-making strategy.

AB Poaching is an illegal activity that remains out of control in many countries. Based on the 2014 report of the United Nations and Interpol, the illegal trade of global wildlife and natural resources amounts to nearly $ 213 billion every year, which is even helping to fund armed conflicts. Poaching activities around the world are further pushing many animal species on the brink of extinction. Unfortunately, the traditional methods to fight against poachers are not enough, hence the new demands for more efficient approaches. In this context, the use of new technologies on sensors and algorithms, as well as aerial platforms is crucial to face the high increase of poaching activities in the last few years. Our work is focused on the use of vision sensors on UAVs for the detection and tracking of animals and poachers, as well as the use of such sensors to control quadrotors during autonomous vehicle following and autonomous landing.

TI Investigation of the Impact on Throughput of Connected Autonomous
   Vehicles with Headway Based on the Leading Vehicle Type
SO TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH RECORD
LA English
DT Article
AB Although the future era of autonomous driving is seen as a solution for many of the current problems in traffic; the introductory phase, with low penetration rates of connected-autonomous vehicles (CAVs), might lead to lower capacities. This forecast is based on certain assumptions that the CAVs can operate more efficiently when communicating and cooperating- already proved in real tests-therefore in practice, they can keep smaller following headways. However, it is envisioned that they might keep larger headways to other conventional vehicles for safety reasons. Lower connected-autonomous vehicle (CAV) penetration rates lead to a reduction in the overall vehicle throughput, then with increasing penetration rates, throughput is recovered and eventually improved. Simulations demonstrate that the impact on vehicle throughput depends on the car following headway and penetration rate. Based on this potential reduction in the maximum throughput for low penetration rates, the aim of this paper is the mitigation of this phenomenon at urban intersections through a possible managing solution to sort CAVs and a pre-set green-time start. A microsimulation model has been calibrated using PTV Vissim to reflect this operating solution, using new possibilities as leading vehicle class dependent headway settings and formula-based routing for sorting vehicles at a two-lane intersection entry. This approach allows the formation of platoons at intersections and uses their effectiveness even at low CAV penetration rates. The tested scenario is simplified to through traffic without turnings maneuvers and the results show that the potential loss in throughput is canceled and reductions in the control delay can reach 17% for oversaturated conditions.

AB Game engines are increasingly used as simulation platforms by the autonomous vehicle community to develop vehicle control systems and test environments. A key requirement for simulation-based development and verification is determinism, since a deterministic process will always produce the same output given the same initial conditions and event history. Thus, in a deterministic simulation environment, tests are rendered repeatable and yield simulation results that are trustworthy and straightforward to debug. However, game engines are seldom deterministic. This paper reviews and identifies the potential causes and effects of non-deterministic behaviours in game engines. A case study using CARLA, an open-source autonomous driving simulation environment powered by Unreal Engine, is presented to highlight its inherent shortcomings in providing sufficient precision in experimental results. Different configurations and utilisations of the software and hardware are explored to determine an operational domain where the simulation precision is sufficiently high i.e. variance between repeated executions becomes negligible for development and testing work. Finally, a method of a general nature is proposed, that can be used to find the domains of permissible variance in game engine simulations for any given system configuration.

AB Safety is one of the major concerns in autonomous driving tasks, and enhancing the collision avoidance ability of connected and autonomous vehicles (CAVs) is an effective way to improve road safety. Most current autonomous driving algorithms make braking and stopping decisions in a traffic emergency. However, such decisions may not be optimal. In this paper, we study the optimal collision avoidance decision-making method for emergencies. To address this challenge, we propose a cooperative decision-making scheme for CAVs in an emergency. Unlike previous decision-making methods, our scheme enables vehicles to avoid collisions by indicating the optimal emergency destinations, which leads to a new task: the prediction of the optimal collision avoidance destination. In the proposed scheme, the potential collision avoidance destinations are evaluated based on a deep reinforcement learning (DRL) model, and we propose a safety evaluation map (SEM) to describe the evaluation results. The cooperative ability of CAVs is considered in the proposed scheme, and a well-designed reward function is applied to train the DRL model. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed model can accurately evaluate potential collision avoidance destinations and is effective in reducing traffic accident rates and accident damage in various traffic emergencies compared to state-of-the-art baseline methods.

AB Reinforcement learning applications are spreading among different domains, including autonomous vehicle control. The diverse situations that can happen during, for instance, at a highway commute are infinite, and with labeled data, the perfect coverage of all use-cases sounds ambitious. However, with the complex tasks and complicated scenarios faced during an autonomous vehicle system design, the credit assignment problem arises. How to construct appropriate objectives for the artificial intelligence to learn and the preferences between the different goals also matter of the designer's choice. This work attempts to tackle the problem by utilizing successor features and providing a possible decomposition of the reward functions, guiding the agent's actions. This method makes the training easier for the agent and enables immediate, profound performance on new combined tasks. Furthermore, with the optimal composition, the desired behavior can be fine-tuned, and as an auxiliary gain, the decomposition empowers different driving styles and makes driving preferences rapidly changeable. We introduce the adaptation of FastRL algorithm to autonomous vehicle domain, meanwhile developing a stabilizing way of using Successor Features, namely DoubleFastRL. We compare our solution for a highway driving scenario with basic agents such as Q-learning having multi-objective training.

DE FOV constraint; Landmark based navigation; Path planning; Guidance;

AB When GPS is not available, autonomous vehicles can obtain navigation information by observing a source with a camera or an acoustic system mounted on the frame of the vehicle. This information can be used in the navigation and to overcome the lack of other sources of positioning. However, these systems often have a limited range and angular FOV. Due to this restriction, motion along some paths will make it impossible to obtain the necessary navigation information as the source is no longer in the vehicle's FOV. This paper proposes both a path planning approach and a guidance control law that allows the vehicle to preserve landmarks that are critical for the navigation inside the FOV while at the same time converging to the proposed path. The suggested approach is experimentally validated by implementation in an autonomous underwater vehicle.

ID TRACKING CONTROL
AB We present a study on the cooperative control of two autonomous surface vehicles performing a caging and transport mission on the water surface. The two vehicles, connected to each other by means of a floating flexible rope, are required to capture a floating target from a given location, and transport it to a designated position. We focus on the coordination and control strategy to meet these requirements, and on its implementation on two under-actuated vehicles. We describe a multi-layered control architecture which achieves the goal, followed by simulation studies and field experiments with the two vehicles caging and transporting a floating target on the surface of a lake.

ID VERIFICATION
AB Autonomous driving has gained much attention from both industry and academia. Currently, Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) are widely used for perception and control in autonomous driving. However, several fatal accidents caused by autonomous vehicles have raised serious safety concerns about autonomous driving models. Some recent studies have successfully used the metamorphic testing technique to detect thousands of potential issues in some popularly used autonomous driving models. However, prior study is limited to a small set of metamorphic relations, which do not reflect rich, real-world traffic scenarios and are also not customizable. This paper presents a novel declarative rule-based metamorphic testing framework called RMT. RMT provides a rule template with natural language syntax, allowing users to flexibly specify an enriched set of testing scenarios based on real-world traffic rules and domain knowledge. RMT automatically parses human-written rules to metamorphic relations using an NLP-based rule parser referring to an ontology list and generates test cases with a variety of image transformation engines. We evaluated RMT on three autonomous driving models. With an enriched set of metamorphic relations, RMT detected a significant number of abnormal model predictions that were not detected by prior work. Through a large-scale human study on Amazon Mechanical Turk, we further confirmed the authenticity of test cases generated by RMT and the validity of detected abnormal model predictions.

AB On-ramp is one of the scenarios most likely to cause traffic accidents and congestion. In order to mitigate the conflict between mainline vehicles and ramp vehicles, and improve vehicle safety and travel efficiency, we propose an interactive on-ramp merging decision-making (IORMDM) method based on motion prediction. We first propose a motion prediction method for different actions of vehicles based on model predictive control. Meanwhile, the game theory is employed to construct the interaction behavior between the ramp vehicle and the mainline vehicle, and the merging motivation of the ramp vehicle is modeled to describe the collision risk between it with the end of the acceleration lane. Afterward, according to the predicted trajectories of vehicles, the comprehensive payoff of vehicle collision risk, efficiency, passenger comfort, and merging motivation of each action is solved. The Nash equilibrium solution is solved to determine the optimal action of each vehicle according to the payoff table. Simulation experiments demonstrate that our proposed method could reduce collision risk and improve traffic efficiency.

AB Object detection performed by Autonomous Vehicles (AV)s is a crucial operation that comes ahead of various autonomous driving tasks, such as object tracking, trajectories estimation, and collision avoidance. Dynamic road elements (pedestrians, cyclists, vehicles) impose a greater challenge due to their continuously changing location and behaviour. This paper presents a comprehensive review of the state-of-the-art object detection technologies focusing on both the sensory systems and algorithms used. It begins with a brief introduction on the autonomous driving operations and challenges. Then, different sensory systems employed on existing AVs are elaborated while illustrating their advantages, limitations and applications. Also, sensory systems employed by different research are reviewed. Moreover, due to the significant role Deep Neural Networks (DNN)s are playing in object detection tasks, different DNN-based networks are also highlighted. Afterwards, previous research on dynamic objects detection performed by AVs are reviewed in tabular forms. Finally, a conclusion summarizes the outcomes of the review and suggests future work towards the development of vehicles with higher automation levels.

AB There is a paradigm shift happening in automotive industry towards electric vehicles as environment and sustainability issues gained momentum in the recent years among potential users. Connected and Autonomous Electric Vehicle (CAEV) technologies are fascinating the automakers and inducing them to manufacture connected autonomous vehicles with self-driving features such as autopilot and self-parking. Therefore, Traffic Flow Prediction (TFP) is identified as a major issue in CAEV technologies which needs to be addressed with the help of Deep Learning (DL) techniques. In this view, the current research paper presents an artificial intelligence-based parallel autoencoder for TFP, abbreviated as AIPAE-TFP model in CAEV. The presented model involves two major processes namely, feature engineering and TFP. In feature engineering process, there are multiple stages involved such as feature construction, feature selection, and feature extraction. In addition to the above, a Support Vector Data Description (SVDD) model is also used in the filtration of anomaly points and smoothen the raw data. Finally, AIPAE model is applied to determine the predictive values of traffic flow. In order to illustrate the proficiency of the model's predictive outcomes, a set of simulations was performed and the results were investigated under distinct aspects. The experimentation outcomes verified the effectual performance of the proposed AIPAE-TFP model over other methods.

AB This article presents the open water propeller characteristics and the four-quadrant propeller models as applied to a torpedo-shaped underwater vehicle. A series of experiments with a Gavia autonomous underwater vehicle propeller were conducted in the towing tank using a rotor testing apparatus. The purpose of these tests was to measure the propeller thrust and torque under varying flow conditions and then to be used as the basis of the developed propeller models. These mathematical models were constructed using two regression models, a polynomial and a Fourier series. Model coefficients were derived using the method of least squares and a comparison analysis was also conducted to test the robustness of the methodology. Results show that the Fourier series models were able to produce a reasonable and accurate approximation of thrust and torque coefficients with a small number of parameters in the examined condition of this study. The obtained four-quadrant open water characteristics of the autonomous underwater vehicle propeller model would be utilised to improve the system mathematical model for more accurate simulation and controller design, to compare the autonomous underwater vehicle performance equipped with different propulsion units, and to validate computational fluid dynamic results.

AB KAT-5 was the fourth vehicle to make history in DARPA's 2005 Grand Challenge, where for the first time ever, autonomous vehicles were able to travel through 100 miles of rough terrain at average speeds greater than 15 mph. In this paper, we describe the mechanisms and methods that were used to develop the vehicle. We describe the main hardware systems with which the vehicle was outfitted for navigation, computing, and control. We describe the sensors, the computing grid, and the methods that controlled the navigation based on the sensor readings. We also discuss the experiences gained in the course of the development and provide highlights of actual field performance. (c) 2006 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

AB The ideal of the self-driving car replaces an error-prone human with an infallible, artificially intelligent driver. This narrative of autonomy promises liberation from the downsides of automobility, even if that means taking control away from autonomous, free-moving individuals. We look behind this narrative to understand the attachments that so-called 'autonomous' vehicles (AVs) are likely to have to the world. Drawing on 50 interviews with AV developers, researchers and other stakeholders, we explore the social and technological attachments that stakeholders see inside the vehicle, on the road and with the wider world. These range from software and hardware to the behaviours of other road users and the material, social and economic infrastructure that supports driving and self-driving. We describe how innovators understand, engage with or seek to escape from these attachments in three categories: 'brute force', which sees attachments as problems to be solved with more data, 'solve the world one place at a time', which sees attachments as limits on the technology's reach and 'reduce the complexity of the space', which sees attachments as solutions to the problems encountered by technology developers. Understanding attachments provides a powerful way to anticipate various possible constitutions for the technology.

AB This paper presents a novel approach for path-following control of a four-wheeled autonomous vehicle. The rear wheels of the vehicle are driven independently, all four wheels can be braked independently, and the front wheels are steered together. The proposed cascade structure consists of two convex optimization-based parts: one for path-following and another for the control allocation problem of the actuators. The control algorithm presents cost functions for the allocation problem focusing on safety. The proposed cost functions were examined and compared to former ones in a simulation environment. After all, the controller was tested in real-time test on a Lotus Evora test vehicle developed by ThyssenKrupp.

ID AUTOMATED VEHICLES; DECISION-MAKING; COMMUNICATION; DESIGN
AB A driving-safety-zone-model-oriented motion planning framework (DSZMF) is proposed for autonomous platoons in heterogeneous driving environments with complex driving behaviors and interactions between human -driven and autonomous vehicles. As an extension of the responsibility-sensitive-safety (RSS) model, the driving safety zone model ensures that autonomous truck platoons adhere to explicit and implicit traffic rules as rational traffic participants.It consists of three zones created by safe distances and artificial potential field (APF), namely the restricted zone, the coordinated zone, and pre-cautionary zone. The Rational Traffic Participant (RTP) module is created by using a Finite State Machine (FSM) to provide an optimized platooning behavioral strategy based on the dynamic states of surrounding vehicles. Furthermore, the distributed model predictive controllers are utilized for motion planning, while the H infinity controller is developed to maintain the string stability of the autonomous platoon. The proposed DSZMF generates behavioral decisions by thoroughly considering the driving safety zone model, string stability, and multiple vehicle dynamics constraints. Finally, three critical scenarios are co-simulated for case studies, and the simulation results demonstrate that the DSZMF improves the safe time integration rate over the existing MCF by 18.9%, 11.1%, and 11.6% in three scenarios, respectively. In addition, DSZMF increases the minimum longitudinal and lateral Time to Collision (TTC) values to reduce collision risks. The case studies validate the efficacy of the proposed method for safety assurance and collaborative control of the autonomous platoon.

AB This paper provides a new solution for path following control of autonomous ground vehicles. H-2 control problem is considered to attenuate the effect of the road curvature disturbance. To this end, we formulate a standard model from the road-vehicle dynamics, the a priori knowledge on the road curvature, and the path following specifications. This standard model is then represented in a Takagi-Sugeno fuzzy form to deal with the time-varying nature of the vehicle speed. Based on a static output feedback scheme, the proposed method allows avoiding expensive vehicle sensors while keeping the simplest control structure for real-time implementation. The concept of D-stability is exploited using Lyapunov stability arguments to improve the transient behaviors of the closed-loop vehicle system. In particular, the physical upper and lower bounds of the vehicle acceleration are explicitly considered in the design procedure via a parameter-dependent Lyapunov function to reduce drastically the design conservatism. The proposed H-2 design conditions are expressed in terms of linear matrix inequalities (LMIs) with a single line search parameter. The effectiveness of the new path following control method is clearly demonstrated with both theoretical illustrations and hardware experiments under real-world driving situations.

AB Vehicle automation and communication technologies are considered promising approaches to improve operational driving behavior. The expected gradual implementation of autonomous vehicles (AVs) shortly will cause unique impacts on the traffic flow characteristics. This paper focuses on reviewing the expected impacts under a mixed traffic environment of AVs and regular vehicles (RVs) considering different AV characteristics. The paper includes a policy implication discussion for possible actual future practice and research interests. The AV implementation has positive impacts on the traffic flow, such as improved traffic capacity and stability. However, the impact depends on the factors including penetration rate of the AVs, characteristics, and operational settings of the AVs, traffic volume level, and human driving behavior. The critical penetration rate, which has a high potential to improve traffic characteristics, was higher than 40%. AV's intelligent control of operational driving is a function of its operational settings, mainly car-following modeling. Different adjustments of these settings may improve some traffic flow parameters and may deteriorate others. The position and distribution of AVs and the type of their leading or following vehicles may play a role in maximizing their impacts.

DT Review
AB The purpose of this paper is to discuss and present a technical analysis of the recent advancements in autonomous robots equipped with a manipulator. The autonomous robots include unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV), unmanned underwater vehicle (UUV), and unmanned ground vehicle (UGV). A manipulator can make an autonomous robot more adaptable and robust but it can also affect its performance as well. Several issues can arise because of the installation of a manipulator like the robot becoming unstable due to the extra weight, slow convergence, and errors in the path planning. Therefore, this study presents the numerous recent techniques that are in use to counter the aforementioned problems. The methodology and approach used in this paper are to first present the dynamic model of the autonomous robot. Then, the study offers a performance analysis of the specific robot in question. Finally, the paper formulates the limitations of the recently proposed techniques in the form of a table for each vehicle. The key findings of this study are a comprehensive review of the aforesaid techniques and their technical analysis. The unique contribution of this study is to present some of the limitations that these methods have so the researcher can better select the method according to the mission requirement.

AB The exponential growth of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) or drones in recent years has raised concerns about their safe operation, especially in beyond-line-of-sight (BLOS) scenarios. Existing unmanned aircraft system traffic management (UTM) heavily relies on commercial communication networks, which may become ineffective if network infrastructures are damaged or disabled. For this challenge, we propose a novel approach that leverages vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) communications to enhance UAV safety and efficiency in UAV operations. In this study, we present a UAV information collection and sharing system named Drone Mapper (R), enabled by V2V communications, so that UAVs can share their locations with each another as well as with the ground operation station. Additionally, we introduce an autonomous flight coordination control system (AFCCS) that augments UAV safety operations by providing two essential functionalities: UAV collision avoidance and UAV formation flight, both of which work based on V2V communications. To evaluate the performance of the developed AFCCS, we conducted comprehensive field experiments focusing on UAV collision avoidance and formation flight. The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed system and show seamless operations among multiple UAVs.

AB We propose a vision-based localization algorithm with multiswarm particle swarm optimization for driving an autonomous vehicle. With stereo vision, the vehicle can be localized within a 3D point cloud map using the particle swarm optimization. For vehicle localization, the GPS (global positioning system)-based algorithms are often affected by the certain conditions resulting in intermittent missing signal. We address this issue in vehicle localization by using stereo vision in addition to the GPS information. The depth-based localization is formulated as an optimization-based tracking problem. Virtual depth images generated from the point cloud are matched with the online stereo depth images using the particle swarm optimization. The virtual depth images are generated from the point cloud using a series of coordinate transforms. We propose a novel computationally efficient tracker, i.e., a multiswarm particle swarm optimization-based algorithm. The tracker is initialized with GPS information and employs a Kalman filter in the bootstrapping phase. The Kalman filter stabilizes the GPS information in this phase and, subsequently, initializes the online tracker. The proposed localization algorithm is validated with acquired datasets from driving tests. A detailed comparative and parametric analysis is conducted in the experiments. The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness and robustness of the proposed algorithm for vehicle localization, which advances the state of the art for autonomous driving.

DT Article
DE Fused controller; Neural networks; Autonomous vehicles; Lateral control
AB We present a novel fused feed-forward neural network controller inspired by the notion of task decomposition principle. The controller is structurally simple and can be applied to a class of control systems that their control requires manipulation of two input variables. The benchmark problem of inverted pendulum is such example that its control requires availability of the angle as well as the displacement. We demonstrate that the lateral control of autonomous vehicles belongs to this class of systems and successfully apply the proposed controller to this problem. The parameters of the controller are encoded into real value chromosomes for genetic algorithm (GA) optimization. The neural network controller contains three neurons and six connection weights implying a small search space implying faster optimization time due to few controller parameters. The controller is also tested on two benchmark control problems of inverted pendulum and the ball-and-beam system. In particular, we apply the controller to lateral control of a prototype semi-autonomous vehicle. Simulation results suggest a good performance for all the tested systems. To demonstrate the robustness of the controller, we conduct Monte-Carlo evaluations when the system is subjected to random parameter uncertainty. Finally experimental studies on the lateral control of a prototype autonomous vehicle with different speed of operation are included. The simulation and experimental studies suggest the feasibility of this controller for numerous applications. Crown Copyright (c) 2012 Published by Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB This paper introduces a control scheme to vector thrust in marine cycloidal propellers with non-zero forward speed, despite the presence of measurement noise and current-like disturbances. Cycloidal propellers utilize 360 degrees thrust-vectoring to provide agile maneuvering to surface vessels like tugboats and double ended ferries, but have yet to be utilized in present-day unmanned and autonomous marine vehicles. This work strategizes a low-level cycloidal propeller controller to track a reference thrust magnitude and direction for use in high-level control of underwater vehicles. Unlike previous work that assumes zero inflow-speed, the propeller-shaft speed and propeller-blade phase are hydrodynamically coupled in cases with non-zero inflow. The incorporation of this coupling enables thrust-tracking over varying advance-speeds necessary for propulsion and maneuvering of unmanned and autonomous underwater vehicles. A torque controller for screw propellers is extended for thrust-tracking in cycloidal propellers. A propeller-phase control loop is added and the resultant controller is verified through simulations for 360 degrees thrust vectoring of cycloidal propellers in currents and varying cruise speeds. This low-level controller will enable use of cycloidal propellers for high maneuverability and thrust-augmentation in applications like station-keeping, seakeeping, maneuvering, and teaming of unmanned and autonomous marine vehicles in complex marine environments like surf zones and restricted waters.

AB Active safety systems are of significant importance for autonomous vehicles operating in safety-critical situations like an obstacle-avoidance manoeuvre with high vehicle speed or poor road condition. However, a conventional electronic stability control system, may not always yield desired path following and yaw stability performance in such circumstances merely through brake intervention. This paper pursues a detailed investigation on utilising model predictive control (MPC) and torque vectoring for path following and yaw stability control of over-actuated autonomous electric vehicles (AEVs) in dangerous double lane change manoeuvre. The control problem of the AEV is formulated based on MPC by utilising active front steering and torque vectoring, and constraints are imposed explicitly on yaw rate and sideslip angle to ensure yaw stability. Four MPC-based controllers are designed based on double-track vehicle models. Specifically, they include two one-level controllers, i.e. one with torque vectoring and one with equal torque allocation, and two two-level controllers, i.e. one with optimisation-based torque allocation and one with rule-based allocation. These controllers are assessed extensively, with respect to passing velocity, tracking accuracy, tyre utilisation and robustness. The effect of horizon length on the control performance and computational efficiency is also investigated.

   IMPACT
AB Connectivity and automation are expected to enhance safety and efficiency in transportation systems. Connectivity will provide information to drivers/autonomous vehicles to enhance decision-making reliability at the operational and tactical levels. Consequently, drivers are more likely to execute safe and efficient maneuvers and autonomous vehicles will have a more accurate perception of the traffic condition and an "error-free" execution of the driving maneuvers. At the operational level, ensuring string stability is a key consideration since unstable traffic flow results in shockwave propagation and possibly crashes. While several studies have examined the effects of information availability on string stability in a connected environment, most of the approaches are focused on automated driving (e.g., Cooperative Adaptive Cruise Control systems) and do not consider a mixed environment with regular, connected, and autonomous vehicles. To ensure connectivity in such a mixed environment, the correlation between communication range and connected vehicles density should be considered. To capture the effects of this correlation, this study uses the Continuum Percolation theory to determine the effects of the vehicular density and communication range on the connectivity level in telecommunications network and consequently, on the string stability of traffic flow. Based on the Continuum Percolation theory, there is a critical density of connected vehicles above which the entire system is connected. This critical density also depends on the communication range. This study presents an analytical derivation of this critical density. Moreover, this study evaluates the string stability under different communication ranges and market penetration rates of connected and autonomous vehicles. Results revealed that as communication range increases, the system becomes more stable and at high communication ranges, the system performs similar to the system with full connectivity. Moreover, results indicated the existence of an optimal communication range to maximize stability and ensure information delivery. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB This paper introduces a modernized version of many-to-few dial-a-ride called autonomous dial-a-ride transit (ADART), which employs fully-automated order-entry and routing-and-scheduling systems that reside exclusively on board the vehicle. Here, ''fully automated'' means that under normal operation, the customer is the only human involved in the entire process of requesting a ride, assigning trips, scheduling arrivals and routing the vehicle. There are no telephone operators to receive calls, nor any central dispatchers to assign trips to vehicles, nor any human planning a route. The vehicles' computers assign trip demands and plan routes optimally among themselves, and the drivers' only job is to obey instructions from their vehicle's computer. Consequently, an ADART vehicle fleet covers a large service area without any centralized supervision. In effect, the vehicles behave like a swarm of ants accomplishing their chore without anyone in charge.

AB This paper presents a design method for outputfeedback path-following control of under-actuated autonomous underwater vehicles moving in a vertical plane without using surge, heave, and pitch velocities. Specifically, an extended state observer (ESO) is developed to recover the unmeasured velocities as well as to estimate total uncertainty induced by internal model uncertainty and external disturbance. At the kinematic level, a commanded guidance law is developed based on a vertical line-of-sight guidance scheme and the observed velocities. To optimize guidance signals, optimization-based reference governors are formulated as bound-constrained quadratic programming problems for computing optimal reference signals. Two globally convergent recurrent neural networks called projection neural networks are used to solve the optimization problems in real-time. Based on the optimal reference signals and ESO, a kinetic control law with disturbance rejection capability is constructed at the kinetic level. It is proved that all error signals in the closed-loop system are uniformly and ultimately bounded. Simulation results substantiate the efficacy of the proposed method for output-feedback path-following of under-actuated autonomous underwater vehicles.

AB The foggy freeway is a scenario with a high incidence of accidents. Different traffic flow conditions will affect the driving behavior of conditionally autonomous vehicle drivers in the foggy areas of the freeway. In this study, the experiment was carried out by using the driving simulation system. Forty-two participants drove on a foggy freeway according to two traffic conditions and two non-driving related tasks. Wilcoxon Signed-Rank Test and Survival Analysis were applied to explore the impact. The results show that the effects of different non-driving related tasks on driving behavior are mainly concentrated in the takeover process; The deceleration reaction time of the free flow (6.04 s) is much lower than that of bound flow (9.40 s); In the condition of bound flow, the driver is more inclined to slow down without braking. Potential application areas of this research comprise safety assessment of conditional autonomous driving and formulating autonomous driving policy.

AB The automotive industry has witnessed an increasing level of development in the past decades; from manufacturing manually operated vehicles to manufacturing vehicles with a high level of automation. With the recent developments in Artificial Intelligence (AI), automotive companies now employ blackbox AI models to enable vehicles to perceive their environment and make driving decisions with little or no input from a human. With the hope to deploy autonomous vehicles (AV) on a commercial scale, the acceptance of AV by society becomes paramount and may largely depend on their degree of transparency, trustworthiness, and compliance with regulations. The assessment of the compliance of AVs to these acceptance requirements can be facilitated through the provision of explanations for AVs' behaviour. Explainability is therefore seen as an important requirement for AVs. AVs should be able to explain what they have `seen', done, and might do in environments in which they operate. In this paper, we provide a comprehensive survey of the existing work in explainable autonomous driving. First, we open by providing a motivation for explanations by highlighting the importance of transparency, accountability, and trust in AVs; and examining existing regulations and standards related to AVs. Second, we identify and categorise the different stakeholders involved in the development, use, and regulation of AVs and elicit their AV explanation requirements. Third, we provide a rigorous review of previous work on explanations for the different AV operations (i.e., perception, localisation, planning, vehicle control, and system management). Finally, we discuss pertinent challenges and provide recommendations including a conceptual framework for AV explainability. This survey aims to provide the fundamental knowledge required of researchers who are interested in explanation provisions in autonomous driving.

ID BEHAVIOR
AB Nowadays, autonomous vehicles are increasing, and the driving scenario that includes both autonomous and human-driven vehicles is a fact. Knowing the driving styles of drivers in the process of automating vehicles is interest in order to make driving as natural as possible. To this end, this article presents a first approach to the design of a controller for the braking system capable of imitating the different manoeuvres that any driver performs while driving. With this aim, different experimental tests have been carried out with a vehicle instrumented with sensors capable of providing real-time information related to the braking system. The experimental tests consist of reproducing a series of braking manoeuvres at different speeds on a flat floor track following a straight path. The tests distinguish between three types of braking manoeuvre: maintained, progressive and emergency braking, which cover all the driving circumstances in which the braking system may intervene. This article presents an innovative approach to characterise braking types thanks to the methodology of analysing the data obtained by sensors during experimental tests. The characterisation of braking types makes it possible to dynamically classify three driving styles: cautious, normal and aggressive. The proposed classifications allow it possible to identify the driving styles on the basis of the pressure in the hydraulic brake circuit, the force exerted by the driver on the brake pedal, the longitudinal deceleration and the braking power, knowing in all cases the speed of the vehicle. The experiments are limited by the fact that there are no other vehicles, obstacles, etc. in the vehicle's environment, but in this article the focus is exclusively on characterising a driver with methods that use the vehicle's dynamic responses measured by on-board sensors. The results of this study can be used to define the driving style of an autonomous vehicle.

AB Autonomous driving has the potential to revolutionize mobility and transportation by reducing road accidents, alleviating traffic congestion, and mitigating air pollution. This transformation can result in energy efficiency, enhanced convenience, and increased productivity, as valuable driving time can be repurposed for other activities. The main objective of this paper is to provide a comprehensive technical survey of the latest research in the field of lateral, longitudinal, and integrated control techniques for autonomous vehicles. The survey aims to explore a wide range of techniques and methodologies employed to achieve precise steering control while also considering longitudinal aspects. Model-based control techniques form the foundation for control, utilizing mathematical models of vehicle dynamics to design controllers that effectively track desired speeds and/or steering behavior. Unlike model-free control techniques such as reinforcement learning and deep learning algorithms facilitate the integration of longitudinal and lateral control by learning control policies directly from data and without explicit knowledge of the underlying dynamics. Through this survey, the paper delves into the strengths, limitations, and advancements in both model-based and model-free control approaches for autonomous vehicles. It investigates their performance in real-world scenarios and addresses the technical challenges associated with their implementation. These challenges may include uncertainties in the environment, adaptability to dynamic conditions, robustness, safety considerations, and computational complexity.

AB There is a "timing optimism" that artificial general intelligence will be achieved soon, but some literature has suggested that people have mixed feelings about its overall impact. This study expanded their findings by investigating how Taiwanese university students perceived the overall impact of high-level-machine-intelligence (HLMI) in three areas: a set of 12 human professions, autonomous vehicles, and smart homes. Respondents showed a relatively more positive attitude, with a median answer of "on balance good", toward HLMI's development corresponding to those occupations having a higher probability of automation and computerization, and a less positive attitude, with a median of "more or less neutral", toward professions involving human judgment and social intelligence, and especially creativity, which had a median of "on balance bad". On the other hand, they presented a highly positive attitude toward the AI application of the smart home, while they demonstrated relatively more reservation toward autonomous vehicles. Gender, area of study, and a computer science background were found as predictors in many cases, whereas traffic benefits, and safety and regulation concerns, among others, were found as the most significant predictors for the overall impact of autonomous vehicles, with comfort and support benefits being the most significant predictor for smart homes. Recommendations for educators, policy makers, and future research were provided.

AB Underwater magnetic surveying serves as the fundamental prerequisite for detecting sensitive underwater targets and magnetically susceptible submerged objects. However, when utilizing magnetic gradient tensor measurements for underwater positioning, the stability of the measurement apparatus can be significantly affected by hydrodynamic disturbances in the underwater environment, thereby having a substantial impact on data quality. Autonomous Underwater Vehicles (AUV) are unmanned underwater robots designed to independently perform various tasks and operations in underwater environments. In order to ensure the quality of data collection, this paper proposes a structure utilizing an Autonomous Underwater Vehicles platform equipped with a three-component magnetic gradiometer. This structure employs second-order tensor positioning algorithms and vertical gradient positioning algorithms, coupled with the Autonomous Underwater Vehicles's inherent vertical profile motion, to effectively achieve the precise positioning of underwater cables. Simulation results indicate that, in the absence of geomagnetic background noise, both horizontal and vertical structures yield favorable positioning results. However, when introducing background noise of 40,000 nT, the horizontal structure exhibits larger positioning errors, whereas the vertical structure demonstrates smaller errors. Experimental results show that in near-field scenarios, both structures achieve relatively similar positioning accuracy. Nevertheless, under identical distances in the far field, the vertical structure reduces errors by a minimum of 30.78% compared to the horizontal structure, thereby confirming the feasibility of integrating magnetic gradient tensor measurement structures with Autonomous Underwater Vehicles platforms.

AB Continual learning is essential for all real-world applications, as frozen pre-trained models cannot effectively deal with non-stationary data distributions. The purpose of this study is to review the state-of-the-art methods that allow continuous learning of computational models over time. We primarily focus on the learning algorithms that perform continuous learning in an online fashion from considerably large (or infinite) sequential data and require substantially low computational and memory resources. We critically analyze the key challenges associated with continual learning for autonomous real-world systems and compare current methods in terms of computations, memory, and network/model complexity. We also briefly describe the implementations of continuous learning algorithms under three main autonomous systems, i.e., self-driving vehicles, unmanned aerial vehicles, and urban robots. The learning methods of these autonomous systems and their strengths and limitations are extensively explored in this article.

AB This article presents a method for the trajectory prediction of surrounding vehicles and proactive longitudinal control of autonomous vehicles (AVs) in an urban road environment. A long short-term memory (LSTM)-based deep learning model is designed for the surrounding vehicles' trajectory prediction. In our model, the historical evolution of the relation between a target vehicle and lanes is considered to learn the driver's behavior in a lane-aware manner. Interaction among adjacent vehicles is captured based on a graph convolutional network (GCN), which uses a self-attention mechanism. Compared to other approaches, our prediction model utilizes environment information that is acquirable in AVs with local sensors. A model predictive control (MPC) is designed to derive the control inputs of acceleration for AVs. The proposed control method utilizes the prediction results of the target vehicle to give action requests to AV in a proactive manner considering both safety and ride quality. The results of comparative studies indicate that the proposed prediction model achieves improved accuracy compared to baselines. The control results provided by automated driving tests show that the proposed control algorithm applied by the LSTM-based prediction model enables AVs to achieve safety with respect to surrounding vehicles and provide ride comfort to passengers.

AB We argue that object detectors in the safety critical domain should prioritize detection of objects that are most likely to interfere with the actions of the autonomous actor. Especially, this applies to objects that can impact the actor's safety and reliability. To quantify the impact of object (mis)detection on safety and reliability in the context of autonomous driving, we propose new object detection measures that reward the correct identification of objects that are most dangerous and most likely to affect driving decisions. To achieve this, we build an object criticality model to reward the detection of the objects based on proximity, orientation, and relative velocity with respect to the subject vehicle. Then, we apply our model on the recent autonomous driving dataset nuScenes, and we compare nine object detectors. Results show that, in several settings, object detectors that perform best according to the nuScenes ranking are not the preferable ones when the focus is shifted on safety and reliability.

AB With the advancement of communication and autonomous driving technologies, a mixed traffic flow comprising human-driven vehicles (HVs), connected human-driven vehicles (CHVs), and connected autonomous vehicles (CAVs) is emerging. In this paper, we propose a generalized car-following model for mixed traffic flow, which considers both the human drivers' characteristics (i.e., perception ability of distance, acceleration, and speed, trust level in connected vehicle information, and driving style) and information from multiple leading connected vehicles (CVs). Through numerical experiments, we analyze the influences of mixed traffic flow composition schemes, communication distance, and human drivers' characteristics on mixed traffic flow. The results show that the proposed model can effectively capture the car-following behavior of different types of vehicles in mixed traffic flow. The contribution of CHVs to mixed traffic flow stability is significantly less than that of CAVs due to the involvement of human drivers' characteristics. Human drivers' characteristics significantly influence average fuel consumption (FC) within mixed traffic flow. Specifically, inaccurate perception of distance by human drivers can lead to an increase in the average FC, while a higher level of trust in connected information leads to lower average FC. Furthermore, the results reveal that the communication distance between CVs plays a pivotal role in the stability of mixed traffic flow.

AB Vehicle automation technologies open new avenues for improving present transportation networks. It is predicted that Autonomous vehicles (AVs) and Connected Vehicles (CVs) will improve the traffic flow though increasing road capacities and reducing travel time and congestion to a great extent. According to the studies, AVs and CVs benefits will likely to more increase with their penetration rates and level of automation and cooperation. Eventually it might accelerate the expected evolution in car mobility in which the gradual transition from regular human driving to automated driving will occur. This paper summarizes the recent studies on the impact of vehicle automation in traffic flow. Although many factors are considered to affect traffic flow under the use of vehicle automation. This study has selected four main factors, these are travel behavior factor, the effect of platooning, travel time factor, and the effect of intersection control. The reviewed studies relevant to these keywords have been extensively argued and thoroughly discussed in this paper. Furthermore, the different applied models and the analytical frameworks which have been used to achieve various results and outcomes, are described in an illustrative table. Finally, all findings which have been demonstrated from this paper emphasize a great contribution of the developed vehicle automation technology to the future of our transportation system.

AB This paper investigates the impact of tyre dynamics on autonomous vehicle dynamic control. The commonly used 2 degrees of freedom bicycle model and a detailed vehicle model considering tyre dynamics are built, respectively, to describe the vehicle dynamics. The two models are firstly compared with the response to front wheel steering input and differential motor torque input. The transient vehicle body vibrations are clearly demonstrated by the detailed model but overlooked by the bicycle model. The influence of tyre nonlinearity on path offset is also revealed. Then, the path following control strategy is designed based on the linear quadratic regulator control to compare the two models from the path following performance perspective. The double lane change simulation is conducted. The results show that at low vehicle speed, the path following errors of two models are very close, which proves the rationality of using the bicycle model to represent the vehicle dynamics in mild and moderate driving conditions. However, when the path following is conducted with high vehicle speed, the required lateral tyre force is large, so the tyres work with large slip angles and the tyre nonlinearity generates significant deviation on the path following errors between the two models.

AB Autonomous driving systems (ADSs) need to be able to respond quickly to changes in the dynamic traffic scenario. However, regardless of the changes occurring in traffic scenes, the current local path planning frameworks of ADSs are based on the fixed frequency re-planning path (i.e., running their planning algorithms repeatedly). This planning method makes it difficult to provide a reasonable traveling path, agility, and comfort for driverless vehicles in changing traffic scenarios. Therefore, this article performs an in-depth analysis of the problems of traditional planning frameworks which use a fixed frequency to replan the path and proposes a novel path planning framework that is universal based on multiple-models. The proposed framework divides the planning process into several layers, each of which has different functions. With this framework, the ADS can adaptively adjust the planning process according to the changes in traffic scenes and then provide different path planning algorithms to ensure its safety and flexibility in the process of driving. Moreover, the problems caused by the traditional planning framework can be solved. This framework has been applied to the autonomous vehicle "Pioneer", which won first place in the 2019 China Intelligent Vehicle Future Challenge (IVFC). The effectiveness and rationality of the integrated framework of local path planning proposed in this article were verified by a large number of tests in real-world traffic scenarios.

AB For several years road vehicle autonomous cruise control (ACC) systems as well as anti-collision radar have been developed. Several manufacturers currently sell this equipment. The current generation of ACC sensors only track the first preceding vehicle to deduce its speed and position. These data are then used to compute, manage and optimize a safety distance between vehicles, thus providing some assistance to car drivers. However, in real conditions, to elaborate and update a real time driving solution, car drivers use information about speed and position of preceding and following vehicles. This information is essentially perceived using the driver's eyes, binocular stereoscopic vision performed through the windscreens and rear-view mirrors. Furthermore, within a line of vehicles, the frontal road perception of the first vehicle is very particular and highly significant. Currently, all these available data remain strictly on-board the vehicle that has captured the perception information and performed these measurements. To get the maximum effectiveness of all these approaches, we propose that this information be shared in real time with the following vehicles, within the convoy. On the basis of these considerations, this paper technically explores a cost-effective solution to extend the basic ACC sensor function in order to simultaneously provide a vehicle-to-vehicle radio link. This millimetre wave radio link transmits relevant broadband perception data (video, localization...) to following vehicles, along the line of vehicles. The propagation path between the vehicles uses essentially grazing angles of incidence of signals over the road surface including millimetre wave paths beneath the cars.

AB Connected and autonomous vehicles (CAVs) are expected to operate with safety guarantee in presence of adversaries from the Internet of Vehicles. This article proposes a control method named reachability analysis plus satisfiability modulo theories (RA-SMT) for CAVs against integrity attacks caused by bounded adversary. This method enables vehicles to possess the reach-avoid specification and strict control safety ensurance even in the worst case scenario. The introduction of state-feedback control decomposes the original complex problem into more manageable reachability analysis and adversary-free control strategy optimization. Precisely, zonotope sets are employed for reachability analysis, and the control strategy is optimally solved and verified simultaneously via SMT. This method is applicable to complex traffic scenarios with the help of SMT, which can describe various constraints flexibly and conveniently. Simulation results reveal the effectiveness and safety of the proposed method in the classical car-following scenario against bounded adversary under various conditions. Particularly, RA-SMT exhibits significantly improved control performance (around 16%) and computation efficiency (around 63%) compared with existing methods. Finally, the RA-SMT is implemented on an autonomous driving platform to validate its practicability.

AB Collaborative perception enables autonomous vehicles to exchange sensor data among each other to achieve cooperative object classification, which is considered an effective means to improve the perception accuracy of connected autonomous vehicles (CAVs). To protect information privacy in cooperative perception, we propose a lightweight, privacy-preserving cooperative object classification framework that allows CAVs to exchange raw sensor data (e.g., images captured by HD camera), without leaking private information. Leveraging chaotic encryption and additive secret sharing technique, image data are first encrypted into two ciphertexts and processed, in the encrypted format, by two separate edge servers. The use of chaotic mapping can avoid information leakage during data uploading. The encrypted images are then processed by the proposed privacy-preserving convolutional neural network (P-CNN) model embedded in the designed secure computing protocols. Finally, the processed results are combined/decrypted on the receiving vehicles to realize cooperative object classification. We formally prove the correctness and security of the proposed framework and carry out intensive experiments to evaluate its performance. The experimental results indicate that P-CNN offers exactly almost the same object classification results as the original CNN model, while offering great privacy protection of shared data and lightweight execution efficiency.

AB This paper proposed a finite-time prescribed performance control scheme for underactuated autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) based on adaptive neural networks and a tan-type barrier Lyapunov function. Even in the presence of output constraints and environmental disturbances, the AUV can also precisely track the desired trajectory in a finite time. By introducing a tan-type barrier Lyapunov Function (TBLF), the singularity problem in process design is solved and all output errors are guaranteed to satisfy the prescribed performance specifications. Dynamic surface control (DSC) and the minimal learning parameter (MLP) are employed to greatly simplify the complexity of the algorithm and enhance the robustness of the control system, respectively. Lyapunov stability analysis proves that the proposed controller guarantees all signals in the closed-loop system to be uniformly ultimately bounded (UUB), and that the tracking errors converge to a small neighborhood near the origin in a finite time. Finally, the simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness and feasibility of the proposed controller.

AB The field of automatic driving has always been a research hotspot. Based on inertial and odometer, dead reckoning is used to navigate for L4 and above level autonomous vehicles with less human intervention when GPS is blocked. The navigation accuracy is mainly determined by the alignment error and the drift accumulated over time. In this paper, we proposed a novel method to achieve initial alignment of inertial navigation for L4 and above level autonomous vehicles. The alignment is accomplished with a MEMS inertial measurement unit (MIMU) and single antenna global positioning system real-time kinematic (GPS-RTK). By matching the trajectory obtained from MIMU dead reckoning with the trajectory obtained from RTK, the initial heading angle is obtained, and the heading angle accuracy is improved through multiple iterations. In the case of RTK precision decreasing, the MIMU can still achieve lane-level navigation after the initial alignment. Because the alignment is accomplished in motion, there is no need for additional static alignment time before the vehicle starts. The field experiment results show that the method could achieve fast initial alignment in a few seconds in moving state with an alignment accuracy of 0.05 degrees.

AB This paper studies the heterogeneous energy cost and charging demand impact of autonomous electric vehicle (EV) fleet under different ambient temperature. A data-driven method is introduced to formulate a two-dimensional grid stochastic energy consumption model for electric vehicles. The energy consumption model aids in analyzing EV energy cost and describing uncertainties under variable average vehicle trip speed and ambient temperature conditions. An integrated eco-routing and optimal charging decision making framework is designed to improve the capability of autonomous EV's trip level energy management in a shared fleet. The decision making process helps to find minimum energy cost routes with consideration of charging strategies and travel time requirements. By taking advantage of derived models and technologies, comprehensive case studies are performed on a data-driven simulated transportation network in New York City. Detailed results show us the heterogeneous energy impact and charging demand under different ambient temperature. By giving the same travel demand and charging station information, under the low and high ambient temperature within each month, there exist more than 20% difference of overall energy cost and 60% difference of charging demand. All studies will help to construct sustainable infrastructure for autonomous EV fleet trip level energy management in real world applications.

An overview of the hardware, firmware, ground station, and validation testing used to demonstrate this autopilot as a viable research instrument for atmospheric thermodynamic sensing on micro/miniature aerial vehicles is presented. The autonomous micro aerial vehicle pilot incorporates a 16 bit 140 MHz processor, global positioning system, dual radios, inertial measurement unit, pressure sensor, humidity sensor, and temperature sensor. Through these components, the autonomous micro aerial vehicle pilot is capable of full-state feedback, vehicle state estimation, localization, and wireless networking. Notable features of this autopilot are its dual-radio configuration, providing redundancy and adaptability in communication, and the detachable sensor breakout design that allows for increased flexibility in sensor placement on a vehicle. Full-state feedback of the autopilot platform was validated through a series of bench tests. This includes a unique technique for dynamic inertial measurement unit validation performed using the present group's model positioning system as well as comparing estimated pressure values with known values at multiple heights and global positioning system values with a known path. Systemwide validation was performed through flight tests on a micro/miniature aerial vehicle airframe.

AB Lidar imaging systems are one of the hottest topics in the optronics industry. The need to sense the surroundings of every autonomous vehicle has pushed forward a race dedicated to deciding the final solution to be implemented. However, the diversity of state-of-the-art approaches to the solution brings a large uncertainty on the decision of the dominant final solution. Furthermore, the performance data of each approach often arise from different manufacturers and developers, which usually have some interest in the dispute. Within this paper, we intend to overcome the situation by providing an introductory, neutral overview of the technology linked to lidar imaging systems for autonomous vehicles, and its current state of development. We start with the main single-point measurement principles utilized, which then are combined with different imaging strategies, also described in the paper. An overview of the features of the light sources and photodetectors specific to lidar imaging systems most frequently used in practice is also presented. Finally, a brief section on pending issues for lidar development in autonomous vehicles has been included, in order to present some of the problems which still need to be solved before implementation may be considered as final. The reader is provided with a detailed bibliography containing both relevant books and state-of-the-art papers for further progress in the subject.

AB This paper addresses the problem of cooperative path-following of multiple autonomous vehicles. Stated briefly, the problem consists of steering a group of vehicles along specified paths while keeping a desired spatial formation. For a given class of autonomous surface vessels, it is shown how Lyapunov-based techniques and graph theory can be brought together to design a decentralized control structure, where the vehicle dynamics and the constraints imposed by the topology of the inter-vehicle communication network are explicitly taken into account. To achieve path-following for each vehicle, a nonlinear adaptive controller is designed that yields convergence of the trajectories of the closed-loop system to the path in the presence of constant unknown ocean currents and parametric model uncertainty. The controller derived implicitly compensates for the effect of the ocean current without the need for direct measurements of its velocity. Vehicle cooperation is achieved by adjusting the speed of each vehicle along its path according to information exchanged on the positions of a subset of the other vehicles, as determined by the communication topology adopted. Global stability and convergence of the closed-loop system are guaranteed. Illustrative examples are presented and discussed. Copyright (C) 2009 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB Without the involvements of human beings, cyber physical systems (CPSs) run based on many devices distributed everywhere around the smart city. Autonomous vehicles (AVs) occupy a critical part in modern transportation systems under the condition of 5G wireless communication. To help people make decisions, AVs collect and produce instant information on the roads. When messages are trasferred from AVs, real-time and dependable authentications are required. Recently, a host of signature or key agreement authentication schemes have been proposed by researchers. However, weaknesses appear, such as instant data sent from autonomous vehicles are in plaintext, and attackers can track the identity of the autonomous vehicle even if pseudo-identity mechanism is employed. In this paper, we introduce a new authentication scheme for AVs in transportation systems. Formal proof with random oracles demonstrates that it is difficult for the adversary to forge the four messages in the public communication environment. Moreover, security properties including vehicle anonymity, traceability and mutual authentication meet the requirements in our discussion. At last, the performation test with miracl library and simulation with NS3 show that the proposed scheme is practical due to completeness of more security targets than others.

AB In this paper, we develop a novel visual-inertial navigation system with motion constraint (VINS-Motion), which extends the visual-inertial navigation system (VINS) to incorporate vehicle motion information for improving the autonomous vehicles localization accuracy. We introduce the vehicle stop detection module in the pre-processing measurement procedure. During the back-end processing, if the vehicle is detected to be in a stopping state, we perform optimization based on the stop constraint to help eliminate the abnormal jitter of the estimated pose, thus ensuring the reasonability of the trajectory. Otherwise, besides the prior information, IMU measurement residual, and visual measurement residual utilized in VINS, vehicle orientation/velocity constraint built by Ackerman steering model is first exploited to constitute residuals. We minimize the sum of priors and Mahalanobis norms of three kinds of residuals to obtain a maximum posterior estimation, thus increasing system consistency and accuracy. The proposed approach is validated on public datasets and compared with state-of-the-art algorithms, which demonstrates that the motion constraint proposed in this paper improves the standard VINS performance and achieves significantly higher positioning accuracy.

AB Autonomous driving is believed to provide numerous benefits for individuals and society, including increased road safety, reduced traffic congestion, and an improved ecological footprint. However, many barriers still hinder the widespread acceptance of autonomous vehicles. Research has proposed governmental policy strategies to accelerate the diffusion of autonomous driving, but less is known about end-user perceptions of this innovative technology. First, we employ a qualitative research design to identify the elements attributed to individual acceptance of autonomous driving. Furthermore, we organize a research model based on the technology acceptance model, validated with an online survey of 316 participants. The findings reveal how social influence, system characteristics, and individual factors determine individual acceptance of autonomous driving. The research helps to strengthen the existing body of knowledge by highlighting individual perceptions, with implications for practitioners.

AB This paper proposes a neural network approach adaptive super-twisting sliding mode control algorithm for autonomous vehicles. An adaptive and robust control algorithm in autonomous vehicles is needed to compensate for disturbance and parametric uncertainty from the variable environment and vehicle conditions. The sliding mode control (SMC) is a robust controller that compensates for robust and reasonable control performance against disturbance and parametric uncertainty. However, the inherent limitation of the sliding mode control, namely the chattering phenomenon, has a negative effect on the system. Additionally, when the disturbance exceeds the defined boundaries, the control stability is compromised. To overcome these limitations, this study incorporates the radial basis function neural network (RBFNN) and Lyapunov function to estimate disturbance and parametric uncertainty. The estimated disturbance is reflected in the super-twisting sliding mode control (STSMC) to reduce the chattering phenomenon and achieve enhanced robust performance. The performance evaluation of the proposed neural network approach control algorithm is conducted using the double lane change (DLC) scenario and rapid path-tracking (RPT) scenario, implemented in the CarMaker and Matlab/Simulink environments, respectively.

ID OPTIMAL PREVIEW CONTROLLER; PREDICTIVE CONTROL; PATH TRACKING
AB In this paper, a longitudinal and lateral control system of an autonomous vehicle is presented by developing a novel hybrid trajectory tracking algorithm. In this proposed method, the longitudinal control system is developed based on the curvature information of the reference path. The autonomous vehicle modifies the desired speed according to the estimated size and types of the reference trajectory curves. This desired speed is integrated into the PID controller to maintain an optimal speed of the vehicle while following the given path. The lateral control system is designed based on feedforward (preview control) and feedback (LQR) controllers to reduce lateral errors between the trajectory and autonomous vehicle. The feedforward and the feedback controllers generate precise steering angles to eliminate orientation and lateral errors caused by the curvature of the trajectory and external disturbances. The effectiveness of the proposed method is evaluated by comparing simulation and experimental results with different trajectory tracking algorithms on simulated and experimented paths. It is proven that the proposed algorithm is capable of significantly minimizing lateral errors on sharp curves compared to other path tracking methods.

AB Navigating, directing, and controlling autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) are demanding and considered complicated compared to the autonomous surface-level performance. In such vehicles, the motion can be controlled depending on the estimation of indefinite hydrodynamic forces and the disturbances that occurs in this vehicle in the underwater background. In this article, Gray Wolf optimization (GWO) is performed along with the second-order sliding mode control (GW-SoSMC) approach for controlling the yaw angle in AUV. The main purpose of the article is to reduce the error that occurs in the system between the controlled signal and desired signal corresponding to yaw angle. Using this proposed model, both the occurrence of chattering and the controlling performance of AUV system can be diminished. Moreover, the proposed model is compared with the existing approaches like, FireFly-SoSMC (FF-SoSMC), Genetic Algorithm-SoSMC (GA-SoSMC), Gray Wolf-SMC (GW-SMC), Group search optimization-SoSMC (GSO-SoSMC) and Artificial Bee Colony-SoSMC (ABC-SoSMC). From the simulation results, it shows that the performance of the implemented technique in terms of steady-state response, error analysis, yaw angle analysis, and controller response is enhanced while comparing with the existing approaches.

AB This paper focuses on the study and implementation of a navigation system in order to estimate position, velocity and attitude of an autonomous underwater vehicle, AUV. The extended Kalman filter, EKF, is investigated for the fusion of the sample data from different sensors: the strapdown inertial measurement unit, magnetic compass, Doppler velocity log, depth sensor, and an acoustic positioning system. Results are applied to the development of a navigation system for the Pirajuba AUV, an autonomous underwater vehicle that is being developed at the mechatronics department of the Politechnic School of the University of Sao Paulo. The navigation system is composed by off the shelf components integrated in a CAN based network. On the hardware platform, a software architecture is implemented based on free and largely known tools, like C language, and the GNU compiler. The real-time performance of the filter is validated through laboratory and field tests. The last one includes experiment using an automobile vehicle. Results in the field tests indicate the correct choice for the system model assumed in the EKF, and the good performance of the navigation algorithm in real-time. During the simulation, the accuracy obtained in the estimation of the AUV position and attitude are satisfactory.

AB The introduction of autonomous (self-driving) and shared autonomous vehicles (AVs and SAVs) will affect travel destinations and distances, mode choice, and congestion. From a traffic perspective, although some congestion reduction may be achieved (thanks to fewer crashes and tighter headways), car-trip frequencies and vehicle miles traveled (VMT) are likely to rise significantly, reducing the benefits of driverless vehicles. Congestion pricing (CP) and road tolls are key tools for moderating demand and incentivizing more socially and environmentally optimal travel choices.
   This work develops multiple CP and tolling strategies in alternative future scenarios, and investigates their effects on the Austin, Texas network conditions and traveler welfare, using the agent-based simulation model MATSim. Results suggest that, while all pricing strategies reduce congestion, their social welfare impacts differ in meaningful ways. More complex and advanced strategies perform better in terms of traffic conditions and traveler welfare, depending on the development of the mobility landscape of autonomous driving. The possibility to refund users by reinvesting toll revenues as traveler budgets plays a salient role in the overall efficiency of each CP strategy as well as in the public acceptability.

AB We present a recursive path-planning method that efficiently generates a path by using reduced states of the search space and taking into account the kinematics, shape, and turning space of a car-like vehicle. Our method is based on a kinematics-aware node expansion method that checks for collisions based on the shape and turning space of a vehicle. We present two heuristics that simultaneously consider the kinematics of a vehicle with and without obstacles. In particular, for challenging environments containing complex obstacles and even narrow passages, we recursively identify intermediate goals and nodes that allow the vehicle to compute a path to its destination. We show the benefits of our method through simulations and experimental results by using an autonomous ground vehicle. Furthermore, we show that our method can efficiently generate a collision-free path for vehicles in complex environments with passageways.

AB To guarantee the safety and reliability of autonomous driving applications, it is indispensable to construct a proper fault diagnosis framework tailored to autonomous vehicles. Fault diagnosis aims to provide essential information about the system operational status and its interpretation facilitates decision-making and mitigates the potential operation risks. In the present work, interpretability issue in fault diagnosis for autonomous vehicles is discussed from the sensor data analytics perspective. Environmental impact is first evaluated using the noise energy as a measure to interpret the impact on sensor data caused by the environment. A signal quality indicator is proposed and Savitzky-Golay filters are applied for online denoising, acting as a countermeasure to mitigate the impact and to enhance the data quality. Then, the adversarial learned denoising shrinkage autoencoder (ALDSAE), an adversarial learning neural network, is constructed for sensor data anomaly detection. It considers an adversarial training technique to improve the performance of the anomaly detector. A residual explainer specific to the ALDSAE model is employed to calculate the contribution of each input feature to the anomaly score in order to interpret the anomaly detection results. Several experiments with the collected data from an autonomous vehicle in a real test field are implemented to validate the effectiveness of the proposed approaches. Results show that the area under the ROC curve (AUC_ROC) of the proposed ALDSAE is over 20% higher in average than several traditional anomaly detectors, and the mean explanation accuracy of the residual explainer achieves similar performance with the widely employed kernel Shapley additive explanation (SHAP) with more than 99% reduction in mean response time.

AB Substantial challenges still exist in designing path-tracking control systems for autonomous vehicles, particularly at speed limits or under varying operating conditions. Such problems arise for various reasons, such as the nonlinear characteristics of vehicular components, system-component interactions, constraints on the states and control inputs, and more. This paper focuses on designing a robust adaptive control system for high-speed autonomous vehicles in case the system dynamics are unknown or unavailable. For this purpose, an intelligent NN-based estimation system's universal approximation potential will be leveraged, coupled to an adaptive integral sliding mode controller (AISMC). Unlike previously reported studies, the present paper considers the entire dynamics of the autonomous vehicle unknown rather than solely a part of the system or external disturbances merely. The Lyapunov stability theorem is employed to guarantee the asymptotic stability of the developed framework and to obtain the adaptation laws. A critical maneuver explores the effectiveness and robustness of the suggested framework under severe disturbances, parametric uncertainties, and high speeds. The obtained results indicate that the developed framework holds the capacity to navigate the vehicle alongside the desired trajectory and outperforms other reported studies in the literature subject to various external disturbances.

AB To safely and efficiently change lanes among human drivers, autonomous vehicles (AVs) should make human-like decisions and seamlessly cooperate with surrounding vehicles. Both overaggressive and over-conservative cut-in maneuvers will have adverse effects on traffic efficiency and safety. However, it is still not entirely clear how much influence of the AV's cut-in behavior would lay on the surrounding drivers in urban traffic. To investigate this question, we design a series of driving scenarios and analyze the impact of different cut-in maneuvers performed by the human-like AV on the surrounding drivers' comfort. Ten volunteer drivers participate in our experiment and take a series of trials in a driving simulator. The experimental results demonstrate that the relative distance between the AV and the target car on the adjacent lane has a more significant effect on the surrounding drivers' comfort than the relative speed does. In addition, different parameters should be considered with different cut-in scenarios. This conclusion could provide practical support to make a friendly cut-in decision for the AVs.

AB In this article, we describe an approach to autonomous system construction that not only supports self-awareness but also formal verification. This is based on modular construction where the key autonomous decision making is captured within a symbolically described "agent." So, this article leads us from traditional systems architectures, via agent-based computing, to explainability, reconfigurability, and verifiability, and on to applications in robotics, autonomous vehicles, and machine ethics. Fundamentally, we consider self-awareness from an agent-based perspective. Agents are an important abstraction capturing autonomy, and we are particularly concerned with intentional, or rational, agents that expose the "intentions" of the autonomous system. Beyond being a useful abstract concept, agents also provide a practical engineering approach for building the core software in autonomous systems such as robots and vehicles. In a modular autonomous system architecture, agents of this form capture important decision making elements. Furthermore, this ability to transparently capture such decision making processes, and especially being able to expose their intentions, within an agent allows us to apply strong (formal) agent verification techniques to these systems.

   Trajectory Prediction on Egocentric View

DE Autonomous driving; autonomous vehicle; attention mechanism; egocentric
   view; non-autoregressive transformer; pedestrian trajectory prediction
AB Predicting the future trajectories of surrounding pedestrians is undoubtedly one of the most essential but challenging tasks for safe urban autonomous driving. Despite this importance, there has been limited research conducted on the egocentric view from easy-to-access vehicle-mounted cameras for autonomous driving applications. This paper presents a non-autoregressive transformer based trajectory prediction methodology for pedestrian on egocentric view. Furthermore, our proposed model predicts ego-motion independent future trajectories for utilization in downstream tasks such as motion planning in autonomous vehicles. This approach differs from previous researches as it focuses on predicting the future position of pedestrians based on the current observed image context, rather than their future positions in future observed images. The proposed model, referred to as the TransPred network in this paper, is composed of three main modules: vehicle motion compensation, non-autoregressive transformer, and conditional variational autoencoder(CVAE). The transformer structure is employed to effectively handle raw images and the historical trajectory of the target pedestrian, enabling the generation of advanced future predictions. Additionally, the CVAE module is utilized in the final part of the overall model to predict plausible multiple future trajectories. It contributes to generating diverse and realistic future trajectory predictions. The performance of our model has been evaluated on Nuscenes and In-house dataset obtained from our vehicle equipped with sensors. We achieves the state-of-the-art performance for prioritized trajectories on both datasets. Moreover, the usability of the proposed ego-motion independent trajectories for autonomous driving is demonstrated through risk assessment experiments.

AB In order to increase the accuracy of the path tracking, an improved model predictive control (IMPC) is proposed for autonomous vehicle under road conditions of large curvature, which can enhance the performances of the driving stability and safety. The controller design is implemented in four steps. First, the curvature of road ahead is derived and applied to determine the longitudinal velocity. Thus, the longitudinal velocity is not assumed to be constant, which is the salient feature of the proposed control. Second, the kinematic model of vehicle is established by the Ackermann steering principle. Third, the predictive model is constructed by linearization and discretization of the kinematic model. Fourth, the longitudinal velocity and the front steering angle are imposed on hard constraints, and the constrained objective function is designed and composed of the position deviation and the control increment. Then, we can obtain the optimal results of the longitudinal velocity and the front steering angle. Furthermore, experiment and simulation on the path tracking of an autonomous vehicle are presented. The results show that the proposed control can realize excellent tracking performance under the road conditions of large curvature.

AB Recently, the advanced driver assistance system (ADAS) of autonomous vehicles (AVs) has offered substantial benefits to drivers. Improvement of passenger safety is one of the key factors for evolving AVs. An automated system provided by the ADAS in autonomous vehicles is a salient feature for passenger safety in modern vehicles. With an increasing number of electronic control units and a combination of multiple sensors, there are now sufficient computing aptitudes in the car to support ADAS deployment. An ADAS is composed of various sensors: radio detection and ranging (RADAR), cameras, ultrasonic sensors, and LiDAR. However, continual use of multiple sensors and actuators of the ADAS can lead to failure of AV sensors. Thus, prognostic health management (PHM) of ADAS is important for smooth and continuous operation of AVs. The PHM of AVs has recently been introduced and is still progressing. There is a lack of surveys available related to sensor-based PHM of AVs in the literature. Therefore, the objective of the current study was to identify sensor-based PHM, emphasizing different fault identification and isolation (FDI) techniques with challenges and gaps existing in this field.

AB Bicycles and similar two-wheeled vehicles are a scientifically interesting category of means of transportation, whose simultaneous localization and mapping problem, in contrast to other ground vehicles, has yet to be examined in depth and fully resolved. In this article, we introduce for the first time a comprehensive theoretical framework for the application of simultaneous localization and mapping specifically for autonomous bicycles and akin vehicles, based on the kinematics and dynamics models of the bicycle and the specific effects they have on the motion/odometry and measurement models that are essential for the solution of the simultaneous localization and mapping problem. In addition, we present our laboratory's first autonomous bicycle platform and its functional sensor system and sensor rotation pattern, specifically adjusted to the special characteristics of bicycles. Moreover, we investigate the effect of the bicycle frame roll, the main uncertainty factor of the bicycle simultaneous localization and mapping problem, on the overall simultaneous localization and mapping performance. The experimental results performed on our bicycle platform verify the potency of our proposed modeling and simultaneous localization and mapping application framework and provide further insight on future improvements for the two-wheeled vehicle simultaneous localization and mapping problem.

AB This work addresses the problem of optimal positioning for an intervention AUV, minimizing the energy consumption and improving the stability in orientation. During a generic intervention task, the vehicle is generally maintained in a hovering configuration, thus requiring a 6 DOF control of the vehicle positioning. The choice of roll and pitch, if done arbitrarily, can severely impact the power efficiency of the vehicle, especially in heavy systems, since the center of buoyancy (COB) may not be necessarily aligned over the center of mass (COM). This approach uses an Extended Kalman Filter (EKF) to identify the location of the center of buoyancy relative to the center of mass, thus allowing to compute the working orientation that maintains the COB vertically aligned above the COM. The EKF is implemented online and hence is able to detect movements of the COB due for example to ballast operations. This algorithm has been firstly implemented in simulation and then successfully validated with the SAUVIM (Semi-Autonomous Underwater Vehicle for Intervention Missions) autonomous underwater vehicle. With its weight of about 4 tons, this testbed is an optimal platform for validating the precision of the filter, since a very small variation of the target pitch and roll results in a large restoring torque.

AB Model predictive control (MPC)-based path following schemes for autonomous cars represent a novel and highly debated control approach. Their high online computational load poses a challenge for practical real-time application in vehicle systems with fast dynamics. This paper proposes an implementation scheme for an MPC path following controller that considers the feasible road region and vehicle shape. Moreover, the model mismatch induced by varying road conditions and small-angle assumptions is considered in the form of a measurable disturbance. To solve the optimization problem for the proposed MPC path following controller, a differential evolution (DE) algorithm is adopted. To verify the computational performance of the proposed implementation scheme, an experimental platform was developed that consists of the Hongqi autonomous car HQ430, various sensors, and systems for communication and data processing. The experimental results indicate that the proposed DE-based implementation strategy for the MPC path following controller achieves good computational performance and satisfactory control performance for path following in autonomous cars.

AB In contrast to the single-light detection and ranging (LiDAR) system, multi-LiDAR sensors may improve the environmental perception for autonomous vehicles. However, an elaborated guideline of multi-LiDAR data processing is absent in the existing literature. This paper presents a systematic solution for multi-LiDAR data processing, which orderly includes calibration, filtering, clustering, and classification. As the accuracy of obstacle detection is fundamentally determined by noise filtering and object clustering, this paper proposes a novel filtering algorithm and an improved clustering method within the multi-LiDAR framework. To be specific, the applied filtering approach is based on occupancy rates (ORs) of sampling points. Besides, ORs are derived from the sparse "feature seeds" in each searching space. For clustering, the density-based spatial clustering of applications with noise (DBSCAN) is improved with an adaptive searching (AS) algorithm for higher detection accuracy. Besides, more robust and accurate obstacle detection can be achieved by combining AS-DBSCAN with the proposed OR-based filtering. An indoor perception test and an on-road test were conducted on a fully instrumented autonomous hybrid electric vehicle. Experimental results have verified the effectiveness of the proposed algorithms, which facilitate a reliable and applicable solution for obstacle detection.

AB In this article, we give necessary conditions for the stability of coupled autonomous vehicles in R. We focus on linear arrays with decentralized vehicles, where each vehicle interacts with only a few of its neighbors. We obtain explicit expressions for necessary conditions for stability in the cases where a system consists of a periodic arrangement of two or three different types of vehicles, i.e., configurations as follows:... 2-1-2-1 or... 3-2-1-3-2-1. Previous literature indicated that the (necessary) condition for stability in the case of a single vehicle type (...1-1-1) held that the first moment of certain coefficients of the interactions between vehicles has to be zero. Here, we show that this does not generalize. Instead, the condition (necessary) in the cases considered is that the first moment plus a nonlinear correction term must be zero.

AB The computational work performed to navigate a biomimetic underwater vehicle autonomously is discussed. The navigation procedure uses as input a set of vehicle geometric and state variables, and from that it predicts the needed vehicle body deformations so that the vehicle can navigate through a set of given waypoints. The first task was to develop a two-dimensional numerical simulation based on an unsteady panel method coupled with the vehicle dynamics, Numerous test cases spanning the range of possible conditions were processed with the simulation, and these data were subsequently used to train a neural network. The trained network can predict what body deflection time history is necessary for the vehicle to navigate the given waypoints. Validation results are presented that show the accuracy of the present flow solver, and several test cases of autonomous navigation are presented to show the capabilities of the current method.

AB The climate change impacts of the anticipated growth in shared autonomous vehicles (SAVs) are highly uncertain due to competing mechanisms whose magnitudes are difficult to estimate. On the one hand, SAVs could reduce greenhouse gas emissions by driving more efficiently, avoiding traffic congestion, accelerating adoption of alternative fuel vehicles, and charging in alignment with renewable electricity generation. On the other hand, SAVs could induce more vehicle miles traveled (VMT) by lowering the time cost of travel and allowing non-drivers to travel more by car. In this study, we develop an energy system optimization model that integrates the electricity and transport sectors, computes endogenous technology adoption, and distinguishes SAVs from privately owned vehicles (POVs) to explore the contributions of SAVs to climate change mitigation. Our results show that widespread SAV adoption lowers costs and emissions, and that these desirable outcomes remain true even if SAVs induce double the VMT of the POVs they replace. SAVs dramatically accelerate the market penetration of electric vehicles. The environmental and economic benefits of this electrification trend are larger if electric SAV charging can be optimally aligned with renewable electricity generation. Especially in the short to medium term, SAV adoption can be a more impactful lever than a carbon tax for decarbonizing vehicle travel.

AB In this paper, a design method is presented for path-following control of under-actuated autonomous underwater vehicles subject to velocity and input constraints, as well as internal and external disturbances. In the guidance loop, a kinematic control law of the desired surge speed and pitch rate is derived based on a backstepping technique and a line-of-sight guidance principle. In the control loop, an extended state observer is developed to estimate the extended state composed of unknown internal dynamics and external disturbances. Then, a disturbance rejection control law is constructed using the extended state observer. To bridge the guidance loop and the control loop, a reference governor is proposed for computing optimal guidance signals within the velocity and input constraints. The reference governor is formulated as a quadratically constrained optimization problem. A projection neural network is employed for solving the optimization problem in real time. Simulation results illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed method for path-following control of autonomous underwater vehicles subject to constraints and disturbances simultaneously in the vertical plane.

AB Connected autonomous vehicle (CAV) technology has the potential to enable significant gains in energy economy (EE). Much research attention has been focused on autonomous eco-driving control enabled by various methods. In this study, the state of the literature on autonomous eco-driving control is reviewed, an overall systems' description of eco-driving control for a CAV is provided, and representative methods are evaluated comparatively against each other in simulation. Simulations are conducted using real-world traffic signal data and a validated future automotive systems technology simulator (FASTSim) model. Results indicate that an EE improvement in the range of 5%-15% is attainable depending on the method and cost function used. In this article it is shown that dynamic programming (DP) methods are most effective in improving EE but are significantly more computationally expensive than other methods. The genetic algorithm (GA) methods are shown to present the most potential in terms of EE improvement and run-time. Results also indicate that velocity-sensitive cost functions allow all the methods to perform better than pure acceleration minimization.

AB The complex decision-making systems used for autonomous vehicles or advanced driver-assistance systems (ADAS) are being replaced by end-to-end (e2e) architectures based on deep-neural-networks (DNN). DNNs can learn complex driving actions from datasets containing thousands of images and data obtained from the vehicle perception system. This work presents the classification, design and implementation of six e2e architectures capable of generating the driving actions of speed and steering wheel angle directly on the vehicle control elements. The work details the design stages and optimization process of the convolutional networks to develop six e2e architectures. In the metric analysis the architectures have been tested with different data sources from the vehicle, such as images, XYZ accelerations and XYZ angular speeds. The best results were obtained with a mixed data e2e architecture that used front images from the vehicle and angular speeds to predict the speed and steering wheel angle with a mean error of 1.06%. An exhaustive optimization process of the convolutional blocks has demonstrated that it is possible to design lightweight e2e architectures with high performance more suitable for the final implementation in autonomous driving.

AB In this paper, we consider coordinated movement of a network of vehicles consisting of a bounded number of malicious agents, that is, vehicles must reach consensus in longitudinal position and a common predefined velocity. The motions of vehicles are modeled by double-integrator dynamics and communications over the network are asynchronous with delays. Each normal vehicle updates its states by utilizing the information it receives from vehicles in its vicinity. On the other hand, misbehaving vehicles make updates arbitrarily and might threaten the consensus within the network by intentionally changing their moving direction or broadcasting faulty information in their neighborhood. We propose an asynchronous updating strategy for normal vehicles, based on filtering extreme values received from neighboring vehicles, to save them from being misguided by malicious vehicles. We show that there exist topological constraints on the network in terms of graph robustness under which the vehicles resiliently achieve coordinated movement. Numerical simulations are provided to evaluate the results. (c) 2022 European Control Association. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The paper presents a novel control strategy for autonomous vehicles, which can effectively handle the nonlinear effects and uncertainties of the controlled system. This solution is based on a new formulation of the ultra-local model-based control approach. This method can deal with the unknown dynamics and other uncertainties of the vehicle without any further measurement or complex modelling process. The control methods require a reduced-complexity nominal linear model of the system, and the unknown part is continuously estimated by the proposed ultra-local model. The proposed control-oriented vehicle modelling method leads to an increased performance level of vehicle motion. The effectiveness of the proposed method through a high-fidelity vehicle simulator (CarMaker) is illustrated. Moreover, the operation of the control through its implementation on a test vehicle of ThyssenKrupp is also demonstrated.

AB In order to improve the real-time and computational efficiency of autonomous vehicles' decision-making process, this paper draws on the decision-making behavior of human drivers with the motivation as the core and proposes a decision-making and planning method based on motivation and risk assessment. On the one hand, it analyzes and determines the motivations that cause the driving state to change for decision-making and planning. On the other hand, on the basis of the lateral trajectory prediction of surrounding vehicles, the longitudinal trajectory propensity prediction of different drivers is added to construct a risk assessment model that can reflect risk of the future time domain. Based on this, the motivation-based decision method is mapped into the risk assessment model, and a cost function is established to decouple the path and speed, so that the geometry and speed can be flexibly adjusted according to environmental risks. The simulation results show that the proposed method can effectively make driving behavior decisions and plan the trajectory in real time according to the current environment, which can improve the computational efficiency of the decision-making process and guarantee the safety at the same time.

DE Autonomous vehicle; Modular vehicle; Trajectory optimization; Platoon

AB Autonomous modular vehicle (AMV) technology allows for the flexible adjustment of vehicle length en-route per application needs, e.g., docking multiple short vehicles into one long vehicle or, conversely, splitting a long vehicle into multiple shorter ones. AMV docking is an extreme case of autonomous vehicle (AV) platooning in that AMVs are physically connected with zero gaps. This paper studies the trajectory planning for platoon split operations. A two-stage optimization problem is proposed to design AMV or platooned AV split operations trajectories. The first-stage objective minimizes the split operation time duration for operation efficiency. The second-stage objective minimizes the sum of squared acceleration to identify the smoothest trajectories for riding comfort and fuel efficiency.A feasible cone method is proposed by extending the time geography to reveal theoretical properties on the solution feasibility and analytically solve the first-stage problem. An exact solution approach based on quadratic programming and a heuristic solution approach based on Pontryagin's maximum principle are proposed to solve the second-stage problem. The original feasible region of the second-stage problem is greatly reduced through the feasible region analyses.Numerical experiments show that the heuristic solution approach can always solve the second stage problem instantaneously without any or with a slight loss of the operation optimality to satisfy real-time applications needs, whereas the exact solution approach with a state-of-the-art solver may take a much longer solution time that may impose challenges to certain real-time applications. It is also noted that the exact solution time is significantly reduced after accommodating the reduced feasible region. This is critical for applications requiring absolute optimality when the heuristic solution approach fails to reach the exact optimum. The comparison between the heuristic solution approach and a customized benchmark approach reveals the superiority of the heuristic solution approach in optimizing vehicle split trajectories. Results from sensitivity analyses on key parameters provide managerial insights into engineering implementations. The generalizability of the heuristic solution approach in solving another trajectory smoothing objective function considering both acceleration and jerk is proven by extensive numerical experiments. The generalizability of the heuristic solution approach in large-scale applications and when considering surrounding traffic is also discussed.

AB Heavy vehicles rolling on wet roads produce splash and spray clouds. These aerosols reduce the visibility of other drivers, contribute to a small, but quantifiable proportion of road traffic accidents and affect the operational capabilities of autonomous vehicles travelling near them. Even though knowing the physical properties of these aerosols is essential for testing and validating sensors for environment perception and recognition of autonomous vehicles, there is little information about them.
   In this work the physical characteristics of spray clouds produced by heavy vehicles rolling on wet asphalt were measured by optical methods. Time resolved droplet size, mass concentration, number density, light extinction and contrast attenuation parallel and perpendicular to the travelling direction of the vehicle were measured. Vehicle velocity, vehicle configuration and water depth were varied during the tests.
   Results show that the average droplet diameter ranges between 100 and 400 mu m with maximum diameters of almost 4 mm. Mass concentration gamuts between 0,2 and 0,7 kg/m(3) with peaks surpassing 1 kg/m(3) while number density spans between 20 and 40 cm(-3) and occasionally exceeds 100 cm(-3). Light extinction can reach levels as high as 0,2 m(-1) and contrast, evaluated from images, can reach values under 0,1.

AB In-water tests of automated launch and recovery (L&R) of a Hydroid REMUS 100 autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) from a station-keeping 16-ft wave adaptive modular vehicle unmanned surface vehicle (USV) have been conducted to determine the feasibility of developed concepts of operation. The USV is a catamaran with a custom-configured propulsion system that enables it to maintain position and heading on the surface. AUV launch is accomplished through lowering the AUV from the USV top tray to the water surface and releasing it. Recovery is initiated through requiring the AUV to navigate toward an acoustic homing beacon on a taut line suspended from the USV. The taut line serves as docking target and as a connecting link between the two vehicles during L&R. During these operations, the USV approximately keeps station on the water surface. Once the docking is complete, the USV moves forward, towing the AUV as it is extracted onboard the USV via a customized winch mechanism. It was found that for appropriate environmental conditions, L&R of the AUV from a station-keeping USV is an effective alternative to the mobile L&R method using the same vehicles, with the same launch and recovery system.

DT Article
DE Autonomous vehicles; autonomous shuttles; transportation technology;
   mode substitution; transportation demand management
AB The success of autonomous shuttle services and their ability to deliver on the myriad potential benefits of such services, depends on two issues: (1) willingness to use these services, and (2) the extent to which autonomous shuttle services can replace existing forms of transport, particularly car travel. This paper addresses these issues using survey data drawn from a pilot autonomous shuttle program. Descriptive statistics inform user preferences and expectations regarding autonomous shuttles. Logistic regression is used to specify correlates of willingness and frequency to ride the shuttle, and willingness to do so instead of using other forms of travel. Findings provide preliminary evidence for the existence of an enthusiastic early adopter population and also indicates that an autonomous shuttle service would likely be perceived as complementary to existing multi-modal systems in downtown areas. Additionally, regression results demonstrate that age, working downtown, and perceptions of bus service are associated with willingness to substitute the car for shuttle travel. Future research is needed once autonomous shuttle services become fully operational to understand if, in fact, early-adopters who are enthusiastic about autonomous vehicles continue to use autonomous shuttles once implemented, and to better understand the potential implications of autonomous transit systems in cities.

AB This article focuses on the design, test, and validation of a deep neural network (DNN)-based control scheme capable of predicting optimal motion commands for autonomous ground vehicles (AGVs) during the parking maneuver process. The proposed design utilizes a multilayer structure. In the first layer, a desensitized trajectory optimization method is iteratively performed to establish a set of time-optimal parking trajectories with the consideration of noise-perturbed initial configurations. Subsequently, by using the preplanned optimal parking trajectory data set, several DNNs are trained in order to learn the functional relationship between the system state-control actions in the second layer. To obtain further improvements regarding the DNN performances, a simple yet effective data aggregation approach is designed and applied. These trained DNNs are then utilized as the motion controllers to generate feedback actions in real time. Numerical results were executed to demonstrate the effectiveness and the real-time applicability of using the proposed control scheme to plan and steer the AGV parking maneuver. Experimental results were also provided to justify the algorithm performance in real-world implementations.

AB A network queuing approach is used to estimate performance measures for Autonomous Vehicle Storage and Retrieval (AVS/R) Systems using opportunistic interleaving. The model exploits the distribution of cycle types and random storage assumptions to estimate the proportion of single and dual command cycles in a system. Comparable in accuracy and computational efficiency to procedures based on standard queuing models, the proposed technique provides the additional advantage of flexibility for modeling the interfaces between a storage system and the overall material flow system in a facility. The procedure is demonstrated for a range of problem scenarios. (C) 2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Developing methods for autonomous landing of an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) on a mobile platform has been an active area of research over the past decade, as it offers an attractive solution for cases where rapid deployment and recovery of a fleet of UAVs, continuous flight tasks, extended operational ranges, and mobile recharging stations are desired. In this work, we present a new autonomous landing method that can be implemented on micro UAVs that require high-bandwidth feedback control loops for safe landing under various uncertainties and wind disturbances. We present our system architecture, including dynamic modeling of the UAV with a gimbaled camera, implementation of a Kalman filter for optimal localization of the mobile platform, and development of model predictive control (MPC), for guidance of UAVs. We demonstrate autonomous landing with an error of less than 37 cm from the center of a mobile platform traveling at a speed of up to 12 m/s under the condition of noisy measurements and wind disturbances.

AB In this paper, we consider the need for deployment in the long-distance safe longitudinal formation control task when the connected autonomous vehicle (CAV) platoon is subjected to malicious cyber attacks. To ensure the safe, orderly, stable and efficient driving performance of the vehicle platoon, a novel distributed data-driven control (DDDC) approach for a homogeneous connected autonomous vehicle platoon under false data injection (FDI) attacks is investigated. First, an FDI attacks detection and compensation mechanism is designed to detect whether the received position signals are under attack or not and compensate the attacked position signals. Then, a novel DDDC approach for the vehicle platoon longitudinal formation control is developed by using the compensation data from the designed attack compensation mechanism and a dynamic linearization data model. Theoretical analysis verifies that the proposed DDDC method can ensure the internal stability (IS) and string stability (SS) of the homogeneous platoon subjected to FDI attacks. Finally, the effectiveness and practicality of the proposed DDDC approach are validated through a group of comparative simulations subjected to random FDI attacks of equal frequency and magnitude.

AB Mobile pulse light detection and ranging (LIDAR) is an essential component of autonomous vehicles. The obstacle detection function of autonomous vehicles requires very low failure rates. With an increasing number of autonomous vehicles equipped with LIDAR sensors for use in the detection and avoidance of obstacles and for safe navigation through the environment, the probability of mutual interference becomes an important issue. The reception of foreign laser pulses can lead to problems such as ghost targets or a reduced signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). In this paper, we presented the probability that any LIDAR sensor would interfere mutually by considering spatial and temporal overlaps. We presented some typical mutual interference scenarios in real-world vehicle applications, as well as an analysis of the interference mechanism. We proposed a new multi-plane LIDAR sensor which used coded pulse streams encoded by carrier-hopping prime code (CHPC) technology to measure surrounding perimeters without mutual interference. These encoded pulses utilized a random azimuth identification and checksum with random spreading code. We modeled the entirety of the LIDAR sensor operation in Synopsys OptSim and represented the alien pulse elimination functionality obtained via modeling and simulation.

AB Autonomous driving is becoming a pivotal technology that can realize intelligent transportation and revolutionize the future of mobility. Various types of sensors, including perception sensors and localization sensors, are essential for high-level autonomous and intelligent vehicles (AIV). In this paper, the characteristics of different sensors are compared, and the application characteristics and requirements of AIV are analyzed in depth. These analyses indicate that: GNSS, as the unique localization sensor that can obtain an absolute position, can not only provide all-weather position and time information for internal multi-sensor fusion but also act as a standard spatiotemporal reference for all autonomous systems; Furthermore, AIVs aim to provide safety for a mass user base ranging from tens to hundreds of millions; for this, AIVs require a global wide-area and instantaneous precise positioning service with location privacy protection. Based on a "geometry-bound" description of road grade and vehicle size, it has been found that GNSS requirements in autonomous vehicles include decimeter-level positioning with the assurance of high integrity. Combined with high-integrity GNSS implementation in the civil aviation field, GNSS different technology routes, and commercial solutions, a state space representation (SSR)-based GNSS high-precision augmentation positioning solution for AIV is summarized and introduced. The solution can achieve instantaneous, precise positioning with high integrity in a wide area by utilizing passive positioning mode with location privacy protection. In addition, the research progress on key technologies in the solution and existing challenges is investigated in detail by reviewing a series of publications.

TI Pillar-Based Cooperative Perception from Point Clouds for 6G-Enabled
   Cooperative Autonomous Vehicles
SO WIRELESS COMMUNICATIONS & MOBILE COMPUTING
LA English
DT Article
AB 3D object detection is a significant aspect of the perception module in autonomous driving; however, with current technology, data sharing between vehicles and cloud servers for cooperative 3D object detection under the strict latency requirement is limited by the communication bandwidth. The sixth-generation (6G) networks have accelerated the transmission rate of the sensor data significantly with extreme low-latency and high-speed data transmission. However, which sensor data format and when to transmit it are still challenging. To address these issues, this study proposes a cooperative perception framework combined with a pillar-based encoder and Octomap-based compression at edges for connected autonomous vehicles to reduce the amount of missing detection in blind spots and further distances. This approach satisfies the constraints on the accuracy of the task perception and provides drivers or autonomous vehicles with sufficient reaction time by applying fixed encoders to learn a representation of point clouds (LiDAR sensor data). Extensive experiment results show that the proposed approach outperforms the previous cooperative perception schemes running at 30 Hz, and the accuracy of the object bounding box results in further distances (greater than 12 m). Furthermore, this approach achieves a lower total delay for the procession of the fusion data and the transmission of the cooperative perception message. To the best of our knowledge, this study is the first to introduce a pillar-based encoder and Octomap-based compression framework for cooperative perception between vehicles and edges in connected autonomous driving.

AB With the rapid development of the Internet of Things (IoT) and artificial intelligence, autonomous vehicles have received much attention in recent years. Safe driving is one of the essential concerns of self-driving cars. The main problem in providing better safe driving requires an efficient inference system for real-time task management and autonomous control. Due to limited battery life and computing power, reducing execution time and resource consumption can be a daunting process. This paper addressed these challenges and developed an intelligent task management system for IoT-based autonomous vehicles. For each task processing, a supervised resource predictor is invoked for optimal hardware cluster selection. Tasks are executed based on the earliest hyper period first (EHF) scheduler to achieve optimal task error rate and schedule length performance. The single-layer feedforward neural network (SLFN) and lightweight learning approaches are designed to distribute each task to the appropriate processor based on their emergency and CPU utilization. We developed this intelligent task management module in python and experimentally tested it on multicore SoCs (Odroid Xu4 and NVIDIA Jetson embedded platforms). Connected Autonomous Vehicles (CAV) and Internet of Medical Things (IoMT) benchmarks are used for training and testing purposes. The proposed modules are validated by observing the task miss rate, resource utilization, and energy consumption metrics compared with state-of-art heuristics. SLFN-EHF task scheduler achieved better results in an average of 98% accuracy, and in an average of 20-27% reduced in execution time and 32-45% in task miss rate metric than conventional methods.

AB Autonomous Vehicle has been transforming intelligent transportation systems. As telecom-munication technology improves, autonomous vehicles are getting connected to each other and to infrastructures, forming Connected and Autonomous Vehicles (CAVs). CAVs will help humans achieve safe, efficient, and autonomous transportation systems. However, CAVs will face significant security challenges because many of their components are vulnerable to attacks, and a successful attack on a CAV may have significant impacts on other CAVs and infrastructures due to their interconnectivity. In this paper, we conduct a survey on 189 papers from 2000 to 2020 to understand state-of-the-art CAV attacks and defense tech-niques. Of those 189 papers, 131 were directly concerned with attack models or defense strategies for CAVs. This survey first presents a comprehensive overview of security attacks and their corresponding countermeasures on CAVs. We then discuss the details of attack models based on the targeted CAV components of attacks, access requirements, and attack motives. Finally, we identify some current research challenges and trends from the per-spectives of both academic research and industrial development. Based on our studies of academic literature and industrial publications, we have not found any strong connection between academic research and industry's implementation of CAV-related security issues. While efforts from CAV manufacturers to secure CAVs have been reported, there is no evi-dence to show that CAVs on the market can defend against some novel attack models that the research community has recently found. This survey may give researchers and engi-neers a better understanding of the current status and trend of CAV security for CAV's future improvement. (c) 2021 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Road intersections represent the primary bottleneck in transportation systems and connected autonomous vehicles (CAVs) have the potential to aleviate the problem through communication and coordination. As such, this work proposes a novel framework where, accounting for CAVs' location uncertainty, an intersection manager (IM) controls CAVs approaching a road crossing so as to maximize the number of admitted vehicles, while ensuring a guaranteed (tunable) level of safety. To fully exploit the communication links among the IM and the CAVs, several features are included in the proposed framework: (i) periodic re-optimizations of the CAVs' applied controls; (ii) periodic re-ordering of the intersection crossing sequence; and (iii) event-based control and ordering optimizations to achieve the best possible trade-off between complexity and performance. The proposed framework is able to improve both the number of admitted CAVs to the intersection and the CAVs' average speeds as compared to relevant state-of-the-art solutions. Importantly, when event-triggering is applied, most of the benefits introduced by periodic optimizations are retained, while at the same time the number of re-optimizations required are reduced by 47.6% (34.18%) during average (heavy) traffic conditions.

AB In this article, we propose a macroscopic model for studying routing on networks shared between human-driven and autonomous vehicles that captures the effects of autonomous vehicles forming platoons. We use this to study inefficiency due to selfish routing and bound the price of anarchy (PoA), the maximum ratio between total delay experienced by selfish users and the minimum possible total delay. To do so, we establish two road capacity models, each corresponding to an assumption regarding the platooning capabilities of autonomous vehicles. Using these, we develop a class of road delay functions, parameterized by the road capacity, that are polynomial with respect to vehicle flow. We then bound the PoA and the bicriteria, another measure of the inefficiency due to selfish routing, for general networks with multiple source-destination pairs. We find these bounds depend on: the degree of the polynomial in the road delay function; and the degree of asymmetry, the difference in how human-driven and autonomous traffic affect road delay. We demonstrate that these bounds recover the classical bounds when no asymmetry exists. We show the bounds are tight in certain cases and that the PoA bound is order optimal with respect to the degree of asymmetry.

AB With the emergence of connected and automated technologies, Connected Autonomous Vehicles (CAVs) are able to communicate and interact with other vehicles and signal controllers. Vehicle to Vehicle (V2V) and Vehicle to Infrastructure (V2I) communications open up an opportunity to improve routing and signal timing efficiency with additional information from CAVs, such as prior travel time and signal green time. Most of the existing research on routing and signal timing for Human Driven Vehicles (HDVs) has to face the fact that human drivers only have partial knowledge about travel costs and traffic status on the road network, which typically reduces the system efficiency. In this paper, the impacts of additional information from CAVs on routing and signal timing efficiency in terms of total travel time have been investigated. An Optimal Routing and Signal Timing (ORST) control strategy for CAVs has been proposed and compared with four existing routing and signal timing strategies where drivers have different levels of information. The results of the simulation demonstrate that with additional information from CAVs, ORST can reduce about 49% of the total travel time compared with Stochastic User Equilibrium (SUE) and about 10% of the total travel time compared with User Equilibrium (UE).

AB Scene understanding plays a crucial role in autonomous driving by utilizing sensory data for contextual information extraction and decision making. Beyond modeling advances, the enabler for vehicles to become aware of their surroundings is the availability of visual sensory data, which expand the vehicular perception and realizes vehicular contextual awareness in real-world environments. Research directions for scene understanding pursued by related studies include person/vehicle detection and segmentation, their transition analysis, lane change, and turns detection, among many others Unfortunately, these tasks seem insufficient to completely develop fully-autonomous vehicles i.e. achieving level-5 autonomy, travelling just like human-controlled cars. This latter statement is among the conclusions drawn from this review paper: scene understanding for autonomous driving cars using vision sensors still requires significant improvements. With this motivation, this survey defines, analyzes, and reviews the current achievements of the scene understanding research area that mostly rely on computationally complex deep learning models. Furthermore, it covers the generic scene understanding pipeline, investigates the performance reported by the state-of-the-art, informs about the time complexity analysis of avant garde modeling choices, and highlights major triumphs and noted limitations encountered by current research efforts. The survey also includes a comprehensive discussion on the available datasets, and the challenges that, even if lately confronted by researchers, still remain open to date. Finally, our work outlines future research directions to welcome researchers and practitioners to this exciting domain.

AB Edge Computing and Network Function Virtualization (NFV) concepts can improve network processing and multi-resources allocation when intelligent optimization algorithms are deployed. Multiservice offloading and allocation approaches pose interesting challenges in the current and next-generation vehicle networks. The state-of-the-art optimization approaches still formulate exact algorithms, and tune approximation methods to get sufficient solutions. These approaches are data-centric that aim to use heterogeneous data inputs to find the near optimal solutions. In the context of connected and autonomous vehicles (CAVs), these techniques show an exponential computational time and deal only with small and medium scale networks. Therefore, we are motivated by using recent Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) techniques to learn the behavior of exact optimization algorithms while enhancing the Quality of Service (QoS) of network operators and satisfying the requirements of the next-generation Autonomous Vehicles (AVs). DRL algorithms can improve AVs service offloading and optimize edge resources. An Optimal Virtual Edge Autopilot Placement (OVEAP) algorithm is proposed using Integer Linear Programming (ILP). Moreover, an autopilot placement protocol is presented to support the algorithm. Optimal allocation and Virtual Network Function (VNF) placement and chaining of the autopilot, based on several new constraints such as computing and networking loads, network edge infrastructure, and placement cost, are designed. Further, a DRL approach is formulated to deal with dense Internet of Autonomous Vehicle (IoAV) networks. Extensive simulations and evaluations are carried out. Results show that the proposed allocation strategies outperform the state-of-the-art solutions and give better performance in terms of Total Edge Servers Utilization, Total Edge Servers Allocation Time, and Successfully Allocated autopilots.

AB The current state of the art in the planning and coordination of autonomous vehicles is based upon the presence of speed lanes. In a traffic scenario where there is a large diversity between vehicles the removal of speed lanes can generate a significantly higher traffic bandwidth. Vehicle navigation in such unorganized traffic is considered. An evolutionary based trajectory planning technique has the advantages of making driving efficient and safe, however it also has to surpass the hurdle of computational cost. In this paper, we propose a real time genetic algorithm with Bezier curves for trajectory planning. The main contribution is the integration of vehicle following and overtaking behaviour for general traffic as heuristics for the coordination between vehicles. The resultant coordination strategy is fast and near-optimal. As the vehicles move, uncertainties may arise which are constantly adapted to, and may even lead to either the cancellation of an overtaking procedure or the initiation of one. Higher level planning is performed by Dijkstra's algorithm which indicates the route to be followed by the vehicle in a road network. Replanning is carried out when a road blockage or obstacle is detected. Experimental results confirm the success of the algorithm subject to optimal high and low-level planning, re-planning and overtaking. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB This study proposes an autonomous obstacle avoidance system not only by braking but also by steering, as one of the active safety technologies to prevent traffic accidents. The proposed system prevents the vehicle from colliding with a moving obstacle like a pedestrian jumping out from the roadside. In the proposed system, to avoid the predicted colliding position based on constant-velocity obstacle motion assumption, the avoidance trajectory is derived as connected two identical arcs. The system then controls the vehicle autonomously by the combined control of the braking and steering systems. In this paper, the proposed system is examined by real car experiments and its effectiveness is shown from the results of the experiments.

AB Approximation strategies for transaction waiting times are proposed for use in Autonomous Vehicle Storage and Retrieval Systems (AVS/RSs) with non-Poisson arrival rates and non-exponential service times. The proposed modelling tools dynamically adjust approximations based on the variance of the transaction inter-arrival times observed in a system. Simulation-based validation studies indicate that this strategy can reduce the magnitude of errors in estimated transaction waiting times by approximately 80% relative to static approximations. The design conceptualisation applications of the proposed technique are demonstrated over a series of realistically sized demonstration problems.

DE autonomous maritime vehicles; protocol; protocol data unit
AB The utilization of autonomous maritime vehicles is becoming widespread in operations that are deemed too hazardous for humans to be directly involved in them. One of the ways to increase the productivity of the tools used during missions is the deployment of several vehicles with the same objective regarding data collection and transfer, both for the benefit of human staff and policy makers. However, the interchange of data in such an environment poses major challenges, such as a low bandwidth and the unreliability of the environment where transmissions take place. Furthermore, the relevant information that must be sent, as well as the exact size that will allow understanding it, is usually not clearly established, as standardization works are scarce in this domain. Under these conditions, establishing a way to interchange information at the data level among autonomous maritime vehicles becomes of critical importance since the needed information, along with the size of the transferred data, will have to be defined. This manuscript puts forward the Maritime Data Transfer Protocol, (MDTP) a way to interchange standardized pieces of information at the data level for maritime autonomous maritime vehicles, as well as the procedures that are required for information interchange.

AB Interaction-aware autonomous driving (IAAD) is a rapidly growing field of research that focuses on the development of autonomous vehicles (AVs) that are capable of interacting safely and efficiently with human road users. This is a challenging task, as it requires the AV to be able to understand and predict the behaviour of human road users. In this literature review, the current state of IAAD research is surveyed. Commencing with an examination of terminology, attention is drawn to challenges and existing models employed for modeling the behaviour of drivers and pedestrians. Next, a comprehensive review is conducted on various techniques proposed for interaction modeling, encompassing cognitive methods, machine-learning approaches, and game-theoretic methods. The conclusion is reached through a discussion of potential advantages and risks associated with IAAD, along with the illumination of pivotal research inquiries necessitating future exploration.

   unmanned ground vehicle (UGV); autonomous vehicles (AVs)
AB Autonomous vehicles (AVs) are expected to be on public roads in the near future, but some critical aspects of this reality are yet to be resolved. One of these aspects is the lack of a sufficient safety-performance-verification technique. The existing tools of functional-safety engineering do not provide a comprehensive solution for the verification of artificial intelligence and machine learning. For the verification of this type of algorithms, it has become widely accepted in the recent years that simulation tests should be used. Nevertheless, to the best of our knowledge, no detailed method for how these simulation tests should be performed has yet been suggested. To start tackling this gap, this paper presents a verification methodology based on the statistical testing of AVs' safety-related functionality in simulated scenarios. Also, presented here is a test-case implementation of the methodology on a full-scale autonomous unmanned ground vehicle (UGV). In this example, the functionality of safe autonomous off-road navigation is verified. It is shown that the statistical performance data that are gathered using simulation can be used to accurately predict the overall safety performance of UGVs in real life. Our intention is that this paper will provide a starting point for the further discussion on the exact way simulation tests shall be used for the safety verification of AVs.

AB In current research of autonomous vehicle path tracking, most contributions focus on tracking accuracy during complex driving condition. However, the vehicle might fall into unstable dangerous condition when the road curvature is big or with high speed. A path tracking control framework is proposed in this paper, which considers path tracking accuracy and vehicle stability. In general, the control framework consists of three main components: vehicle stability judging controller, path tracking controller, and torque distributor. Firstly, the stability of the current vehicle can be evaluated by the stability judgment controller according to the phase plane of the sideslip angle. Then, the proportion of vehicle stability in the control objective is adjusted according to the current vehicle stability. To improve the path tracking accuracy, the path tracking is composed of a combined controller using MPC algorithm, which controls the front wheel angle and direct yaw moment at the same time. After that, the torque distributor is developed to distribute the desired yaw moment into four executive wheels, which synthesizes the results of power performance distribution and stability distribution. Finally, the effectiveness of the proposed control framework is verified by the Matlab-CarSim co-simulation experiment and the hardware-in-the-loop experiment based on LabVIEW-RT. The results show that the proposed controller has better tracking accuracy and stability than the general MPC controller.

AB Self-driving cars and other vehicles are being increasingly demonstrated, released, and deployed on roads. Yet only a handful of special-case vehicles have obtained a permit to go fully driverless, and our passenger cars still require drivers at the steering wheel to correct the car if something goes wrong. Safety drivers, which operate autonomous vehicles in testing phases, upon occasions were unable to correct the faulty behavior of their vehicles, inducing accidents and, unfortunately, casualties. This article proposes a method to analyze the reliability of autonomous vehicles applying the classical reliability theory and software reliability growth models (SRGMs). This method is then applied to real-world data to get some predictions on what is really needed to safely remove the driver and go fully driverless.

ID PATH; ROBOT; FIELD
AB This paper introduces an efficient motion planning method for on-road driving of the autonomous vehicles, which is based on the rapidly exploring random tree (RRT) algorithm. RRT is an incremental sampling-based algorithm and is widely used to solve the planning problem of mobile robots. However, due to the meandering path, the inaccurate terminal state, and the slow exploration, it is often inefficient in many applications such as autonomous vehicles. To address these issues and considering the realistic context of on-road autonomous driving, we propose a fast RRT algorithm that introduces a rule-template set based on the traffic scenes and an aggressive extension strategy of search tree. Both improvements lead to a faster and more accurate RRT toward the goal state compared with the basic RRT algorithm. Meanwhile, a model-based prediction postprocess approach is adopted, by which the generated trajectory can be further smoothed and a feasible control sequence for the vehicle would be obtained. Furthermore, in the environments with dynamic obstacles, an integrated approach of the fast RRT algorithm and the configuration-time space can be used to improve the quality of the planned trajectory and the replanning. A large number of experimental results illustrate that our method is fast and efficient in solving planning queries of on-road autonomous driving and demonstrate its superior performances over previous approaches.

AB Team Oshkosh, composed of Oshkosh Corporation, Teledyne Scientific and Imaging Company, VisLab of the University of Parma, Ibeo Automotive Sensor GmbH, and Auburn University, participated in the DARPA Urban Challenge and was one of the 11 teams selected to compete in the final event. Through development, testing, and participation in the official events, we experimented and demonstrated autonomous truck operations in (controlled) urban streets of California, Wisconsin, and Michigan under various climate and traffic conditions. In these experiments TerraMax (TM), a modified medium tactical vehicle replacement (MTVR) truck by Oshkosh Corporation, negotiated urban roads, intersections, and parking lots and interacted with manned and unmanned traffic while observing traffic rules. We accumulated valuable experience and lessons on autonomous truck operations in urban environments, particularly in the aspects of vehicle control, perception, mission planning, and autonomous behaviors, which will have an impact on the further development of large-footprint autonomous ground vehicles for the military.
   In this article, we describe the vehicle, the overall system architecture, the sensors and sensor processing, the mission planning system, and the autonomous behavioral controls implemented on TerraMax. We discuss the performance of some notable autonomous behaviors of TerraMax and our experience in implementing these behaviors and present results of the Urban Challenge National Qualification Event tests and the Urban Challenge Final Event. We conclude with a discussion of lessons learned from all of the above experience in working with a large robotic truck. (c) 2008 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

AB Vehicle-to-Grid (V2G) has potential for providing the distributed spinning reserve to the power system. We proposed an autonomous V2G control scheme managing the vehicle user's convenience, the battery condition during the idle time, and the contribution to the power system, simultaneously. V2G power is controlled corresponding to the frequency deviation detected at the plug-in terminal and the desirable battery State-of-Charge for the plug-out. In this paper, the proposed control scheme is implemented to an electric vehicle and charging system. Performances of the interface, communication and control structure, and system efficiency and time response are verified by using the test system coordinating an electric vehicle battery test bed with a DC charging port, a controllable bi-directional power conditioner, and an integrated interface controller.

ID SAFETY; MODEL; PROBABILITY; ASSOCIATION; BEHAVIORS; FRAMEWORK
AB Visibility can be identified as one of the critical determinants for the safety performance of autonomous vehicles (AVs) on unsignalized mid-block crosswalks (UMC), which may be significantly influenced by build-up environment and surrounding vehicles. This study investigates the safety performance when AVs interact with pedestrians approaching from far-side sidewalks to UMCs considering the visual occlusion of opposing vehicles. A mathematical model is proposed for judging the visibilities of objects from observers' location under the impact of visual obstacles and is embedded into an agent-based pedestrian-vehicle interaction framework. Two yielding decision modules is assumed for AVs: The normal decision module implements the pedestrian priority rule simply based on the current detectable information, whereas the memory aid decision module extends AVs' detection abilities by incorporating the memory data. Through simulation experiments, it is found that the percentages of short post encroachment time (%SPET) between AVs and far-side pedestrians reach peaks when the pedestrian flow rate is 300-400 ped/h. When opposing vehicles are in stationary queue conditions, %SPETs are only sensitive to the net distance between the last opposing vehicles in the queue and crosswalks (D-queue). As the D-queue decreases to lower than 15 m, %SPETs start to increase drastically. However, when opposing vehicles are in free flow conditions, %SPETs are influenced by multiple factors such as pedestrians' crossing decisions, sizes and flow rates of opposing vehicles. Furthermore, only when opposing vehicles are in free flow conditions, memory aid AVs can significantly eliminate the impacts of opposite vehicles. Finally, several countermeasures are developed to enhance the visibility and safety at UMCs based on the findings of this study.

Dorfler, where we work with the cartesian composition and we define the internal links among multiautomata by means of the internal links' matrix. We used the obtained product ofn-ary multi-automata as a system that models and controls certain traffic situations (lane shifting) for autonomous vehicles.

DE Vehicle to vehicle cooperation; cooperative autonomous vehicles;
   drop-off; the arrival time
AB Autonomous vehicles (AVs) will revolutionise city design, and radically affect how people move. The scenario of AVs taking users to their destinations and then conveniently dropping them off is an obvious advantage, reducing the need for drivers to waste time car parking. However, it is not so clear how AVs need to behave when dropping off passengers at busy drop-off areas, since there are a number of possible options, from simply waiting for a spot at the drop off area, circulating till a slot is available at a drop-off area to actually parking further, depending on the situation at the drop-off area and passenger preferences. In this paper, we propose and investigate a cooperative drop-off (CDO) approach. CDO can handle the unpredictable circumstances of a drop-off situation using vehicle cooperation and makes rational collective decisions with the goal of minimizing the arrival time of passengers. Comprehensive simulation of a range of aspects is used to assess and examine different factors affecting the CDO approach, and it is shown to provide reasonable performance under different conditions.

AB In the context of shared connected autonomous vehicles (SCAVs), the relocation of idle vehicles is a crucial issue for the operation of autonomous mobility-on-demand (AMoD) services. Unlike traditional human-chauffeured taxis, AMoD operations are fully controllable by central systems and not affected by unpredictable human driver behavior. To address the spatial-temporal imbalance between supply and demand and optimize the level of service while minimizing agency costs, we propose a real-time AMoD relocation model. However, vehicle-specific control every second for large fleet sizes may cause computational burdens for the control center. To overcome this, we present a bi-level framework that decomposes the original system-level problem into an inter-zonal relocation problem for the entire service area and an intra-zonal relocation problem for each zone. This reduces the decision space to periodic inter- and intra-zonal relocation of idle vehicles. Using real-world taxi operation data from Daejeon City, Korea, we demonstrate the proposed method via agent-based simulations, assuming that SCAVs replace existing taxis. The results show that the method can significantly reduce the total generalized cost for both users and the agency. Through a sensitivity analysis, we investigate how the performance varies depending on the zone size, inter- and intra-zonal relocation interval, and demand uncertainty and discuss the observed tradeoff. The intended contribution is twofold: first, we propose a novel computationally feasible method that can efficiently operate AMoD systems in real time; second, we provide a closed-form analytical formulation that can help decision-makers explicitly understand the relationship between the cost components and the decision factors.

AB Vehicular Ad hoc NETworks (VANET) is emerging as a highly promising technology, which aims to provide road safety, environment protection and personal-oriented services. The vehicle ad hoc wireless communications form an indispensable part of truly ubiquitous communications networking. VANET is formed by spontaneously moving autonomous vehicles with the self-organization and self-management capability. In this paper, we focus on the decentralized coordination of multiple unmanned vehicles such that they can freely move and adaptively cooperate in a complex environment. During this procedure, flocking is one of the key operations and requirements. Here, flocking refers to the formation and maintenance of a desired pattern by a group of mobile vehicles without collision during movement. We propose a resilient and scalable flocking scheme for a group of vehicles, which follows the leader-followers moving pattern. In the absence of obstacles, a collision avoidance algorithm is presented to maintain a desired distance among vehicles. This will ensure information completeness and is significant in certain mission critical situations without collision between a unmanned vehicle and its neighboring vehicles. In the presence of obstacles in an environment, this algorithm is able to avoid collision between a vehicle and its neighbor (either a neighboring vehicle or a neighboring obstacle). Theoretical proof has been presented to demonstrate the effectiveness and correctness of the algorithm to guarantee collision-free. In addition, with increasing number of vehicles, the performance of the proposed flocking scheme performs without increasing the processing overhead, which demonstrates the desirable scalability.

AB Autonomous vehicles are drawing significant attention from governments, manufacturers and consumers. Experts predict them to be the primary means of transportation by the middle of this century. Recent literature shows that vehicle automation has the potential to alter traffic patterns, vehicle ownership, and land use, which may affect fuel consumption from the transportation sector. In this paper, we developed a data-rich analytical framework to quantify system-wide fuel impacts of automation in the United States by integrating (1) a dynamic vehicle sales, stock, and usage model, (2) an historical transportation network-level vehicle miles traveled (VMT)/vehicle activity database, and (3) estimates of automation's impacts on fuel efficiency and travel demand. The vehicle model considers dynamics in vehicle fleet turnover and fuel efficiency improvements of conventional and advanced vehicle fleet. The network activity database contains VMT, free-flow speeds, and historical speeds of road links that can help us accurately identify fuel-savings opportunities of automation. Based on the model setup and assumptions, we found that the impacts of automation on fuel consumption are quite wide-ranging with the potential to reduce fuel consumption by 45% in our "Optimistic" case or increase it by 30% in our "Pessimistic" case. Second, implementing automation on urban roads could potentially result in larger fuel savings compared with highway automation because of the driving features of urban roads. Through scenario analysis, we showed that the proposed framework can be used for refined assessments as better data on vehicle-level fuel efficiency and travel demand impacts of automation become available.

ID NAVIGATION
AB Autonomous ground vehicle navigation requires the integration of many technologies such as path planning, position and orientation sensing, vehicle control, and obstacle avoidance. The work presented here focuses on the control of a nonholonomic ground vehicle as it tracks a given path. A new path tracking technique called "vector pursuit" is presented. This new technique is based on the theory of screws, which was developed by Sir Robert Ball in 1900. It generates a desired vehicle turning radius based on the vehicle's current position and orientation relative to the position of a point ahead on the planned path and the desired orientation along the path at that point. The vector pursuit algorithm is compared to other geometrical approaches, and it is shown to be more robust, resulting in more accurate path tracking. (C) 2004 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

AB During manual driving, most human drivers often use information about the speed and position of the preceding and following vehicles in order to adjust the position and speed of their vehicles. The purpose of this paper is to design an autonomous intelligent cruise control (AICC) which mimics this human driving behavior, The proposed AICC law uses relative speed and spacing information from the preceding and following vehicles in order to choose the proper control action for smooth vehicle following and for maintaining a desired intervehicle spacing specified by the driver. The vehicle stability and platoon stability (in the case of multiple vehicles) in both directions (backward and forward) are guaranteed by the proposed AICC law. Furthermore, platoon stability is guaranteed for a speed-dependent desired spacing (time headway approach) as well as for a constant desired spacing at all speeds.

AB Research on intelligent transport systems (ITSs) is steadily leading to safer and more comfortable control for vehicles. Systems that permit longitudinal control have already been implemented in commercial vehicles, acting on throttle and brake. Nevertheless, lateral control applications are less common in the market. Since a too-sudden turn of the steering wheel can cause an accident in a few seconds, good speed and position control of the steering wheel is essential. We present here a new cascade control architecture based on fuzzy logic controllers that emulate a human driver's behavior. The control architecture was tested on a real vehicle at different vehicle speeds. The results showed the use of a straightforward and intuitive fuzzy controller to give good performance.

DT Article
DE autonomous driving; vehicle turning control; VANET; model predictive

AB Currently the research and development of autonomous driving vehicles (ADVs) mainly consider the situation whereby manual driving vehicles and ADVs run simultaneously on lanes. In order to acquire the information of the vehicle itself and the environment necessary for decision-making and controlling, the ADVs that are under development now are normally equipped with a lot of sensing units, for example, high precision global positioning systems, various types of radar, and video processing systems. Obviously, the current advanced driver assistance systems (ADAS) or ADVs still have some problems concerning high reliability of driving safety, as well as the vehicle's cost and price. It is certain, however, that in the future there will be some roads, areas or cities where all the vehicles are ADVs, i.e., without any human driving vehicles in traffic. For such scenarios, the methods of environment sensing, traffic instruction indicating, and vehicle controlling should be different from that of the situation mentioned above if the reliability of driving safety and the production cost expectation is to be improved significantly. With the anticipation that a more sophisticated vehicle ad hoc network (VANET) should be an essential transportation infrastructure for future ADV scenarios, the problem of vehicle turning control based on vehicle to everything (V2X) communication at road intersections is studied. The turning control at intersections mainly deals with three basic issues, i.e., target lane selection, trajectory planning and calculation, and vehicle controlling and tracking. In this paper, control strategy, model and algorithms are proposed for the three basic problems. A model predictive control (MPC) paradigm is used as the vehicle upper layer controller. Simulation is conducted on the CarSim-Simulink platform with typical intersection scenes.

AB Self-driving, 'autonomous' vehicles (AVs) promise to change the world in profound ways. The suggested benefits include safety, efficiency and accessibility. However, researchers and others have been quick to raise questions about wider implications for mobility and urban environments and responsible development of the technology. In a discussion that has been dominated by science, engineering and narrow questions of ethics, there is a need to draw attention to the old questions of politics: Who wins? Who loses? Who decides? Who pays? AVs will not be defined by their supposed autonomy; they will be defined by a set of social relationships. The special collection that this paper accompanies brings together research from a range of disciplines to explore the politics of autonomous vehicles and provide a foundation for ongoing investigation.

AB This paper investigates the depth control problem for autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) by developing a novel fuzzy memorized sampled-data controller. In particular, the mixed H-infinity and passive performance index is considered for disturbances in more practical underwater environments. By means of the Lyapunov-Krasovskii functional method, sufficient criteria are established such that the desired depth can be stabilized while satisfying the prescribed mixed H-infinity and passive performance. Then, the desired fuzzy memorized controller is designed in terms of linear matrix inequalities (LMIs). Finally, an illustrative example is provided for demonstrating the feasibility and effectiveness of our derived results.

AB The support for reliable communication in the increasingly large fleets of autonomous vehicles is one of the important challenges for emerging 5G systems. The presence of heterogeneous data streams of different priority between the connected vehicles (coordinated autonomous driving, platooning, passenger entertainment services, etc.) calls for new methods to estimate the performance characteristics of these systems. In this article, a novel mathematical framework is proposed to model the process of dynamic radio resource (re-)allocation across multiple competing data streams in autonomous vehicular fleets equipped with 5G cellular capabilities. The developed framework is subsequently applied to: (i) study the coexistence of multiple traffic types having different service requirements and (ii) quantify the impact of session prioritization schemes. Our study reveals that the prioritization scheme initially offloading high-rate entertainment sessions, named ESpreempt, in most of the setups achieves a 5-30% performance gain in comparison with the scheme initially offloading low-rate platooning sessions, named PSpreempt. It is also shown that higher variations in the traffic load of autonomous driving sessions have a distinctly negative impact on system-level performance. The outlined framework can be applied in a wide range of 5G vehicular scenarios, as well as extended to capture other categories of data streams in future wireless networks.

AB LiDAR-based Multiple Object Detection and Tracking (MODT) is one of the essential tasks in autonomous driving. Since MODT is directly related to the safety of an autonomous vehicle, it is critical to provide reliable information about the surrounding objects. For that reason, we propose a semantic point cloud-based adaptive MODT system for autonomous driving. Semantic point clouds emerge with advances in deep learning-based Point Cloud Semantic Segmentation (PCSS), which assigns semantic information to each point in the point cloud of LiDAR. This semantic information provides several advantages to the MODT system. First, any point corresponding to any static object can be filtered. Because the class information assigned to each point can be directly utilized, filtering is possible without any modeling. Second, the class information of an object can be inferred without any special classification process because the class information is provided from the semantic point cloud. Finally, the clustering and tracking module can consider unique dimensional and dynamic characteristics based on class information. We utilize the Carla simulator and KITTI dataset to verify our method by comparing several existing algorithms. In conclusion, the accuracy of the proposed algorithm is improved by about 176% on average compared to the existing algorithm.

AB Featured Application: This article can be applied to the simulations of vehicles with different degrees of automation in different city scenarios.
   Intelligent vehicles gradually enter the vehicular fleet with advanced driver-assistance technologies. Their impact on traffic should, therefore, be considered by transportation decision-makers. This paper examines the effect of vehicles with different levels of automation on traffic flow, such as non-assisted vehicles, vehicles with driver assistance systems, and fully autonomous vehicles. The accuracy of the examined traffic scenario is also an important factor in microscopic traffic simulation. In this paper, the central part of the city of Duisburg, Duisburg's inner ring, is chosen for the traffic scenario. Through the cooperation with local government, official data of Origin/Destination matrices, induction loops, and traffic light plans are provided for this work. Thus, traffic demand from Origin/Destination matrices and induction loops are generated and compared, respectively. Finally, vehicles with different levels of automation are simulated in the Duisburg inner ring scenario.

AB This paper proposes cloudlet-based intelligent agents for energy crowdsourcing from autonomous electric vehicles (AEVs). Existing energy crowdsourcing mechanisms focus on load shedding and cost savings, but lack incentive models for strategically behaving agents. In the proposed model, crowdsourcing agents residing on the edge network communicate with AEVs to stimulate them to participate in providing energy to the grid during peak time periods. The focus of this paper is on the development of incentive mechanisms that allow the agents to engage in an auctioning process according to their energy contribution. Through theoretical analysis and simulations, we evaluate the performance of the proposed model with respect to individual rationality, computational efficiency, and truthfulness.

AB This paper presents a path-planning and path-control concept for autonomous driving with a track guided vehicle. The specification of an adequate reference trajectory is performed by solving a nonlinear optimal-control problem considering realistic constraints like available road width or maximum tolerable longitudinal and lateral accelerations. The path-control system is based upon decoupling and linearization of the nonlinear control plant with the help of substitute control variables. Some driving experiments are shown to prove the operability of the system.

AB In this research, a fuzzy logic controller is designed for vision-based autonomous road-following. Because of its high-speed response, portability, and flexibility, a field programmable gate array is applied to implement this control system. Furthermore, a novel hardware/software partitioning method using the genetic algorithm is developed. This method is capable of finding the tradeoff among several evaluation factors under conditions of hard constraints. A small-scaled intelligent vehicle, which is capable of autonomous road-following is built and the proposed controller is tested in the real-world environment. Experiments of hardware implementation and codesign implementation are presented and compared.

AB A method for visually navigating an autonomous vehicle in an unstructured environment with fuzzy logic is summarized in this paper. Fuzzy logic is used with a human embedding method to process the raw vision data and control the autonomous vehicle. Specifically, the ability to classify pixels in the image space is discussed as a means of locating a safe path. Human embedding is used as a method to train the fuzzy logic system. The trained system is shown able to follow and recover to paths in the unstructured environment. Additionally, a hierarchical system that fuses the visual information with other sensors is discussed. The addition of an optical sensor provides the controller with critical information that helps make intelligent decisions in the presence of sensor imprecision and uncertainty.

AB Autonomous vehicles (AVs) are being introduced to the traffic system with the promise of improving current traffic status. However, the empirical data also indicate contrary effects with estimated higher crash rate and change of crash patterns. Therefore, it is necessary to investigate the driving behavior of AVs and human-driven vehicles (HDVs) in real mixed traffic. Current studies have analyzed the driving behavior of AVs and HDVs, as well as behavioral adaptations of drivers of HDVs based on empirical data. While they play an important role in traffic systems, signalized intersections have not been studied sufficiently in this context. Therefore, this study aims to utilize the Waymo open dataset to characterize and quantify the behavioral differences of AVs and HDVs at signalized intersections. Five parameters of driving behavior related to signalized intersections were characterized according to five critical maneuver phases, which were identified by wavelet transform and threshold-based method. Statistically significant differences in driving behavior between AVs and HDVs were found, from three categorized situations: vehicle approaching the red light/queue, vehicle responding to the green light (as the first vehicle), and vehicle responding to its preceding vehicle (in the queue). Further, behavioral adaptations of HDV drivers were revealed in that they tended to keep closer to the stopped AVs in a queue and to react more strongly to AV start-up maneuvers when the traffic light turns to green.

AB By simulating the geomagnetic fields and analyzing the variation of intensities, this paper presents a model for calculating the objective function of an Autonomous Underwater Vehicle (AUV) geomagnetic navigation task. By investigating the biologically inspired strategies, the AUV successfully reaches the destination during geomagnetic navigation without using the priori geomagnetic map. Similar to the pattern of a flatworm, the proposed algorithm relies on a motion pattern to trigger a local searching strategy by detecting the real-time geomagnetic intensity. An adapted strategy is then implemented, which is based on the specific target. The results show the reliability and effectiveness of the proposed algorithm.

AB This paper deals with automatic steering of autonomous wheeled mobile robots by using fuzzy logic. The fuzzy controller has as inputs the vehicle's relative position and orientation with respect to the path to follow, and the controller's output is the steering angle. The dynamic behaviour of path tracking with fuzzy controllers is investigated. The problem is not easy, owing to the nonlinear nature of the feedback tracking system. A new method for designing and tuning fuzzy path trackers for autonomous vehicles is proposed. The results of the application of the designed fuzzy path tracking controllers to RAM-1, a mobile robot designed and built for navigation in indoor and outdoor industrial environments, are shown. The experiments demonstrate a very stable and precise path tracking.

AB While autonomous vehicle (AV) technology is forecast to widely disrupt transport systems, governments' roles in influencing this innovation have not been examined holistically. This empirical study analyses the perceptions of 34 professionals from government and nongovernment actors in the U.K. and Australia. Our findings identify three main categories of government roles: regulator, facilitator and participator and illustrate how different policy mechanisms align within this framework to shape AV innovation. The paper discusses the implications of the interrelationships between these roles within each context, as well as how governments can apply them to pursue transport policy goals. This research provides an important contribution to understanding how local policy environments around the world might shape the development and eventual implementation of AV technologies.

AB Lane changes in multi-vehicle driving environments are one of the most challenging manoeuvres for autonomous vehicles. The key innovation of this study is to develop an integrated longitudinal and lateral trajectory planning and tracking control algorithm under vehicle-to-vehicle communication. This algorithm includes two levels: trajectory planning and path-following control. In the upper level, considering riding comfort, a collision-free lane-changing trajectory cluster is generated under different lane change durations. Then, the most appropriate trajectory from this cluster is provided by selecting the optimal lane change duration considering vehicle dynamics safety, collision avoidance of surrounding vehicles and driver preference. At the bottom level, a multiple-input multiple-output triple-step non-linear approach is proposed in the longitudinal and lateral path-following controller design. The stability of the closed-loop system is rigorously proven based on the Lyapunov function. Finally, the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm is verified with a high-fidelity and full-car model on the veDYNA platform.

AB Hovering control of autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) via a variable ballast system (VBS) is challenging owing to the difficulty in precisely estimating related hydrodynamic coefficients and vertical disturbance. In this work, a hierarchical control strategy is proposed which comprises an upper layer-the proportional-integral-derivative (PID) type ballast water mass planner generating the desired ballast mass, and a lower layer-the continuous mass flowrate controller adjusting the actual ballast mass. The resulting flowrate algorithm endows the system with local uniform asymptotic stability and robustness to both modeling errors and vertical disturbance. Numerical results verify the feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed hierarchical hovering control strategy.

AB In this paper, a new approach to autonomous agent navigation in real-time applications is presented. Effective driving simulators demand a realistic simulation of both the driven vehicle and the surrounding environment. For example, a variety of pedestrians and autonomous vehicles improve the realism of the simulation. Many studies of virtual environments for autonomous navigation are based on complex spatial subdivisions. Our approach takes advantage of the topological structure of cities, where pedestrians usually walk along straight pavements, to develop a new method for the simulation of autonomous pedestrians. The "smart obstacle" concept is introduced and a method for realistic corner turning is also explained. Our approach has been applied to simulate the motion of pedestrians on train station platforms, the results of which are presented and discussed.

AB For distributed drive autonomous vehicles, adding lateral stability control (LSC) to the trajectory tracking control (TTC) can optimize the distribution of the driving torque of each wheel, so that the vehicle can track the planned trajectory while maintaining stable lateral motion. However, the influence of adding LSC on the TTC system is still unclear. Firstly, a stability-track hierarchical control structure composed of LSC and TTC was established, and the interaction between the two layers was identified as the key of this paper. Then, the Intrinsic Mechanistic framework of the stability-tracking control (STC) was proposed by establishing and analyzing the vehicle dynamic model and control process of two layers. Finally, through simulation experiments, it was found that the change in the curvature of the target trajectory will make the tracking target trajectory and maintaining the lateral stability of the vehicle appear to conflict; in addition, in the LSC layer, the steering characteristics and delay characteristics of different reference models have a greater impact on the lateral stability and trajectory tracking performance; moreover, adjusting the preview time has a more obvious effect on trajectory tracking and lateral stability than the stability correction intensity coefficient.

AB Connected autonomous vehicles can leverage communication and artificial intelligence technologies to effectively overcome the perceived limitations of individuals and enhance driving safety and stability. However, due to the high dynamics of the vehicular network and frequent interruptions and handovers, it is still challenging to provide stable communication connections between vehicles, which is likely to cause disasters. To address this issue, in this paper, we propose an intelligent clustering mechanism based on driving patterns in heterogeneous Cognitive Internet of Vehicles (CIoVs). In the proposed approach, we analyze the driving mode containing multiple feature parameters to accurately capture the driving characteristics. To ensure the accuracy of pattern recognition, a genetic algorithm-based neural network pattern recognition algorithm is proposed to support the reliable clustering of connected autonomous vehicles. The cognitive engines recognize the driving modes to group vehicles with a similar driving mode into a relatively stable cluster. In addition, we formulate the stability and survival time of clusters and analyze the communication performance of the clustering mechanism. Simulation results show that the proposed mechanism improves the reliable communication throughput and average cluster lifetime by approximately 14.4% and 11.5% respectively compared to the state-of-the-art approaches.

AB One of the most important components of a high speed tracked vehicle is an efficient suspension system. The vehicle should be able to operate both in rough terrain for performance of engineering tasks as well as on the road with high speed. This is especially important for an autonomous platform that operates either with or without human supervision, so that the vibration level can rise compared to a manned vehicle. In this case critical electronic and electric parts must be protected to ensure the reliability of the vehicle.
   The paper presents a dynamic parameters determination methodology of suspension system for an autonomous high speed tracked platform with total weight of about 5 tonnes and hybrid propulsion system. Common among tracked vehicles suspension solutions and cost-efficient, the torsion-bar system was chosen. One of the most important issues was determining optimal track tensioning - in this case an active hydraulic system was applied. The selection of system. parameters was performed with using numerical model based on multi-body dynamic approach. The results of numerical analysis were used to define parameters of active tensioning control system setup. LMS Virtual.Lab Motion was used for multi body dynamics numerical calculation and Matlab/SIMULINK for control system simulation. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Autonomous vehicles and robots promise many exciting new applications that will transform society. For example, autonomous aerial vehicles (AAVs) operating in urban environments could deliver commercial goods and emergency medical supplies, monitor traffic, and provide threat alerts for national security [1]. At the same time, these applications present significant engineering challenges related to performance, trustworthiness, and safety. For instance, AAVs can be a catastrophic safety hazard should they lose control or situational awareness over a populated area. Space missions, self-driving cars, and applications of autonomous underwater vehicles share similar concerns.

AB This paper focuses attention on continuous curvature path generation for parallel parking manoeuvres of autonomous conventional vehicles. The method is based on beta-spline curves generation from a collision-free path previously calculated. Several constraints have been considered in order to ensure the existence of collision-free and admissible Curves. The efficiency of the proposed method is demonstrated using the nonholonomic autonomous vehicles ROMEO-3R and ROMEO-4R designed and built at the University of Seville. (c) 2007 Elsevier B.V.

AB To address the difficulty of obtaining the optimal driving strategy under the condition of a complex environment and changeable tasks of vehicle autonomous driving, this paper proposes an end-to-end autonomous driving strategy learning method based on deep reinforcement learning. The ideas of target attraction and obstacle rejection of the artificial potential field method are introduced into the distributed proximal policy optimization algorithm, and the APF-DPPO learning model is established. To solve the range repulsion problem of the artificial potential field method, which affects the optimal driving strategy, this paper proposes a directional penalty function method that combines collision penalty and yaw penalty to convert the range penalty of obstacles into a single directional penalty, and establishes the vehicle motion collision model. Finally, the APF-DPPO learning model is selected to train the driving strategy for the virtual vehicle, and the transfer learning method is selected to verify the comparison experiment. The simulation results show that the completion rate of the virtual vehicle in the obstacle environment that generates penalty feedback is as high as 96.3%, which is 3.8% higher than the completion rate in the environment that does not generate penalty feedback. Under different reward functions, the method in this paper obtains the highest cumulative reward value within 500 s, which improves 69 points compared with the reward function method based on the artificial potential field method, and has higher adaptability and robustness in different environments. The experimental results show that this method can effectively improve the efficiency of autonomous driving strategy learning and control the virtual vehicle for autonomous driving behavior decisions, and provide reliable theoretical and technical support for real vehicles in autonomous driving decision-making.

TI AVDM: A hierarchical command-and-control system architecture for

AB Microscopic agent-based traffic simulation is an important tool for the efficient and safe resolution of various traffic challenges accompanying the introduction of autonomous vehicles on the roads. Both the variety of questions that can be asked and the quality of answers provided by simulations, however, depend on the underlying models. In mixed traffic, the two most critical models are the models describing the driving behaviour of humans and AVs, respectively. This paper presents AVDM (Autonomous Vehicle Driving Model), a hierarchical AV behaviour model that allows the holistic evaluation of autonomous and mixed traffic by unifying a wide spectrum of AV functionality, including long-term planning, path planning, complex platooning manoeuvres, and low-level longitudinal and lateral control. The model consists of hierarchically layered modules bidirectionally connected by messages and commands. On top, a high-level planning module makes decisions whether to join/form platoons and how to follow the vehicle's route. A platooning manoeuvres layer guides involved AVs through the manoeuvres chosen to be executed, assisted by the trajectory planning layer, which, after finding viable paths through complex traffic conditions, sends simple commands to the low-level control layer to execute those paths. The model has been implemented in the BEHAVE mixed traffic simulation tool and achieved a 92% success rate for platoon joining manoeuvres in mixed traffic conditions. As a proof of concept, we conducted a mixed traffic simulation study showing that enabling platooning on a highway scenario shifts the velocity-density curve upwards despite the additional lane changing and manoeuvring it induces.

AB Sharing of autonomous vehicles between multiple users can potentially be the ultimate solution for increasing the efficiency of the transportation system. In a time-sharing scenario, autonomous vehicles (AV) owners share their vehicles to others at their unwanted times without incurring any human efforts. However, such sharing service requires the disclosure of users' locations and route information, raising severe privacy concerns and issues. In this paper, we propose a privacy-preserving task scheduling scheme for time-sharing services of autonomous vehicles. First, we design a matching scheme that finds the feasible requesters for each available AV. Then, we propose a scheduling scheme using different approaches for assigning requesters to the AVs based on different system parameters. Both schemes work efficiently without requiring users to share their exact locations and route details while maximizing the AV owner profit and minimizing the requester cost. Specifically, our schemes enable an untrusted matching server to match owners and requesters using a set of intermediate destination (ID) locations in the travel paths. Only if the service can be given to the requester efficiently, the owner and the requester share the details of the routes. All the calculations for verification of the feasibility of the service are done on the untrusted server. We show the accuracy of our proposed scheme through extensive simulations on real data. The results confirm that our traffic-based ID selection scheme, with consideration of the traffic information and patterns in the area, outperforms the baseline scheme where the IDs are chosen randomly. Furthermore, the effectiveness of different scheduling schemes including greedy-based and first come first served are evaluated.

AB Fully autonomous driving is on the horizon; vehicles with advanced driver assistance systems (ADAS) such as Tesla's Autopilot are already available to consumers. However, all currently available ADAS applications require a human driver to be alert and ready to take control if needed. Partially automated driving introduces new complexities to human interactions with cars and can even increase collision risk. A better understanding of drivers' trust in automation may help reduce these complexities. Much of the existing research on trust in ADAS has relied on use of surveys and physiological measures to assess trust and has been conducted using driving simulators. There have been relatively few studies that use telemetry data from real automated vehicles to assess trust in ADAS. In addition, although some ADAS technologies provide alerts when, for example, drivers' hands are not on the steering wheel, these systems are not personalized to individual drivers. Needed are adaptive technologies that can help drivers of autonomous vehicles avoid crashes based on multiple real-time data streams. In this paper, we propose an architecture for adaptive autonomous driving assistance. Two layers of multiple sensory fusion models are developed to provide appropriate voice reminders to increase driving safety based on predicted driving status. Results suggest that human trust in automation can be quantified and predicted with 80% accuracy based on vehicle data, and that adaptive speech-based advice can be provided to drivers with 90 to 95% accuracy. With more data, these models can be used to evaluate trust in driving assistance tools, which can ultimately lead to safer and appropriate use of these features.
