TI Microbubbles as Proxies for Oil Spill Delineation in Field Tests

AB To overcome the environmental impacts of releasing oil into the ocean for testing acoustic methods in field experiments using autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs), environmentally friendly gas bubble plumes with low rise velocities are proposed in this research to be used as proxies for oil. An experiment was conducted to test the performance of a centrifugal-type microbubble generator in generating microbubble plumes and their practicability to be used in field experiments. Sizes of bubbles were measured with a Laser In-Situ Scattering and Transmissometry sensor. Residence time of bubble plumes was estimated by using a Ping360 sonar. Results from the experiment showed that a larger number of small bubbles were found in deeper water as larger bubbles rose quickly to the surface without staying in the water column. The residence time of the generated bubble plumes at the depth of 0.5 m was estimated to be over 5 min. The microbubble generator is planned to be applied in future field experiments, as it is effective in producing relatively long-endurance plumes that can be used as potential proxies for oil plumes in field trials of AUVs for delineating oil spills.

AB Due to the energy transition and the distribution of electricity generation, distribution power systems gain a lot of attention as their importance increases and new challenges in operation emerge. The integration of renewables and electric vehicles for instance leads to manifold changes in the system, e.g. participation in provision of ancillary services. To solve these challenges artificial intelligence provides a variety of solutions based on the increase in sensor data and computational capability. This paper provides a systematic overview of some of the most recent studies applying artificial intelligence methods to distribution power system operation published during the last 10 years. Based on that, a general guideline is developed to support the reader in finding a suitable AI technique for a specific operation task. Therefore, four general metrics are proposed to give an orientation of the requirements of each application. Thus, a conclusion can be drawn presenting suitable algorithms for each operation task.

AB Energy storage devices such as supercapacitors of high performance are in great need due to the continuous expansion of digitalization and related devices for mobile electronics, autonomous sensors, and vehicles of different kinds. However, the nonrenewable resources and often complex preparation processes associated with electrode materials and structures pose limited scale-up in production and difficulties in versatile utilization of the devices. Here, free-standing and flexible carbon nanofiber networks derived from renewable and abundant bioresources are demonstrated. By a simple optimization of carbonization, the carbon nanofiber networks reach a large surface area of 1670 m(2) g(-1) and excellent specific gravimetric capacitance of similar to 240 F g(-1) outperforming many other nanostructured carbon, activated carbon, and even those decorated with metal oxides. The remarkable electrochemical performance and flexibility of the green carbon networks enable an all-solid-state supercapacitor device, which displays a device capacitance of 60.4 F g(-1) with a corresponding gravimetric energy density of 8.4 Wh kg(-1) while maintaining good mechanical properties.

ID SLIDING-MODE CONTROL; CONTENT DELIVERY; MOBILE ROBOTS
AB In this paper, we present and implement a hybrid approach to robust visual servoing for autonomous ground vehicles. A vision integrated model for nonholonomic mobile robots is derived that obviates the need for actual depth data for image-based visual servoing by assuming planar motion. A fractional order sliding-mode controller has been designed where the parameters of the sliding surface are adapted in real time. These adaptive laws are so derived that ensure finite-time convergence. An optical flow based heading restoration law is designed to handle the severe external perturbations, i.e., when the visual marker disappears from the field of view of the camera. The heading restoration law is combined with the reinforcement learning to solve this visibility problem. The proposed algorithm enables the robot to reach the home location even when the visual marker momentarily disappears from the camera field of view due to external disturbances. The proposed algorithm is validated in real time using Pioneer P3-DX robots through perturbation studies. Both simulation and experimental results prove the efficacy of the proposed scheme.

AB The multiple autonomous underwater vehicles (AUV) sailing in a specific configuration can reduce resistance if properly using the hydrodynamic interactions. This paper investigated the resistance characteristics of a multi-AUV system with both experimental and numerical approaches. A center-beam-support bar structure was designed to conduct the experiment. Validation of our numerical method was carried out by comparing with the experimental data. Parametric studies were then performed on the distance, the speed and the number of AUVs. The numerical results showed that SST-transition model is more suitable for simulating the multi-AUV system at Reynolds numbers (Re) ranging from 2.46 x 10(6) to 6.69 x 10(6). At Re = 6.14 x 10(6), the largest reduction of resistance can be 35.14% at d/L = 0. In the meantime, there appears some undesirable interference area between d/L = 0.042 and d/L = 0.063 where the total resistance of the fleet increases sharply. Apart from that, higher reduction of resistance can be expected with the increase of the speed and the number of AUVs.

The mini-glider is designed for CanSat competition, which has a theme of a Mars glider concept with atmosphere data acquisition. The aim is to facilitate the transportation of the glider and to land it on the destination point by following strict rules. Having a light and compact design is important since it uses power for the transmission of sensory data only. Dimensions of the glider is produced with a wingspan that is 440 mm and a length of 304 mm. The wings can be stowed in a fixed size container that has a diameter of 125 mm and a height of 310 mm. Its weight is only 144 g and it can increase up to 500 g maximum with a payload. The mechanism, which includes springs and neodymium N48 grade magnets for a wing-folding system, is capable of being ready in 98 ms for gliding after separating from its container. The mini-glider is capable of telemetering, communicating, and conducting other sensory operations autonomously during the flight.

AB Underwater moving object detection/tracking is critical in various applications such as exploration of natural undersea resources, acquiring of accurate scientific data to maintain regular surveillance of missions, navigation and tactical surveillance. Real time object detection/tracking which tends to obstacle avoidance is possible with an autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) fitted with sensor(sonar). To bring these applications into effective use, there is a need to evaluate various solutions for the safe navigation of AUV in the significant underwater environment. Convergence time becomes a problem and plays an increasingly important role in safe navigation of AUV applications. To achieve this, several methods, i.e. Kalman Filter (KF), Extended Kalman Filter (EKF) and Particle Filter (PF) have been investigated, although all these methods have their own limitations. In this paper, a new method has been developed wherein tracking algorithm using EKF has been extended to the Bearing and Elevation only Tracking (BEOT) method. By using Monte Carlo approach, the performance of this algorithm has been analyzed. Consequently, the time of convergence has been calculated and accordingly the results have been plotted.

AB This paper focuses on design of a new self-adaptive fuzzy PID controller based on nonlinear MIMO structure for an AUV. Complexity and highly coupled dynamics, time-variance, and difficulty in hydrodynamic modeling and simulation, complicates the AUV modeling process and the design of proper and acceptable controller. In this work, the comprehensive nonlinear model of AUV is derived through kinematics and dynamic equations and then its treatment in open-loop is verified. In proposed controller, the PID parameters are adjusted by Mamdani fuzzy rules. Combined adaptive methods and dual PID controllers can improve solving of the uncertainty challenge in the PID parameters and AUV modeling uncertainty. The simulation results indicate that developed control system is stable, competent, and efficient enough to control the AUV in tracking the two channels of heading and depth with stabilized speed. Obtained results show that the proposed controller is not only robust, but also gives excellent dynamic, stunning steady-state characteristics and robust stability compared with a classically tuned PID controller.

AB A technique is presented for passively localizing multiple noise-producing targets by cross-correlating the elevation beams of a compact volumetric array on separate bearings. A target's multipath structure inherently contains information about its range; however, unknown, random noise waveforms make time separation of individual arrivals difficult. Ocean ambient noise has previously been used to measure multipath delays to the seabed by cross-correlating the beams of a vertical line array [Siderius, Song, Gerstoft, Hodgkiss, Hursky, and Harrison, J. Acoust. Soc. Am. 127, 2193-2200 (2010)], but this methodology has not been applied to distant noise sources having non-vertical arrivals. The technique presented in this paper uses a compact volumetric array mounted to an autonomous underwater vehicle to measure the three-dimensional directionality and time delays of multipath arrivals, while adaptively rejecting clutter and multi-target interference. This is validated with experimental results in a shallow ocean environment in which a small workboat maneuvered in the vicinity. Short ranges could be estimated reliably using straight ray paths, but longer ranges required accounting for ray refraction. (C) 2014 Acoustical Society of America.

TI Vision-based navigation using multi-rate feedback from optic flow and
   scene reconstruction
SO AERONAUTICAL JOURNAL
LA English
DT Article
ID MOTION
AB Vision-based control is being aggressively pursued for autonomous systems. Such control is particularly valuable for path planning to achieve mission objectives like target tracking and obstacle avoidance. This paper presents a multi-rate strategy that utilises a fast-rate optic flow approach and a slow-rate scene reconstruction approach. The vehicle uses scene reconstruction to generate an accurate map for path planning; however, optic flow is used to avoid obstacles while the scene reconstruction is computed. A switch element is used in the feedback path to determine whether information relating to the reconstructed map or the optical flow should be used for navigation. The resulting controller is able to generate flight trajectories and perform obstacle avoidance within a computational cost which is reasonable given performance demands and computational resources on a wide range of aircraft. A simulation demonstrates the performance of an aircraft that uses the multi-rate controller to avoid an obstacle which is only observed after a turn. Essentially, the fast-rate optic flow indicates the presence of the obstacle during the time that slow-rate scene reconstruction is being performed. The resulting flight path is able to follow mission objectives and avoid a collision.

AB Traffic sign recognition techniques aim to reduce the probability of traffic accidents by increasing road and vehicle safety. These systems play an essential role in the development of autonomous vehicles. Autonomous driving is a popular field that is seeing more and more growth. In this study, a new high-performance and robust deep convolutional neural network model is proposed for traffic sign recognition. The stacking ensemble model is presented by combining the trained models by applying improvement methods on the input images. For this, first of all, by performing preprocessing on the data set, more accurate recognition was achieved by preventing adverse weather conditions and shooting errors. In addition, data augmentation was applied to increase the images in the data set due to the uneven distribution of the number of images belonging to the classes. During the model training, the learning rate was adjusted to prevent overfitting. Then, a new stacking ensemble model was created by combining the models trained with the input images that were subjected to different preprocessing. This ensemble model obtained 99.75% test accuracy on the German Traffic Sign Recognition Benchmark (GTSRB) dataset. When compared with other studies in this field in the literature, it is seen that recognition is performed with higher accuracy than these studies. Additively different approaches have been applied for model evaluation. Gradient-weighted Class Activation Mapping (Grad-CAM) was used to make the model explainable. Evidential deep learning approach was applied to measure the uncertainty in classification. Results for safe monitoring are also shared with SafeML-II, which is based on measuring statistical distances. In addition to these, the migration test is applied with BTSC (Belgium Traffic Sign Classification) dataset to test the robustness of the model. With the transfer learning method of the models trained with GTSRB, the parameter weights in the feature extraction stage are preserved, and the training is carried out for the classification stage. Accordingly, with the stacking ensemble model obtained by combining the models trained with transfer learning, a high accuracy of 99.33% is achieved on the BTSC dataset. While the number of parameters the single model is 7.15 M, the number of parameters of the stacking ensemble model with additional layers is 14.34 M. However, the parameters of the models trained on a single preprocessed dataset were not trained, and transfer learning was performed. Thus, the number of trainable parameters in the ensemble model is only 39,643.

AB Gliders are low-power autonomous underwater vehicles used to obtain oceanic measurements in vertical sections. Assimilation of glider temperature and salinity into coastal ocean circulation models holds the potential to improve the ocean subsurface structure estimate. In this study, the impact of assimilation of glider observations is studied using a four-dimensional variational (4DVAR) data assimilation and forecast system set offshore of Oregon and Washington on the U.S. West Coast. Four test cases are compared: (1) no assimilation, (2) assimilation of glider temperature and salinity data alone, (3) assimilation of the glider data in combination with the surface observations including satellite sea surface temperature, sea surface height, and high-frequency radar surface velocities, and (4) assimilation of the surface data alone. It is found that the assimilation of glider observations alone creates unphysical eddies in the vicinity of the glider transect. As a consequence, the forecast errors in the surface velocity and temperature increase compared to the case without data assimilation. Assimilation of surface and subsurface observations in combination prevents these features from forming and reduces the errors in the forecasts for the subsurface fields compared to the other three experiments. These improvements persisted in 21-day forecasts run after the last data assimilation cycle.
   Plain Language Summary Ocean forecast systems, like our system for the ocean offshore Oregon- Washington, USA, use numerical models to predict future temperature, currents, sea surface height, and salt concentration. Eventually, these predictions are corrected using observations in a process called data assimilation ( DA) in order to better approximate the true state of the ocean. Assimilation of subsurface observations made by autonomous underwater vehicles called gliders can potentially improve the predictions of the ocean state below the surface. In this study, we have assimilated glider observations together with, and in absence of, surface observations. We found that assimilation of glider observations alone creates predictions that are less accurate than those obtained from a model without DA as the DA creates unphysical features. Assimilating the glider observations in tandem with surface observations prevents these features from forming and realizes local improvements to the subsurface ocean predictions that last for 21 days after the last DA correction. These results show that one has to be careful with using glider observations in DA and should always assimilate glider observations in combination with observations that cover large swaths of the ocean surface.

AB The PointPillars algorithm can detect vehicles, pedestrians, and cyclists on the road, and is widely used in the field of environmental awareness in autonomous driving. However, its feature encoding network only uses a minimalist PointNet network for feature extraction of point cloud information, which does not consider the global context information of the point cloud, and the local structure features are not sufficiently extracted, and these feature losses can seriously affect the performance of the object detection network. To address this problem, this paper proposes an improved PointPillars algorithm named TGPP: Transformer-based Global PointPillars. After the point cloud is divided into several pillars, global context features and local structure features are extracted through a multi-head attention mechanism, so that the point cloud after feature coding has global context features and local structure features; the two-dimensional pseudo-image generated by this feature is used for feature learning using a two-dimensional convolutional neural network. Finally, the SSD detection head is used to achieve 3D object detection. It is demonstrated that the TGPP achieves an average accuracy improvement of 2.64% in the KITTI test set.

AB Nowadays autonomous vehicles are evolving due to the advancements in cutting edge technologies. In order to recognize the traffic signatures with high efficacy, traffic recognition system is required. Sign detection and classification are the two parts of the recognition system. The sign detection algorithm detects the size and coordinates of the sign board in an image and in sign classification, the representation of traffic signal is identified and classified into one of their traffic sign sub-classes. In order to achieve these goals, an extremely fast detection module using support vector machine is proposed to detect the traffic sign into one of the traffic classes such as, prohibitory, danger, mandatory, and non-sign. Further classification is carried out using deep convolutional neural networks to determine the sub-classes of each super-class, such as, prohibitory, danger, and mandatory. Based on publicly available benchmark traffic sign image datasets, we have demonstrated that the proposed approach has significantly improved traffic sign recognition accuracy compared with state-of-the-art systems.

AB Systematic attack design is essential to understanding the vulnerabilities of cyber-physical systems (CPSs), to better design for resiliency. In particular, false data injection attacks (FDIAs) are well-known and have been shown to be capable of bypassing bad data detection (BDD) while causing targeted biases in resulting state estimates. However, their effectiveness against moving horizon estimators (MHE) is not well understood. In fact, this paper shows that conventional FDIAs are generally ineffective against MHE. One of the main reasons is that the moving window renders the static FDIA recursively infeasible. This paper proposes a new attack methodology, moving-horizon FDIA (MH-FDIA), by considering both the performance of historical attacks and the current system's status. Theoretical guarantees for successful attack generation and recursive feasibility are given. Numerical simulations on the IEEE-14 bus system further validate the theoretical claims and show that the proposed MH-FDIA outperforms state-of-the-art counterparts in both stealthiness and effectiveness. In addition, an experiment on a path-tracking control system of an autonomous vehicle shows the feasibility of the MH-FDIA in real-world nonlinear systems.

AB For self-driving vehicles, detecting lane lines in changeable scenarios is a fundamental yet challenging task. The rise of deep learning in recent years has contributed to the thriving of autonomous driving. However, existing methods of lane detection based on deep learning have high requirements on computing environment, so their applicability is further restricted. This paper proposed an improved attention deep neural network (DNN), a lightweight semantic segmentation architecture catering for efficient computation in low memory, which contains two branches worked in different resolution. The proposed network integrates fine details captured by local interaction of pixels at high resolution into global contexts at low resolution, computing dense feature maps for prediction task. Based on the attributes of disparate feature resolution characteristics, different attention mechanisms are adopted to guide the network to effectively exploit the model parameters. The proposed network achieves comparable results with state-of-the-art methods on two popular lane detection benchmarks (TuSimple and CULane), with faster calculation efficiency at 259 frames-per-second (FPS) on CULane dataset, and the total number of model parameters only requires 1.57 M. This study provides a practical and meaningful reference for the application of lane detection in memory constrained devices.

DE Brake squeal; Chaotic instability; Hopf bifurcation
ID MITIGATION; VIBRATIONS; ONSET; MODEL
AB Chaotic instability in a vibration phenomenon, known as brake squeal, is investigated including the combined effects of falling friction, sprag-slip and mode coupling. Brake squeal is a high-pitched noise that occurs sometimes when a vehicle is decelerated using disc brakes. The equations of motion for the two dominant coupled modes of the brake system reduce to two autonomous coupled nonlinear second-order systems. The mode coupling instability via friction causes limit cycle behaviour via a supercritical Hopf bifurcation. This limit cycle is shown to break up into chaotic motion characterised by a Poincare map with a less than one-dimensional attractor, similar to that found in a forced dry friction oscillator. For the first time, conservative analytical conditions for brake squeal chaos are developed and verified numerically over a range of sprag angles and brake pressures for fundamental and real brake systems. The predictive model is then used to identify and quantify means to suppress brake squeal chaos to unlikely, excessive friction levels. The results provide predictive insight into conditions under which brake squeal chaos occurs and its suppression.

AB Trajectory planning is of great value and yet challenging for multirotor unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) applications in a complex urban environment, mainly due to the complexities of handling cluttered obstacles. The problem further complicates itself in the context of autonomous multi-UAV trajectory planning considering conflict avoidance for future city applications. To tackle this problem, this paper introduces the multi-UAV cooperative trajectory planning (MCTP) problem, and proposes a bilevel model for the problem. The upper level is modeled as an extended multiple traveling salesman problem, aiming at generating trajectories based on heuristic framework for multi-UAV task allocation and scheduling and meanwhile considering UAV kinodynamic properties. The lower level is modeled as a holding time assignment problem to avoid possible spatiotemporal trajectory conflicts, where conflict time difference is analyzed based on the proposed state-time graph method. Numerical studies are conducted in both a 1 km2 virtual city and 12 km2 real city with a set of tasks and obstacles settings. The results show that the proposed model is capable of planning trajectories for multi-UAV from the system-level perspective based on the proposed method.

AB Development of accessible and cheap sensors as well as the possibility to transfer and process huge amounts of data offer new possibilities for many areas utilizing till now conventional approaches. Navigation of robots and autonomous vehicles is no exception in this aspect and Internet of Things (IoT), together with the means of computational intelligence, represents a new way for construction and use of robots. In this paper, the possibility to move sensors from robots to their surroundings with the help of IoT is presented and the modification of the IoT concept in the form of intelligent space as well as the concept of ubiquitous robot are shown in the paper. On an example of route tracking, we will clarify the potential of distributed networked sensors and processing their data with the use of fuzzy cognitive maps for robotic navigation. Besides, two modifications of adaptation approaches, namely particle swarm optimization and migration algorithm, are presented here. A series of simulations was performed, which are discussed and future research directions are proposed.

AB The testing of the intelligent driving systems is faced with the challenges of efficiency because real traffic scenarios are infinite, uncontrollable and difficult to be precisely defined. Based on the complexity index of scenario that designed to measure the test effect indirectly, a new combinational testing algorithm of test cases generation is proposed to make a balance among multiple objects including test coverage, the number of test cases and test effect. Then a joint simulation platform based on Matlab, PreScan and Carsim is built up to realize the construction of 3D test environment, execution of test scenarios and evaluation of test results automatically and seamlessly. The strategy proposed in this paper is validated by applying it to a traffic jam pilot system. The result shows that the proposed strategy can improve the overall complexity of the designed test scenarios effectively, which can help us detect system faults faster and easier. And the time required to conduct tests is reduced obviously by means of automation.

AB Revolutionizing logistics and supply chain management in smart manufacturing is one of the main goals of the Industry 4.0 movement. Emerging technologies such as autonomous vehicles, Cyber-Physical Systems and digital twins enable highly automated and optimized solutions in these fields to achieve full traceability of individual products. Tracking various assets within shop-floors and the warehouse is a focal point of asset management; its aim is to enhance the efficiency of logistical tasks. Global players implement their own solutions based on the state of the art technologies. Small and medium companies, however, are still skeptic toward identification based tracking methods, because of the lack of low-cost and reliable solutions. This paper presents a novel, working, reliable, low-cost, scalable solution for asset tracking, supporting global asset management for Industry4.0. The solution uses high accuracy indoor positioning-based on Ultra-Wideband (UWB) radio technology-combined with RFID-based tracking features. Identifying assets is one of the most challenging parts of this work, so this paper focuses on how different identification approaches can be combined to facilitate an efficient and reliable identification scheme.

AB Machine vision technology has taken huge leaps in recent years, and is now becoming an integral part of various intelligent systems, including autonomous vehicles and robotics. Usually, visual information is captured by a frame-based camera, converted into a digital format and processed afterwards using a machine-learning algorithm such as an artificial neural network (ANN)(1). The large amount of (mostly redundant) data passed through the entire signal chain, however, results in low frame rates and high power consumption. Various visual data preprocessing techniques have thus been developed(2-7) to increase the efficiency of the subsequent signal processing in an ANN. Here we demonstrate that an image sensor can itself constitute an ANN that can simultaneously sense and process optical images without latency. Our device is based on a reconfigurable two-dimensional (2D) semiconductor(8,9) photodiode(10-12) array, and the synaptic weights of the network are stored in a continuously tunable photoresponsivity matrix. We demonstrate both supervised and unsupervised learning and train the sensor to classify and encode images that are optically projected onto the chip with a throughput of 20 million bins per second.

AB Artificial Intelligence (AI) applications are developing at a high rate, facing soon a tremendous energy challenge. In this context, the original Axon-Hillock (AH) Artificial Neuron (AN) has been optimized to achieve ultra-low power (ULP) consumption. The membrane capacitance was taken out, and in order to drastically reduce its power consumption, the (feedback) capacitance is lowered to 5 fF, the transistors gate width is reduced to 120 nm and the supply voltage is decreased to as low as 200 mV. Designed and fabricated using 65 nm CMOS Technology, the refined AH neuron features a standby power of 11 pW, and when excited, a power consumption that does not exceed 30 pW for a firing frequency of 15.6 kHz. Its energy efficiency per spike is lower than 2 fJ/spike when the DC power is included (around 1 fJ/spike excluding the DC power), for an area of 31 mu m(2). These performance confer to this ULP AH neuron a high potential for future development of highly energy efficient Spiking Neural Networks, required to design future neuroprocessors embedded in various applications (smart visual sensors for autonomous vehicles, robotics).

AB This paper presents a new sensor based on a radial field bulk piezoelectric diaphragm to provide energy-efficient and high-performance situational sensing for autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs). This sensor is self-powered, does not need an external power supply, and works efficiently in d(33) mode by using inter-circulating electrodes to release the radial in-plane poling. Finite element analysis was conducted to estimate the sensor behavior. Sensor prototypes were fabricated by microfabrication technology. The dynamic behaviors of the piezoelectric diaphragm were examined by the impedance spectrum. By imitating the underwater disturbance and generating the oscillatory flow velocities with a vibrating sphere, the performance of the sensor in detecting the oscillatory flow was tested. Experimental results show that the sensitivity of the sensor is up to 1.16 mV/(mm/s), and the detectable oscillatory flow velocity is as low as 4 mm/s. Further, this sensor can work well under a disturbance with low frequency. The present work provides a good application prospect for the underwater sensing of AUVs.

AB This paper proposes a chasing controller to enable a pursuer to chase a high-speed evader such that the relative distance between the evader and the pursuer monotonically decreases as time passes. Our controller is designed to assure that the angular rate of Line-of-Sight joining the pair (the pursuer and the evader) is exactly zero at all time indexes. Assuming that the pursuee can readily observe optical flow, but only poorly detect looming, this pursuer's movement is hardly detected by the pursuee. Consider the terminal phase when the pursuer is sufficiently close to the evader. As we slow down the relative speed of the pursuer with respect to the evader, we can reduce the probability of missing the high-speed evader. Thus, our strategy is to make the pursuer decrease its speed in the terminal phase, while ensuring that the distance between the evader and the pursuer monotonically decreases as time passes. The performance of our controller is verified utilizing MATLAB simulations.

AB This paper proposes a coordinated control strategy according to the slope-climbing maneuver for autonomous tractor-trailer trucks, with considering tracking accuracy and underactuated trailer stability. First of all, a slope-deconstruction method is adopted to establish a coupled slope-climbing dynamics and trailer articulation model, to investigate motion characteristics and mechanical properties in the target operating condition. After that, a stability assessment is presented on the stable domain of articulation states to determine the underactuated stability. Furthermore, a hierarchical coordinated strategy can be consequently constructed to guarantee the vehicle stability during slope-climbing tracking. Specifically, feedforward model predictive control (MPC) is designed to compensate for system errors in coupled nonlinear dynamics for improved tracking performance. Besides, a robust H-infinity is also introduced to govern articulation stability with coordinated braking regulation. At last, co-simulation analysis will be carried out to verify the feasibility and effectiveness of the control strategy, where the practical application adjustment has been discussed to satisfy the driving operation as well.

ID TRACKING
AB Trajectory forecasting for traffic participants (e.g., vehicles) is critical for autonomous platforms to make safe plans. Currently, most trajectory forecasting methods assume that object trajectories have been extracted and directly develop trajectory predictors based on the ground truth trajectories. However, this assumption does not hold in practical situations. Trajectories obtained from object detection and tracking are inevitably noisy, which could cause serious forecasting errors to predictors built on ground truth trajectories. In this paper, we propose to predict trajectories directly based on detection results without relying on explicitly formed trajectories. Different from traditional methods which encode the motion cues of an agent based on its clearly defined trajectory, we extract the motion information only based on the affinity cues among detection results, in which an affinity-aware state update mechanism is designed to manage the state information. In addition, considering that there could be multiple plausible matching candidates, we aggregate the states of them. These designs take the uncertainty of association into account which relax the undesirable effect of noisy trajectory obtained from data association and improve the robustness of the predictor. Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness of our method and its generalization ability to different detectors or forecasting schemes.

AB In vehicle-to-everything (V2X) networks, security and safety are inherently difficult tasks due to the distinct characteristics of such networks, such as their highly dynamic topology and frequent connectivity disruptions. Jellyfish attacks are a sort of denial of service attack that are challenging to deal with, since they conform to protocol norms while impairing network performance, particularly in terms of communication overhead and reliability. Numerous existing approaches have developed new techniques with which to identify and prevent these attacks; however, no approach has been capable of facing all three types of Jellyfish attacks, which include reordering attacks, delay variance attacks, and periodic drop attacks. In this work, we design a new protocol that analyzes the behavior of every node in a network and selects the trusted routes for data transmission to their intended destination by calculating different Honesty metrics. The OMNET++ simulator was used to evaluate the overall performance of the proposed protocol. Various evaluation metrics, such as the packet delivery ratio, end-to-end delay, and throughput, are considered and compared with other existing approaches.

AB The concept of thrust-based control without the employment of thrust-vectoring (TVC), already introduced in a previous work by the authors, is further developed in conjunction with an appropriate control suite, tasked with both artificial stabilization and beam-tracking navigation functions. In the paper, the fully non-linear mathematical model employed for testing the controllers in a virtual environment is outlined. Then a comparative approach is adopted in the analysis, where a standard tail-back airship with deflectable aerodynamic surfaces is employed as a baseline, and the performance of a four-thrusters layout with a thrust-based control and no TVC is assessed with respect to it. Featured test cases in forward flight include short climbs, abrupt turns, and multi-checkpoint navigation. The research supports the feasibility and adequate performance of the proposed thrust-based airship layout and control, and presents a critical analysis of the pros and cons with respect to the considered baseline airship configuration featuring standard aerodynamic control.

AB There are numerous non-smooth factors in railway vehicle systems, such as flange impact, dry friction, creep force, and so on. Such non-smooth factors heavily affect the dynamical behavior of the railway systems. In this paper, we investigate and mathematically analyze the double grazing bifurcations of the rail-way wheelset systems with flange contact. Two types of models of flange impact are considered, one is a rigid impact model and the other is a soft impact model. First, we derive Poincare maps near the grazing trajectory by the Poincare-section discontinuity mapping (PDM) approach for the two impact models. Then, we analyze and compare the near grazing dynamics of the two models. It is shown that in the rigid impact model the stable periodic motion of the railway wheelset system translates into a chaotic motion after the grazing bifurcation, while in the soft impact model a pitchfork bifurcation occurs and the system tends to the chaotic state through a period doubling bifurcation. Our results also extend the applicability of the PDM of one constraint surface to that of two constraint surfaces for autonomous systems.

AB Real-time, dynamic, and visual monitoring of underwater scenes would become an important research topic with the development of underwater wireless optical communication (UWOC), autonomous underwater vehicle, and video fusion technologies. To this end, we developed a UWOC-based 2K real-time digital video surveillance prototype named AquaF-seer. Using a light-emitting diode and an avalanche photodetector based diffused line-of-sight UWOC system, real-time video transmission with a high resolution of 1920 x 1080 pixels is achieved over various channels, i.e., 1.5-m free space channel, pure water channel, pure water channel with 1.53-mL/s bubble-induced turbulence, pure water channel with 42.40-mL/s bubble-induced turbulence, simulated pure sea water channel, and coastal ocean water channel. Moreover, 46-m and 5-m video monitoring are implemented in free space and an outdoor diving pool. It indicates the reliability of the prototype, which is the first step to realize underwater visual monitoring in future human-robot interaction applications.

AB Autonomous robotic vehicles (i.e., drones) are potentially transformative for search and rescue (SAR). This paper works toward wearable interfaces, through which humans team with multiple drones. We introduce the Virtual Drone Search Game as a first step in creating a mixed reality simulation for humans to practice drone teaming and SAR techniques. Our goals are to (1) evaluate input modalities for the drones, derived from an iterative narrowing of the design space, (2) improve our mixed reality system for designing input modalities and training operators, and (3) collect data on how participants socially experience the virtual drones with which they work. In our study, 17 participants played the game with two input modalities (Gesture condition, Tap condition) in counterbalanced order. Results indicated that participants performed best with the Gesture condition. Participants found the multiple controls challenging, and future studies might include more training of the devices and game. Participants felt like a team with the drones and found them moderately agentic. In our future work, we will extend this testing to a more externally valid mixed reality game.

AB With the development of the convergence of IT and automotive technology, platoon-based driving systems are getting more attention and how to disseminate messages in the platoon is an important issue. In this paper, to enhance the energy efficiency and traffic throughput (e.g., average velocity) while meeting transmission deadlines, we propose an energy efficient message dissemination scheme (EMDS) in platoon-based driving systems, which also provides proper power control and relay selection. To find out the optimal policy to balance the probability of successful message dissemination and transmission power cost in EMDS, we formulate a Markov decision process (MDP) problem that considers the velocity of the vehicles in the platoon. To evaluate the performance of EMDS, we analyze the outage probability, the average velocity, and the expected power consumption using the discrete-time Markov chain (DTMC) model. Evaluation results demonstrate EMDS with the optimal policy improves the average velocity and the energy efficiency of message dissemination compared with the conventional message dissemination schemes, while reducing the message dissemination failure rate.

AB One of the necessary demands in extensive livestock systems is the counting of animals in areas of tens of hectares, costly when carried out manually and locally. In this context, this work proposes and discusses the efficacy of a semi-autonomous, non-invasive method for remote identification of animals in the field, applicable to precision livestock systems. The method was conceived from an exploratory research methodology based on remote sensing techniques that include image collection processes by aerial surveying with RGB camera embedded in unmanned aerial vehicle, persistence of images obtained by means of storage in space-time databases and processing of stored images for the construction of a rural property orthomosaic succeeded by the application of patterns discovery processes, making use of deep learning, especially convolutional neural networks. According to the experiments carried out, the method was effective, being able to identify and count animals from the collection of images made at 100 m height, with an accuracy of up to 95%, including the approximate geographical position of the animals to field.

   fusion; Feature fusion; RNN
AB Emotion recognition is a hot research in modern intelligent systems. The technique is pervasively used in autonomous vehicles, remote medical service, and human-computer interaction (HCI). Traditional speech emotion recognition algorithms cannot be effectively generalized since both training and testing data are from the same domain, which have the same data distribution. In practice, however, speech data is acquired from different devices and recording environments. Thus, the data may differ significantly in terms of language, emotional types and tags. To solve such problem, in this work, we propose a bimodal fusion algorithm to realize speech emotion recognition, where both facial expression and speech information are optimally fused. We first combine the CNN and RNN to achieve facial emotion recognition. Subsequently, we leverage the MFCC to convert speech signal to images. Therefore, we can leverage the LSTM and CNN to recognize speech emotion. Finally, we utilize the weighted decision fusion method to fuse facial expression and speech signal to achieve speech emotion recognition. Comprehensive experimental results have demonstrated that, compared with the uni-modal emotion recognition, bimodal features-based emotion recognition achieves a better performance.

AB Underwater wireless power transfer (WPT) technology can enhance the endurance of the autonomous underwater vehicles (AUV). WPT that based on electromagnetic theory will generate eddy current loss (ECL) in seawater. In this paper, we make use of shielding coils to weaken the electromagnetic field (EMF) in seawater, which can reduce ECL and improve the transfer efficiency. Simplified circuit models were proposed to provide an intuitive and comprehensive analysis of the transfer efficiency and the finite element analysis (FEA) was used to simulate the distribution of EMF. We learn that the system with shielding coils performs better when the operating frequency is relatively high by comparing the power transfer efficiency of the underwater WPT systems with and without the shielding, and its maximum efficiency is higher than the system without shielding. The effect of the shielding coils has the similar influence when compared with the metallic plate. While considering the efficiency and weight of coils, the results show that the shielding coils can be used in the underwater WPT system to improve the power transfer efficiency.

AB Many text mining tasks such as text retrieval, text summarization, and text comparisons depend on the extraction of representative keywords from the main text. Most existing keyword extraction algorithms are based on discrete bag-of-words type of word representation of the text. In this paper, we propose a patent keyword extraction algorithm (PKEA) based on the distributed Skip-gram model for patent classification. We also develop a set of quantitative performance measures for keyword extraction evaluation based on information gain and cross-validation, based on Support Vector Machine (SVM) classification, which are valuable when human-annotated keywords are not available. We used a standard benchmark dataset and a homemade patent dataset to evaluate the performance of PKEA. Our patent dataset includes 2500 patents from five distinct technological fields related to autonomous cars (GPS systems, lidar systems, object recognition systems, radar systems, and vehicle control systems). We compared our method with Frequency, Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency (TF-IDF), TextRank and Rapid Automatic Keyword Extraction (RAKE). The experimental results show that our proposed algorithm provides a promising way to extract keywords from patent texts for patent classification.

TI DESPOT: Online POMDP Planning with Regularization
SO JOURNAL OF ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE RESEARCH
LA English
DT Article
ID VALUE-ITERATION; DECISION; ALGORITHMS
AB The partially observable Markov decision process (POMDP) provides a principled general framework for planning under uncertainty, but solving POMDPs optimally is computationally intractable, due to the "curse of dimensionality" and the "curse of history". To overcome these challenges, we introduce the Determinized Sparse Partially Observable Tree (DESPOT), a sparse approximation of the standard belief tree, for online planning under uncertainty. A DESPOT focuses online planning on a set of randomly sampled scenarios and compactly captures the "execution" of all policies under these scenarios. We show that the best policy obtained from a DESPOT is near-optimal, with a regret bound that depends on the representation size of the optimal policy. Leveraging this result, we give an anytime online planning algorithm, which searches a DESPOT for a policy that optimizes a regularized objective function. Regularization balances the estimated value of a policy under the sampled scenarios and the policy size, thus avoiding overfitting. The algorithm demonstrates strong experimental results, compared with some of the best online POMDP algorithms available. It has also been incorporated into an autonomous driving system for real-time vehicle control. The source code for the algorithm is available online.

TI Complete characterization of the stability of cluster synchronization in
   complex dynamical networks
SO SCIENCE ADVANCES
LA English
DT Article
AB Synchronization is an important and prevalent phenomenon in natural and engineered systems. In many dynamical networks, the coupling is balanced or adjusted to admit global synchronization, a condition called Laplacian coupling. Many networks exhibit incomplete synchronization, where two or more clusters of synchronization persist, and computational group theory has recently proved to be valuable in discovering these cluster states based on the topology of the network. In the important case of Laplacian coupling, additional synchronization patterns can exist that would not be predicted from the group theory analysis alone. Understanding how and when clusters form, merge, and persist is essential for understanding collective dynamics, synchronization, and failure mechanisms of complex networks such as electric power grids, distributed control networks, and autonomous swarming vehicles. We describe a method to find and analyze all of the possible cluster synchronization patterns in a Laplacian-coupled network, by applying methods of computational group theory to dynamically equivalent networks. We present a general technique to evaluate the stability of each of the dynamically valid cluster synchronization patterns. Our results are validated in an optoelectronic experiment on a five-node network that confirms the synchronization patterns predicted by the theory.

   Optimal pathplanning
AB The optimal path planning problem is considered for rovers. Tip-over risk is accurately modelled using direction dependence. In the previous direction-independent model, the value function was approximated using the Fast Marching Method (FMM). The risk was not accurately modelled. Solar energy is considered here for the first time. Minimizing path length, obstacle avoidance and soil risk are also considered. For a direction-dependent model, the value function in the optimal path planning problem can be approximated accurately using the Ordered Upwind Method (OUM)-but not FMK The value function is used to synthesize the optimal control, which is shown to have no local minima. A novel algorithmic improvement, OUM-BD over the OUM to include a bi-directional search is presented. The OUM-BD is slightly slower than the FMM, but can accurately solve a larger class of problems. The OUM-BD is faster than the existing OUM, an optimal hi-directional RRT path planner (Bi-RRT*), and a genetic algorithm (GA) path planner in terms of time, and outperforms both the GA and Bi-RRT* planner in cost in tested examples.

AB This paper presents a new distributed architecture designed and built in order to execute, among other functions, on-board movement control and path planning of a mobile robot by using Digital Signal Processors (DSP) and NeuronChip(R) Microcontrollers. Different functions have been asigned to independent processor modules interconected through a Serial Communications Link that uses the LonWorks(R) Protocol. Each module acts as a 'node' in a data network, were commands and control data flow as short messages increasing the system flexibility. High level tasks can be developed by DSP nodes, while low level and communication tasks are carried out by the NeuronChip. An application to Path-planning with Obstacle Avoidance using this architecture is described in detail: a DSP node, using appropriate sensory information, creates a model of the environment detecting obstacles, then it computes a path to follow and executes a full tracking algorithm, including position estimation and velocities commands generation; two NeuronChip nodes are responsible of motor control and state feedback, accepting velocities commands, computing a digital closed loop algorithm and giving back sensed velocities and encoders sampling.

AB In the held of computer-aided vehicle design, it is important to simulate the activity of the future end user in order to evaluate the product being designed on the basis of ergonomic criteria such as ingress/egress, encumbering, control reach, control maneuverability, and visibility. This can be done with a computerized graphical mannequin. Some of the problems related to this question are reviewed and a method of mannequin manipulation for posture simulation is presented. Tn this method, the postures and movements implied by the use of the product being designed are generated from position and orientation constraints assigned by the user to various body parts. An inverse geometric algorithm then computes a set of angles satisfying the geometric constraints. The algorithm is based on a functional segmentation of the human body into autonomous mobile segments, organized in a tree-like structure and able to cooperate in order to solve an inverse geometric problem. The resolution strategy is based on an action plan, decomposing the global constraint problem into local subproblems handled by the segments and taking into account priority levels of action attributed to the segments. Some examples of postures obtained with this method related to the use of an automobile are presented.

AB Measurements of turbulence were performed in four frontal locations near the mouths of Block Island Sound (BIS) and Long Island Sound (LIS). These measurements extend from the offshore front associated with BIS and Mid-Atlantic Bight Shelf water, to the onshore fronts near the Montauk Point (MK) headland, and the Connecticut River plume front. The latter feature is closely associated with the major fresh water input to LIS. Turbulent kinetic energy (TKE) dissipation rate, epsilon, was obtained using shear probes mounted on an autonomous underwater vehicle. Offshore, the BIS estuarine outflow front showed, during spring season and ebb tide, maximum TKE dissipation rate, epsilon, estimates of order 10(-5) W/kg, with background values of order 10(-6) to 10(-9) W/kg. Edwards et al. [Edwards, C.A., Fake, T.A., and Bogden, P.S., 2004a. Spring-summer frontogenesis at the mouth of Block Island Sound: 1. A numerical investigation into tidal and buoyancy-forced motion. Journal of Geophysical Research 109 (C12021), doi:10.1029/2003JC002132.] model this front as the boundary of a tidally driven, baroclinically adjusted BIS flow around the MK headland eddy. At the entrance to BIS, near MK, two additional fronts are observed, one of which was over sand waves. For the headland site front east of MK, without sand waves, during ebb tide, e estimates of 10(-5) to 10(-6) W/kg were observed. The model shows that this front is at the northern end of an anti-cyclonic headland eddy, and within a region of strong tidal mixing. For the headland site front further northeast over sand waves, maximum c estimates were of order 10(-4) W/kg within a background of order 10(-7)-10(-6) W/kg. From the model, this front is at the northeastern edge of the anti-cyclonic headland eddy and within the tidal mixing zone. For the Connecticut River plume front, a surface trapped plume, during ebb tide, maximum epsilon estimates of 10(-5) W/kg were obtained, within a background of 10(-6) to 10(-8) W/kg. Of all four fronts, the river plume front has the largest finescale meansquare shear, S-2 similar to 0.15 s(-2). All of the frontal locations had local values of the buoyancy Reynolds number indicating strong isotropic turbulence at the dissipation scales. Local values of the Froude number indicated shear instability in all of the fronts. Published by Elsevier B.V.

AB This research addresses the design of an Adaptive Fuzzy Sliding-Mode Control (AFSMC) for a group of nonlinear under-actuated systems with unknown input gain functions. In the proposed approach, to provide a structure for controlling the under-actuated subsystem, the sliding manifold corresponding to the whole dynamic system is derived based on the backstepping technique. In addition, two separate fuzzy inference systems are utilized for approximating the system's internal dynamics and the unknown input gain function. In order to derive the robust part of the controller, a novel method is proposed to define the upper bound of the uncertain term in the form of a state-dependent second-degree polynomial. It should be mentioned that the output vectors of the fuzzy systems and the coefficients of the robust part of the controller are obtained by the designed adaptation laws. The asymptotic stability analysis for the proposed AFSMC structure is provided by the second theorem of Lyapunov and Barbalat's lemma. In the end, the AFSMC effectuality is confirmed by the depth control of a REMUS Autonomous Underwater Vehicle (AUV).

AB The applicability of SLAM algorithms is largely limited to the assumption of scene rigidity. Moreover, dynamic object perception is an essential technique for many robotic applications such as autonomous driving and multi-robot collaboration. In this letter, we present PointSLOT, an online, real-time and general stereo system that simultaneously performs SLAM and dynamic object tracking without any artificial priors. Unlike previous SLOT systems, we explicitly identify moving and static objects by computing the object motion probabilities, such that features from static objects are utilized to improve the camera pose estimation instead of treating all object regions as outliers. Based on the camera-centric parameterization for the object pose, the trajectories and dynamic landmarks of multi-keyframe objects are efficiently computed through an object-based bundle adjustment approach. The evaluations on KITTI datasets and real-world experiments show that the proposed system achieves comparable results to state-of-the-art solutions on both camera motion estimation and dynamic object tracking. The open-source code is available at https://github.com/pkzhou/PointSLOT.

AB One of significant tasks in autonomous vehicle technology is traffic signs recognizing. It helps to avoid traffic violations on the road. However, recognition of traffic signs becomes more complicated in bad weather such as lack of light, rain, fog. Those bad weather conditions cause low accuracy of detecting and recognizing. In this paper, we aim to build a model to recognize and classify the traffic signs in different bad weather conditions by applying deep learning technique. Weather data are collected from variety types as well as generated from different techniques. Collected data are trained on the YOLOv5s, YOLOv7 model. In order to increase the accuracy, those YOLOv5s are improved on different models by replacing Squeeze-and-Excitation (SE) attention module or Global Context(GC) block. On the test set: the accuracy of YOLOv5s is 76.8%, the accuracy of YOLOv7 is 78% the accuracy of YOLOv5s+SE attention module is 78.4% and the accuracy of YOLOv5s+C3GC is 79.2%. The results show that YOLOv5s+C3GC model significantly improves the accuracy in recognition of blurred-distant-objects.

AB With the progress and development of modern industry, it is urgent to develop a more general and mature predefined time control theory system for uncertain nonlinear systems and apply it to practical engineering systems. Therefore, a novel predefined-time sliding mode control is designed to improve the slow convergence speed of asymptotically convergent controllers and finite-time convergent controllers affected by the initial state of the system. The proposed control approach is proved to converge from the initial value to the balance position using Jensen's inequality and Liapunov theorem. The proposed control method can deal with the ship motion system having six Degree-Of-Freedom (DOF) under external disturbance and parameter uncertainty. Furthermore, there are several application scenarios to simulate the proposed algorithm, such as the ship which is required to achieve ideal control accuracy in a short and fixed time. Alternatively, an unmanned ship is required to arrive at the desired location within the specified time. To sum up, this algorithm can extend some existing theoretical results on finite-time and fixed-time control to the predefined-time case.

AB This paper studies an input to state stabilizing control of networked control systems (NCSs) under a specified packet dropout rate. By considering packet dropouts in the NCSs, the transmission intervals are categorized by small delay intervals (packet-dropout-free case) and large delay intervals (packet-dropout case). Based on such classifications, we establish the concept of average packet dropout rate (ADR) to characterize the quality of service (QoS) for networks. Then, a switched systems approach is used to derive the ISS (input to state stability) conditions by exploiting Lyapunov theory and input delay approach for a specified ADR. In what follows, the controller design method for the NCSs under a specified ADR is reached by solving linear matrix inequalities (LMIs). According to the proposed results, a control and communication co-design method is developed such that one can design the controller gain according to QoS. Finally, simulations on self-steering control of autonomous vehicles are presented to verify the effectiveness of the proposed co-design method. (C) 2021 ISA. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB With the development of autonomous driving, augmented reality, and other fields, it is becoming increasingly important for machines to more accurately and comprehensively perceive their surrounding environment. LiDAR is one of the most important tools used by machines to obtain information about the surrounding environment. However, because of occlusion, the point cloud data obtained by LiDAR are not the complete shape of the object, and completing the incomplete point cloud shape is of great significance for further data analysis, such as classification and segmentation. In this study, we examined the completion of a 3D point cloud and improved upon the FoldingNet auto-encoder. Specifically, we used the encoder-decoder architecture to design our point cloud completion network. The encoder part uses the transformer module to enhance point cloud feature extraction, and the decoder part changes the 2D lattice used by the A network into a 3D lattice so that the network can better fit the shape of the 3D point cloud. We conducted experiments on point cloud datasets sampled from the ShapeNet car-category CAD models to verify the effectiveness of the various improvements made to the network.

ID STABILITY ANALYSIS; UNDERWATER; DESIGN; LOGIC
AB This study provides a new embedded linear model (ELM) three-dimensional fuzzy PID control method for a bionic autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV), which is disturbed by ocean waves. The uncertainty of the ocean waves will make it difficult for the AUV to achieve good sailing quality, especially near the sea surface. In view of this problem, an ELM fuzzy PID controller, which adopts three-dimensional fuzzy control rules, is designed. In the ELM fuzzy PID controller, a linear model of AUV is established in order to actively perceive the effect of waves on AUV. Hence, the wave disturbance can be reflected in the control signal earlier and faster. Finally, three simulations are carried out to verify the control effect of the ELM fuzzy PID controller. An ocean wave disturbance model is established in order to simulate the force and the moment acting on the AUV. The results imply that compared with the classical PID controller and normal fuzzy PID controller, the ELM fuzzy PID controller can significantly enhance the stability of AUV and make the response faster and overshoot smaller.

AB The vibration noise of the distributed drive autonomous ground vehicle (AGV) is mainly produced by the inverter-fed brushless DC permanent magnet in-wheel motor (PMIWM). It is necessary to reduce the vibration noise level of the PMIWM driven by pulse width modulation (PWM). A suppression approach of electromagnetic vibration noise for the PMIWM is investigated. First, the air gap magnetic field of the inverter-fed PMIWM was analyzed. The electric current harmonics and the unbalanced magnetic force (UMF) were investigated. The natural frequency and noise of the PMIWM were presented. Then, a flux-weaken approach was employed to maintain the robustness of the PMIWM when a sudden drop of DC bus voltage. The random switching frequency (RSF) PWM control method based on a two-state Markov chain is proposed to decrease the amplitude of the harmonics caused by the switching frequency and the multiple switching frequencies. The experimental results show that the RSFPWM can not only effectively reduce the vibration noise and the inverter losses, but also improve the robustness of the PMIWM control system under unpredictable uncertainties.

   Map for Monocular SLAM in Urban Environment

ID VISUAL SLAM; OBJECT
AB In this letter, we propose a novel semantic direct monocular simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) system that fuses the semantic information obtained by an advanced deep neural network (DNN) into direct sparse odometry with loop closure(LDSO), with the purpose of improving the localization accuracy and building a dense semanticmap of the urban environment. For localization, we apply a point reselection strategy based on coarse semantic plane (CSP) constraints to discard static points inconsistent with the nearby co-plane points of the same semantic class and dynamic points beyond the visible range. Moreover, a point group movement consistency (PGMC) check is utilized to decrease the impact of moving dynamic objects. For the dense semantic map, we model numerous small semantic planes from well-estimated points to measure the depth of each static pixel, rather than conduct stereo matching. Experimental results show that our method is more accurate than LDSO and comparable with ORB-SLAM in terms of localization. Moreover, it is capable of building a dense semantic map of the urban environment for better scene understanding.

AB While delineating the connection between transportation accessibility and economic activity has long been a topic of interest in geography and regional science, a better understanding of the agglomerative benefits of transportation systems is vital. This paper seeks to tie the concepts of accessibility and agglomeration together by arguing that accessibility benefits ultimately stem from the agglomerative potential created by various transportation investments. This line of reasoning provides an avenue to use the economic mechanisms described in agglomeration theory to analyze the effects of specific transportation modes. To do this, the paper traces the literature on the economic impacts of transportation systems and presents a theoretical framework for understanding the connection between specific transportation modes and specific agglomeration benefits. Ultimately, specific modes have unique features that are more or less conducive to specific agglomeration benefits, to which specific types of businesses also respond. These specific connections are particularly important to understand as the development of new urban transportation modes, for example, autonomous vehicles-and their potential economic impacts-increases rapidly.

AB In recent years, underwater video technologies allow us to explore the ocean in scientific and noninvasive ways, such as environmental monitoring, marine ecology studies, and fisheries management. However the low-light and high-noise scenarios pose great challenges for the underwater image and video analysis. We here propose a CNN knowledge transfer framework for underwater object recognition and tackle the problem of extracting discriminative features from relatively low contrast images. Even with the insufficient training set, the transfer framework can well learn a recognition model for the special underwater object recognition task together with the help of data augmentation. For better identifying objects from an underwater video, a weighted probabilities decision mechanism is introduced to identify the object from a series of frames. The proposed framework can be implemented for real-time underwater object recognition on autonomous underwater vehicles and video monitoring systems. To verify the effectiveness of our method, experiments on a public dataset are carried out. The results show that the proposed method achieves promising results for underwater object recognition on both test image datasets and underwater videos. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB This paper presents supervision and control power system for photovoltaic generators with battery storage. The system consists of a photovoltaic (PV) generators and a battery bank supplying kept a load. Two applications are presented throughout this paper. In the first one, the load is made variable while in the second it is considered constant in a case of water pumping. The maximum power point tracking (MPPT) algorithm is applied to reach the maximum power of PV panels. In this work, two algorithms have been used. A supervision unit is also provided to allow maximum power production for the PV generator, protect the batteries against overcharge and deep discharge and satisfies the energy needs. The simulation results under Matlab/Simulink for the two applications show that the proposed supervisor makes the autonomous photovoltaic system capable of working normally by charging and discharging batteries no matter what the meteorological conditions are. This fact guarantees the effectiveness of the proposed applications. (C) 2017 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB A data-driven generalization of the crossover model is proposed, characterizing the human control of systems with both integer and fractional-order plant dynamics. The model is developed and validated using data obtained from human subjects operating in compensatory and pursuit tracking tasks. From the model, it is inferred that humans possess a limited but consistent capability to compensate for fractional-order plant dynamics. Further, a review of potential sources of fractionality within such man-machine systems suggests that visual perception, based on visual cues that contain memory, and muscular dynamics are likely sources of fractional-order dynamics within humans themselves. Accordingly, a possible mechanism for fractional-order compensation, operating between visual and muscular subsystems, is proposed. Deeper analysis of the data shows that human response is more highly correlated to fractional-order representations of visual cues, rather than directly to objective engineering variables, as is commonly proposed in human control models in the literature. These results are expected to underpin future design developments in human-in-the-loop cyber-physical systems, for example, in semi-autonomous highway driving.

AB Using mobile robots or unmanned vehicles to assist optimal wireless sensors deployment in a working space can significantly enhance the capability to investigate unknown environments. This paper addresses the issues of the application of numerical optimization and computer simulation techniques to on-line calculation of a wireless sensor network topology for monitoring and tracking purposes. We focus on the design of a self-organizing and collaborative mobile network that enables a continuous data transmission to the data sink (base station) and automatically adapts its behavior to changes in the environment to achieve a common goal. The pre-defined and self-configuring approaches to the mobile-based deployment of sensors are compared and discussed. A family of novel algorithms for the optimal placement of mobile wireless devices for permanent monitoring of indoor and outdoor dynamic environments is described. They employ a network connectivity-maintaining mobility model utilizing the concept of the virtual potential function for calculating the motion trajectories of platforms carrying sensors. Their quality and utility have been justified through simulation experiments and are discussed in the final part of the paper.

TI Dual-Tracked Mobile Robot for Motion in Challenging Terrains
SO JOURNAL OF FIELD ROBOTICS
LA English
DT Article
AB In this paper we present a novel design for a dual-tracked mobile robot. The robot is designed for safe, stable, and reliable motion in challenging terrains, tunnels, and confined spaces. It consists of two tracked platforms connected with a semipassive mechanism. Sensors attached to the connecting mechanism provide redundant localization data that improve the vehicle's autonomous dead reckoning. Each tracked platform mechanically backs up the other platform, resulting in a more robust and reliable operation. The load share between the platforms enables a high payload-to-weight ratio even on soft and slippery terrains. The robot's configurations make it suitable for motion in confined spaces such as underground tunnels, collapsed structures, pipes, and caves. The paper presents the mechanical design of the robot, its kinematic model, stability analysis, and a motion planner. Experimental results conducted on prototype models in various types of environments verify the robot capabilities to operate successfully on challenging terrains. The dual-tracked robot is capable of climbing slopes 50% steeper than a single robot can. Moreover, the improved odometry system shows high accuracy with 2% error of the total travel distance.

AB New high-resolution autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) seafloor images, with 1 m lateral resolution and 0.3 m vertical resolution, reveal unexpected seafloor rugosity and low-relief (<10 m), discontinuous conduits over similar to 70 km(2). Continuous channel thalwegs were interpreted originally from lower-resolution images, but newly acquired AUV data indicate that a single sinuous channel fed a series of discontinuous lower-relief channels. These discontinuous channels were created by at least four avulsion events. Channel relief, defined as the height from the thalweg to the levee crest, controls avulsions and overall stratigraphic architecture of the depositional area. Flow-stripped turbidity currents separated into and reactivated multiple channels to create a distributary pattern and developed discontinuous trains of cyclic scours and megaflutes, which may be erosional precursors to continuous channels. The diverse features now imaged in the Lucia Chica channel system (offshore California) are likely common in modern and ancient systems with similar overall morphologies, but have not been previously mapped with lower-resolution detection methods in any of these systems.

AB Autonomous aerial vehicles play an important role in military applications such as in search, surveillance and reconnaissance. Multi-player stochastic pursuit-evasion (PE) differential game is a natural model for such operations involving intelligent moving targets with uncertainties. In this paper, some fundamental issues of stochastic PE games are addressed. We first model a general stochastic niulti-player PE differential game with perfect state information. To avoid the difficulty of multiplicity of the players, we extend the iterative method for deterministic multi-player PE games to the stochastic case. Starting from certain suboptimal solutions with an improving property, the optimization based on limited look-ahead can be used for improvement. The process converges when this improvement is applied iteratively. Furthermore, we introduce a hierarchical approach that can determine a valid starting point of the iterative process. As a basis for multi-player games, stochastic two-player PE games are also addressed. We also briefly discuss the games with imperfect state information and propose a suboptimal approach from a practical point of view. Finally, we demonstrate the usefulness and the feasibility of the method through simulations. Copyright (c) 2007 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB As low-cost and highly autonomous ocean observation platforms, underwater gliders encounter risks during their launch and recovery, especially when coordinating multi-glider deployments. This work focuses on cooperative path planning of an underwater glider fleet with simultaneous launch and recovery to enhance the autonomy of sampling and reduce deployment risks. Specifically, the gliders collaborate to achieve sampling considering the specified routines of interest. The overall paths to be planned are divided into four rectangular parts with the same starting point, and each glider is assigned a local sampling route. A clipped-oriented line-of-sight algorithm is proposed to ensure the coverage of the desired edges. The pitch angle of the glider is selected as the optimizing parameter to coordinate the overall progress considering the susceptibility of gliders to currents and the randomness of paths produced by complex navigational strategies. Therefore, a multi-actuation deep-Q network algorithm is proposed to ensure simultaneous launch and recovery. Simulation results demonstrate the acceptable effectiveness of the proposed method.

AB This work addresses the pursuit-evasion problem of capturing a Differential Drive Robot (DDR) with a Dubins Car (DC) in minimum time. We model the problem as a zero-sum differential game, and using differential game theory, we compute the time-optimal motion strategies of the players near the end of the game. We unveil the existence of three singular surfaces: an Evader's Dispersal Surface (EDS), a Transition Surface (TS), where the DDR switches its controls, and a Pursuer's Universal Surface (PUS). A particular set of motion strategies for the players is used at each singular surface. To compute our solution, we assume that both players have the same maximum speed and a bounded turning ratio. Considering the previous setting, the game's outcome only depends on the particular motion capabilities of the players. From previous results in the literature and those presented in the current paper, we can establish that a DDR has an advantage when it plays as a pursuer or as an evader compared to a Dubins Car performing the same role.

AB Traffic sign recognition and autonomous vehicles computing are a few of the innovative applications which are emerging in the domain of mobile edge computing. Distributed machine learning in the form of Federated Learning (FL) has been applied to mobile edge computing through a range of methodologies and techniques for intelligent feature classification approaches. The challenges that research on such FL methods is facing is twofold: identify an optimal distributed architecture and algorithm components to each side to meet the demand of heavy data processing, and enhance the algorithm components with heuristics that fit to the problem domain and optimize the key parameters of the algorithms. In this prospect, we present a Federated Learning implementation based on a neural network architecture with emphasis to traffic sign image recognition. Our benchmark was tested with two FL strategies seeking an optimal performance model and in reference to a corresponding data set. We present the results of this work while we define the scope of future improvements to our model.

Energy efficiency is primarily dictated by the number of dissimilar energy conversion processes in the system. After combustion, a Compression Ignition (CI) engine must periodically continue to inject fuel to produce mechanical energy, simultaneously generating thermal, acoustic, and fluid energy (in the form of unburnt hydrocarbons, engine coolant, and engine oil). In this paper, we present multiple sets of Shallow Artificial Neural Networks (SANNs), Convolutional Neural Network (CNNs), and K-th Nearest Neighbor (KNN) classifiers, capable of approximating the in-cylinder conditions and informing future optimization and control efforts. The neural networks provide outstanding predictive capabilities of the variables of interest and improve understanding of the energy and power management of a CI engine, leading to improved awareness, efficiency, and resilience at the device and system level.

AB Uncrewed aerial vehicles (UAVs) are continuously gaining popularity in a wide spectrum of applications, while their positioning and navigation most often relies on Global Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSS). However, numerous conditions and practices require UAV operation in GNSS-denied environments, including confined spaces, urban canyons, vegetated areas and indoor places. For the purposes of this study, an integrated UAV navigation system was designed and implemented which utilizes GNSS, visual, depth and inertial data to provide real-time localization. The implementation is built as a package for the Robotic Operation System (ROS) environment to allow ease of integration in various systems. The system can be autonomously adjusted to the flight environment, providing spatial awareness to the aircraft. This system expands the functionality of UAVs, as it enables navigation even in GNSS-denied environments. This integrated positional system provides the means to support fully autonomous navigation under mixed environments, or malfunctioning conditions. Experiments show the capability of the system to provide adequate results in open, confined and mixed spaces.

AB Heading control plays an essential role in improving accuracy of all kinds of navigations for wave gliders. However, the performance will exhibit large heading errors and oscillations caused by weak maneuverability and large ocean current disturbance when the wave glider is gliding at a time-varying velocity. A robust dynamic heading tracking control integrated a modified active disturbance rejection controller (MADRC) and an improved anti-windup (IAW) compensator was put forward in this paper, which could extremely guarantee heading tracking accuracy with appropriate actuator power consumption in real time. Focused on dynamically tracking a time-varying desired heading, a reduced-order extended state observer (RESO) was designed to estimate and compensate uncertain disturbance and reduce the computational complexity. The IAW was applied to deal with actuator saturation problem, which could further reduce convergence time and power consumption in the heading control. Following this, a closed-loop control was put forward with a dynamic model of "Black Pearl" wave glider and a given heading control. The proposed control was verified by simulations and sea trials compared with conventional heading controls, which demonstrated its effectiveness and practicability.

AB The open-frame structure of work-class ROVs results in significant model uncertainties, and its motion is strongly disturbed by the umbilical cable. To address these problems, this article developed a nonlinear disturbance observer-based super-twisting double-loop sliding-mode control (NDO-STDSMC) method to achieve trajectory tracking control of work-class ROVs with system uncertainties and external disturbances. First, a new outer-loop controller with a novel reaching law is designed to increase the convergence rate compared with the existing double-loop sliding-mode control (DSMC). Second, an inner-loop controller that combines the advantages of the super-twisting sliding-mode scheme is proposed to guarantee the tracking error converges to zero in finite time. Then, a nonlinear disturbance observer is designed to estimate and compensate for the system uncertainties and external disturbances. The stability of the overall control system is proven by the Lyapunov approach. Finally, comprehensive simulation studies on trajectory tracking control of work-class ROVs are provided to demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed NDO-STDSMC method and its superiority over existing DSMC and STDSMC methods.

ID MICROLENS ARRAY
AB The light field camera provides a robust way to capture both spatial and angular information within a single shot. One of its important applications is in 3D depth sensing, which can extract depth information from the acquired scene. However, conventional light field cameras suffer from shallow depth of field (DoF). Here, a vari-focal light field camera (VF-LFC) with an extended DoF is newly proposed for mid-range 3D depth sensing applications. As a main lens of the system, a vari-focal lens with four different focal lengths is adopted to extend the DoF up to ~15 m. The focal length of the micro-lens array (MLA) is optimized by considering the DoF both in the image plane and in the object plane for each focal length. By dividing measurement regions with each focal length, depth estimation with high reliability is available within the entire DoF. The proposed VF-LFC is evaluated by the disparity data extracted from images with different distances. Moreover, the depth measurement in an outdoor environment demonstrates that our VF-LFC could be applied in various fields such as delivery robots, autonomous vehicles, and remote sensing drones.

ID CLASSIFICATION; ALGORITHM
AB Sonar is one of the most important tools for underwater object detection and submarine topography reconstruction. To classify sonar images automatically and accurately is essential for the navigation and path planning of autonomous underwater vehicles (AUV). However, for the intensity inhomogeneity and speckle noise in sonar images, it is difficult to obtain segmentation results of high accurate rate. To address these issues, in this paper, we advocate a segmentation method incorporating simple linear iterative clustering (SLIC) and adaptive intensity constraint into Markov random field (MRF), to segment sonar images with intensity inhomogeneity into the object highlight, the object shadow and the background areas. The main procedures of the proposed work are as follows: first, SLIC is used to separate sonar images into homogeneous super pixels, and second the homogeneity patches, with a novel intensity constraint strategy, is utilized to optimize the segmentation result of MRF at each iteration. Experimental results reveal that the proposed method performs well and fast on real sonar images which have intensity inhomogeneity problem. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB A new underwater video compression technique based on adaptive hybrid wavelets,and directional filter banks is proposed to achieve both high coding efficiency and good reconstruction quality at very low-bit rates. A key application is the real-time transmission of video through acoustic channels with limited bandwidth, from an autonomous underwater vehicle to a surface station, e.g., for man-in-the-loop monitoring and inspection operations. For intra-frame coding, the method maintains details in texture regions at relatively low bit rates, and overcomes the ringing artifacts within smooth regions. For inter frame coding, improved efficiency is achieved by making use of: (1) a new spatio-temporal just-noticeable-distortion model to remove perceptual redundancy; (2) motion interpolation to reduce bit rate; and (3) variable-precision in quantizing the residual error. Experiments with underwater video sequences are presented to assess the effectiveness of the proposed approach, in comparison to traditional wavelet-based techniques. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

AB A number of organisms and organelles are capable of self-propulsion at the micro- and nanoscales. Production of simple man-made mimics of biological transportation systems may prove relevant to achieving movement in artificial cells and nano/micronscale robotics that may be of biological and nanotechnological importance. We demonstrate the propulsion of particles based on catalytically controlled molecular self-assembly and fiber formation at the particle surface. Specifically, phosphatase enzymes (acting as the engine) are conjugated to a quantum dot (the vehicle), and are subsequently exposed to micellar aggregates (fuel) that upon biocatalytic dephosphorylation undergo fibrillar self-assembly, which in turn causes propulsion. The motion of individual enzyme/quantum dot conjugates is followed directly using fluorescence microscopy. While overall movement remains random, the enzyme conjugates exhibit significantly faster transport in the presence of the fiber forming system, compared to controls without fuel, a non-self-assembling substrate, or a substrate which assembles into spherical, rather than fibrous structures upon enzymatic dephosphorylation. When increasing the concentration of the fiber-forming fuel, the speed of the conjugates increases compared to non-self-assembling substrate, although directionality remains random.

In this method, multiple LED lamps on the indoor ceiling are used, which can radiate light only during the individual time slot assigned to each of them. Using the RSSRs, circle or straight line equations are obtained and the crossing point among those equations determines the location of the object. In the experiment, four LED lamps are identified by time-division multiplexing with room dimensions of 1.0 x 1.0 x 1.3 m(3), and the results show that the mean of the location error is 3.24 cm in the entire floor area.

AB Ecosystem function will in large part be determined by functional groups present in biological communities. The simplest distinction with respect to functional groups of an ecosystem is the differentiation between primary and secondary producers. A challenge thus far has been to examine these groups simultaneously with sufficient temporal and spatial resolution for observations to be relevant to the scales of change in coastal oceans. This study takes advantage of general differences in the bioluminescence flash kinetics between planktonic dinoflagellates and zooplankton to measure relative abundances of the two groups within the same-time space volume. This novel approach for distinguishing these general classifications using a single sensor is validated using fluorescence data and exclusion experiments. The approach is then applied to data collected from an autonomous underwater vehicle surveying > 500 km in Monterey Bay and San Luis Obispo Bay, CA during the summers of 2002-2004. The approach also reveals that identifying trophic interaction between the two planktonic communities may also be possible. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB A framework for collaborative facility engineering is presented. The framework is based on a distributed problem-solving approach to collaborative facility engineering and employs an integration approach called Agent-Based Software Engineering as an implementation vehicle of this approach. The focal entity of this framework is a Multiagent Design Team (MDT) that comprises a collection of software agents (e.g. design software applications with a certain standard communication interface) and a design specialist, which together perform specific design tasks. Multiagent design teams are autonomous and form an organizational structure based on a federation architecture. Every multiagent design team surrenders its autonomy to a system program called facilitator, which coordinates the interaction among software agents in the federation architecture. Facilitators can be viewed as representatives of one or more teams that facilitate the exchange of design information and knowledge in support of the design tasks they perform. In the federation architecture, design specialists collaborate by exchanging design information with others via their software agents, and by identifying and resolving design conflicts by negotiation. In addition to a discussion of the framework's primary components, its realization in an integrated distributed environment for collaborative building engineering is described.

   adversarial network; Neural style transfer; Convolutional neural
   networks; Deep learning; Autonomous surface vehicles
AB Cyanobacterial Harmful Algal Blooms (CyanoHABs) in lakes and reservoirs have increased substantially in recent decades due to different environmental factors. Its early detection is a crucial issue to minimize health effects, particularly in potential drinking and recreational water bodies. The use of Autonomous Surface Vehicles (ASVs) equipped with machine vision systems (cameras) onboard, represents a useful alternative at this time. In this regard, we propose an image Semantic Segmentation approach based on Deep Learning with Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) for the early detection of CyanoHABs considering an ASV perspective. The use of these models is justified by the fact that with their convolutional architecture, it is possible to capture both, spectral and textural information considering the context of a pixel and its neighbors. To train these models it is necessary to have data, but the acquisition of real images is a difficult task, due to the capricious appearance of the algae on water surfaces sporadically and intermittently over time and after long periods of time, requiring even years and the permanent installation of the image capture system. This justifies the generation of synthetic data so that sufficiently trained models are required to detect CyanoHABs patches when they emerge on the water surface. The data generation for training and the use of the semantic segmentation models to capture contextual information determine the need for the proposal, as well as its novelty and contribution.Three datasets of images containing CyanoHABs patches are generated: (a) the first contains real patches of CyanoHABs as foreground and images of lakes and reservoirs as background, but with a limited number of examples; (b) the second, contains synthetic patches of CyanoHABs generated with state-of-the-art Style-based Generative Adversarial Network Adaptive Discriminator Augmentation (StyleGAN2-ADA) and Neural Style Transfer as foreground and images of lakes and reservoirs as background, and (c) the third set, is the combination of the previous two. Four model architectures for semantic segmentation (UNet++, FPN, PSPNet, and DeepLabV3+), with two encoders as backbone (ResNet50 and EfficientNet-b6), are evaluated from each dataset on real test images and different distributions. The results show the feasibility of the approach and that the UNet++ model with EfficientNet-b6, trained on the third dataset, achieves good generalization and performance for the real test images.& COPY; 2023 The Author(s).

AB Path planning is crucial for (autonomous underwater vehicles)AUVs to achieve autonomy. A proper path-planning method can obtain the optimal path while ensuring the safety of the path. This paper aims to address the issue of significant path-tracking errors arising from the independent research of traditional path-planning algorithms and path-tracking techniques. To this end, a path-planning algorithm based on A* + APF (AplusPF) is proposed for AUVs. This algorithm incorporates AUV kinetics into the iterative process of the A* algorithm and plans a safe and trackable path while fully considering AUV dynamic constraints and position and attitude information. Additionally, the algorithm adds the prediction of AUV trajectory to the heuristic function of the A* algorithm so that the heuristic function is closer to the actual value, thereby improving the algorithm's efficiency. The algorithm combines the APF algorithm to achieve fast and effective obstacle avoidance, thereby solving the problem of the A* algorithm's slow running speed in complex multi-obstacle environments. The effectiveness of the AplusPF algorithm is verified by the simulation results.

AB In this article, we interrogate the utility of conceptualising the 'first and last mile' (FLM) as a 'challenge' to be addressed through automated and integrated mobility services. We critically engage with the concept through a design anthropological approach which takes two steps so as: to complicate literatures that construct the FLM as a place where automated, service-based and micro-mobility innovations will engender sustainable modal choices above individual automobility; and to demonstrate how people's situated mobility competencies and values, shape social and material realities and future imaginaries of everyday mobilities. To do so, we draw on ethnographic research into everyday mobility practices, meanings and imaginaries in a suburban neighbourhood in Sweden. We show how locally situated mobilities both challenge the spatial and temporal underpinnings of the first and last mile concept, and resist universalist technology-driven automation narratives. We argue that instead of attempting to bridge gaps in seemingly linear journeys through automated systems, there is a need to account for the practices, tensions and desires embedded in everyday mobilities.

SO IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON VEHICULAR TECHNOLOGY

DT Article
DE Task offloading; TEE; Edge computing
AB Offloading tasks to edge servers has been regarded as a potential way to solve the computation resource poverty problem of the end devices like autonomous vehicles. However, due to the sharing and openness features of edge computing, it raises severe security problems. In order to combat such issues, Trust Execution Environment (TEE), such as TrustZone, is advocated to strength the security of task offloading to edge computing in the hardware level. For the exploration of TrustZone, the inevitable involvement of cryptographic operations make existing offloading strategies not applicable, or not efficient enough, any more. In addition, TrustZone does not allow multiple tasks to coexist and execute on one CPU core at the same time. Taking the above issues into consideration, we investigate a secure task offloading problem for minimizing the total task completion time under the constraint of energy budget. To address this problem, we propose a Priority-aware Secure Task Offloading (PASTO) algorithm and evaluate the performance of PASTO by both numerical analysis and prototype based experiments. All the experiment results show that PASTO can effectively reduce the total task completion time in comparison with other state-of-the-art offloading approaches in TrustZone-enabled edge clouds.

AB This paper uses data processing techniques to reduce the required transmission bandwidth in ship-to-shore communications. The proposed framework (ONline Efficient Sources Transmission Optimizer -) leverages state-of-the-art technologies and novel algorithms to automatically optimize transmissions under structural (e.g., available bandwidth, fixed packet overhead) and user-defined (e.g., maximum latency) constraints. In addition, authenticates and encrypts the communication between the ship and the shore via mainstream free and open-source software components. Initially, we present the abstract mathematical formulation of the problem, with its assumptions, goal function, constraints, and significant quantities. Then, we introduce the architecture of a system capable of continuously estimating the compressibility, processing and transmission time of streaming data. Such estimations allow to calculate and apply optimal parameters for achieving the best compression ratio. Lastly, using a prototypical implementation, we evaluate the system performance with a Class B ship simulator on two realistic use cases. Our experiments show an excellent compression ratio with maritime protocols (more than 40:1) and a limited latency impact, demonstrating the approach's viability.

AB The field of Continual Learning investigates the ability to learn consecutive tasks without losing performance on those previously learned. The efforts of researchers have been mainly focused on incremental classification tasks. Yet, we believe that continual object detection deserves even more attention due to its vast range of applications in robotics and autonomous vehicles. This scenario is also more complex than conventional classification, given the occurrence of instances of classes that are unknown at the time but can appear in subsequent tasks as a new class to be learned, resulting in missing annotations and conflicts with the background label. In this review, we analyze the current strategies proposed to tackle the problem of class-incremental object detection. Our main contributions are: (1) a short and systematic review of the methods that propose solutions to traditional incremental object detection scenarios; (2) A comprehensive evaluation of the existing approaches using a new metric to quantify the stability and plasticity of each technique in a standard way; (3) an overview of the current trends within continual object detection and a discussion of possible future research directions.

AB DC microgrids have gained a lot of interest recently due to increasing dc loads such as electric vehicles and the penetration of renewable energy sources (RESs). However, DC microgrids face challenges concerning bus voltage fluctuations, which severely impact the system stability when subjected to uncertainties of load and RESs. This paper focuses on maintaining the stability of a DC-bus through voltage control for a dc islanded microgrid using the concept of cascade double-loop control. The rule in cascade double-loop control is based on a proportional-integral (PI) controller tuned through a new nature-inspired African vulture optimization algorithm (AVOA). The paper presents a comparison of the performance of the African vulture optimization algorithm against particle swarm optimization (PSO) under several operating conditions. The simulation considers actual data for the solar irradiance and temperature and sudden load changes. The system is implemented on MATLAB/Simulink. The results demonstrate that the AVOA-based PI controller performs better in voltage regulation than the PSO-based PI controller.

AB This paper summarizes our results and findings made throughout the past years on the way towards a one millimeter thin, flexible, and scalable foil camera. The sensor part of the camera consists of multiple thin-film luminescent concentrator (LC) layers, each of which is sensitive to a different band of the light spectrum. A special optical micro-structure cut into the edges of the LC layers multiplexes the transported light signal into a variant of the Radon transform of the image focused on the LC surface. For increasing the camera's depth of field beyond the sensor surface, various thin-film imaging layers, such as optical Soller collimators realized by means of X-ray lithography on a PMMA wafer, have been investigated. The flexibility and scalability of our thin-film camera has the potential to lead to new human-computer interfaces that are unconstrained in shape and sensing-distance. Applications such as contact-less sensing, smart skin sensors for autonomous robots and industrial machines, and environment sensing for vehicles are imaginable.

ID PERFORMANCE
AB In this research, a next-generation, low-cost triple-frequency GNSS, microelec- tromechanical (MEMS) based inertial measurement unit (IMU), and a patch antenna was used to obtain decimeter-level accuracy in a suburban and urban environment. A unique combination of the low-cost hardware and software constraining was used to bridge the GNSS gaps in an urban environment to pro- vide a continuous, accurate, and reliable position solution that is novel and has not been previously published. The low-cost navigation system demonstrates less than a decimeter-level accuracy in the presence of a sufficient number of satellites. During half a minute of introduced GNSS signal loss, the overall rms of the algorithm is 10-40% better than dual-frequency PPP with IMU, as the sat- ellite availability reduces. The results obtained during partial GNSS availability indicate a significant step forward in the low-cost navigation area for applica- tions like low-cost autonomous vehicles, intelligent transportation systems, etc. that demand a decimeter level of accuracy.

AB Joint communication and localization will be a key in beyond 5G networks for emerging context-aware applications such as Internet-of-Things and autonomous vehicles. In particular, millimeter wave (mmWave) networks using a massive number of antennas and large bandwidth are considered for high-rate communication and high-accuracy localization. In mmWave networks, beamforming (BF) and power allocation need to be jointly designed to simultaneously achieve high data rates and high localization accuracies. This paper proposes cooperative BF and power allocation scheme with multiple base stations to maximize the weighted sum rate of mobile stations while guaranteeing position and orientation estimation error bounds. The proposed scheme consists of two stages. In the first stage, pilot overhead is minimized while satisfying the accuracy constraints. In the second stage, the weighted sum rate for data transmission is maximized based on the estimated channel information. Numerical results show that the proposed scheme achieves a larger rate-accuracy region compared to conventional schemes.

AB As a part of emergency landing architecture for multi-rotor, a fault-tolerant trajectory tracking control strategy is proposed in this paper to control a quadcopter in case of a partial motor fault. The introduction of fault-tolerant strategy includes a lightweight fault detection and identification algorithm and a three-loop tracking controller. The lightweight fault detection and identification algorithm identifies the fault based on the controller outputs and the angular rates calculated by a discrete extended Kalman filter. The three-loop controller comprises a cascade structure of a discrete nonlinear adaptive algorithm in the inner-loop and a PID algorithm in the outer-loops of the controller structure. To have more realistic simulations, the gyroscopic effects of rotors and the airframe drag terms are considered in modeling as the model uncertainty. The simulation results demonstrate that the proposed fault-tolerant controller can effectively control the quadcopter in presence of partial motor fault, model uncertainties, and sensor noises. The results also demonstrate the effect of fault detection time delay on the overall control performance.

ID VISION
AB Lane detection on road segments with complex topologies such as lane merge/split and highway ramps is not yet a solved problem. This paper presents a novel graph-embedded solution. It consists of two key parts, a learning-based low-level lane feature extraction algorithm, and a graph-embedded lane inference algorithm. The former reduces the over-reliance on customized annotated/labeled lane data. We leveraged several open-source semantic segmentation datasets (e.g., Cityscape, Vistas, and Apollo) and designed a dedicated network that can be trained across these heterogeneous datasets to extract lane attributes. The latter algorithm constructs a graph to represent the lane geometry and topology. It does not rely on strong geometric assumptions such as lane lines are a set of parallel polynomials. Instead, it constructs a graph based on detected lane nodes. The lane parameters in the world coordinate are inferred by efficient graph-based searching and calculation. The performance of the proposed method is verified on both open source and our own collected data. On-vehicle experiments were also conducted and the comparison with Mobileye EyeQ2 shows favorable results.

AB Understanding the surrounding environment of the vehicle is still one of the challenges for autonomous driving. This paper addresses 360-degree road scene semantic segmentation using surround view cameras, which are widely equipped in existing production cars. First, in order to address large distortion problem in the fisheye images, Restricted Deformable Convolution (RDC) is proposed for semantic segmentation, which can effectively model geometric transformations by learning the shapes of convolutional filters conditioned on the input feature map. Second, in order to obtain a large-scale training set of surround view images, a novel method called zoom augmentation is proposed to transform conventional images to fisheye images. Finally, an RDC based semantic segmentation model is built; the model is trained for real-world surround view images through a multi-task learning architecture by combining real-world images with transformed images. Experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the RDC to handle images with large distortions, and that the proposed approach shows a good performance using surround view cameras with the help of the transformed images.

AB The warehouse is one of the essential components of logistics and supply chains. The efficiency of the whole chain is affected by the performance of warehouse operations and, more particularly, the storage and retrieval of goods. This paper considers a storage and retrieval problem in a real warehouse with random storage and different types of forklifts, depending on the locations they can access. The problem deals with selecting locations to store/retrieve a predefined set of pallets, assigning an adequately skilled forklift to each operation and determining the order in which each forklift will perform its operations so that the total employed time is minimized. The problem is solved heuristically by decomposing it into three subproblems, each one handling one of the three key decisions of the problem, and taking into account congestion considerations. The paper also studies two modifications of the problem, adding secondary objective functions. Computational results compare the effectiveness of the proposed algorithms for the different problems in a stochastic environment via simulation.

AB Robotic technologies, whether they are remotely operated vehicles, autonomous agents, assistive devices, or novel control interfaces, offer many promising capabilities for deployment in real-world environments. Postdisaster scenarios are a particularly relevant target for applying such technologies, due to the challenging conditions faced by rescue workers and the possibility to increase their efficacy while decreasing the risks they face. However, field-deployable technologies for rescue work have requirements for robustness, speed, versatility, and ease of use that may not be matched by the state of the art in robotics research. This paper aims to survey the current state of the art in ground and aerial robots, marine and amphibious systems, and human-robot control interfaces and assess the readiness of these technologies with respect to the needs of first responders and disaster recovery efforts. We have gathered expert opinions from emergency response stakeholders and researchers who conduct field deployments with them to understand these needs, and we present this assessment as a way to guide future research toward technologies that will make an impact in real-world disaster response and recovery.

ID MISALIGNMENTS
AB Inductive power transfer (IPT) realizes no physical connection and make it possible to be a substitute for conductive charging in autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) power feeding applications. However, in marine environment, the seawater stream vibration could bring disturbance and change the primary and secondary parameters, which reduces the stability of the power transmission system. This paper proposes a concentric circular ring structure applied in AUV's IPT system for resisting the disturbance of ocean current. The study focuses on its misalignment tolerance. It is found that the 3rd coupler (19:24 turns) has better tolerance on axial misalignment among the three couplers with different secondary winding turns. It improves the coupling coefficient reduction from 34.7% to 23.6% when the axial misalignment varies from 0 to 50 mm and the radial displacement almost has no influence on coupling coefficient if radial misalignment is much smaller than the diameter of coils. Experiment results show that the system efficiency drops from 93.2% to 82.4%, when the axial misalignment changes from 0 to 50 mm. (C) 2018 Author(s).

AB The Arctic region is known to be severely affected by climate change, with evident alterations in both physical and biological processes. Monitoring the Arctic Ocean ecosystem is key to understanding the impact of natural and human-induced change on the environment. Large data sets are required to monitor the Arctic marine ecosystem and validate high-resolution satellite observations (e.g., Sentinel), which are necessary to feed climatic and biogeochemical forecasting models. However, the Global Observing System needs to complete its geographic coverage, particularly for the harsh, extreme environment of the Arctic Region. In this scenario, autonomous systems are proving to be valuable tools for increasing the resolution of existing data. To this end, a low-cost, miniaturized and flexible probe, ArLoC (Arctic Low-Cost probe), was designed, built and installed on an innovative unmanned marine vehicle, the PROTEUS (Portable RObotic TEchnology for Unmanned Surveys), during a preliminary scientific campaign in the Svalbard Archipelago within the UVASS project. This study outlines the instrumentation used and its design features, its preliminary integration on PROTEUS and its test results.

AB Intelligent Systems for autonomous vehicles including drone, robot vision, and video surveillance, need to distinguish pedestrian from other object. Pedestrian detection is an essential and significant research topic due to its diverse applications. In this paper, a new visual distinctiveness detection method for pedestrian is proposed based on the statistically weighting probabilistic latent semantic analysis. We detect the distinctiveness by integrating three steps as follows: first representing the co-ocurrence matrix of images, which were vectorized using the bag of visual words (BoVW) framework; then calculating the weights through the histograms of visual words of each class; and finally applying the weights to the test images as the distinctiveness of visual words. The probabilistic latent semantic analysis (PLSA) was used as classification method in our system. We extracted the weighted visual words by sampling the patches from the current image. The proposed method was compared to the PLSA using the Caltech 256 datasets. The classes used include pedestrians, cars, motorbikes, airplanes and horses. The results of the experiment show that the proposed method outperforms current methods in predicting pedestrians and transportation objects.

AB Terrain classification is a critical component of any autonomous mobile robot system operating in unknown real-world environments. Over the years, several proprioceptive terrain classification techniques have been introduced to increase robustness or act as a fallback for traditional vision based approaches. However, they lack widespread adaptation due to various factors that include inadequate accuracy, robustness and slow run-times. In this paper, we use vehicle-terrain interaction sounds as a proprioceptive modality and propose a deep long-short term memory based recurrent model that captures both the spatial and temporal dynamics of such a problem, thereby overcoming these past limitations. Our model consists of a new convolution neural network architecture that learns deep spatial features, complemented with long-short term memory units that learn complex temporal dynamics. Experiments on two extensive datasets collected with different microphones on various indoor and outdoor terrains demonstrate state-of-the-art performance compared to existing techniques. We additionally evaluate the performance in adverse acoustic conditions with high-ambient noise and propose a noise-aware training scheme that enables learning of more generalizable models that are essential for robust real-world deployments.

AB Precision agriculture has been implemented in various cultivation operations for various crops. Recently, autonomous mower tractor with variable rate fertilization has been tried. Variable rate fertilization requires quantification of grass growth level. Objective of this study was to compare the performance of potential sensors under different growth levels and sensor operation conditions. A CCD camera, an ultrasonic module, and an optical reflectance sensor (i.e., Crop Circle) were tested at fields with different grass growth levels. Effects of sensor mounting height and angle were investigated. Effects of vehicle (i.e., mower tractor) vibration and traveling were also investigated: under static, vibration and no traveling, and vibration with traveling conditions. Results showed that sensor mounting height had a little effect on the sensor performance, and grass growth level was successfully quantified. Camera angle of 90 degrees showed the best performance with less noise. The ultrasonic sensor could work with less deviation under static condition, whereas, CCD camera proved the applicability under all operating conditions. Operation condition of the optical reflectance sensor showed a little effect on the grass growth detection results. This study would provide information useful for automated grass growth mapping and variable fertilization recommendation.

AB We present a magnetic inversion method in the space domain using Akaike's Bayesian information criterion (ABIC). The horizontal variation of magnetization intensity is represented by a linear combination of bicubic B spline functions, and the problem is set to determine the expansion coefficients. A prior constraint on the roughness of the magnetization variation is incorporated in order to suppress the numerical instability. The ABIC give us the optimal weight of the prior constraint relative to the requirement of fitting the observed data, which is statistically determined from the quality and quantity of the data based on the entropy maximization principle. We applied this method to actual deep-sea magnetic data collected by using an autonomous underwater vehicle and successfully obtained a magnetization distribution that adequately accounts for the observation. The solution does not suffer from the inevitable smoothing due to high-cut filtering or an error caused by reducing the data onto a flat surface as sometimes happens in current inversion methods. Our method is especially useful in handling data collected along a surface of extreme topography over a relatively small area.

AB An autonomous robot will have to detect moving obstacles online before it can plan its collision-free path, while navigating in a dynamic environment. The robot collects information about the environment with the help of a camera and determines the inputs for its motion planner through image analysis. The present article deals with issues related to camera calibration and online image processing. The problem of camera calibration is treated as an optimization problem and solved using a genetic algorithm so as to achieve minimum distorted image plane error. The calibrated vision system is then utilized for the detection and identification of the objects by analysing the images collected at regular intervals. For image processing. five different operations. such as median filtering, thresholding, perimeter estimation, labelling and size filtering, have been carried out. To show the effectiveness of the developed camera-based vision system, inputs of the motion planner of a navigating robot are calculated for two different cases. It is observed that online detection of the shapes and configurations of the obstacles is possible by using the vision system developed.

AB Advances in a fuzzy decision theory that allow automatic cooperation between unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) are discussed. The algorithms determine points the UAVs are to sample, flight paths, and the optimal UAVs for the task and related changes during the mission. Human intervention is not required after the mission begins. The algorithms take into account what is known before and during the mission about UAV reliability, fuel, and kinematics as well as the measurement space's meteorological states, terrain, air traffic, threats and related uncertainties. The fuzzy decision tree for path assignment is a significant advance over an older fuzzy decision rule that was previously introduced. Simulations show the ability of the control algorithm to allow UAVs to effectively cooperate to increase the UAV team's likelihood of successfully measuring the atmospheric index of refraction over a large volume. A genetic program (GP) based data mining procedure is discussed for automatically evolving fuzzy decision trees. The GP is used to automatically create the fuzzy decision tree for real-time UAV path assignments. The GP based procedure offers several significant advances over previously introduced GP based data mining procedures. These advances help produce mathematically concise fuzzy decision trees that are consistent with human intuition.

AB Road detection is a key issue for autonomous driving in urban traffic. In this paper, after a brief overview of existing methods, we present a road-area detection algorithm based on color images. This algorithm is composed of two modules: boundaries are first estimated based on the intensity image and road areas are subsequently detected based on the full color image. In the first module, an edge image of the scene is analyzed to obtain the candidates for the left and right road borders and to delimit the area that will subsequently be used to compute the mean and variance of the Gaussian distribution, assumed to be obeyed by the color components of road surfaces. The second module effectively extracts the road area and reinforces boundaries that most appropriately fit the road-extraction result. The combination of these modules can overcome basic problems due to inaccuracies in edge detection based on the intensity image alone and due to the computational complexity of segmentation algorithms based on color images. Experimental results on real road scenes have substantiated the effectiveness of the proposed method.

AB This paper proposes two methods that give intelligence to automatically guided vehicles (AGVs). In order to drive AGVs autonomously, two types of problems need to be overcome. They are the AGV navigation problem and collision avoidance problem. The first problem has been well known since 1980s. A new method based on the feature scene recognition and acquisition is proposed. The sparse distributed memory neural network (SDM) is employed for the scene recognition and acquisition. The navigation route for the AGV is learnt by use of Q-learning depending on the recognized and acquired scenes. The second problem is described as mutual understanding of behaviors between AGVs, The method of mutual understanding is proposed by the use of Q-learning. Those two methods are combined together for driving plural AGVs autonomously to deliver raw materials between machine tools in a factory. They are incorporated into the AGVs as the machine intelligence. In experimental simulations, it is verified that the first proposed method call guide the AGV to the suitable navigation and that the second method can acquire knowledge of mutual understanding of the AGVs' behaviors.

ID PARAMETER-ESTIMATION
AB Flying targets are becoming increasingly maneuverable, contributing to the growing problem of their detection with active and passive radars. Rapid acceleration causes blurring of the target echo on the range-Doppler (RD) map, which reduces the signal-to-noise ratio in a given range and velocity cell. This article proposes a novel, nonparametric approach to quickly and efficiently estimating target acceleration on the RD map. In this article, a universal signal model for an active frequency-modulated continuous wave radar and a passive radar is introduced. Based on this model, an estimation algorithm has been developed that can be applied to both active and passive radars. Compared with the method known from the literature, the proposed solution is much faster (even more than $\mathbf {100}$ times) while maintaining numerical stability and allowing for the estimation of acceleration of many targets to be performed simultaneously. The proposed method was supported by simulation tests and signals from real-life active and passive radars observing a jet fighter and a drone. The obtained outcomes show that the proposed technique can be successfully used for autonomous real-time systems that detect and estimate the parameters of maneuvering vehicles.

TI Positioning method of expressway ETC gantry by multi-source traffic data

LA English
DT Article; Early Access
AB With the rapid development of expressway Electronic Toll Collection (ETC) technology in China, the expressway management system is becoming digital and intelligent, which provides a solid foundation for expressway vehicle infrastructure cooperation and autonomous driving. The gantry position is the key part of the ETC system. However, there are still some problems (e.g. gantry position missing or false), which can seriously affect the intelligent development of expressways. To address these two issues, an ETC gantry positioning method is proposed. First, the ETC transaction data and the GPS data on expressways are preprocessed to remove abnormal data and retrieve missed data. Then, combined with Dead Reckoning (DR) and Median Center, the potential position of the gantry is calculated from ETC transaction data and GPS data. Finally, the switching strategy based on Kalman Filter (KF) is used to capture the final gantry position. By comparing the results of the proposal with the collected gantry position, it is found that the positioning error of the gantry position calculated by this proposal is about 37 m. The positioning accuracy is 98.78% with the threshold of 100 m. The experimental results show that the proposal can effectively locate the expressway gantry.

AB This paper evaluates an overhead robotic compact storage and retrieval system (ORCSRS), which is a novel automated compact system where basic storage and handling containers are stacked on top of one another to form bin stacks on each plane. Bin-picking robots and track changing robots are assigned to carry bins with the target stock keeping units (SKUs) to the picker to fulfill orders. We develop a discrete event simulation model to analyze the performance of an ORCSRS in terms of efficiency and energy consumption. Performance indicators such as throughput, robot utilization, and system energy consumption are obtained for both single-SKU and multi-SKUs cases and both dedicated and shared storage policies coupled with random and zoned stacks. Our results provide valuable suggestions for the optimal design of an ORCSRS, such as the best layout for optimizing throughput, number of robots required to achieve a given throughput in a limited warehouse area, and the maximum number of bins that should be stored in one stack.

AB In this paper, a new robust controller is developed and analyzed for an autonomous vehicle (AV) with nonholonomic dynamics driving in a 2D plane that can avoid colliding with a set of obstacles despite the presence of uncertainties in the mathematical model of the AV. The state variables and their velocities are considered to be measurable (two simple coordinates and three angles). The controller is based on the integral sliding mode (ISM) concept, which aims to minimize the current state's convex (but not necessarily strongly convex) function. A cost function's subgradient is likewise designed to be measured online. The averaged subgradient (ASG) technique is used to build and analyze an optimization algorithm. The major findings show that the intended regime (non-stationary analogue of sliding surface) can be reached from the start of the process and deriving an explicit upper bound for the cost function decrement, i.e., proving functional convergence and estimating the rate of convergence, thereby allowing for multiple obstacle avoidance. The proposed strategy is shown to perform effectively with a numerical example.

ID PERFORMANCE ANALYSIS; SYSTEMS
AB Changes in the environment, such as landslides, tsunamis, rising or falling sea levels in coastal oceans, and neighboring land surfaces, significantly impact the structure of the ocean and human life. These natural climate-change processes have unanticipated and deadly consequences for coastal areas. The continental margin part of the ocean has recently attracted the most attention because of the mineral sources and human activities such as exploration, navigation, recreation, and fishing. The continental margin stretches from the coastal mountains and plains to continental shelf, slope, and rise, where terrestrial and maritime means meet. In this paper, we propose a reconfigurable underwater optical wireless sensor network (UOWSN) based on underwater wireless optical communication (UWOC) to monitor and discover continental margin ore deposits. In this proposed system, a transceiver on the underwater wireless autonomous vehicle moving around the different regions of the continental margin collects information and transmits it to the seashore control station once it reaches the ocean surface. We investigated the outage probability and average bit error rate of the proposed system at the continental margin and used coding techniques to mitigate the effects of high turbulence in the continental shelf region.

AB Route planning is the key to safe, efficient and intelligent navigation of maritime traffic. Autonomous route planning is a complex optimization problem, which requires both global route planning and local collision avoidance. In this paper, we propose an optimization algorithm which can consider both global route planning and local collision avoidance. Firstly, nonlinear constraint optimization models of obstacle limitation, safe water depth limitation and ship steering limitation are established. Then, the PE-A* algorithm and route planning framework are proposed by using potential energy field to accurately express the environment. Finally, the safety and feasibility of the route planned by PE-A* algorithm are discussed through simulation experiments. Simulation results show that PE-A* algorithm can realize both global route planning and local collision avoidance, and the safety and feasibility of the planned route are greatly improved. From the perspective of potential energy, this work proposes an automatic route planning algorithm and establishes a flexible mathematical model, which can add fuel consumption, time and other related engineering requirements into the model to plan the optimal route meeting the requirements.

ID OPTIMIZATION
AB Information gathering while interacting with other agents under sensing and motion uncertainty is critical in domains such as driving, service robots, racing, or surveillance. The interests of agents may be at odds with others, resulting in a stochastic noncooperative dynamic game. Agents must predict others' future actions without communication, incorporate their actions into these predictions, account for uncertainty and noise in information gathering, and consider what information their actions reveal. Our solution uses local iterative dynamic programming in Gaussian belief space to solve a game-theoretic continuous POMDP. Solving a quadratic game in the backward pass of a game-theoretic belief-space variant of iterative linear-quadratic Gaussian control (iLQG) achieves a runtime polynomial in the number of agents and linear in the planning horizon. Our algorithm yields linear feedback policies for our robot, and predicted feedback policies for other agents. We present three applications: Active surveillance, guiding eyes for a blind agent, and autonomous racing. Agents with game-theoretic belief-space planning win 44% more races than without game theory and 34% more than without belief-space planning.

ID SCALE
AB Camera equipped Autonomous Underwater Vehicles (AUVs) are now routinely used in seafloor surveys. Obtaining effective representations from the images they collect can enable perception-aware robotic exploration such as information-gain-guided path planning and target-driven visual navigation. This letter develops a novel self-supervised representation learning method for seafloor images collected by AUVs. The method allows deep-learning convolutional autoencoders to leverage multiple sources of metadata to regularise their learning, prioritising features observed in images that can be correlated with patterns in their metadata. The impact of the proposed regularisation is examined on a dataset consisting of more than 30 k colour seafloor images gathered by an AUV off the coast of Tasmania. The metadata used to regularise learning in this dataset consists of the horizontal location and depth of the observed seafloor. The results show that including metadata in self-supervised representation learning can increase image classification accuracy by up to 15% and never degrades learning performance. We show how effective representation learning can be applied to achieve class balanced representative image identification for summarised understanding of imbalanced class distributions in an unsupervised way.

ID TRACKING
AB This article studies the leader-following consensus of multiagent systems (MASs) with completely event-triggered mechanisms (CETMs) and directed switching topologies. When most event-triggered schemes in MASs only reduce each agent's data transmissions to neighbor agents, CETMs further reduce data transmissions to actuators with one triggered function in each agent. To guarantee the switching links utilized by CETMs contain a directed spanning tree at any time, triggered decisions are improved to include the instants at which each agent's output links or leader link change. Furthermore, a less conservative method based on matrix inequalities is combined to minimize the allowable average dwell time (ADT) of switching topologies under the design conditions of CETMs. Based on multiple Lyapunov functions (MLFs), the sufficient conditions for controller gains that guarantee the leader-following consensus of MASs are proposed when the ADT of switching topologies is larger than the allowable value. Finally, an example of autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) is given to illustrate the effectiveness of CETMs.

DT Article
ID CLASSIFICATION
AB Convolutional neural networks, inspired by biological visual cortex systems, are a powerful category of artificial neural networks that can extract the hierarchical features of raw data to provide greatly reduced parametric complexity and to enhance the accuracy of prediction. They are of great interest for machine learning tasks such as computer vision, speech recognition, playing board games and medical diagnosis(1-7). Optical neural networks offer the promise of dramatically accelerating computing speed using the broad optical bandwidths available. Here we demonstrate a universal optical vector convolutional accelerator operating at more than ten TOPS (trillions (10(12)) of operations per second, or tera-ops per second), generating convolutions of images with 250,000 pixels-sufficiently large for facial image recognition. We use the same hardware to sequentially form an optical convolutional neural network with ten output neurons, achieving successful recognition of handwritten digit images at 88 per cent accuracy. Our results are based on simultaneously interleaving temporal, wavelength and spatial dimensions enabled by an integrated microcomb source. This approach is scalable and trainable to much more complex networks for demanding applications such as autonomous vehicles and real-time video recognition.

AB The high-speed water entry process of an autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) has a strong impact non-linearity, and a cavity formed by air and water will often be generated as part of the entry process. The shape of the water-entry cavity plays an important role in the load characteristics and stability of the water-entry trajectory. In this paper, a numerical model for describing the cavity and impact load characteristics of a high-speed water-entry AUV is established. The simulation results such as cavity shape and impact load are compared with experimental data. The good agreement between the numerical results and those of the experiments reveals the accuracy and capability of the numerical algorithm. Subsequently, the arbitrary Lagrange-Euler (ALE) numerical algorithm is used to simulate and analyse the variation laws of the cavity characteristics and impact loads with different head shapes, water-entry velocities, water-entry angles and angles of attack. The results obtained in this study can provide a good reference for the trajectory control and structural design of the AUV.

AB An autonomous vehicle launched from moving platform is subjected to flexure-like disturbance and needs to stabilize itself before embarking on the target tracking phase. Control and guidance remains inactive during stabilization phase. Hence, estimating the deviation from the intended trajectory is important in the absence of control and guidance commands for trajectory correction. This estimation problem is here mapped to the misalignment estimation problem, with the intended trajectory data resembling mother data and the followed trajectory data resembling daughter data. The main requirement is fast convergence for early commencement of target tracking phase. Kalman filter and its variants fail to converge due to the inability to model time varying nonlinearities and flexure in the system model. Conventional particle filter converges, but computation time is high. This work explores evolutionary particle filter variants that may provide faster convergence through adaptive tuning of the range from where particle support points are selected. Such heuristics is based on the observed residual trend. Monte Carlo simulation results underline the importance of designing estimator based on adaptive tuned evolutionary particle filter algorithm.

AB The problem of circumnavigating a moving target in a three dimensional setting by a network of agents while avoiding inter-agent collisions is addressed in this paper. A distributed control strategy is proposed for the multi-agent system to achieve three objectives: reaching the target plane with predesigned orientation, circulating around the target with prescribed radius, and avoiding collisions among agents. After representing the control objectives by three potential functions, the gradient fields of which are orthogonal to each other, the control law then is developed using the gradient vector field-based approach. The novelty of the proposed controller lies in the orthogonality of the vector fields, which decouples the control objectives and ensures global asymptotic convergence to the desired motion, subject to some mild initial condition constraints. The stability and convergence analysis are presented using Lyapunov tools, and the effectiveness of the proposed control strategy is demonstrated through numerical simulations.

DE Angle random walk noise; Noise Reduction; Alpha-Beta Filter; Fading
   Memory Filter
AB Nowadays, MEMS sensors are widely used in systems such as autonomous vehicles, but they still suffer from high stochastic errors such as Angle random walk (ARW) noise, which causes failure in real-signals and produces an error in the position and attitude of mobile systems. So far, many filters are developed to reduce the amount of noise in the output of the MEMS sensors. The computational overhead, the rate of noise reduction, and the phase-delay of the filter are the most important characteristics of choosing a suitable filter. In this paper, a low pass filter based on the alpha-beta filter with a very low computational overhead is proposed to reduce the amount of noise. In order to find the optimal filter gain, the improvement in the positioning is selected as a criterion, which is a tradeoff between the amount of noise reduction and the phase delay of the filtered signal. In this work, the KITTI database is used to evaluate the proposed filter. The results show that the proposed filter reduces the sensor's noise and improves the positioning of the moving car, significantly.

ID BURIED TARGETS
AB One of the factors that significantly affects bistatic scattering from seabed targets is bottom type. This factor has the potential to impact classification, as models that do not take bottom composition into account could improperly characterize target type, geometry, or material. This paper looks at the impact of bottom composition and self-burial on scattering from spherical and cylindrical targets in a 6.5m deep environment with a mud and sand bottom. Sphere and cylinder scattering data from an autonomous underwater vehicle-based bistatic scattering experiment are compared to scattering simulation models with a range of bottom compositions and target burial increments. Three different sets of sediment parameters were tested. Correlation between the real and simulated data are then used to assess the similarity of each simulated scattering data set to the experiment data. Robustness to bottom composition in classification was then tested by training a model using simulated data and classifying experiment target data using a machine learning method for each environment type. Combined-environment classification models, composed of different ranges of mud depths and target burial increments, were shown to be effective at classifying the experiment data.

AB Managing resources in dynamic vehicular environments is a tough task, which is becoming more challenging with the increased number of access technologies today available in connected cars (e.g., IEEE 802.11, LIE), in the variety of applications provided on the road (e.g., safety, traffic efficiency, and infotainment), in the amount of driving awareness/coordination required (e.g., local, context, and cooperative awareness), and in the level of automation toward zero-accident driving (e.g., platooning and autonomous driving). The open programmability and logically centralized control features of the software-defined networking (SDN) paradigm offer an attractive means to manage communication and networking resources in the vehicular environment and promise improved performance. In this paper, we enumerate the potentials of software-defined vehicular networks, analyze the need to rethink the traditional SDN approach from theoretical and practical standpoints when applied in this application context, and present an emulation approach based on the proposed node car architecture in Mininet-WiFi to showcase the applicability and some expected benefits of SDN in a selected use case scenario.

AB This paper deals with the transmission of alarm messages in large and dense underwater swarms of Autonomous Underwater Vehicles (AUVs) and describes the verification process of the derived algorithm results by means of two simulation tools realized by the authors. A collision-free communication protocol has been developed, tailored to a case where a single AUV needs to send a message to a specific subset of swarm members regarding a perceived danger. The protocol includes a handshaking procedure that creates a silence region before the transmission of the message obtained through specific acoustic tones out of the normal transmission frequencies or through optical signals. This region will include all members of the swarm involved in the alarm message and their neighbours, preventing collisions between them. The AUV sending messages to a target area computes a delay function on appropriate arcs and runs a Dijkstra-like algorithm obtaining a multicast tree. After an explanation of the whole building of this collision-free multicast tree, a simulation has been carried out assuming different scenarios relevant to swarm density, signal power of the modem and the geometrical configuration of the nodes.

DE shortest path; free form boundary domain; partition
ID ALGORITHM
AB The shortest path computation is important in industrial automation, especially for robot and autonomous vehicle navigation. However, most of the computations concentrate on computing the shortest path between two points within a polygon. The common approach for handling a bounded domain with free form boundary is to convert the domain into a polygon by boundary approximation so that the conventional computing algorithms can be used. Such an approximation affects the accuracy of the path. This article presents an approach to compute the shortest path between two given points in a free form boundary domain without any boundary approximation. This is addressed geometrically by imaginably placing a source at one of the points which radiates the shortest paths to various points of the domain. Some shortest paths are deflected by the geometry of the boundary so that they are no longer straight lines. Based on the deflections of the shortest paths, the bounded domain is partitioned into a set of subdomains. A tree is then constructed to show the relationships among these subdomains. The shortest path between two points is obtained from this tree.

AB Two distributed consensus problems, including leadless consensus and tracking consensus, for multiple quadrotors with bounded disturbances under a directed topology are solved in this study. First, the model of a single quadrotor is divided into two subsystems. Some coupling terms between the two subsystems are regarded as external perturbations. For the case of leadless consensus, a distributed sliding-mode controller for the first subsystem and a state-feedback controller for the second subsystem are proposed to guarantee that the consensus is achieved with bounded errors that are only associated with disturbances. For the case of tracking consensus, by using the proposed sliding-mode consensus protocols combining with two sliding-mode observers, it is shown that all quadrotors can track the leader with bounded errors which can be manipulated suitably. Simulations show the effectiveness of the proposed control protocols.

AB The Houses That Matsutake Built. In the mountains of northwest Yunnan, China, a valuable mushroom, matsutake or song rong (Tricholoma matsutake) was commodified in the 1980s. Since that time, it has been exported in large quantities to Japan. The sale of matsutake now contributes more to the income of Shangri-la County (Diqing Autonomous Tibetan Prefecture) than any other crop, including timber and livestock. During the 1980s and 1990s, villagers in this remote region used their mushroom earnings to build spacious, beautiful new houses in the traditional local (Kham) style, and in some cases to buy motor vehicles or open businesses. In villages with access to productive matsutake habitat, virtually every household was able to build a new house; entire villages were transformed. During the 1990s, several villages developed locally based management regimes to enhance production and to address the problems and conflicts that arose from the harvest of such a valuable product. More recently, government agencies and NGOs have played a highly visible role in promoting "sustainable" harvest policies. The implications of their involvement are briefly examined and the future of matsutake harvest in Yunnan is discussed.

TI Manufacturing system development framework using a data models driven

SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PRODUCTION RESEARCH

DT Article
ID DEADLOCK-AVOIDANCE
AB We report on a data models driven approach for the development of a manufacturing system framework. Relational data schemes are used for the creation of data models. A modular approach is adopted for the creation of complex manufacturing system configurations. Each module is created by selecting the appropriate resources from the data models and is represented as a standard module template in the module library for future use. Several modules can be integrated together through an automated guided vehicles system to model a complex manufacturing system. Each module is autonomous in creating and executing its plans, but cooperative with other modules to realize the system's overall goals. For effective control of parts in the system, an event-based simulation strategy is implemented. The developed algorithm can resolve the situations arising due to any deadlock or conflict during a simulation run. System data tables are regularly updated as and when an event occurs in the system. The updated information includes machine status, part location and status, and capacity status, etc. of all parts and resources. A case study comprising eight part types with five different flow patterns in a three-module system is taken to show the effectiveness of the proposed approach.

AB In the field of astronomical observation, large space telescopes are key tools for deep space exploration. However, the aperture of space telescopes is limited by the ability to fabricate large monolithic mirrors or lenses and by severe restrictions on the overall volume and mass capacity of the launch vehicle. The use of robots for autonomous assembly while in orbit is a promising option for the deployment of large-aperture space telescopes. In this paper, we describe a modular robotic manipulator that offers high precision and flexibility. A space telescope ground assembly system is then designed, the key components of which are a redundant robotic manipulator and a reconfigurable telescope unit. The ground-based assembly of the space telescope is implemented through a combination of trajectory planning, visual perception, and robotic supple control techniques, validating the ability of the robotic manipulator to automatically assemble modular space telescopes. Finally, the developed robotic manipulator is used to conduct ground assembly demonstration experiments, and the modular space telescope is assembled according to the assembly task plan, accumulating technical experience for future space telescope assembly tasks in orbit.

AB This paper presents a new combined automatic warehouse system that can not only realize automatic storage and sorting processes, but also process automatic replenishment requests according to inventory demand. In this system, there are two storage areas: one for the pallets and the other for the totes. The pallet storage area can process the storage and picking of pallets, whereas the tote storage area can handle case storage and picking. In addition, this system automatically initiates a replenishment request from the pallet storage area to the tote storage area when the storage area is lower than the safety stock. This study uses the characteristics of the order matrix to study the influence of order structure on replenishment with four evaluation parameters: the workload of two storage areas, the number of used storage positions in the tote storage area, and replenishment time. The numerical analysis part sets different order parameter values, including the order density, order strength, and wave size, to analyze the impact of multiple order structures on the system performance, which helps warehouse operation managers decide the replenishment strategy parameters.

TI Multimodality in mmWave MIMO Beam Selection Using Deep Learning:
   Datasets and Challenges
SO IEEE COMMUNICATIONS MAGAZINE
LA English
DT Article
AB The increasing availability of multimodal data holds many promises for developments in millimeter- wave (mmWave) multiple-antenna systems by harnessing the potential for enhanced situational awareness. Specifically, inclusion of non-RF modalities to complement RF-only data in communications- related decisions like beam selection may speed up decision making in situations where an exhaustive search, spanning all candidate options, is required by the standard. However, to accelerate research in this topic, there is a need to collect real-world datasets in a principled manner. This article presents an experimentally obtained dataset, composed of 23 GB of data, which aids in beam selection in vehicle-to- everything mmWave bands, with the goal of facilitating machine learning (ML) in the wireless communication required for autonomous driving. Beyond this specific example, the article describes methodologies of creating such datasets that use time synchronized and heterogeneous types of LiDAR, GPS, and camera images, paired with the RF ground truth data of selected beams in the mmWave band. While we use beam selection as the primary demonstrator, we also discuss how multimodal datasets may be used in other ML-based PHY-layer optimization areas, such as beamforming and localization.

SO IEEE ROBOTICS AND AUTOMATION LETTERS

DE Mapping; marine robotics; localization; gaussian process
AB Gaussian processes (GPs) are becoming a standard tool to build terrain representations thanks to their capacity to model map uncertainty. This effectively yields a reliability measure of the areas of the map, which can be directly utilized by Bayes filtering algorithms in robot localization problems. A key factor is that this map uncertainty can incorporate the noise intrinsic to the terrain surveying process through the GPs ability to train on uncertain inputs (UIs). However, existing techniques to build GP maps with UIs in a tractable manner are restricted in the form and degree of the input noise. In this letter, we propose a flexible and efficient framework to build large-scale GP maps with UIs based on Stochastic Variational GPs and Monte Carlo sampling of the UIs distributions. We validate our mapping approach on a large bathymetric survey collected with an autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) and analyze its performance against the use of deterministic inputs (DI). Finally, we show how using UI SVGP maps yields more accurate particle filter localization results than DI SVGP on a real AUV mission over an entirely predicted area.

AB In this article, a new approach for ship-ship collision probability estimation based on the Cross-Entropy (CE) method is introduced, which can be treated as an adaptive importance sampler. It has the advantage of attaining low variance estimates of small collision probabilities, which will most often be the case in realistic scenarios. Furthermore, a risk-based Collision Avoidance (COLAV) system being able to take obstacle kinematic uncertainty and intention uncertainty into account is presented, namely the Probabilistic Scenario-Based Model Predictive Control (PSB-MPC). The collision probability estimator (CPE) is used in the risk assessment of the PSB-MPC, and tested in a simulation study, where the total system is validated. Simulation results show that the MPC is able to utilize the CPE for better risk assessment than the original version, in order to make safer decisions in close quarter situations and cases where nearby obstacles make unexpected maneuvers. It is also shown that when all vessels involved use the PSB-MPC, situations are resolved according to the traffic rules in a safe manner.

AB Lots of evidence has indicated that many kinds of animals can achieve goal-oriented navigation by spatial cognition and dead reckoning. The geomagnetic field (GF) is a ubiquitous cue for navigation by these animals. Inspired by the goal-oriented navigation of animals, a novel long-distance underwater geomagnetic navigation (LDUGN) method is presented in this article, which only utilizes the declination component (D) and inclination component (I) of GF for underwater navigation without any prior knowledge of the geographical location or geomagnetic map. The D and I measured by high-precision geomagnetic sensors are compared periodically with that of the destination to determine the velocity and direction in the next step. A model predictive control (MPC) algorithm with control and state constraints is proposed to achieve the control and optimization of navigation trajectory. Because the optimal control is recalculated at each sampling instant, the MPC algorithm can overcome interferences of geomagnetic daily fluctuation, geomagnetic storms, ocean current, and geomagnetic local anomaly. The simulation results validate the feasibility and accuracy of the proposed algorithm.

AB Weeds are amongst the most impacting abiotic factors in agriculture, causing important yield loss worldwide. Integrated Weed Management coupled with the use of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (drones), allows for Site-Specific Weed Management, which is a highly efficient methodology as well as beneficial to the environment. The identification of weed patches in a cultivated field can be achieved by combining image acquisition by drones and further processing by machine learning techniques. Specific algorithms can be trained to manage weeds removal by Autonomous Weeding Robot systems via herbicide spray or mechanical procedures. However, scientific and technical understanding of the specific goals and available technology is necessary to rapidly advance in this field. In this review, we provide an overview of precision weed control with a focus on the potential and practical use of the most advanced sensors available in the market. Much effort is needed to fully understand weed population dynamics and their competition with crops so as to implement this approach in real agricultural contexts.

AB We propose a sequential method to extract 3-dimensional information for mapping by using sensor fusion of two sonar devices. The 3D reconstruction using sonar images from forward-looking multibeam sonar (FLMS) is an ill-posed problem due to the loss of elevation angle; thus we used an additional sonar and its complementary information. Our approach is to utilize geometric constraints between the installation of two sonar devices and complementary characteristics such as a different angle of the acoustic beams and data acquisition method. The fusion process proceeds in three stages. The first stage is to build a likelihood map using geometric constraints of the installation between two sonar devices. The second stage is to calculate the feasible elevation angle of the FLMS. The elevation angle of FLMS is limited by its vertical beam spreading angle, which can be represented by particles. The third stage is Monte-Carlo experiment using the generated particles by computing the weight, and correct the data of FLMS. To verify the proposed method, we applied the proposed method in simulations and experiments in engineering basin with an AUV.

AB Cyber-physical systems (CPSs) have attracted many researchers in areas as diverse as aerospace, manufacturing, transportation, and so on. However, modeling methodologies and tools for autonomous objects in CPS are still lacking. In this paper, the CPS-Agent is proposed to model objects with consideration of temporal-spatial traits and interaction with physical environment. It is formulated by a fivetuple. Furthermore, considering that no universal methodology of coordination strategy formulation could be used to guide researchers, we present a role-based strategy formulation to make work patterns of CPS-Agents more clear. In terms of network communication among CPS-Agents, a set of communicative primitives is tailored based on the FIPA-ACL specification. Afterward, to guide engineers in designing systems according to their application requirements in the area of CPS, we design templates and a novel visual support tool for generating C++ files automatically corresponding to customized CPS-Agents, coordination strategies, and coordination groups. Finally, the complete development process based on our methodologies and tool is illustrated by an instance of a car team.

AB This paper presents a novel adaptive controller for controlling an autonomous helicopter with unknown inertial matrix to asymptotically track the desired trajectory. To identify the unknown inertial matrix included in the attitude dynamic model, this paper proposes a new structural identifier that differs from those previously proposed in that it additionally contains a neural networks (NNs) mechanism and a robust adaptive mechanism, respectively. Using the NNs to compensate the unknown aerodynamic forces online and the robust adaptive mechanism to cancel the combination of the overlarge NNs compensation error and the external disturbances, the new robust neural identifier exhibits a better identification performance in the complex flight environment. Moreover, an optimized algorithm is included in the NNs mechanism to alleviate the burdensome online computation. By the strict Lyapunov argument, the asymptotic convergence of the inertial matrix identification error, position tracking error, and attitude tracking error to arbitrarily small neighborhood of the origin is proved. The simulation and implementation results are provided to evaluate the performance of the proposed controller.

SO JOURNAL OF THE ACOUSTICAL SOCIETY OF AMERICA

ID SHALLOW-WATER; INVERSION
AB This paper presents a range dependent sediment sound speed profile measurement obtained using the image source method. This technique is based on the analysis of the seafloor reflected acoustic wave as a collection of image sources which positions are linked with the thick-nesses and the sound speed of the sediment stack. The data used were acquired by the NURC in 2009 during the Clutter09 experiment. The equipment used was an autonomous undersea vehicle towing a 1600-3500 Hz frequency band source and a 32 m horizontal line array of 32 hydrophones at 12m above the seabed. Under the assumption of locally range independent seabed properties, the moving horizontal array provides successive range independent sediment sound speed profiles along a track to obtain the range and depth dependent structure of the seafloor. Two key steps include recovery of the time-varying unknown array shape from the data and spatial filtering of the successive sound speed profiles. A comparison of the image source method result and seismic data along nearly the same 14 km track indicates that the seabed stratigraphy is correctly mapped by this method.

ID UNDERWATER NAVIGATION
AB We analyze the observability properties of the kinematic model of an autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) moving in 3D, under the influence of ocean currents, using range and depth measurements. The results obtained shed light into the types of trajectories that an AUV may be requested to undergo in order to ensure observability, which is a crucial step in the design of single or multiple beacon positioning systems. We assume that the AUV is equipped with two sensor suites: the first computes the distance (range) of the AUV to single or multiple fixed transponders, while the second measures the vehicle's depth. In both situations, the vehicle has access to its heading angle. We further assume that the AUV undergoes maneuvers commonly known as trimming trajectories, that are naturally obtained when the inputs (thruster rpms and control surface deflections) are held constant. This is done for two main reasons: (i) the class of trajectories thus generated is sufficiently rich for a vast number of applications and (ii) from an observability-analysis standpoint they lead to mathematical tractability and allow for an intuitive physical interpretation. These facts stand in sharp contrast to common approaches adopted in the literature, where the characterization of trajectories that yield observability is only implicit and defies a simple interpretation.
   In the set-up adopted, the trimming trajectories are completely characterized by three variables: (a) linear body speed parallel to v parallel to; (b) flight-path angle gamma; and (c) yaw rate psi. We assume that parallel to v parallel to > 0, gamma, and psi are constant but otherwise arbitrary (within the constraints of the vehicle capabilities) and examine the observability of the resulting system with the two above mentioned sensor suites. We adopt definitions of observability and weak observability that seek inspiration from those proposed by Herman and Krener (1977) but reflect the fact that we consider specific kinds of maneuvers in 3D.
   We start with the single transponder case. For range measurements only, we show that in the absence of ocean currents the 3D kinematic model of an AUV undergoing trimming trajectories with nonzero flight-path angle and yaw rate is observable. In the case of non-zero but known ocean currents, identical results apply subject to the condition that the flight-path angle satisfies a current-related constraint. However, if the current is non-zero and unknown, the model is only weakly observable. The situation changes completely when both range and depth measurements are available. In this case, under the assumption that the yaw rate is different from zero, observability is obtained even when the flight-path angle is zero (vehicle moving in a horizontal plane) and there are non-zero unknown currents. These obvious advantages are lost if yaw rate is equal to zero, for in this case the model is only weakly observable. In all situations where the model is weakly observable we give a complete characterization of the sets of states that are indistinguishable from a given initial state. Finally, we show that the extended model that is obtained by considering multiple (at least two) transponders is observable in all situations if the yaw rate is different from zero.

AB There have been conflicting results in the literature regarding the congestion impacts of shared mobility systems with for-hire vehicles (FHVs). To the best of our knowledge, there is no physically meaningful and mathematically tractable model to explain these conflicting results or devise efficient management schemes for such mobility systems. In this paper, we attempt to fill the gap by presenting a compartmental model for passenger trip and vehicle dynamics in shared mobility systems with FHVs and discussing the impacts of different fleet-size management schemes. To develop the compartmental model, we first divide passenger trips into four compartments: planned, waiting, traveling, and completed. We describe the dynamics of the waiting trips by the point queue model, and those of the traveling trips by an extended bathtub model. As the traditional bathtub model for vehicular trips, the extended bathtub model is derived in a relative space with respect to individual trips' distances to their destinations. However, different from the traditional bathtub model, vehicular dynamics and trip dynamics in the extended bathtub model are not overlapping, as the dynamics of FHVs are controlled by the fleet-size management scheme; but they are related, as traveling trips travel with occupied FHVs, and empty FHVs supply seats to waiting trips. Within this modeling framework, the matching process between waiting passengers and FHVs is modeled at the aggregate level, such that the passenger trip flow from the waiting compartment to the traveling compartment equals the minimum of the waiting trips' demand of seats and the supply of seats determined by the completion rate of traveling trips and the fleet-size management scheme. In addition to the pooling ratio, the deadhead miles, the detour miles caused by pooling services, and other extra miles associated with the matching process are captured by another exogenous parameter, namely, the extra mileage ratio. With these assumptions and simplifications, the resulting compartmental model is a deterministic, coupled queueing model, which can be written as a system of differential equations. We also present the sufficient and necessary condition on the fleet-size management scheme for the model to be well-defined. With the parsimonious, closed-form compartmental model, we demonstrate theoretically that limiting the wait time leads to a fleet-size management scheme equivalent to that of the privately operated vehicles (POVs), i.e., the POV scheme. In such a system, the completion rate depends on the extra trip mileage ratio, as well as the pooling ratio. With 100% autonomous FHVs, the optimal fleet size that minimizes the total costs occurs at the maximum flow-rate and the free flow speed. With mixed POVs and FHVs, we extend the compartmental model and numerically solve for the optimal fleet sizes under different market penetration rates. This study reconciles the conflicting results in the literature. We find that, with a low pooling ratio, the overall system's performance can be deteriorated or improved, depending on the fleet-size management scheme: with the POV scheme, the system could become more congested; but with an appropriate fleet size cap, the system's performance can be substantially improved. A major policy implication of this study is that implementing a cap for the FHV fleet size is a viable measure to mitigate the congestion effects of extra deadhead and detour miles caused by FHVs.

AB Mobility-on-demand (MoD) systems have recently emerged as a promising paradigm of one-way vehicle sharing for sustainable personal urban mobility in densely populated cities. We assume the capability of a MoD system to be enhanced by deploying robotic shared vehicles that can autonomously cruise the streets to be hailed by users. A key challenge of the MoD system is that of real-time, fine-grained mobility demand and traffic flow sensing and prediction. This paper presents novel Gaussian process (GP) decentralized data fusion and active sensing algorithms for real-time, fine-grained traffic modeling and prediction with a fleet of MoD vehicles. The predictive performance of our decentralized data fusion algorithms are theoretically guaranteed to be equivalent to that of sophisticated centralized sparse GP approximations. We derive consensus filtering variants requiring only local communication between neighboring vehicles. We theoretically guarantee the performance of our decentralized active sensing algorithms. When they are used to gather informative data for mobility demand prediction, they can achieve a dual effect of fleet rebalancing to service mobility demands. Empirical evaluation on real-world datasets shows that our algorithms are significantly more time-efficient and scalable in the size of data and fleet while achieving predictive performance comparable to that of state-of-the-art algorithms.
   Note to Practitioners-Knowing, understanding, and predicting spatiotemporally varying traffic phenomena in real time has become increasingly important to the goal of achieving smooth-flowing, congestion-free traffic in densely populated urban cities, which motivates our work here. This paper addresses the following fundamental problem of data fusion and active sensing: How can a fleet of autonomous robotic vehicles or mobile probes actively cruise a road network to gather and assimilate the most informative data for predicting a spatiotemporally varying traffic phenomenon like a mobility demand pattern or traffic flow? Existing centralized solutions are poorly suited because they suffer from a single point of failure and incur huge communication, space, and time overheads with large data and fleet. This paper proposes novel efficient and scalable decentralized data fusion and active sensing algorithms with theoretical performance guarantees. The practical applicability of our algorithms is not restricted to traffic monitoring [1]-[4]; they can be used in other environmental sensing applications such as mineral prospecting [5], precision agriculture, monitoring of ocean/freshwater phenomena (e.g., plankton bloom) [6]-[9], forest ecosystems, pollution (e.g., oil spill), or contamination. Note that the decentralized data fusion component of our algorithms can also be used for static sensors and passive mobile probes and, interestingly, adapted to parallel implementations to be run on a cluster of machines for achieving efficient and scalable probabilistic prediction (i.e., with predictive uncertainty) with large data. Empirical results show that our algorithms can perform well with two datasets featuring real-world traffic phenomena in the densely-populated urban city of Singapore. A limitation of our algorithms is that the decentralized data fusion components assume independence between multiple traffic phenomena while the decentralized active sensing components only work for a single traffic phenomenon. So, in our future work, we will generalize our algorithms to perform active sensing of multiple traffic phenomena and remove the assumption of independence between them.

AB By the year 2045, it is projected that Autonomous Vehicles (AVs) will make up half of the new vehicle market. Successful adoption of AVs can reduce drivers' stress and fatigue, curb traffic congestion, and improve safety, mobility, and economic efficiency. Due to the limited intelligence in relevant technologies, human-in-the-loop modalities are still necessary to ensure the safety of AVs at current or near future stages, because the vehicles may not be able to handle all emergencies. Therefore, it is important to know the takeover readiness of the drivers to ensure the takeover quality and avoid any potential accidents. To achieve this, a comprehensive understanding of the drivers' physiological states is crucial. However, there is a lack of systematic analysis of the correlation between different human physiological responses and takeover behaviors which could serve as important references for future studies to determine the types of data to use. This paper provides a comprehensive analysis of the effects of takeover behaviors on the common physiological indicators. A program for conditional automation was developed based on a game engine and applied to a driving simulator. The experiment incorporated three types of secondary tasks, three takeover events, and two traffic densities. Brain signals, Skin Conductance Level (SCL), and Heart Rate (HR) of the participants were collected while they were performing the driving simulations. The Frontal Asymmetry Index (FAI) (as an indicator of engagement) and Mental Workload (MWL) were calculated from the brain signals to indicate the mental states of the participants. The results revealed that the FAI of the drivers would slightly decrease after the takeover alerts were issued when they were doing secondary tasks prior to the takeover activities, and the higher difficulty of the secondary tasks could lead to lower overall FAI during the takeover periods. In contrast, The MWL and SCL increased during the takeover periods. The HR also increased rapidly at the beginning of the takeover period but dropped back to a normal level quickly. It was found that a fake takeover alert would lead to lower overall HR, slower increase, and lower peak of SCL during the takeover periods. Moreover, the higher traffic density scenarios were associated with higher MWL, and a more difficult secondary task would lead to higher MWL and HR during the takeover activities. A preliminary discussion of the correlation between the physiological data, takeover scenario, and vehicle data (that relevant to takeover readiness) was then conducted, revealing that although takeover event, SCL, and HR had slightly higher correlations with the maximum acceleration and reaction time, none of them dominated the takeover readiness. In addition, the analysis of the data across different participants was conducted, which emphasized the importance of considering standardization or normalization of the data when they were further used as input features for estimating takeover readiness. Overall, the results presented in this paper offer profound insights into the patterns of physiological data changes during takeover periods. These findings can be used as benchmarks for utilizing these variables as indicators of takeover preparedness and performance in future research endeavors.

AB Image sensing technologies are rapidly increasing the cost-effectiveness of biodiversity monitoring efforts. Species differences in the reflectance of electromagnetic radiation can be used as a surrogate estimate plant biodiversity using multispectral image data. However, these efforts are often hampered by logistical difficulties in broad-scale implementation. Here, we investigate the utility of multispectral imaging technology from commercially available unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs, or drones) in estimating biodiversity metrics at a fine spatial resolution (0.1-0.5 cm pixel resolution) in a temperate calcareous grassland in Oxfordshire, UK. We calculate a suite of moments (coefficient of variation, standard deviation, skewness, and kurtosis) for the distribution of radiance from multispectral images at five wavelength bands (Blue 450 +/- 16 nm; Green 560 +/- 16 nm; Red 650 +/- 16 nm; Red Edge 730 +/- 16 nm; Near Infrared 840 +/- 16 nm) and test their effectiveness at estimating ground-truthed biodiversity metrics from in situ botanical surveys for 37-1 x 1 m quadrats. We find positive associations between the average coefficient of variation in spectral radiance and both the Shannon-Weiner and Simpson's biodiversity indices. Furthermore, the average coefficient of variation in spectral radiance is consistent and highly repeatable across sampling days and recording heights. Positive associations with biodiversity indices hold irrespective of the image recording height (2-8 m), but we report reductions in estimates of spectral diversity with increases to UAV recording height. UAV imaging reduced sampling time by a factor of 16 relative to in situ botanical surveys. We demonstrate the utility of multispectral radiance moments as an indicator of biodiversity in this temperate calcareous grassland at a fine spatial resolution using a widely available UAV monitoring system with a coarse spectral resolution. The use of UAV technology with multispectral sensors has far-reaching potential to provide cost-effective and high-resolution monitoring of biodiversity.

AB Cooperative Intelligent Transport System (C-ITS) is a promising technology that aims to improve the traditional transport management systems. In C-ITS infrastructure Autonomous Vehicles (AVs) communicate wirelessly with other AVs, Road Side Units (RSUs) and Traffic Command Centres (TCCs) using an open channel Internet. However, the use of the Internet brings inherent vulnerabilities related to privacy (e.g., adversary performing inference and data poisoning attacks), and security (e.g., AVs can be compromised using advanced hacking techniques) issues and prevents the faster realization of C-ITS applications. To address these challenges, this paper presents a privacy-preserving-based secure framework to provide both privacy and security in C-ITS infrastructure. The proposed framework provides two level of security and privacy using blockchain and deep learning modules. First, a blockchain module is designed to securely transmit the C-ITS data between AVs-RSUs-TCCs, and a smart contract-based enhanced Proof of Work (ePoW) technique is designed to verify data integrity and mitigate data poisoning attacks. Second, a deep-learning module is designed that includes Long-Short Term Memory-AutoEncoder (LSTM-AE) technique for encoding C-ITS data into a new format to prevent inference attacks. The encoded data is used by the proposed Attention-based Recurrent Neural Network (A-RNN), for intrusive events recognition in C-ITS infrastructure. The proposed A-RNN is trained using Truncated Backpropagation Through Time (BPTT) algorithm. The framework is further validated and tested using two publicly available ToN-IoT and CICIDS-2017 datasets. The proposed framework is compared with peer privacy-preserving intrusion detection techniques, and the result shows the effectiveness of the proposed framework over several state-of-the-art techniques in both blockchain and non-blockchain systems.

AB The purpose of this paper is to offer a unique adaptive path planning framework to address a new challenge known as the Unknown environment Persistent Monitoring Problem (PMP). To identify the unknown events' occurrence location and likelihood, an unmanned ground vehicle (UGV) equipped with a Light Detection and Ranging (LIDAR) and camera is used to record such events in agriculture land. A certain level of detecting capability must be the distinct monitoring priority in order to keep track of them to a certain distance. First, to formulate a model, we developed an event-oriented modelling strategy for unknown environment perception and the effect is enumerated by uncertainty, which takes into account the sensor's detection capabilities, the detection interval, and monitoring weight. A mobile robot scheme utilizing LIDAR on integrative approach was created and experiments were carried out to solve the high equipment budget of Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) for robotic systems. To map an unfamiliar location using the robotic operating system (ROS), the 3D visualization tool for Robot Operating System (RVIZ) was utilized, and GMapping software package was used for SLAM usage. The experimental results suggest that the mobile robot design pattern is viable to produce a high-precision map while lowering the cost of the mobile robot SLAM hardware. From a decision-making standpoint, we built a hybrid algorithm HSAStar (Hybrid SLAM & A Star) algorithm for path planning based on the event oriented modelling, allowing a UGV to continually monitor the perspectives of a path. The simulation results and analyses show that the proposed strategy is feasible and superior. The performance of the proposed hyb SLAM-A Star-APP method provides 34.95%, 27.38%, 33.21% and 29.68% lower execution time, 26.36%, 29.64% and 29.67% lower map duration compared with the existing methods, such as ACO-APF-APP, APFA-APP, GWO-APP and PSO-APP.

AB This paper proposes the development of a system incorporating inertial measurement unit (IMU), a consumer-grade digital camera and a fire detection algorithm simultaneously with a nano Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) for inspection purposes. The video streams are collected through the monocular camera and navigation relied on the state-of-the-art indoor/outdoor Simultaneous Localisation and Mapping (SLAM) system. It implements the robotic operating system (ROS) and computer vision algorithm to provide a robust, accurate and unique inter-frame motion estimation. The collected onboard data are communicated to the ground station and used the SLAM system to generate a map of the environment. A robust and efficient re-localization was performed to recover from tracking failure, motion blur, and frame lost in the data received. The fire detection algorithm was deployed based on the color, movement attributes, temporal variation of fire intensity and its accumulation around a point. The cumulative time derivative matrix was utilized to analyze the frame-by-frame changes and to detect areas with high-frequency luminance flicker (random characteristic). Color, surface coarseness, boundary roughness, and skewness features were perceived as the quadrotor flew autonomously within the clutter and congested area. Mixed Reality system was adopted to visualize and test the proposed system in a physical environment, and the virtual simulation was conducted through the Unity game engine. The results showed that the UAV could successfully detect fire and flame, autonomously fly towards and hover around it, communicate with the ground station and simultaneously generate a map of the environment. There was a slight error between the real and virtual UAV calibration due to the ground truth data and the correlation complexity of tracking real and virtual camera coordinate frames.

   High-resolution bathymetry on the Explorer Ridge
   Ridge topography reconstruction
   Model of cyclic volcanism
   We combine high-resolution bathymetry acquired using the Autonomous Underwater Vehicle ABE with digital seafloor imagery collected using the remotely operated vehicle ROPOS across the axial valley of the Southern Explorer Ridge (SER) to infer the recent volcanic and tectonic processes. The SER is an intermediate spreading ridge located in the northeast Pacific. It hosts the Magic Mountain hydrothermal vent. We reconstruct the unfaulted seafloor terrain at SER based on calculations of the vertical displacement field and fault parameters. The vertical changes between the initial and the restored topographies reflect the integrated effects of volcanism and tectonism on relief-forming processes over the last 11,000-14,000 years. The restored topography indicates that the axial morphology evolved from a smooth constructional dome >500 m in diameter, to a fault-bounded graben, ~500 m wide and 30-70 m deep. This evolution has been accompanied by changes in eruptive rate, with deposition of voluminous lobate and sheet flows when the SER had a domed morphology, and limited-extent low-effusion rate pillow eruptions during graben development. Most of the faults shaping the present axial valley postdate the construction of the dome. Our study supports a model of cyclic volcanism at the SER with periods of effusive eruptions flooding the axial rift, centered on the broad plateau at the summit of the ridge, followed by a decrease in eruptive activity and a subsequent dominance of tectonic processes, with minor low-effusion rate eruptions confined to the axial graben. The asymmetric shape of the axial graben supports an increasing role of extensional processes, with a component of simple shear in the spreading processes.

AB Compared with preprocessed obstacle environments, unknown environments are more challenging for path planning. In unknown environments, an agent can make decisions only by relying on the obstacle information detected by its onboard sensors. However, when facing non-convex obstacles, this limited detection information can easily trap the agent in a local optimum. In this paper, a nature-inspired methodology called Interfered Fluid Dynamic System (IFDS) is extended to anti-local optimum obstacle avoidance in unknown 3D environments for the first time and a novel fluid-based path planning framework is proposed. First, the detection region of the agent is discretized. Then, spherical virtual obstacles (SVOs) located at detected discrete points are generated and memorized. Thus, obstacle avoidance in unknown environments is transformed into the avoidance of known SVOs. Next, the currently generated and memorized SVOs are input to the core of the framework, the IFDS algorithm, to produce repulsive effects, and the corresponding 3D avoidance path is resolved. On this basis, to address local optimum in cases with non-convex obstacles, and considering compatibility with the IFDS, the direction coefficient and sink-heading angular rate adjustment strategies, which belong to the same system as the IFDS, are introduced to modify the IFDS in this framework. Finally, receding horizon control is introduced to improve the obstacle avoidance performance. Simulations show that the proposed framework can enable the agent to autonomously jump out of the 3D non-convex obstacle environments with typical features of the local optimum, including wall-like and cave-like obstacles, and safely reach the destination.

ID DISTURBANCE
AB Floating LiDAR systems (FLS) and other moored environmental monitoring systems are used extensively for wind and environmental assessments in offshore wind projects. In addition, wave energy converters (WECs) are being evaluated for more extensive use in coastal and deeper waters, most of which also require anchoring to the seabed. Since these systems must be moored, heavy anchors and typically heavy chain are used to secure the mooring and measurement/WEC buoy to the seabed. Disadvantages of present mooring technology include 1) damage to the seabed and benthic communities in vicinity of the mooring, as chain sweeps over the sea bottom; 2) an unnecessarily large watch circle at the water's surface; 3) slightly increased likelihood of marine mammal entanglement; 4) mooring damage from nearby fishing activity; and 5) likelihood of mooring failure due to self -entanglement within the mooring itself. This study presents an alternative mooring using mechanically compliant, elastomeric hoses to connect the buoyed system to the bottom anchor. Modeling the two mooring types with a typical buoy used in wind resource assessments shows a significant decrease in anchor drag area and surface watch circle with the use of the elastomeric hose versus the traditional chain and polyethylene line mooring. The hose also is equipped with copper conductors and/or fiber-optic conductors, providing power and data transmission between the bottom and the surface. For WEC solutions, the elastomeric hose provides similar benefits as for FLS and environmental monitoring systems, with the added advantage of being able to transmit power to the seafloor for distribution. For one WEC application, we have developed an elastomeric solution containing not only larger copper conductors to enable power transmission but also fiber-optic conductors to permit data transfer from a garage mounted on the bottom (servicing an autonomous underwater vehicle [AUV] or unmanned underwater vehicle [UUV], for instance) to the surface buoy for onward transmission to shore.

AB This paper addresses some basic questions as to how vision links up with action and serves to guide locomotion in both biological and artificial creatures. The thorough knowledge gained during the past five decades on insects' sensory-motor abilities and the neuronal substrates involved has provided us with a rich source of inspiration for designing tomorrow's self-guided vehicles and micro-vehicles, which will be able to cope with unforeseen events on the ground, under water, in the air, in space, on other planets, and inside the human body. Insects can teach us some useful tricks for designing agile autonomous robots. Since constructing a "biorobot" first requires exactly formulating the biological principles presumably involved, it gives us a unique opportunity of checking the soundness and robustness of these principles by bringing them face to face with the real physical world. "Biorobotics" therefore goes one step beyond computer simulation. It leads to experimenting with real physical robots which have to pass the stringent test of the real world. Biorobotics provide us with a new tool, which can help neurobiologists and neuroethologists to identify and investigate worthwhile issues in the field of sensory-motor control. Here we describe some of the visually guided terrestrial and aerial robots we have developed since 1985 on the basis of our biological findings. All these robots behave in response to the optic flow, i.e., they work by measuring the slip speed of the retinal image. Optic flow is sensed on-board by miniature electrooptical velocity sensors. The very principle of these sensors was based on studies in which we recorded the responses of single identified neurons to single photoreceptor stimulation in a model visual system: the fly's compound eye.

ID WALKING MACHINE
AB This paper describes the mechanical design of a multifunctional four-legged walking machine that is being developed at the Robotics Research Centre, NTU. The major factors influencing the design requirements include minimisation of the weight of the machine, large workspace of the legs, good energy efficiency and relatively high walking speed. The designed walking machine can adopt a variety of configurations such as insect, mammalian, reptile, or human like. The design is invertable and the machine using the legs as manipulators can even perform basic pick and place functions. Lengths of machine leg segments are: 0.12 m-thigh segment and 0.14 m-shank segment, body has a square shape with the side 0.08 m. Total weight is 1.5-2 kG (depends on the type of feet attached and construction of the body frame). The speed of motion depends on the type of implemented gait (side walking with separated legs motion and body transfer, turning motion, stair climbing etc.), during basic straight line quadruped crawl (only one leg at a time in transfer) on a horizontal surface it is 0.045 m/s. It should be stressed that the speed depends on leg configuration and the step length. For shorter steps the number of leg transfers for a given travelling distance is larger and the walking speed is lower. On the other hand, a shorter step length implies that the leg resultant mass will be transferred over a shorter distance in relation to the body frame and the total displacement of the machine centre of mass will be smaller which increases the vehicle stability compared with the situation when the step is longer. Considering different gaits with diverse configurations we can summarise that the walking speed range of the legged autonomous vehicle machine is between 0.001 and 0.045 m/s.

AB By virtue of the low cost and flexible deployment, unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) are becoming the most promising platform for active radar sensing to find targets in shaded areas and build a temporary communication infrastructure at disaster sites. Radar and wireless communication are essential functions for reliable control of UAVs and real-time exchange of sensed measurements. However, due to the limited payload and power budget of UAVs, it is impossible to mount two individual radar and communication systems, especially on small- or medium-sized UAVs. Recently, joint communication and radar (JCR) systems have emerged as a breakthrough, which perform the communication and radar functions simultaneously on the same hardware platform. Compared to a simple combination of individual communication and radar systems, a UAV JCR system can minimize the implementation cost, power consumption, payload, and radio resource usage. This paper proposes transmit beamformer and receive beamformer designs for a UAV network composed of a UAV JCR base station, a target, and multiple user equipments. Specifically, the UAV transmits an orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM)-modulated waveform with transmit and receive beamforming to perform multi-input multi-output (MIMO) radar and multiuser-MIMO (MU-MIMO) communication functions simultaneously. Unlike the previous OFDM radar scheme that employs the communication symbol repetition method, a novel receive beamformer design is proposed to resolve the inter-carrier interference problem in the range/velocity estimation process, which therefore does not sacrifice the communication transmission rate. As a result, simulation results show that the proposed scheme achieves a higher radar signal-to-clutter ratio while achieving a higher communication sum-rate than existing schemes.

AB Detecting the objects surrounding a moving vehicle is essential for autonomous driving and for any kind of advanced driving assistance system; such a system can also be used for analyzing the surrounding traffic as the vehicle moves. The most popular techniques for object detection are based on image processing; in recent years, they have become increasingly focused on artificial intelligence. Systems using monocular vision are increasingly popular for driving assistance, as they do not require complex calibration and setup. The lack of three-dimensional data is compensated for by the efficient and accurate classification of the input image pixels. The detected objects are usually identified as cuboids in the 3D space, or as rectangles in the image space. Recently, instance segmentation techniques have been developed that are able to identify the freeform set of pixels that form an individual object, using complex convolutional neural networks (CNNs). This paper presents an alternative to these instance segmentation networks, combining much simpler semantic segmentation networks with light, geometrical post-processing techniques, to achieve instance segmentation results. The semantic segmentation network produces four semantic labels that identify the quarters of the individual objects: top left, top right, bottom left, and bottom right. These pixels are grouped into connected regions, based on their proximity and their position with respect to the whole object. Each quarter is used to generate a complete object hypothesis, which is then scored according to object pixel fitness. The individual homogeneous regions extracted from the labeled pixels are then assigned to the best-fitted rectangles, leading to complete and freeform identification of the pixels of individual objects. The accuracy is similar to instance segmentation-based methods but with reduced complexity in terms of trainable parameters, which leads to a reduced demand for computational resources.

ID CLOUD; ALLOCATION
AB With the development of autonomous vehicular technologies, the execution tasks become more memory-consuming and computation-intensive. Simultaneously, a certain portion of tasks are latency-sensitive, such as collaborative perception, path planning, collaborative simultaneous localization and mapping, real-time pedestrian detection, etc. Because of the limited computation resources inside vehicles and restricted transmission bandwidth, edge computing can be an effective way to assist with the tasks execution. Considering from the perspective of business, the reservation or subscription cost is cheaper than real time requests. In order to minimize the expense of consuming edge services, the desirable situation is to reserve the resources as much as needed. However, the configuration of vehicular network is variational in practice due to the diversity of road maps, different time range like peak time and off-peak time, and the various task types, which makes it challenging to figure out a general machine learning model that is suitable for any case. Therefore, to predict the resource consumption in edge nodes accurately in different scenarios, we propose a two-stage meta-learning based approach to adaptively choose the appropriate machine learning algorithms based on the meta-features extracted on database. Besides, due to the deficiency of dataset for edge resource consumption, we program in game engine unity to generate the 3D model of Manhattan area. Meanwhile, we change the factors like different road maps and number of vehicles so as to get closer to practices. In the evaluation part, we adopt root mean square error, mean absolute percentage, and mean GEH as evaluation metrics to assess the performance of each model. Also, a quantitative analysis for the total cost and waste is also conducted. Eventually, we can find that the proposed meta-learning based method outperforms the non-meta ones.

AB Internet of Things (IoT) consists of a variety of heterogeneous interconnected devices called objects or things. These objects are generally equipped with sensing, processing and wireless communication capabilities. Unfortunately, these capabilities are not enough compared to those of devices in traditional networks. For example, objects have low battery power, limited memory storage, and less processing power. There are some cases where objects have to communicate with each other. In an Autonomous Vehicular Network for example, when a vehicle needs to change its direction, it has to alert other vehicles in the same network. This is known as the permutation routing problem. More precisely, the permutation routing problem in IoT occurs when some things of the network possess items that belong to others. The goal is to send items to their respective owners. A number of solutions to the problem have been proposed in literature which focus mainly on Wireless Sensor Networks (where the memory size of objects are the same). In this paper, we propose an efficient permutation routing scheme for a single-hop IoT network (the memory size differs from one object to another). The proposed NESEPRIN protocol consists of two phases: In the first phase, we solve the permutation routing problem in a single-hop environment with a single channel, and secondly we generalize the previous solution to a network with multiple channels. Our solution makes use of the wake and sleep technique to improve the energy conservation of objects. The simulation results show that our protocol outperforms the existing protocols designed to solve the permutation routing problem in terms of energy saving when the volume of data to route is large. NESEPRIN is the better candidate to solve the permutation routing problem in a single-hop multi-channels IoT environment where the volume of data to route is huge.

AB The prediction of the motion of traffic participants is a crucial aspect for the research and development of Automated Driving Systems (ADSs). Recent approaches are based on multi-modal motion prediction, which requires the assignment of a probability score to each of the multiple predicted motion hypotheses. However, there is a lack of ground truth for this probability score in the existing datasets. This implies that current Machine Learning (ML) models evaluate the multiple predictions by comparing them with the single real trajectory labeled in the dataset. In this work, a novel data-based method named Probabilistic Traffic Motion Labeling (PROMOTING) is introduced in order to (a) generate probable future routes and (b) estimate their probabilities. PROMOTING is presented with the focus on urban intersections. The generation of probable future routes is (a) based on a real traffic dataset and consists of two steps: first, a clustering of intersections with similar road topology, and second, a clustering of similar routes that are driven in each cluster from the first step. The estimation of the route probabilities is (b) based on a frequentist approach that considers how traffic participants will move in the future given their motion history. PROMOTING is evaluated with the publicly available Lyft database. The results show that PROMOTING is an appropriate approach to estimate the probabilities of the future motion of traffic participants in urban intersections. In this regard, PROMOTING can be used as a labeling approach for the generation of a labeled dataset that provides a probability score for probable future routes. Such a labeled dataset currently does not exist and would be highly valuable for ML approaches with the task of multi-modal motion prediction. The code is made open source.

AB Driving is a highly dynamic task requiring extensive and fast processing of visuospatial information in brief time intervals, while experienced drivers can efficiently perform this task. Therefore, investigating the human-like visual fixation behavior shows much potential in developing the advanced driving assistance systems and efficient autonomous vehicles. Literature shows that driver's visual fixation behavior is guided by a combination of top-down and bottom-up mechanisms. Currently, existing excellent computational frameworks rely heavily on the deep neural network's strong feature extraction ability, which is inherently task-unaware. These black-box models are limited in strengthening the guidance of task-aware top-down factors in governing the fixation behavior. Furthermore, using the black-box model to fit the training data directly decreases its interpretability. In this paper, we encourage to adopt the white-box method. By researching the findings in the intersection of neuroscience and psychology, we propose to identify two white-box representations for driving separately: the information selection representation including salience, effort, expectancy, and value, and the driving task-aware representation highlighting sub-task and speed. We present a novel computational framework to incorporate all the above factors to predict driver's visual fixation systematically. On the BDDA dataset, we have conducted the extensive quantitative evaluation and qualitative analysis to validate the effectiveness. Its performance surpasses the previous state-of-the-art by +11.3% in the Pearson's Correlation Coefficient, especially by a large margin of +24.5% and +28.8% in the turning operations. The ablation study further demonstrates the influence of each component in our framework. Moreover, the trained model has been deployed on the DR(eye)VE dataset to verify the generalization ability, demonstrating the potential of domain adaptation.

AB The increasingly widespread use of mobile technologies and connectivity as well as vehicle automation have triggered renewed attention to the issue of productivity and enjoyment of time spent travelling. Rejecting the traditional assumption that travel time is "wasted", questions of whether improved fruition of time spent travelling can help encourage PT ridership and affect the uptake of autonomous vehicles draw increasing interest. Yet, the investigation of how people spend travel time, especially from a modelling standpoint, is still an emerging field in travel behaviour research. This paper contributes to this area of study by jointly analysing activity engagement and time use while travelling, with a particular focus on multitasking, i.e. conducting activities other than travel. The application of the newly developed extended Multiple Discrete Continuous (eMDC) model allows the relaxation of the assumption of a defined time budget, allowing the performance of multiple activities at the same time, and permits investigating substitutions and complementarity effects between different activities. The eMDC is found to be more suitable to model multitasking compared to existing approaches because (i) it does not require arbitrarily dropping activities when they are performed at the same time, and (ii) it allows capturing complementarity and substitution effects. By applying the model to the UK Time-Use Survey, we find that social and work activities as well as social and mass media consumption are substitutes while travelling. We also forecast time-use changes under different transport policy scenarios, proving impacts of substitution effects. While eMDC is our preferred approach, we observe that depending on the choice of modelling framework, the results can lead to different conclusions concerning suitability of particular policy measures. Hence, for future applications, testing of different frameworks is advised to assess sensitivity of the conclusions to the implicit modelling assumptions.

AB Data acquisition is the challenging and crucial step for any structural health monitoring (SHM) scheme, especially on numerous measurement locations that are typically at very high elevations or largely inaccessible areas, which are often linked to time-consuming, costly, and to some extent, dangerous sensor implementation and cable wiring. Noncontact vision-based measurement techniques have been recognized recently as a primarily feasible approach, although it is still characterized by some limitations. To address these constraints, the proposed study introduced an enhanced noncontact displacement measurement method that employed an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) and computer vision algorithms. Since UAV can carry cameras to approach any difficult-to-reach regions, the proposed system can overcome several bottlenecks of the state-of-the-art vision-based methods with regard to finding a stationary place for the camcorder and for mitigating the inaccuracy induced by the long distance between the camcorder and the measurement location. Guided by the schematic framework for the system, a camera was mounted on the UAV for filming of the measurement point, and then displacements on that point were determined by a key-point vision-based measurement method. Moreover, translations generated by the UAV were obtained by means of reference objects on the background. Additionally, an autonomous scheme based on Canny edge detection and Hough transform were introduced for calculation of scale factors between the pixel and engineering unit for every image frame to address the issue of very fluctuant distances from the UAV to the measurement location. Subsequently, the actual displacements of the measurement location were measured following the elimination of the UAV motions from the displacement data. The proposed system was verified on an experiment with a small-sized steel tower where the outcomes provided an initial confirmation of the approach's promising potential. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd.

AB This paper aims to present a Decentralised Cooperative Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (DCSLAM) solution based on 2D laser data using an Adaptive Covariance Intersection (ACI). The ACI-DCSLAM algorithm will be validated on a swarm of Unmanned Ground Vehicles (UGVs) receiving features to estimate the position and covariance of shared features before adding them to the global map. With the proposed solution, a group of (UGVs) will be able to construct a large reliable map and localise themselves within this map without any user intervention. The most popular solutions to this problem are the EKF-SLAM, Nonlinear H-infinity (NH infinity) SLAM and the FAST-SLAM. The former suffers from two important problems which are the poor consistency caused by the linearization problem and the calculation of Jacobian. The second solution is the NH infinity which is a very promising filter because it doesn't make any assumption about noise characteristics, while the latter is not suitable for real time implementation. Therefore, a new alternative solution based on the smooth variable structure filter (SVSF) is adopted. Cooperative adaptive SVSF-SLAM algorithm is proposed in this paper to solve the UGVs SLAM problem. Our main contribution consists in adapting the SVSF filter to solve the Decentralised Cooperative SLAM problem for multiple UGVs. The algorithms developed in this paper were implemented using two mobile robots Pioneer P3 - AT, equiped with 2D laser telemetry sensors. Good results are obtained by the Cooperative adaptive SVSF-SLAM algorithm compared to the Cooperative EKF/NH8-SLAM algorithms, especially when the noise is colored or affected by a variable bias. Simulation results confirm and show the efficiency of the proposed algorithm which is more robust, stable and adapted to real time applications.

DE autonomous driving; computer vision; trajectory prediction
AB Accurately predicting the future trajectory and behavior of traffic participants is crucial for the maneuvers of self-driving vehicles. Many existing works employed a learning-based "encoder-interactor-decoder" structure, but they often fail to clearly articulate the relationship between module selections and real-world interactions. As a result, these approaches tend to rely on a simplistic stacking of attention modules. To address this issue, a trajectory prediction network (Q-EANet) is presented in this study, which integrates GRU encoders, MLPs and attention modules. By introducing a new explanatory rule, it makes a contribution to interpretable modeling, models the entire trajectory prediction process via an implicit social modeling formula. Inspired by the anchoring effect in decision psychology, the prediction task is formulated as an information query process that occurs before traffic participants make decisions. Specifically, Q-EANet uses GRUs to encode features and utilizes attention modules to aggregates interaction information for generating the target trajectory anchors. Then, queries are introduced for further interaction. These queries, along with the trajectory anchors with added Gaussian noise, are then processed by a GRU-based decoder. The final prediction results are obtained through a Laplace MDN. Experimental results on the several benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of Q-EANet in trajectory prediction tasks. Compared to the existing works, the proposed method achieves state-of-the-art performance with only simple module design. The code for this work is publicly available at .

AB The expeditious growth of the Internet of Things (IoT) has accelerated the evolution of multi-access edge computing (MEC). MEC alleviates the challenges of conventional cloud computing, such as high data latency, poor data gathering reliability, increased network cost, and lack of network robustness. The primary objective of MEC is to facilitate a hierarchy of edge servers to address these quality-of-service (QoS) challenges, especially the information propagation issue due to the mobility of IoT devices (IoD). Further, social-relationship among mobile IoD is a critical parameter used to reduce the data transmission delay and queue size at the MEC. Specifically, in this work, a novel socially-aware radio map generation method is proposed to compute the fine-grained and accurate locations of QoS-deprived areas. Firstly, a novel method to compute the social relationship index (SRI) factor is proposed on the basis of current and future encounters among moving IoDs. Then the obtained SRI factor is used to form clusters of mobile IoD. The clusters' signal to interference plus noise ratio (SINR) is then used to generate the socially-aware radio map. Following that, unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV) use this radio map, which contains rich and serviceable channel information, for 3D beamforming towards the mobile clusters. Using the obtained radio map, Kalman filter-based offline path planning of UAVs is proposed to minimize the UAVs flying distance from the initial to final locations. Furthermore, an optimization problem is formulated to assess the performance of the proposed method. Finally, the performance of the proposed method is compared with the existing methods, taking into account various network parameters such as optimum number of UAVs needed to cover the deployed area, data transmission delay, and received SINR.

AB Aims Micromotion is an autonomous intramural movement of the bladder, and is believed to be an initial step in the generation of urinary urgency. Therefore, controlling micromotion may be a novel target in overactive bladder (OAB) treatment. However, developing micromotion treatment has been limited by the absence of a standardized animal model. We attempted to create a micromotion animal model and investigated the effectiveness of a beta(3)-adrenoceptor agonist (CL316,243) on micromotion.Methods Bilateral major pelvic ganglia (MPGs) were excised in 18 male Sprague-Dawley rats, resulting in an almost completely denervated bladder. On postoperative Day 7, cystometry was performed. Rats were divided into three treatment groups: CL316,243; beta(3-)adrenoceptor antagonist (SR59230A) pretreated CL316,243; and a nonselective antimuscarinic agent (oxybutynin). Changes in micromotion were evaluated after the intra-arterial administration of each agent.Results Low-amplitude oscillations in intravesical pressure (micromotion) were observed 1 week after MPGs excision. Micromotion frequency significantly (p = 0.003) decreased (2.17 & PLUSMN; 3.54 times/5 min) with CL316,243 compared with vehicle (6.33 & PLUSMN; 1.97 times/5 min). Micromotion amplitude also decreased with CL316,243 (1.15 & PLUSMN; 1.93 cmH(2)O) compared with vehicle (5.96 & PLUSMN; 5.12 cmH(2)O), approaching conventional significance (p = 0.090). No significant decreases in frequency or amplitude were observed with oxybutynin treatment.Conclusions Systemic administration of the beta(3)-adrenoceptor agonist CL316,243 effectively controlled micromotion in bilateral MPGs-excised, almost completely denervated rat bladders. This result indicates that beta(3)-adrenoceptor agonist may affect the bladder directly, suggesting that it might be effective for overall OAB, regardless of the presence or level of neurological deficits. Bilateral MPGs-excised rats are considered a plausible micromotion animal model suitable for future research.

AB A novel air-to-ground communication paradigm is conceived, where an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)-mounted base station (BS) equipped with multiple antennas sends information to multiple ground users (GUs) with the aid of a simultaneously transmitting and reflecting reconfigurable intelligent surface (STAR-RIS). In contrast to the conventional RIS whose main function is to reflect incident signals, the STAR-RIS is capable of both transmitting and reflecting the impinging signals from either side of the surface, thereby leading to full-space 360 degree coverage. However, the transmissive and reflective capabilities of the STAR-RIS require more complex transmission/reflection coefficient design. Therefore, in this work, a sum-rate maximization problem is formulated for the joint optimization of the UAV's trajectory, the active beamforming at the UAV, and the passive transmission/reflection beamforming at the STAR-RIS. This cutting-edge optimization problem is also subject to the UAV's flight safety, to the maximum flight duration constraint, as well as to the GUs' minimum data rate requirements. Given the unknown locations of obstacles prior to the UAV's flight, we provide an online decision making framework employing reinforcement learning (RL) to simultaneously adjust both the UAV's trajectory as well as the active and passive beamformer. To enhance the system's robustness against the associated uncertainties caused by limited sampling of the environment, a novel "distributionally-robust" RL (DRRL) algorithm is proposed for offering an adequate worst-case performance guarantee. Our numerical results unveil that: 1) the STAR-RIS assisted UAV communications benefit from significant sum-rate gain over the conventional reflecting-only RIS; and 2) the proposed DRRL algorithm achieves both more stable and more robust performance than the state-of-the-art RL algorithms.

AB The huge available bandwidth in Terahertz (THz) frequency band is recently contemplated to achieve high data rate wireless communications. Consequently, THz communications are attractive candidates to fulfill the continuous ever-increasing requirements of future wireless networks. Numerous beyond 5G applications are highly considered for those systems such as high capacity backhaul, enhanced hotspot booths as well as short-range device-to-device (D2D) communications. Wireless communications systems that deploy unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) promise to achieve cost-effective wireless connectivity for devices without any need to pay for infrastructure coverage. When compared to terrestrial communications, wireless systems with UAVs are generally faster and more flexible to deploy or reconfigure. In addition, systems deploying UAVs are likely to have much better communication channels due to their high mobility capabilities. Accordingly, the presence of short-range line-of-sight (LOS) links prevail. In this paper, we consider a single-cell cellular network with a UAV deployed as a decode-and-forward (DF) relay in the full-duplex (FD) mode in order to assist a base station (BS) and extend its coverage over THz channel. A joint power allocation and trajectory optimization scheme that minimizes the outage probability of the link between the BS and a mobile device (MD) is derived in the presence of the interference of the D2D devices that share the same THz frequency band. Furthermore, the optimum powers of the MD and the UAV that maximize the achievable rate at the BS are obtained. The performance of the proposed schemes is compared with the fixed power allocation schemes which distribute the power equally among users. Numerical results show that the outage probability and the achievable rate at the BS using the proposed schemes are remarkably superior compared to the fixed power allocation schemes.

AB Underwater vehicles are widely used in underwater detection, and bionic design, e.g. imitating fish, is an important way to improve their hydrodynamic performance. Most research is on the mechanical structure and kinematics of fish-like models, while evolvement rules and hydrodynamic effects of fluid field around fish have not been studied adequately. In this paper, a kinematic model to simulate the swimming motion of fish is established according to the actual movement of tuna, and the model is optimized to achieve convenient adjustment in the initial oscillating position and maximum oscillating amplitude. A numerical simulation model is established and the boundary condition is verified by experiments with a physical fish-like prototype and a set of force measuring devices. The evolvement rule of the fluid field around the fish-like model from starting to cruising is determined and the hydrodynamic effect is analyzed. The issue of the effect of fluid fields with various averaged fish-like model densities in the buoyancy regulating process is discussed. Finally, a novel way to calculate the Strouhal number is proposed. The results show that the averaged drag force coefficient decreases as the fish-like model speeds up, because the water pressure near the fish head strengthens to generate a larger resistance force and the vortex in the wake field disperses to produce a less positive effect. The viewpoint that the superposition of vortices will benefit the fish-like model instead of weakening the positive effect is confirmed. The width value of the reversed Karman vortex street can be connected with the Strouhal number, and the Strouhal number can be calculated by the evolvement rule of the fluid field. This research will contribute to bionic autonomous underwater vehicle design.

AB In this article, a radio-frequency (RF) power-amplifier (PA) system configuration for the on-board energy conversion is proposed for unmanned aerial vehicle base station's (UAV-BS's) battery charging. First, the PA system utilizes the internal RF source for energy conversion so that perpetual battery charging is possible without external power sources. Therefore, a continuous battery charging of the UAV-BS is possible while providing wireless network coverage by hovering over the target location. In addition, the proposed PA system offers a higher RF power control resolution than the existing PA works, which is desirable for precise power control of the UAV-BS. The objective of simultaneous RF power control and battery charging by the PA system is achieved by activating one Wilkinson power divider (WPD) with a specific power splitting ratio in the power divider bank. The simulations show that the dynamic activation of ten distinct unequal split WPDs of the proposed PA system improves the RF power control resolution by $157$ and $396{\,}\%$ compared to the existing PAs. Additionally, the simulations show that the PA's power added efficiency fluctuation is reduced by $54$ and $82{\,}\%$ compared to the existing PAs. In addition, it will be shown that the proposed on-board battery charging increases the hovering time by $7.4{\,}\%$. Furthermore, an energy-efficiency optimization framework for UAV-BS's is proposed considering real-world communication system's hardware imperfections, and the proposed result suggests that UAV-BS's flight time may decrease by $50{\,}\%$ depending upon the type of UAV-BS RF components.

AB Real-time and high-precision localization information is vital for many modules of unmanned vehicles. At present, a high-cost RTK (Real Time Kinematic) and IMU (Integrated Measurement Unit) integrated navigation system is often used, but its accuracy cannot meet the requirements and even fails in many scenes. In order to reduce the costs and improve the localization accuracy and stability, we propose a precise and robust segmentation-based Lidar (Light Detection and Ranging) localization system aided with MEMS (Micro-Electro-Mechanical System) IMU and designed for high level autonomous driving. Firstly, we extracted features from the online frame using a series of proposed efficient low-level semantic segmentation-based multiple types feature extraction algorithms, including ground, road-curb, edge, and surface. Next, we matched the adjacent frames in Lidar odometry module and matched the current frame with the dynamically loaded pre-build feature point cloud map in Lidar localization module based on the extracted features to precisely estimate the 6DoF (Degree of Freedom) pose, through the proposed priori information considered category matching algorithm and multi-group-step L-M (Levenberg-Marquardt) optimization algorithm. Finally, the lidar localization results were fused with MEMS IMU data through a state-error Kalman filter to produce smoother and more accurate localization information at a high frequency of 200Hz. The proposed localization system can achieve 3 similar to 5 cm in position and 0.05 similar to 0.1 degrees in orientation RMS (Root Mean Square) accuracy and outperform previous state-of-the-art systems. The robustness and adaptability have been verified with localization testing data more than 1000 Km in various challenging scenes, including congested urban roads, narrow tunnels, textureless highways, and rain-like harsh weather.

AB Indoor positioning technology based on Received Signal Strength Indicator (RSSI) fingerprints is a potential navigation solution, which has the advantages of simple implementation, low cost and high precision. However, as the radio frequency signals can be easily affected by the environmental change during its transmission, it is quite necessary to build location fingerprint database in advance and update it frequently, thereby guaranteeing the positioning accuracy. At present, the fingerprint database building methods mainly include point collection and line acquisition, both of which are usually labor-intensive and time consuming, especially in a large map area. This paper proposes a fast and efficient location fingerprint database construction and updating method based on a self-developed Unmanned Ground Vehicle (UGV) platform NAVIS, called Automatic Robot Line Collection. A smartphone was installed on NAVIS for collecting indoor Received Signal Strength Indicator (RSSI) fingerprints of Signals of Opportunity (SOP), such as Bluetooth and Wi-Fi. Meanwhile, indoor map was created by 2D LiDAR-based Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) technology. The UGV automatically traverse the unknown indoor environment due to a pre-designed full-coverage path planning algorithm. Then, SOP sensors collect location fingerprints and generates grid map during the process of environment-traversing. Finally, location fingerprint database is built or updated by Kriging interpolation. Field tests were carried out to verify the effectiveness and efficiency of our proposed method. The results showed that, compared with the traditional point collection and line collection schemes, the root mean square error of the fingerprinting-based positioning results were reduced by 35.9% and 25.0% in static tests and 30.0% and 21.3% respectively in dynamic tests. Moreover, our UGV can traverse the indoor environment autonomously without human-labor on data acquisition, the efficiency of the automatic robot line collection scheme is 2.65 times and 1.72 times that of the traditional point collection and the traditional line acquisition, respectively.

AB The present study surveyed actual extensive users of SAE Level 2 partially automated cars to investigate how driver's characteristics (i.e., socio-demographics, driving experience, personality), system performance, perceived safety, and trust in partial automation influence use of partial automation. 81% of respondents stated that they use their automated car with speed (ACC) and steering assist (LKA) at least 1-2 times a week, and 84 and 92% activate LKA and ACC at least occasionally. Respondents positively rated the performance of Adaptive Cruise Control (ACC) and Lane Keeping Assistance (LKA). ACC was rated higher than LKA and detection of lead vehicles and lane markings was rated higher than smooth control for ACC and LKA, respectively. Respondents reported to primarily disengage (i.e., turn off) partial automation due to a lack of trust in the system and when driving is fun. They rarely disengaged the system when they noticed they become bored or sleepy. Structural equation modelling revealed that trust had a positive effect on driver's propensity for secondary task engagement during partially automated driving, while the effect of perceived safety was not significant. Regarding driver's characteristics, we did not find a significant effect of age on perceived safety and trust in partial automation. Neuroticism negatively correlated with perceived safety and trust, while extraversion did not impact perceived safety and trust. The remaining three personality dimensions 'openness', 'conscientiousness', and 'agreeableness' did not form valid and reliable scales in the confirmatory factor analysis, and could thus not be subjected to the structural equation modelling analysis. Future research should re-assess the suitability of the short 10-item scale as measure of the Big-Five personality traits, and investigate the impact on perceived safety, trust, use and use of automation.

AB Since their introduction in 2017, Electric Scooter Sharing systems (ESSs) are shown to provide numerous benefits for both individuals and society, including convenient green mobility particularly over short to medium dis-tances, increased access to other modes of transportation, and lower cost of travel. Nevertheless, several barriers still hinder the widespread acceptance of ESSs which can be categorized according to their level of impact as macro (infrastructure), meso (community), and micro (individual/perceptions). The acceptance of ESSs as a critical factor at an individual level seems to be the first obstacle to their widespread use. Previous studies have proposed strategies to encourage the use of ESSs, but little information is available concerning how end-users perceive this innovative technology. In this regard, a comprehensive conceptual framework is developed based on the extended Technology Acceptance Model (TAM) that incorporates system characteristics, social influence, and individual acceptance of the ESSs to assess individuals' intentions. The Partial Least Squares Structural Equation Model framework is used to analyze the conceptual model and 22 hypotheses. An online survey with 560 participants is used. The findings indicate that perceived usefulness, trust, and subjective norms are the most important factors determining the willingness to use ESSs. According to our analysis, the conceptual model provides an effective theoretical framework for identifying factors influencing individuals' acceptance of ESSs, enabling the identification of appropriate policies to improve ESSs operations. Accordingly, ESSs inte-gration into a comprehensive and user-friendly platform, accessibility planning, favorable depiction of ESSs and their advantages in media advertisements, and publicity campaigns to promote e-scooters as a sustainable mode of transportation are the most important policies to attract attention to e-scooters.

AB Unmanned Aerial Vehicles and the increasing variety of their applications are raising in popularity. The growing number of UAVs, emphasizes the significance of drones' reliability and robustness. Thus, there is a need for an efficient self-observing sensing mechanism to detect real-time anomalies in drone behavior. Previous works suggested prediction models from control theory, yet, they are complex by nature and hard to implement, while Deep Learning solutions are of great utility. In this paper, we propose a real-time framework to detect anomalies in drones by analyzing the sound emitted from them. For this purpose, we construct a hybrid Deep Learning based Transformer and a Convolutional Neural Network inspired by the well-known VGG architecture. Our approach is examined over a dataset that is collected from a single microphone set located on a micro drone in real-time. Our approach achieves an F1-score of 88.4% in detecting anomalies and outperforms the VGG-16 architecture. Moreover, the framework presented in this paper reduces the number of parameters of the well-known VGG-16 from 138M, into a shrunk version with 3.6M parameters only. Additionally, our real-time approach, results in a smaller number of parameters in the neural network, and yet yields high accuracy in anomaly detection in drones with an average inference time of 0.2 seconds per second. Moreover, with an earphone that weighs less than 100 grams on top of the UAV, our method is shown to be beneficial, even in extreme conditions such as a micro-size dataset that is composed of three hours of flight recordings. The presented self-observing method can be implemented by simply adding a microphone to drones and transmitting the captured audio for analysis to the remote control or performing it onboard the drone using a dedicated microcontroller.

AB In this article, we explore the fundamental limits of the 3-dimensional (3D) localization of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) in conjunction with the effects of 3D antenna radiation patterns. Although localization of UAVs has been studied to some extent in the literature, effects of antenna characteristics on 3D localization remains mostly unexplored. To study such effects, we consider a scenario where a fixed number of radio-frequency (RF) sensors equipped with single or multiple dipole antennas are placed at some known locations on the ground, and they derive the time-difference-of-arrival (TDOA) measurements from the time-of-arrival (TOA) data collected for the UAV that is also equipped with a dipole antenna. We then use these measurements to estimate the 3D location of the UAV, and to derive the Cramer-Rao lower bounds (CRLBs) on the localization error for various orientations of the dipole antennas at the transmitter and the receiver. Namely, we consider vertical-vertical (VV), horizontal-horizontal (HH), and vertical-horizontal (VH) radiation patterns in a purely line-of-sight (LoS) environment and a mixed LoS/Non-line-of-sight (NLoS) environment. We show that the localization accuracy changes in a non-monotonic pattern with respect to the UAV altitude and identify the respective critical altitudes for each of the VV, VH and HH orientations. Subsequently, we propose a multi-antenna signal acquisition technique that mitigates the accuracy degradation due to the antenna pattern mismatches, and we derive the localization CRLB for the multi-antenna scenario. Our numerical results characterize achievable localization accuracy for various antenna configurations, UAV heights, and propagation conditions for representative UAV scenarios.

AB Ball joints used in the steering systems of vehicles are exposed to fluctuating loads, which can cause fatal accidents in case of failure. The design of ball joints is an iterative and time-consuming process. Even though the automotive industry is preparing for the era of autonomous self-steering vehicles, parts such as ball joints were not designed using a fully automated parametric design methodology. Recently, parametric design of automotive ball joints based on variable design methodology using knowledge and feature-based computer-assisted-3D modelling methods was studied. However, these studies do not give details of the interactive sizing process within the part and assembly module to determine the final dimensions for avoidance of fatigue failure. This work provides methods and discusses details of the configurable sizing of a ball joint assembly under the boundaries of the developed "parametric design platform". The platform closes the software gap for the automated reconfiguration and sizing of the ball joint assembly using a three-dimensional (3D) modelling technique. The platform can parametrically change part, material, feature, geometry, assembly and dimension features in a programmable environment. It can also reconfigure the ball joint assembly model considering various structured data conforming to technical standards and reasoning mechanisms with "engineering and geometrical relations" provided in this work, and data gathering along the life cycle of a product. Parameterised 3D solid models and a knowledge base of ball joints are stored in a database, and then an evaluation process within the platform that is capable of sizing ball joints for infinite fatigue-life has been established to verify sizing. It demonstrates the practicability and validity of the automated sizing of a steering ball joint within a configurable design environment and with minimum human expert knowledge and interaction.

AB A study about the effect of different configurations of stationary and movable appendages on the dynamic stability of an autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) is presented. A new stability index that can be used to assess dynamic stability in the vertical plane is derived. It improves upon the vertical plane stability index by accurately accounting for the contribution of hydrostatic forces to dynamic stability, even at low speeds. The use of the new stability index is illustrated by applying it to a set of AUV configurations based on an AUV initially designed at Virginia Tech and built by Dive Technologies. The applicability of this index depends on the speed of the craft. The range of applicability in terms of speed is presented for the DIVE craft as an example. The baseline design of the DIVE craft has asymmetry in the vertical plane and symmetry in the horizontal plane. A virtual planar motion mechanism (VPMM) is used to obtain the hydrodynamic coefficients of the hull. Design iterations are performed on the baseline design by varying the appendages in shape and size, adding appendages and adding features on appendages. The best and the baseline design from this effort are incorporated in a 6 DOF lumped-parameter model (LPM) to compare results of a straight line maneuver. A computational fluid dynamic (CFD) tool is used to obtain the trajectory comparison of turn-circle maneuver for these two designs. A principal conclusion is the important contribution of a hydrostatic restoring force at low-moderate speeds by using G(Vgrav) and the influence of design of control surfaces, both stationary and non-stationary, in the achievement of control-fixed course stability.

AB High-resolution bathymetric surveys from autonomous underwater vehicles ABE and D. Allan B. were merged to create a coregistered map of 71.7 km(2) of the Endeavour Segment of the Juan de Fuca Ridge. Radiocarbon dating of foraminifera in cores from three dives of remotely operated vehicle Doc Ricketts provide minimum eruption ages for 40 lava flows that are combined with the bathymetric data to outline the eruptive and tectonic history. The ages range from Modern to 10,700 marine-calibrated years before present (yr BP). During a robust magmatic phase from >10,700 yr BP to approximate to 4300 yr BP, flows erupted from an axial high and many flowed >5 km down the flanks; some partly buried adjacent valleys. Axial magma chambers (AMCs) may have been wider than today to supply dike intrusions over a 2 km wide axial zone. Summit Seamount formed by approximate to 4770 yr BP and was subsequently dismembered during a period of extension with little volcanism starting approximate to 4300 yr BP. This tectonic phase with only rare volcanic eruptions lasted until approximate to 2300 yr BP and may have resulted in near-solidification of the AMCs. The axial graben formed by crustal extension during this period of low magmatic activity. Infrequent eruptions occurred on the flanks between 2620-1760 yr BP and within the axial graben since approximate to 1750 yr BP. This most recent phase of limited volcanic and intense hydrothermal activity that began approximate to 2300 yr BP defines a hydrothermal phase of ridge development that coincides with the present-day 1 km wide AMCs and overlying hydrothermal vent fields.

TI Strong Depth-Related Zonation of Megabenthos on a Rocky Continental
   Margin (∼700-4000 m) off Southern Tasmania, Australia
SO PLOS ONE

AB Assemblages of megabenthos are structured in seven depth-related zones between similar to 700 and 4000 m on the rocky and topographically complex continental margin south of Tasmania, southeastern Australia. These patterns emerge from analysis of imagery and specimen collections taken from a suite of surveys using photographic and in situ sampling by epibenthic sleds, towed video cameras, an autonomous underwater vehicle and a remotely operated vehicle (ROV). Seamount peaks in shallow zones had relatively low biomass and low diversity assemblages, which may be in part natural and in part due to effects of bottom trawl fishing. Species richness was highest at intermediate depths (1000-1300 m) as a result of an extensive coral reef community based on the bioherm-forming scleractinian Solenosmilia variabilis. However, megabenthos abundance peaked in a deeper, low diversity assemblage at 2000-2500 m. The S. variabilis reef and the deep biomass zone were separated by an extensive dead, sub-fossil S. variabilis reef and a relatively low biomass stratum on volcanic rock roughly coincident with the oxygen minimum layer. Below 2400 m, megabenthos was increasingly sparse, though punctuated by occasional small pockets of relatively high diversity and biomass. Nonetheless, megabenthic organisms were observed in the vast majority of photographs on all seabed habitats and to the maximum depths observed - a sandy plain below 3950 m. Taxonomic studies in progress suggest that the observed depth zonation is based in part on changing species mixes with depth, but also an underlying commonality to much of the seamount and rocky substrate biota across all depths. Although the mechanisms supporting the extraordinarily high biomass in 2000-2500 m depths remains obscure, plausible explanations include equatorwards lateral transport of polar production and/or a response to depth-stratified oxygen availability.

AB This paper presents the design and development of autonomous attitude stabilization, navigation in unstructured, GPS-denied environments, aggressive landing on inclined surfaces, and aerial gripping using onboard sensors on a low-cost, custom-built quadrotor. The development of a multi-functional micro air vehicle (MAV) that utilizes inexpensive off-the-shelf components presents multiple challenges due to noise and sensor accuracy, and there are control challenges involved with achieving various capabilities beyond navigation. This paper addresses these issues by developing a complete system from the ground up, addressing the attitude stabilization problem using extensive filtering and an attitude estimation filter recently developed in the literature. Navigation in both indoor and outdoor environments is achieved using a visual Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) algorithm that relies on an onboard monocular camera. The system utilizes nested controllers for attitude stabilization, vision-based navigation, and guidance, with the navigation controller implemented using a nonlinear controller based on the sigmoid function. The efficacy of the approach is demonstrated by maintaining a stable hover even in the presence of wind gusts and when manually hitting and pulling on the quadrotor. Precision landing on inclined surfaces is demonstrated as an example of an aggressive maneuver, and is performed using only onboard sensing. Aerial gripping is accomplished with the addition of a secondary camera, capable of detecting infrared light sources, which is used to estimate the 3D location of an object, while an under-actuated and passively compliant manipulator is designed for effective gripping under uncertainty.
   The quadrotor is therefore able to autonomously navigate inside and outside, in the presence of disturbances, and perform tasks such as aggressively landing on inclined surfaces and locating and grasping an object, using only inexpensive, onboard sensors.

AB Since the beginning of space exploration, methods and protocols of exploration have been developed using space analogs on Earth to reduce research costs, develop safe deployment/retrieval protocols, and ready astronauts for hostile environments in less threatening settings. Space analogs are required as much as ever today as astronauts and scientists develop new tools and techniques for exploration, while working to address evolving mission objectives from low-earth orbit to deep-space exploration. This study examines coordinated human and robotic exploration at the Aquarius Underwater Habitat off of the coast of Key Largo, Florida, in support of the NEEMO 15 (NASA Extreme Environment Mission Operations) program. The exploration scheme presented in this work fuses (1) robotic precursor missions as a means of remote sensing data collection; (2) crowdsourcing to process immense amounts of data to identify key targets of interest that might be missed in the tight cycle of mission operations; and (3) human exploration to examine locations directly up close and collect physical samples that require involved sampling techniques. Autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) and single-person submersibles, called DeepWorkers (TM), were used as underwater analogs of robotic systems currently being used and human-operated vehicles (HOVs) proposed for use on a Near Earth Asteroid (NEA), the Moon, or Mars. In addition to operational lessons learned for space exploration that are directly applicable to ocean exploration, ocean floor mapping provides new levels of detail of benthic habitat critical for coral reef monitoring and management. Opportunistic (onsite adaptive) data sampling also took place by placing self-recording instrumentation onto each of the DeepWorkers, increasing the collection of scientific information during the submersible missions and contributing to mission planning for optimal and efficient use of expensive assets.

AB We are in an unprecedented moment for promoting forest restoration globally, with international and regional pledges to restore at least 350 million hectares by 2030. To achieve these ambitious goals, it is necessary to go beyond traditional plot-scale assessments and develop cost-effective technologies that can monitor the structure and function of restored forests at much broader scales. Lidar remote sensing in unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) platforms can be an agile and autonomous method for monitoring forest restoration projects, especially under conditions when information updates are frequently needed in relatively small areas or, when using an airplane borne lidar system may be not financially viable. Here, we explored the potential of an UAV-borne lidar system to assess the outcomes of a mixed-species restoration plantation experiment, designed to maximize aboveground biomass (AGB) accumulation. The experiment was established in Brazil's Atlantic Forest, with 20 native tree species, by combining two levels of planting density and two management levels, totaling four treatment combinations and one control (plots left over for natural regeneration). We analyzed three structural variables from lidar data (canopy height, gap fraction and leaf area index) and one from field inventory data (AGB). Structural differences between the treatments and the control plots were reliably distinguished by the UAV-borne lidar system. AGB was strongly correlated with canopy height, allowing us to elaborate a predictive equation to use the UAV-borne lidar system for monitoring structural features in other restoration plantations in the region. UAV-borne lidar systems showed enormous potential for monitoring relatively broad-scale (thousands of hectares) forest restoration projects, providing an important tool to aid decision making and accountability in forest landscape restoration.

AB Biohybrid systems integrate living materials with synthetic devices, exploiting their respective advantages to solve challenging engineering problems. One challenge of critical importance to society is detecting and localizing airborne volatile chemicals. Many flying animals depend their ability to detect and locate the source of aerial chemical plumes for finding mates and food sources. A robot with comparable capability could reduce human hazard and drastically improve performance on tasks such as locating disaster survivors, hazardous gas leaks, incipient fires, or explosives. Three advances are needed before they can rival their biological counterparts: (1) a chemical sensor with a much faster response time that nevertheless satisfies the size, weight, and power constraints of flight, (2) a design, sensor suite, and control system that allows it to move toward the source of a plume fully autonomously while navigating obstacles, and (3) the ability to detect the plume with high specificity and sensitivity among the assortment of chemicals that invariably exist in the air. Here we address the first two, introducing a human-safe palm-sized air vehicle equipped with the odor-sensing antenna of an insect, the first odor-sensing biohybrid robot system to fly. Using this sensor along with a suite of additional navigational sensors, as well as passive wind fins, our robot orients upwind and navigates autonomously toward the source of airborne plumes. Our robot is the first flying biohybrid system to successfully perform odor localization in a confined space, and it is able to do so while detecting and avoiding obstacles in its flight path. We show that insect antennae respond more quickly than metal oxide gas sensors, enabling odor localization at an improved speed over previous flying robots. By using the insect antennae, we anticipate a feasible path toward improved chemical specificity and sensitivity by leveraging recent advances in gene editing.

AB Synchronization pertains to the property of interconnected systems according to which their dynamic behavior is coordinated in an appropriate sense. That is to say, some of their state variables, or functions of the latter for that matter, converge to each other. Synchronization may occur naturally or may be induced, controlled, and it may be present between two systems or among a large number. In the latter case, it is convenient to speak of a network of interconnected systems. Understanding synchronization, and how to control it, is an important paradigm as it is present in a variety of scenarios. These involve, e.g., networks of technological systems (robots and vehicles of different kinds), social networks (by which people exchange opinions and agree, or not), networks of biological systems (uni or pluricellular), etc. Owing to the context, the mathematical models to describe such networks and to define synchronization formally, varies dramatically. Ordinary continuous-time or discrete-time models for which modern control theory and Lyapunov stability theory are tailored result inappropriate to incorporate hybrid phenomena that intervene in the network. These may stem from sudden topology changes, the use of digital or intermittent control strategies, the presence of impacts in the intrinsic dynamics of the nodes, etc. In this invited paper, we give an overview of synchronization control problems, mostly of cooperative control of networks of autonomous vehicles (based on continuous-time models). For that matter, the first part of the paper focuses on the main contributions of [1]. Then, we give further perspectives on what we consider significant open problems on synchronization of hybrid systems and hybrid networks. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB In this paper, a novel dynamic surface sliding mode control (DSSMC) method, combined with a lateral velocity tracking differentiator (LVTD), is proposed for the cooperative formation control of underactuated unmanned surface vehicles (USVs) exposed to complex marine environment disturbances. Firstly, in view of the kinematic and dynamic models of USVs and the design idea of a virtual control law in a backstepping approach, the trajectory tracking control problem of USVs' cooperative formation is transformed into a stabilisation problem of the virtual control law of longitudinal and lateral velocities. Then, aiming at the problem of differential explosion caused by repeated derivation in the process of backstepping design, the first-order low-pass filter about the virtual longitudinal velocity and intermediate state quantity of position is constructed to replace differential calculations during the design of the control law, respectively. In order to reduce the steady-state error when stabilising the virtual lateral velocity control law, the integral term is introduced into the design of the sliding mode surface with a lateral velocity error, and then the second-order sliding mode surface with an integral is structured. In addition, due to the problem of controller oscillation and the role of the tracking differentiator (TD) in active disturbance rejection control (ADRC), the LVTD is designed to smooth the state quantity of lateral velocity. Subsequently, based on the dynamic model of USV under complex marine environment disturbances, the nonlinear disturbance observer is designed to observe the disturbances and compensate the control law. Finally, the whole cooperative formation system is proved to be uniformly and ultimately bounded, according to the Lyapunov stability theory, and the stability and validity of the method is also verified by the simulation results.

AB The primary aim of this study was to assess and classify selected EU countries to groups differing in terms of the degree of implementation of innovative energy technologies to alleviate adverse externalities in road transport. This aim was realised using three groups of research methods: collection of empirical data, data processing and presentation of study outcomes. When collecting the research material, the authors used the method of critical literature review and the documentation method. The research material was processed using the agglomerative clustering technique, which was one of the hierarchical clustering methods. The distance between objects (here, selected EU countries) was determined based on the Euclidean distance. The outcome of this analysis was a dendrogram, which constitutes a graphical interpretation of obtained results. The study was conducted on 21 EU countries. The analyses covered the years 2013-2019. The sources of materials included literature on the subject and the Eurostat data. The problem of innovative energy technologies in road transport is presently of considerable importance. This results from the current situation related to human activity. As a result of the conducted cluster analysis, groups were distinguished based on differences in the use of innovative energy technologies alleviating negative externalities generated by road transport. The first group comprised Sweden, the Netherlands and Finland. Compared to the other groups, this group was distinguished by the highest values of four indexes, i.e., the share of renewable energy sources used in transport in 2019, the share in the market of electric passenger vehicles in 2019, the share in the market of electric lorries in 2019, as well as the share in the market of hybrid automobiles in 2019. Countries which participated the least in the elimination of negative externalities generated by road transport included Romania, Hungary, Greece, Poland, Latvia and Estonia.

ID NEURAL-NETWORKS; ALGORITHM
AB Machine learning has rapidly evolved during the last decade, achieving expert human performance on notoriously challenging problems such as image classification. This success is partly due to the re-emergence of bio-inspired modern artificial neural networks (ANNs) along with the availability of computation power, vast labelled data and ingenious human-based expert knowledge as well as optimisation approaches that can find the correct configuration (and weights) for these networks. Neuroevolution is a term used for the latter when employing evolutionary algorithms. Most of the works in neuroevolution have focused their attention in a single type of ANNs, named Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). Moreover, most of these works have used a single optimisation approach. This work makes a progressive step forward in neuroevolution for vehicle trajectory prediction, referred to as neurotrajectory prediction, where multiple objectives must be considered. To this end, rich ANNs composed of CNNs and Long-short Term Memory Network are adopted. Two well-known and robust Evolutionary Multi-objective Optimisation (EMO) algorithms, named Non-dominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm-II (NSGA-II) and Multi-Objective Evolutionary Algorithm based on Decomposition (MOEA/D) are also adopted. The completely different underlying mechanism of each of these algorithms sheds light on the implications of using one over the other EMO approach in neurotrajectory prediction. In particular, the importance of considering objective scaling is highlighted, finding that MOEA/D can be more adept at focusing on specific objectives whereas, NSGA-II tends to be more invariant to objective scaling. Additionally, certain objectives are shown to be either beneficial or detrimental to finding valid models, for instance, inclusion of a distance feedback objective was considerably detrimental to finding valid models, while a lateral velocity objective was more beneficial.(c) 2023 Published by Elsevier B.V.

AB One goal of future transit-oriented transportation systems is to promote door-to-door mobility for travelers by integrating different public transportation modes into a whole. We propose a mathematical design framework for such a transit-oriented multi-modal transportation system from a societal aspect considering three categories of public transportation modes, i.e., general on-demand modes, local on-demand modes, and fixed-schedule modes. A system-state equilibrium is brought up to describe travelers' rational travel choices and their reverse effects on agency service levels using the continuous approximation method, and a centralized system designer then manages to achieve a system-beneficial outcome with the minimum cost. To solve the design problem, we prove that the transportation system reaches a unique equilibrium when decision variables are given. By this discovery, we construct a global search framework based on the DIRECT algorithm to solve the optimal design. In analyzing the problem property, we rigorously prove that in the designed systems, the bus service as a fixed-schedule mode is absent from the design scheme under the cases with sufficiently low demands, and the design problem thus reduces to a one-dimensional line search. The ride-hailing service as a general on-demand mode is similarly proved to be excluded when the demand is sufficiently high. In this context, the approximate design parameters of the bus service and the total system cost are developed analytically. The local on-demand mode, bike-sharing service, as an option of bus feeders, is proved to be efficient under a realistic setting. Extensive numerical examples provide evidence verifying the preceding analyses and indicating the behavior of travelers and agencies. Further sensitivity tests show that the subway is favorable for intensive demands and autonomous vehicles may promote the ride-hailing industry. For completeness, an immediate application of the proposed framework in generalized cases validates the model reliability.

AB Cyber-physical systems (CPS) and Internet-of-Things (IoT) devices are increasingly being deployed across multiple functionalities, ranging from healthcare devices and wearables to critical infrastructures, e.g., nuclear power plants, autonomous vehicles, smart cities, and smart homes. These devices are inherently not secure across their comprehensive software, hardware, and network stacks, thus presenting a large attack surface that can be exploited by hackers. In this article, we present an innovative technique for detecting unknown system vulnerabilities, managing these vulnerabilities, and improving incident response when such vulnerabilities are exploited. The novelty of this approach lies in extracting intelligence from known real-world CPS/IoT attacks, representing them in the form of regular expressions, and employing machine learning (ML) techniques on this ensemble of regular expressions to generate new attack vectors and security vulnerabilities. Our results show that 10 new attack vectors and 122 new vulnerability exploits can be successfully generated that have the potential to exploit a CPS or an IoT ecosystem. The ML methodology achieves an accuracy of 97.4 percent and enables us to predict these attacks efficiently with an 87.2 percent reduction in the search space. We demonstrate the application of our method to the hacking of the in-vehicle network of a connected car. To defend against the known attacks and possible novel exploits, we discuss a defense-in-depth mechanism for various classes of attacks and the classification of data targeted by such attacks. This defense mechanism optimizes the cost of security measures based on the sensitivity of the protected resource, thus incentivizing its adoption in real-world CPS/IoT by cybersecurity practitioners.

AB Sandbank morphology is a longshore corridor with fast morphological changes. To analyze its changes, unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) is the preferred effective and flexible data collection platform, which can collect very high resolution images. UAV campaigns along corridor areas require well-distributed ground control points (GCP) and accurate geotagged image positions to avoid misalignment errors of generated digital surface models (DSMs). However, a sandy terrain can make the measurement of GCPs difficult or even impossible. Furthermore, UAVs are often equipped with consumer-grade devices (onboard GNSS and nonmetric cameras), which, therefore, cannot provide accurate image positions and lead to geometric distortions of the image network due to inappropriate lens distortion corrections. This article proposes a strategy to calibrate the used camera and co-register multitemporal images without the need for accurate geotagged information on the whole datasets and well-distributed GCPs. The proposed strategy includes two improvements. First, we performed semi-on-the-job self-calibration (semi-OTJSC) using UAV images with favor orientations and flight altitudes to precalibrate interior orientation parameters (IOPs) and additional lens distortion parameters. This was then followed by another OTJSC of IOPs involving images with accurate geotagged positions. Second, a "transferred aerial-triangulation (Trans-AT)" strategy is proposed to co-register two consecutive UAV datasets through AT procedure similar to GNSS-supported AT within a strip image block. The experimental results revealed that the proposed method provides the best-fit camera parameters and generates high-accuracy co-registered DSMs. This strategy contributes significantly to multitemporal camera calibration and co-registration procedures for determining morphological changes in corridor mapping.

AB Automobiles for our roadways are increasingly using advanced driver assistance systems. The adoption of such new technologies requires us to develop novel perception systems not only for accurately understanding the situational context of these vehicles, but also to infer the driver's awareness in differentiating between safe and critical situations. This manuscript focuses on the specific problem of inferring driver awareness in the context of attention analysis and hazardous incident activity. Even after the development of wearable and compact multi-modal bio-sensing systems in recent years, their application in driver awareness context has been scarcely explored. The capability of simultaneously recording different kinds of bio-sensing data in addition to traditionally employed computer vision systems provides exciting opportunities to explore the limitations of these sensor modalities. In this work, we explore the applications of three different bio-sensing modalities namely electroencephalogram (EEG), photoplethysmogram (PPG) and galvanic skin response (GSR) along with a camera-based vision system in driver awareness context. We assess the information from these sensors independently and together using both signal processing- and deep learning-based tools. We show that our methods outperform previously reported studies to classify driver attention and detecting hazardous/non-hazardous situations for short time scales of two seconds. We use EEG and vision data for high resolution temporal classification (two seconds) while additionally also employing PPG and GSR over longer time periods. We evaluate our methods by collecting user data on twelve subjects for two real-world driving datasets among which one is publicly available (KITTI dataset) while the other was collected by us (LISA dataset) with the vehicle being driven in an autonomous mode. This work presents an exhaustive evaluation of multiple sensor modalities on two different datasets for attention monitoring and hazardous events classification.

DE V2Verifier; postquantum cryptography; vehicle-to-vehicle communication;
   digital signature algorithm
AB The development of quantum computing systems poses a great threat to the security of existing public key-based systems. As a result, the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) started a Post-Quantum Cryptography (PQC) standardization project in 2015, and currently active research is being conducted to apply PQC to various cryptographic protocols. Unlike elliptic curve cryptography (ECC)-based schemes, PQC requires a large memory footprint and key/signature size. Therefore, when migrating PQC to a protocol, depending on the PQC and protocol specifications, it can be hard to migrate PQC. In the case of the WAVE protocol, it is difficult to satisfy the accuracy of a specific PQC algorithm because segmentation of the signature occurs during transmission due to the limitation of the maximum packet size. Therefore, in this paper, we present two methodologies that can apply PQC while complying with IEEE 1609.2 standards to the WAVE protocol in the V2V environment. Whereas previous migration studies have focused on designing a hybrid mode of protocols, this paper explores solutions more intuitively at the application layer of protocols. We analyzed two postquantum digital signature algorithms (Crystals-Dilithium and Falcon) and the structure of basic-safety messages (BSMs) of the V2V protocol on the size side. Through this, we propose methods that can perform an independent signature verification process without waiting for all divided signatures in the WAVE protocol. Our methodology overcomes the limitation that schemes with large signature sizes cannot be mounted into the WAVE protocol. We also note that the architecture used as an on-board unit (OBU) in an autonomous driving environment is mainly a microprocessor. We investigated an optimized PQC implementation in the OBU environment and simulated our methodology with the V2Verifier. Finally, we measured the accurate latency through simulation in Jetson Xavier, which is mainly used as an OBU in the V2V communication network.

AB The main objective of this research was to evaluate the navigation performance of multi-information integration based on a low-end inertial measurement unit (IMU) in precision agriculture by utilizing different auxiliary information (i.e., GNSS real-time kinematic (RTK), non-holonomic constraints (NHC) and dual antenna GNSS). A series of experiments with different operation scenes (e.g., open sky in wet and dry soils) were carried out for quantitative analysis. For the position drift error during a 20-s GNSS outage, the dual-antenna GNSS-assisted approach did not provide a reduction, and the NHC reduced the maximum error in the lateral and vertical directions by over 80% in the dry soil test, but only by approximately 30% in the wet soil test. The heading error with continuous GNSS assistance can be less than 0.03 degrees and be reduced by more than 90% with the aid of dual-antenna GNSS. Additionally, the NHC reduced the heading error from 0.54 degrees to 0.21 degrees and from 0.34 degrees to 0.25 degrees in the dry and wet soil tests respectively. The results suggested that the multi-information integration improved the positioning and orientation reliability. Moreover, the lateral positioning accuracy required for the control of agriculture autonomous vehicles was achieved at approximately 3.0 mm with over a 60% accuracy improvement brought by the dual-antenna GNSS assistance. In contrast to the vulnerability of a single system, multi-information integration can provide comprehensive navigation information with higher reliability and lower costs. Hence, multi-information fusion will be a great opportunity for agriculture to meet the high-accuracy and high-reliability requirements of precision agriculture.

AB This work introduces a Medium Access Control (MAC) protocol designed to allow a group of underwater robots that share a wireless communication channel to effectively communicate with each other. The goal of the Underwater Multirobot Cooperative Intervention MAC (UMCI-MAC) protocol presented in this work is to minimize the end to end delay and the jitter. The access to the medium in UMCI-MAC follows a Time Division Multiple Access (TDMA) strategy which is arbitrated by a master, which also has the capability to prioritize the transmission of some nodes over the rest of the network. Two experiments have been carried out with a team of four Autonomous Underwater Vehicles (AUV) in order to compare this protocol with Aloha-CS and S-FAMA MAC protocols used in Underwater Wireless Sensor Networks (UWSN). In the first experiment, the communications and the AUVs have been simulated using UWSim-NET. The objective of this experiment was to evaluate all three protocols in terms of delay, jitter, efficiency, collisions and throughput depending on the size of the data packet and the rate of packet delivery in the application layer for each robot. The results of this experiment proved that UMCI-MAC successfully avoids packet collisions and outperforms the other two protocols in terms of delay, jitter and efficiency. The second experiment consisted of a Hardware In The Loop (HIL) teleoperation of a team of four robots. One of the AUVs was a real BlueROV in a water tank, while the remaining AUVs and the communications were simulated with UWSim-NET. It demonstrates the impact of the MAC protocols in underwater acoustic links. Of the three MAC protocols evaluated in this work, UMCI-MAC was the only one which succeeded in the proposed teleoperation experiment. Thus demonstrating its suitability as a communications protocol in underwater cooperative robotics.

AB The arrival of the connected and/or autonomous cars offers countless opportunities for both the user and service provider. In this paper, we present a novel solution for tolling transaction using ITS-G5 technology. Specifically, it investigates how to secure tolling transactions performed with the cooperative intelligent transportation system (C-ITS) equipment and the tolling server as a trusted party. In this novel solution, we consider ITS components using the ITS-G5 technology with features specified by the European Telecommunication Standardization Institute (ETSI): RoadSide Unit (RSU), On-Board Unit (OBU), and the standardized architecture of the Electronic Fee Collection by the International Organization for Standardization (ISO). To perform the tolling transaction, a point-to-point protocol must be established between the RSU of the infrastructure and the OBU embedded in the vehicle. Therefore, we design an efficient architecture that ensures the security of exchanges is guaranteed by the security back office of the tolling server as a trusted party. From the application to the service and until its usage, some security requirements are verified: mutual authentication between all entities involved in the transaction, confidentiality, integrity, and non-repudiation of all exchanged information. The certificate usage combined with the signature process certifies the mutual authentication between each entity: the OBU with the RSU, the payer with the service provider and the RSU with the tolling server. The encryption of the messages and the verification of the signatures ensure the confidentiality, the integrity and the non-repudiation of all exchanged information. The safety and efficiency of the proposed method are validated through its formal verification using the security protocols verifier tool AVISPA (Automated Validation of Internet Security Protocols and Applications). Furthermore, the proposed architecture requires reasonable resources which will be suitable for vehicle-to-infrastructure (V2I) communications.

The transverse component of Reynolds stress and the vertical flux of heat are obtained from the correlation of vertical and transverse horizontal velocity, and the correlation of vertical velocity and temperature fluctuations, respectively. The data were obtained using a turbulence package, with two shear probes, a fast-response thermistor, and three accelerometers. To obtain the vector horizontal Reynolds stress, a generalized eddy viscosity formulation is invoked. This allows the downstream component of the Reynolds stress to be related to the transverse component by the direction of the finescale vector vertical shear. The Reynolds stress and the vector vertical shear then allow an estimate of the rate of production of turbulent kinetic energy (TKE). Heat flux is obtained by correlating the vertical velocity with temperature fluctuations obtained from the FP-07 thermistor. The buoyancy flux term is estimated from the vertical flux of heat with the assumption of a constant temperature-salinity (T-S) relationship. Turbulent dissipation is obtained directly from the usage of shear probes. A multivariate correction procedure is developed to remove vehicle motion and vibration contamination from the estimates of the TKE terms. A technique is also developed to estimate the statistical uncertainty of using this estimation technique for the TKE budget terms. Within the statistical uncertainty of the estimates herein, the TKE budget on average closes for measurements taken in the weakly stratified waters at the entrance to Long Island Sound. In the strongly stratified waters of Narragansett Bay, the TKE budget closes when the buoyancy Reynolds number exceeds 20, an indicator and threshold for the initiation of turbulence in stratified conditions. A discussion is made regarding the role of the turbulent kinetic energy length scale relative to the length of the AUV in obtaining these estimates, and in the TKE budget closure.

AB Underwater bionic robotics or vehicles using oscillating flexible structures as power sources are attracting considerable attention. In this study, the hydrodynamic effect and fluid-structure coupled vibration of a flexible caudal fin actuated by macro fiber composites(MFC) are investigated. A fluid-structure coupled dynamic equation of the MFC-actuated caudal fin with a variable cross-section is established, and both the internal moment generated by the MFC and the complex-valued hydrodynamic forces are considered. Distributions and evolutions of the flow velocity and pressure in the vicinity of the oscillating caudal fin with different parameters are visualized through comprehensive parametric CFD simulations. Simulation results show that the presence of the gap introduces significant flow reshaping effects to the flow distribution and hydrodynamics. Distributions of the flow velocities and concentrated pressure regions depend highly on the gap width of the forked caudal fin. Then, a revised hydrodynamic function depending on three nondimensional governing parameters is developed, this is, the characteristic oscillating frequency, the width ratio, and the gap-to-width ratio. Formulas for the real and -imaginary parts of the complex-valued hydrodynamic function are developed respectively through the comprehensive CFD framework. Theoretical and experimental results show that the revised hydrodynamic function and developed model are capable of estimating the hydrodynamic effect and underwater dynamic response of the MFC-actuated caudal fin. Compared with the classical hydrodynamic function for the rectangular beam, the expression for the beam overestimates the added mass effect exerted on the caudal fin, and underestimates the hydrodynamic damping effect, thus leading to a smaller estimated resonant frequency and bandwidth, but a higher predicted response peak. These findings are useful for the robotic fish or autonomous underwater vehicles which are propelled by oscillating foils actuated by smart actuators.

AB In recent years, the data from Internet of Things (IoT) devices is growing at a rapid pace, and the data collection issues have attracted more and more attention. Distinct from existing solutions which usually adopted traditional wireless technologies achieving low-bandwidth data connections towards IoT devices, this paper adopts the 60 GHz communication technology which is with increasing maturity, providing high-bandwidth wireless transmission for data-intensive IoT devices, such as high-definition (HD) cameras. However, 60 GHz links are subject to line-of-sight short communication range, therefore, we propose to use unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) to fly over data-intensive IoT devices and achieve short-range high-throughput 60 GHz transmission in this paper. Moreover, for a set of HD cameras deployed in the linear scenario, multiple UAV flights are assigned to collect data by 60 GHz communication. To this end, we investigate the UAV flight scheduling (UFS) problem which aims to minimize the number of UAV flights while satisfying the data requirements of all ground cameras (GCs) with limitations of UAV's energy and data storage. We prove that the UFS problem is NP-hard and design efficient algorithms with constant theoretical approximation ratios. Specifically, we first study a special case of the UFS problem where all the cameras are on the same direction of the UAV ground station, and propose two algorithms NF_SUFS and FF_SUFS, whose approximation ratios are both proved to be 2 by theoretical analysis. Then, we extend the algorithms to a more general case with the cameras on both directions of the ground station along the road, and put forward the FF_UFS algorithm that achieves an approximation ratio of 3. Finally, we conduct experiments to validate the effectiveness and efficiency of our algorithms.

AB Cities in many countries are witnessing an era of transformative innovations in vehicular technologies and mobility-on-demand (MoD) services in the context of global initiatives of smart and connected cities. However, advances in the built environment where vehicles operate have not maintained the same pace. The new MoD especially burdens curb environments in urban cores due to competition for spaces for pick-ups and drop-offs (PUDO). These uncoordinated and diverse uses without data-driven management have led to increased safety and sustainability issues. This research intends to address the increasing curbside uses of PUDO activities due to MoD services and proposes a data-driven agent-based simulation approach to plan designated PUDO zones in limited public curbside spaces. A case study was conducted for five street blocks in urban cores of the City of Gainesville, Florida, United States, based on longitudinal parking transaction and violation records, place visitation data, and geospatial data of parking assets. The results show that temporary PUDO zones should be designated at all investigated blocks during peak hours even when the MoD market penetration rate is low (i.e., 10%), which helps mitigate the occurrences of competing use events, while permanent PUDO zones should be designated for the two busiest blocks when the MoD market penetration rates increase to 30% or 50%. Sensitivity analyses suggest that the designated PUDO zones can mitigate curbside stresses more effectively when regulating MoD users' PUDO dwell time (e.g., within one minute). This research aims to contribute to data-driven public asset managerial decision-making and strategies in smart cities and benefits more accessible and sustainable living environments in urban cores.

ID VEHICLE; DESIGN; AUV; CONSUMPTION
AB Autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) are important and useful tool platforms in exploring and utilizing ocean resource. However, the effect of control surfaces would decrease even invalid complete in this condition, and it is very hard for conventional AUVs to perform detailed missions at a low forward speed. Therefore, solving this problem of AUVs becomes particularly important to increase the application scope of AUVs. In this paper, we present a design scheme for the vectored thruster AUV based on 3RPS parallel manipulator, which is a kind of parallel manipulator and has advantages of compact structure and reliable performance. To study the performance and characteristics of the proposed thrust-vectoring mechanism, a series of works about corresponding kinematic and dynamic analysis have been performed through the theoretical analysis and numerical simulation. In the part of kinematics, the inverse, forward kinematics, and workspace analysis of the thrust-vectoring mechanism is presented, and the numerical simulations are accomplished to prove the feasibility and effectiveness of this design in AUVs. In order to further verify feasibility of the thrust-vectoring mechanism, based on the considerations of various affecting factors, a dynamic model of the designed thrust-vectoring mechanism is established according to theoretical analysis, and the driving forces of the linear actuator are presented through a series of numerical simulations. In addition, a control scheme based on PID algorithm is proposed for the designed vectored thruster with considering various affecting factors and the application environment. Meanwhile, the control scheme is also established and verified in MATLAB Simscape Mutibody. A series of numerical simulations of the thrust-vectoring mechanism prove the feasibility of the vectored thruster. According to equipping the designed vectored thruster, the AUVs can overcome the limit of weakening the control ability at zero or low forward speeds, and this improvement also expands the application of it, which has been scaled greatly.

AB Peatlands are important reserves of terrestrial carbon and biodiversity, and given that many peatlands across the UK and Europe exist in a degraded state, their conservation is a major area of concern and a focus of considerable research. Aerial surveys are valuable tools for habitat mapping and conservation and provide useful insights into their condition. We investigate how SfM photogrammetry-derived topography and habitat classes may be used to construct an estimate of carbon loss from erosion features in a remote blanket bog habitat. An autonomous, unmanned, aerial, fixed-wing remote sensing platform (Quest UAV 300 (TM)) collected imagery over Moor House, in the Upper Teesdale National Nature Reserve, a site with a high degree of peatland erosion. The images were used to generate point clouds into orthomosaics and digital surface models using SfM photogrammetry techniques, georeferenced and subsequently used to classify vegetation and peatland features. A classification of peatbog feature types was developed using a random forest classification model trained on field survey data and applied to UAV-captured products including the orthomosaic, digital surface model and derived surfaces such as topographic index, slope and aspect maps. Using the area classified as eroded peat and the derived digital surface model, we estimated a loss of 438 tonnes of carbon from a single gully. The UAV system was relatively straightforward to deploy in such a remote and unimproved area. SfM photogrammetry, imagery and random forest modelling obtained classification accuracies of between 42% and 100%, and was able to discern between bare peat, saturated bog and sphagnum habitats. This paper shows what can be achieved with low-cost UAVs equipped with consumer grade camera equipment and relatively straightforward ground control, and demonstrates their potential for the carbon and peatland conservation research community.

AB The DoA of radio waves is used for many applications, e.g. the localization of autonomous robots and smart vehicles. Estimating the DoA is possible with a multiport antenna, e.g. an antenna array or a multi-mode antenna (MMA). In practice, DoA estimation performance decisively depends on accurate knowledge of the antenna response, which makes antenna calibration vital. As the antenna surroundings influence its response, it is necessary to measure the entire device with installed antenna to obtain the installed antenna response. Antenna calibration is often done in a dedicated measurement chamber, which can be inconvenient and costly, especially for larger devices. Thus, auto- and in-situ calibration methods aim at making antenna calibration in a measurement chamber redundant. However, existing auto- and in-situ calibration methods are restricted to certain antenna types and certain calibrations. In this paper, we propose a Bayesian in-situ calibration algorithm based on a maximum a posteriori (MAP) estimator, which is suitable for arbitrary multiport antennas. The algorithm uses received signals from a transmitter, noisy external DoA observations, takes multipath propagation into account and does not require synchronization. Furthermore, we take an estimation theoretic perspective and provide an in-depth theoretical discussion of in-situ antenna calibration in unknown propagation conditions based on Bayesian information and the Bayesian Cramer-Rao bound (BCRB). Extensive simulations show that the proposed algorithm operates close to the BCRB and the achieved DoA estimation performance asymptotically approaches the case of a perfectly known antenna response. Finally, we provide an experimental validation, where we calibrate the antenna on a robotic rover and evaluate the DoA estimation performance using measurement data. With the proposed in-situ antenna calibration algorithm, DoA estimation performance is considerably improved compared to using an antenna response obtained by simulation or in a measurement chamber.

AB The increasing population across the globe makes it essential to link smart and sustainable city planning with the logistics of transporting people and goods, which will significantly contribute to how societies will face mobility in the coming years. The concept of smart mobility emerged with the popularity of smart cities and is aligned with the sustainable development goals defined by the United Nations. A reduction in traffic congestion and new route optimizations with reduced ecological footprint are some of the essential factors of smart mobility; however, other aspects must also be taken into account, such as the promotion of active mobility and inclusive mobility, encouraging the use of other types of environmentally friendly fuels and engagement with citizens. The Internet of Things (IoT), Artificial Intelligence (AI), Blockchain and Big Data technology will serve as the main entry points and fundamental pillars to promote the rise of new innovative solutions that will change the current paradigm for cities and their citizens. Mobility-as-a-service, traffic flow optimization, the optimization of logistics and autonomous vehicles are some of the services and applications that will encompass several changes in the coming years with the transition of existing cities into smart cities. This paper provides an extensive review of the current trends and solutions presented in the scope of smart mobility and enabling technologies that support it. An overview of how smart mobility fits into smart cities is provided by characterizing its main attributes and the key benefits of using smart mobility in a smart city ecosystem. Further, this paper highlights other various opportunities and challenges related to smart mobility. Lastly, the major services and applications that are expected to arise in the coming years within smart mobility are explored with the prospective future trends and scope.

AB Aims The current study aimed to explore the expression of transient receptor potential A1 ion channels (TRPA1) in the rat ureter and to assess if TRPA1-active compounds modulate ureter function.
   Methods The expression of TRPA1 in rat ureter tissue was studied by immunofluorescence. The TRPA1 distribution was compared to calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP), alpha-actin (SMA1), anoctamin-1 (ANO1), and c-kit. For in vivo analyses, a catheter was implanted in the right ureter of 50 rats. Ureter peristalsis and pressures were continuously recorded by a data acquisition set-up during intraluminal infusion of saline (baseline), saline plus protamine sulfate (PS; to disrupt the urothelium), saline plus PS with hydrogen sulfide (NaHS) or cinnamaldehyde (CA). Comparisons were made between rats treated systemically with vehicle or a TRPA1-antagonist (HC030031).
   Results TRPA1-immunoreactive nerves co-expressed CGRP and were mainly located in the suburothelial region of the ureter. Immunoreactivity for TRPA1 was also encountered in c-kit-positive but ANO1-negative cells of the ureter suburothelium and wall.
   In vivo, HC030031-treated rats had elevated baseline peristaltic frequency (p < 0.05) and higher intraluminal pressures (p < 0.01). PS increased the frequency of ureter peristalsis versus baseline in vehicle-treated rats (p < 0.001) but not in HC030031-treated rats. CA (p < 0.001) and NaHS (p < 0.001) decreased ureter peristalsis. This was counteracted by HC030031 (p < 0.05 and p < 0.01).
   Conclusions In rats, TRPA1 is expressed on cellular structures considered of importance for peristaltic and mechanoafferent functions of the ureter. Functional data indicate that TRPA1-mediated signals regulate ureter peristalsis. This effect was pronounced after mucosal disruption and suggests a role for TRPA1 in ureter pathologies involving urothelial damage.

AB Next-generation transportation will be integrated, interconnected and highly autonomous. One key challenge in traffic management is ensuring safety while maintaining the required level of service quality. In such future mobility systems, rigorous formalization and validation will thus become critical to ensure that the transportation network operates as intended, traffic properties are reliably maintained, and services resume in a timely manner after potential disruptions. Formal methods have recently gained considerable attention as a modeling and verification paradigm capable of addressing many challenges associated with next-generation transportation systems. In this regard, we propose to use higher-order-logic theorem proving for formally analyzing transportation systems. As a first step towards this direction, we present a logical framework for the formal analysis of macroscopic models of traffic flow. Leveraging upon the high expressiveness of the underlying logic, we formally model the continuous components of macroscopic models while capturing their real behavior. In particular, we present a formalization of some foundation concepts of macroscopic models, namely density, flow rate, mean speed, relative occupancy, and shockwave using the higher-order-logic theorem prover HOL Light. This choice is primarily motivated by the fact that the macroscopic models deal with the traffic flow dynamics and thus play a vital role in planning strategies in allocating resources for implementing optimized and balanced transportation systems. For illustration, we perform the formal input-output and shockwave analysis of a German freeway. The case study demonstrated the practicability of this formal approach due to the high expressiveness of the underlying logic. The proposed research is first step towards formalizing the foundational mathematical theories and core concepts of traffic flow theory. This accomplishment will open new ways to plan and model various components of the transportation systems such as highway links, ramp metering, merging behavior and eventually address the problem of routing vehicles in a network of automated vehicles.

AB Data stream has been the underlying challenge in the age of big data because it calls for real-time data processing with the absence of a retraining process and/or an iterative learning approach. In the realm of the fuzzy system community, data stream is handled by algorithmic development of self-adaptive neuro-fuzzy systems (SANFS) characterized by the single-pass learning mode and the open structure property that enables effective handling of fast and rapidly changing natures of data streams. The underlying bottleneck of SANFSs lies in its design principle, which involves a high number of free parameters (rule premise and rule consequent) to be adapted in the training process. This figure can even double in the case of the type-2 fuzzy system. In this paper, a novel SANFS, namely parsimonious learning machine (PALM), is proposed. PALM features utilization of a new type of fuzzy rule based on the concept of hyperplane clustering, which significantly reduces the number of network parameters because it has no rule premise parameters. PALM is proposed in both type-1 and type-2 fuzzy systems where all of which characterize a fully dynamic rule-based system. That is, it is capable of automatically generating, merging, and tuning the hyperplane-based fuzzy rule in the single-pass manner. Moreover, an extension of PALM, namely recurrent PALM, is proposed and adopts the concept of teacher-forcing mechanism in the deep learning literature. The efficacy of PALM has been evaluated through numerical study with six real-world and synthetic data streams from public database and our own real-world project of autonomous vehicles. The proposed model showcases significant improvements in terms of computational complexity and number of required parameters against several renowned SANFSs, while attaining comparable and often better predictive accuracy.

AB When dealing with unmanned agricultural vehicles (remotely-controlled vehicles, robots), vision systems are a key-factor for implementing field-solutions having direct interactions with crops.
   Among all the possible information given by a vision system, the punctual estimation of the canopy volume is surely an interesting parameter: it is related to the crop vegetative status and, hence, it is fundamental for performing and setting-up properly some important field-operations (e.g., pruning/thinning, spraying). A system able to recognize the canopy volume can provide either the input-signals for implementing a robotic real-time site-specific farming system or relevant information for a proper crop management. However, there are many practical difficulties in the field implementation of such a system: complex canopy shapes, different colours, textures and illumination conditions with projected shadows. Terrestrial/aerial vision systems working on visible-light wavelengths and/or 2D-images of crops, although capable of excellent performances, have a computationally-heavy post-processing; therefore, they are unsuitable for implementing low-cost real-time servo-actuated cropping systems (e.g., robotised sprayers). Instead, a vision system composed by two LiDAR sensors aligned vertically, scanning the same targets, could give a sort of stereoscopic vision, here named "lateral-linear-stereoscopic vision".
   The aim of this study is assessing the opportunity to use such a system on an automatic or autonomous/robotised implement by performing some preliminary tests in a controlled environment. The resulting system is independent of the lighting conditions (it works also in the dark), is highly reliable (no projected shadows) and data processing is very fast. Although further studies are required to overcome the issues that could arise in a future field implementation, this system has all the premises to be successfully embedded in an automatized monitoring system.

DE correlation velocity log; doppler velocity log; navigation; peak finding
AB A correlation velocity log (CVL) is an ultrasonic navigation aid for marine applications, in which velocity is estimated using an acoustic transmitter and a receiver array. CVLs offer advantages over Doppler velocity logs (DVLs) in many autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) applications, since they can achieve high accuracy at low velocities even during hover manoeuvres. DVLs require narrow beam widths, whilst ideal CVL transmitters have wide beam widths. This gives CVLs the potential to use lower frequencies thus permitting operation in deeper water, reducing power requirements for the same depth, or allowing the use of smaller transducers.
   Moving patterns in the wavefronts across a 2D receiver array are detected by calculating, correlation coefficients between bottom reflections from consecutive transmitted pulses, across all combinations of receiver pairings. The position of the peak correlation value, on a surface representing receiver-pairing separations, is proportional to the vessel's displacement between pulses.
   A CVL aimed primarily for AUVs has been developed. Its acoustical and signal processing design has been optimised through sea trials and computer modelling of the sound field. This computer model is also used to predict how the distribution of the correlation coefficients varies with distance from the peak position.
   Current work seeks to increase the resolution of the peak estimate using surface fitting methods, Numerical simulations suggest that peak estimation methods significantly improve system precision when compared with simply identifying the position of the maximum correlation coefficient in the dataset. The peak position may be estimated by fitting a quadratic model to the measured data using least squares or maximum likelihood estimation. Alternatively, radial basis functions and Gaussian processes successfully predict the peak position despite variation between individual correlation datasets.
   This paper summarises the CVL's main acoustical features and signal processing techniques and includes results of sea trials using the device. (C) 2004 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Aim It has been reported previously that brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) regulates blood glucose metabolism in rodent obese diabetic models such as C57BL/KsJ-lepr (db) /lepr (db) (db/db ) mice. BDNF further regulates energy expenditure, possibly through the central and autonomous nervous systems. In this study, we evaluated the effect of BDNF on both lipid and glucose metabolisms to clarify its action mechanism.
   Methods: To control the energy intake, we used a pellet pair-feeding apparatus to synchronize food intake precisely between BDNF-treated and vehicle-treated db/db mice. BDNF (50 mg/kg/week) was subcutaneously injected to male db/db mice twice weekly for 3 weeks, and blood glucose, serum biochemical lipid parameters and tissue weights were measured. Liver triglyceride contents were measured and liver sections were histologically analysed.
   Results: Twice weekly BDNF treatment for 3 weeks significantly lowered blood glucose compared with pellet pair-fed, vehicle-treated db/db mice (294 +/- 109 vs. 529 +/- 91 mg/dL). Serum non-esterified free fatty acid (726 +/- 72 vs. 999 +/- 220 muEq/l), total cholesterol (125 +/- 8 vs. 151 +/- 23 mg/dL) and phospholipid levels (215 +/- 13 vs. 257 +/- 36 mg/dL) of the BDNF-treated db/db mice decreased significantly. Liver weights (1.51 +/- 0.11 vs. 2.05 +/- 0.11 g), liver triglyceride contents (17.5 +/- 1.4 vs. 26.1 +/- 2.1 mg/g) and fatty liver in histological appearance were reduced with BDNF treatment. There were no significant differences in body weights and white adipose tissue weights between the two groups.
   Conclusions: Taken together with the accelerating effect of BDNF on energy metabolism, these findings indicate that BDNF improves glucose and lipid metabolism in obese diabetic animals without enlarging liver or adipose tissues.

AB In recent years, artificial intelligence has led to rapid development and application across various industries. One of the significant developments is the improvement of transportation methods. Accidents involving vehicles frequently result in a high number of fatalities as well as economic damage. Road detection is one of the applications that can be used by self-driving cars. Traffic accidents happen, but artificial intelligence is used in many nations to construct smart cities and apps for self-driving cars. Since public road sign datasets have been used in significant research for road sign identification and analysis, these datasets are particularly significant for training autonomous vehicles. This study records the roads of various cities in Taiwan through road driving. It manually collects traffic signs in Taiwan to create a data set of road signs in Taiwan in daytime environments as well as nighttime environments. Since there is currently no data set of road signs in Taiwan, this study is necessary to create a data set of road signs in Taiwan. The YOLO model is utilized in this work to design road signs in Taiwan for mark detection. The techniques of Contrast Stretching (CS), Histogram Equalization (HE), and Contrast Limited Adaptive Histogram Equalization (CLAHE) are evaluated in a nighttime setting and compared to the original image captured at night. The experimental results show that the best model during the day is YOLO V4 (no flip), the test set mAP is 86.77%, the Precision is 82%, the Recall is 87%, the F1-score is 84%, and the IoU is 63.92%. At night, the CLAHE image method works best in the YOLOv5x model, with a mAP of 86.40%. YOLOv5 can be used in mobile devices or embedded devices, so this study recommends using CLAHE's YOLOv5x as the best model at night and used to improve the effect of road sign detection at night.

AB Monitoring the impacts of pressures, such as climate change, on marine benthic ecosystems is of high conservation priority. Novel imaging technologies, such as autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs), remotely operated vehicles (ROVs), and towed systems, now give researchers the ability to monitor benthic ecosystems over large spatial and temporal scales. The design of monitoring programmes that use such technologies is currently hindered by a lack of information about the typical abundance and spatial distributions of target indicators and the level of sampling required to detect changes. A further complicating factor is that these sampling platforms are often not able to be exactly relocated when conducting repeat surveys. How the spatial properties of benthic organisms influence the estimates of cover, given alternative designs that vary in the geolocation precision of transects and the sampling intensity of images, is explored. A geostatistical modelling approach is used to quantify the spatial distribution of 20 key deep-water invertebrate species at a long-term monitoring site. The parameter estimates from these models are then used to simulate repeat transects with geolocation error and different levels of sampling. Results suggest that species with short effective ranges (i.e. those with strong spatial dependence over relatively short distances) and large spatial variance, which suggests strong spatial dependence effects, will require greater sampling effort to achieve a given standard of precision. Spatial offsets of 2 m, typical of an AUV, are unlikely to have dramatic impacts on the precision of estimates when sufficient images are sampled, but offsets of 10 m that are typical of towed systems may require a prohibitively high sampling effort for some species. These findings have important implications for benthic monitoring programmes, and highlight the importance of considering the interactions between sampling design, the technical limitations of survey equipment, and the spatial properties of indicator species.

AB Penguins display an utmost degree of adaptation to the marine environment as their water locomotion resembles flying, with their flippers demonstrating multimodal functionality. By multimodality of flipper action (two hydrodynamic modes + bipedal gait balance), we mean that flapping performance is dominant in certain periods and, in that case, Strouhal number is important. There are also periods when the steady (non-flapping) mode is dominant, i.e., the flipper acts as a fixed foil; hence both hydrodynamic modes are analysed in this study. Strouhal number from wing-beat frequency and swimming speed is derived across different penguin species, and the effect of flapping amplitude on the Strouhal number is studied. It is established that St during aquatic flights for maximum cases falls within the theoretical range of higher propulsive efficiency (0.2 < Strouhal number < 0.4), which gives us the confidence to consider penguin wings as an efficient flapping foil in the autonomous underwater vehicle. Moreover, the estimated buoyancy force at lower depth explains how penguin returns to the water surface capitalizing on the high buoyancy force while their wings act as a fixed foil and, that way generate beneficial lift. Then, a numerical analysis was performed to estimate the aerodynamic forces generated by the static penguin wing at a Reynolds number of 60,000 in order to understand its feasibility of application for Micro aerial vehicles. It was found that up to 10 degrees angle of attack, the standard NACA0012 profile shows a higher lift-to-drag, whereas at 15 degrees and 20 degrees angle of attack, as the penguin wing one is 122% and 60.62% higher than the NACA0012 aerofoil. Implementation of scaling the geometric features of penguins for wing design applications is also simulated and discussed.

AB Three major problems of wireless sensor networks can be summarized into communication traffic, energy consumption and routing security. In this paper, we analyze performance of an underwater sensor network in dense mode under creation of spherical division-based forbidden regions. Obviously, unnecessary smart node removal from the packet forwarding process of a flooding-based routing policy is theoretically an idea for enhancing the known network parameters. In this research, our purposed approach is to improve energy consumption by using a removal process over physical routing space toward more network reliability and better network lifetime. Clearly, our aim is performance improvement in terms of a network protocol in an underwater wireless sensor networks with a huge number of high-speed mobile nodes. The nodes generally consist of different underwater instruments such as sensors, robots, modems and batteries and are categorized into two groups of autonomous unmanned underwater vehicles and remotely operated vehicles. The proposed approach is a hybrid solution based on vector-based forwarding routing protocol and spherical divisions which is named spherical division-based vector-based forwarding. The proposed protocol can successfully reduce energy consumption and equivalently increase the network lifetime while packet delivery ratio is in a saturation level. In details, our proposed method works on preservation of sensors' energy in which we physically remove some additional paths of routing process (based on a multipath forwarding using a basic routing algorithm). In this regard, we apply a spherical division-based physical restriction on the routing space. However, removing these additional sensor nodes/routers is conditionally done under keeping the suitable traffic performance in terms of PDR because it is essential to say that a new scheme is effective.

AB The topographically complex deep seabed on the Mauritanian slope, from 990 to 1460 m water depth, was imaged with video in an extensive quantitative survey of 17,199 m(2) of seafloor using a Remote Operated Vehicle (ROV). This study investigated the influence of habitat heterogeneity at two scales on the megafaunal assemblages observed by ROV. Changes in megafaunal assemblages on the Mauritanian slope were assessed at a broad scale, within depth zones, and at a finer scale, in response to changes in local geomorphology associated with submarine landslides. Geomorphology was determined by classification of habitat parameters (slope, aspect, bathymetric position, curvature, fractal dimension and ruggedness) derived from an autonomous underwater vehicle-based multibeam bathymetry survey. Habitat parameters were classified by Iterative Self Organizing Clustering into six major geomorphological groups, four of which were assessed in the ROV video survey. A total of 29 megafaunal taxa were observed along the entire survey, with an overall average faunal density of 0.344 ind m(-2). Megafaunal assemblage density, species richness and evenness varied significantly across the depth range of the survey in the most common geomorphological zone (sedimentary plains of low slope and complexity). Characteristic species inhabited the shallow areas (asteroid, ophiuroid, anemone, small macrourid), intermediate areas (Benthothuria funabris, black cerianthid, squat lobster) and deeper areas (the holothurians Enypniastes eximia and Elipidia echinata). Megafaunal density, species richness and evenness were not significantly different between geomorphogical groups within one depth zone (1300-1400 m). However, the steepest zone, on the edge of a major headwall feature, had four unique taxa (Parapagurus pilosimanus, a comatulid crinoid, a gorgonian and its associated ophiuroid).

TI A path following algorithm for mobile robots
SO AUTONOMOUS ROBOTS
LA English
DT Article
DE Robot; Path following; 4WS; RTK-DGPS
AB This paper considers path following control for a robotic platform. The vehicle used for the experiments is a specially designed robotic platform for performing autonomous weed control. The platform is four-wheel steered and four-wheel driven. A diesel engine powers the wheels via a hydraulic transmission. The robot uses a Real Time Kinematic Differential Global Positioning System to determine both position and orientation relative to the path. The deviation of the robot to the desired path is supplied to two high level controllers minimizing the orthogonal distance and orientation to the path. Wheel angle setpoints are determined from inversion of the kinematic model. At low level each wheel angle is controlled by a proportional controller combined with a Smith predictor. Results show the controller performance following different paths shapes including a step, a ramp, and a typical headland path. A refined tuning method calculates controller settings that let the robot drive as much as possible along the same path to its setpoint, but also limit the gains at higher speeds to prevent the closed loop system to become unstable due to the time delay in the system. Mean, minimum and maximum orthogonal distance errors while following a straight path on a paving at a speed of 0.5 m/s are 0.0, -2.4 and 3.0 cm respectively and the standard deviation is 1.2 cm. The control method for four wheel steered vehicles presented in this paper has the unique feature that it enables control of a user definable position relative to the robot frame and can deal with limitations on the wheel angles. The method is very well practical applicable for a manufacturer: all parameters needed are known by the manufacturer or can be determined easily, user settings have an easy interpretation and the only complex part can be supplied as a generic software module.

AB In suburban areas where the demand is not high enough, the fixed-route buses usually operate with infrequent services, which increase the cost of waiting transit services for fixed-route service users. For those low demand regions, flexible-route bus operations with doorstep services, which operate with flexible routes, flexible schedules, and smaller vehicles, can be a feasible alternative. This study formulates the social welfare for flexible-route bus operations under various financial constraints, seeking to jointly optimize the headway, fare, and zone size. Elastic demand functions are constructed as a part of problem formulations. Unlike many previous studies, this study does not presume the shape of the zone, so that the flexible-route bus services can be designed according to the geographical conditions in the regions. Moreover, the amount of subsidy for financially constrained policy is calculated based on the actual demand although many previous studies used the potential demand to calculate the subsidy amount. Numerical analyses are explored to evaluate and compare system-wide welfares for different financial perspectives, i.e., no financial constraint, break-even policy, and subsidized policy. The solution optimality for constrained nonlinear optimization problems is verified using analytical optimization or the Karush-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT) conditions. It is found that the welfare of subsidized transit operations is located between the welfare amounts of unconstrained and break-even cases; this finding of welfare variations over subsidy amounts can be a helpful resource for transportation mobility analysts in determining the appropriate service quality and the corresponding amount of subsidy. Sensitivity analyses are presented to explore the system-wide welfare with respect to critical input parameters, including a comprehensive analysis of the unit cost of bus operations, which offers implications toward Mobility-as-a-Service (MaaS) planning.

AB Progress in spaceflight research has led to the introduction of various manned and unmanned reusable space vehicle concepts, opening up uncharted opportunities for the newborn space transport industry. For future space transport operations to be technically and commercially viable, it is critical that an acceptable level of safety is provided, requiring the development of novel mission planning and decision support tools that utilize advanced Communication, Navigation and Surveillance (CNS) technologies, and allowing a seamless integration of space operations in the current Air Traffic Management (ATM) network. A review of emerging platform operational concepts is conducted, highlighting both the challenges and the opportunities brought in by the integration with conventional atmospheric air transport. Common launch and re-entry planning methodologies are then discussed, where the physical and computational limitations of these approaches are identified and applicability to future commercial space transport operations is assessed. Attention is then turned to the on-orbit phase, where the unique hazards of the space environment are examined, followed by an overview to the necessary elements required for space object de-confliction and collision avoidance modelling. The regulatory framework evolutions required for spacecraft operations are then discussed, with a focus on space debris mitigation strategies and operational risk assessment. Within the atmospheric domain, possible extensions and alternatives to the conventional airspace segregation approaches are identified including promising Air Traffic Flow Management (ATFM) techniques to facilitate the integration of new-entrant platforms. Lastly, recent modelling approaches to meet on-orbit risk criteria are discussed and evolutionary requirements to improve current operational procedures are identified. These insights will inform future research on CNS/ATM and Avionics (CNS + A) systems and associated cyber-physical architectures for Space Traffic Management (STM).

AB Inter-vehicular connectivity to enhance road safety and support highly autonomous driving is increasingly becoming popular. Despite the prevalent works on radio-frequency (RF) based vehicular communication schemes, visible light communication (VLC) is considered to be a promising candidate for vehicular communications due to its low complexity and RF interference-free nature. Deployment of multiple light emitting diodes (LEDs) enables multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) transmission in the context of vehicular VLC. This paper investigates applicability of both point-to-point (direct) vehicular VLC and decode-and-forward relaying based cooperative vehicular VLC including relay terminals between source and destination terminals to enhance road safety based on real world measurements. We consider direct current biased optical orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (DCO-OFDM) based MIMO transmission scheme and evaluate the performances of different MIMO modes including repetition code (RC) and spatial multiplexing (SM), different modulation orders with different transmitter receiver selection mechanisms to support line-of-sight (LoS) and beyond LoS multi-hop vehicular VLC. The results reveal that the selection of the closest transmitters to the receivers provides better performance due to high signal-to-noise-ratio requirements for RC mode whereas SM suffers from channel correlation. Usage of all possible transmitters does not always yield better performance due to the power division at the transmitter side. On the other hand, the performance of RC shows more degradation on higher-order modulations that are required to yield the same throughput with SM. Therefore, considering the higher order modulation requirement for RC based VLC, SM is concluded to be a favorable MIMO scheme for cooperative vehicular VLC. We further demonstrate the benefits of multi-hop transmission over direct transmission with respect to different number of relay vehicles as a consequence of varying inter-vehicular distances between source and destination vehicles.

AB The Palos Verdes Fault (PVF) is one of few active faults in Southern California that crosses the shoreline and can be studied using both terrestrial and subaqueous methodologies. To characterize the near-seafloor fault morphology, tectonic influences on continental slope sedimentary processes and late Pleistocene to present slip rate, a grid of high-resolution multibeam bathymetric data, and chirp subbottom profiles were acquired with an autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) along the main trace of PVF in water depths between 250 and 600m. Radiocarbon dates were obtained from vibracores collected using a remotely operated vehicle (ROV) and ship-based gravity cores. The PVF is expressed as a well-defined seafloor lineation marked by subtle along-strike bends. Right-stepping transtensional bends exert first-order control on sediment flow dynamics and the spatial distribution of Holocene depocenters; deformed strata within a small pull-apart basin record punctuated growth faulting associated with at least three Holocene surface ruptures. An upper (shallower) landslide scarp, a buried sedimentary mound, and a deeper scarp have been right-laterally offset across the PVF by 555, 524, and 398 m, respectively. The ages of the upper scarp and buried mound are approximately 31ka; the age of the deeper scarp is bracketed to 17-24ka. These three piercing points bracket the late Pleistocene to present slip rate to 1.3-2.8mm/yr and provide a best estimate of 1.6-1.9mm/yr. The deformation observed along the PVF is characteristic of strike-slip faulting and accounts for 20-30% of the total right-lateral slip budget accommodated offshore Southern California.

TI INTERNAL CORRECTION OF DEAD-RECKONING ERRORS WITH A DUAL-DRIVE COMPLAINT
   LINKAGE MOBILE ROBOT
SO JOURNAL OF ROBOTIC SYSTEMS
LA English
DT Article
ID GUIDANCE; VEHICLE
AB This paper presents internal position error correction (IPEC)-a new method for accurate and reliable dead-reckoning with mobile robots. The IPEC method has been implemented on our recently developed multi-degree-of-freedom (MDOF) mobile platform, a vehicle in which two differential-drive mobile robots (called ''trucks'') are physically connected through a compliant linkage. In addition to its four wheel encoders, the MDOF platform has one linear and two rotary internal encoders, which allow measurement of the relative distance and bearing between the two trucks. During operation, both trucks perform conventional dead-reckoning with their wheel encoders. But, in addition, the IPEC method uses information from the internal encoders to detect and correct dead-reckoning errors as soon as they occur.
   Our system, called compliant linkage autonomous platform with position error recovery (CLAPPER), requires neither external references (such as navigation beacons, artificial landmarks, known floorplans, or satellite signals), nor inertial navigation aids (such as accelerometers or gyros). Nonetheless, the experimental results included in this article show one to two orders of magnitude better positioning accuracy than systems based on conventional dead-reckoning. The CLAPPER corrects not only systematic errors, such as different wheel diameters, but also non-systematic errors, such as those caused by floor roughness, bumps, or cracks in the floor.
   These features are made possible by exploiting the new growth-rate concept for dead-reckoning errors that is introduced in this article for the first time. The growth-rate concept distinguishes between certain dead-reckoning errors that develop slowly and other dead-reckoning errors that develop quickly. Based on this concept, truck A frequently measures a property with slow-growing error characteristics on reference truck B (thus admitting a small error) to detect a fast-growing error on truck A (thus correcting a large error), and vice versa.

AB This paper proposes a novel three-dimensional trajectory tracking control methodology for a heterogeneous X-rudder autonomous underwater vehicle (XAUV) that can achieve finite-time convergence, complex actuator dynamics handling, and energy-efficient optimized rudder allocation. Under a compound robust control scheme, the trajectory tracking problem is decomposed into three sub-problems: kinematics control, dynamics control, and rudder allocation. For kinematics control, a novel finite-time line-of-sight (FTLOS) guidance law is proposed, which can achieve faster position and orientation tracking when compared with classical LOS guidance, and is rarely studied in the existing finite time control methods. In the dynamics control loop, global finite-time terminal sliding mode control (FTTSMC) laws are provided to solve the heading control, pitching control, and surge velocity tracking control problems, where finite-time convergence is achieved in both the approaching stage and sliding mode holding stage. The multi-source uncertainties with unknown upper bounds in both kinematics and dynamics loops are well treated by finite-time extended disturbance observers (FTEDOs), thus ensuring the system robustness. Moreover, the influence of complex actuator dynamics is fully considered by employing a RBFNN compensator to deal with the propeller saturation and proposing an energy-efficient optimal rudder allocator to tackle the multi-objective and multi-constraint heterogeneous X-rudder angle assignment problem. Finally, simulation verifications are carried out for two different scenarios, where Case 1 focuses on the adaptability of the algorithm to different conditions and Case 2 focuses on the superiority of the algorithm over three other commonly used algorithms. The comparative simulation results show that the proposed controller has good adaptability to different initial and disturbance conditions, and performs better than three other classical controllers, especially in convergence speed, tracking accuracy, stability, and energy consumption.

AB This report describes an automatic control system that allows an assistive robot pushing a wheelchair to climb steps. The robot is equipped with a wheeled mechanism and dual manipulators. The wheelchair is a commercially available model that has been equipped with sensors, circuits, and batteries. The robot and wheelchair are connected when the vehicles climb a step. In that operation, the front wheels of the wheelchair are lifted and placed on the step using the velocity differences between the wheelchair and the robot. Next, when the rear wheels of the wheelchair ascend the step, the robot imitates the upper arm motions of a human pushing against his/her chest that commonly occurs when maneuvering a wheelchair up a step. Similarly, the front wheels of the robot are lifted and placed on the step using the velocity differences between the vehicles and the robot's front wheels. After that, with the assistance of the wheelchair, the other wheels of the robot climb onto the step. In an effort to ensure safety, we also performed a theoretical analysis to determine the most suitable distance for lifting the front wheels of the robot when approaching and climbing a step. Our newly developed cooperative step-climbing system makes it possible to eliminate the complicated operations that were required by previous methods and can also prevent collisions between the wheelchair's front wheels and the step, thus drastically improving the convenience of the operation. The test subject riding the wheelchair was an able-bodied male, and the experiment conducted to evaluate our system was performed on a 120 mm step height that had a friction coefficient of 0.72. This setup was sufficient for demonstrating the overall effectiveness of our system. (c) 2020 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.

AB Artificial muscles powered by a renewable energy source are desired for joint articulation in bio-inspired autonomous systems. In this study, a robotic underwater vehicle, inspired by jellyfish, was designed to be actuated by a chemical fuel source. The fuel-powered muscles presented in this work comprise nano-platinum catalyst-coated multi-wall carbon nanotube (MWCNT) sheets, wrapped on the surface of nickel-titanium (NiTi) shape memory alloy (SMA). As a mixture of oxygen and hydrogen gases makes contact with the platinum, the resulting exothermic reaction activates the nickel-titanium (NiTi)-based SMA. The MWCNT sheets serve as a support for the platinum particles and enhance the heat transfer due to the high thermal conductivity between the composite and the SMA. A hydrogen and oxygen fuel source could potentially provide higher power density than electrical sources. Several vehicle designs were considered and a peripheral SMA configuration under the robotic bell was chosen as the best arrangement. Constitutive equations combined with thermodynamic modeling were developed to understand the influence of system parameters that affect the overall actuation behavior of the fuel-powered SMA. The model is based on the changes in entropy of the hydrogen and oxygen fuel on the composite actuator within a channel. The specific heat capacity is the dominant factor controlling the width of the strain for various pulse widths of fuel delivery. Both theoretical and experimental strains for different diameter (100 and 150 mu m) SMA/MWCNT/Pt fuel-powered muscles with dead weight attached at the end exhibited the highest magnitude under 450 ms of fuel delivery within 1.6 mm diameter conduit size. Fuel-powered bell deformation of 13.5% was found to be comparable to that of electrically powered (29%) and natural jellyfish (42%).

AB Simple Summary The MARCET project (MAC/1.1b/149) aims to monitor the health status of resident cetaceans in Special Areas of Conservation (SACs) of particular interest for whale-watching in Macaronesia. This study, performed in the Canary Islands, Spain, used an autonomous surface vehicle (Waveglider(& REG;& TRADE;)) to detect cetacean species using passive acoustic monitoring (PAM). The automatic detections, via an acoustic acquisition system (Pambuoy), were compared with human detections for the same period. Although automatic detections were lower than human detections, this experiment has allowed the intercomparison of these two techniques, the system's performance, and its improvement by system re-setting. The present work, carried out with a close cooperation between biology, engineering, and oceanography, will integrate with veterinary sciences. The evaluation of ocean ecosystems, cetacean health, and human activities by means of advanced technologies will provide a novel and integrative One Health approach to current and future studies. Within the MARCET European project and community framework, a Waveglider(& REG;& TRADE;) SV2 vehicle was deployed, equipped with a passive acoustic monitoring (PAM) device, in a Special Area of Conservation (SAC) of Gran Canaria (Canary Islands, Spain). The soundscape was continuously recorded from 23 July 2018 until 30 July 2018 and was primarily used for marine mammal sound detection. This study aims to compare these automatically embedded detections from the Waveglider(& REG;& TRADE;) with human expert detections. Furthermore, it provides an assessment of the performance of the automatic detector and discusses the use of this type of technology to monitor wildlife, particularly cetaceans. The MARCET project and this study are only possible due to the multidisciplinary integration of veterinary sciences, ecological, zoological, and biological knowledge and mechanical, communication, and electronics engineering. It represents an excellent example of new technologies, capacities, skills, and cutting-edge knowledge where veterinary science education and training should progressively be involved to contribute to the surveillance and control of ocean health.

AB Our objective is to create a collision avoidance system that will successfully relay emergency messages over VANET using the DSDV protocol. In a collision avoidance system, the Destination-Sequenced Distance-Vector (DSDV) routing protocol is used to deliver a reliable and effective routing solution for information transmission between system nodes. Utilising DSDV, the system is able to proactively maintain routing tables at each node that includes details on the subsequent hop needed to reach each destination as well as a sequence number to guarantee that the most recent information is used. First of all, it is proposed that DSDV would be able to establish communication between different vehicles. When an emergency arises, i.e. an accident occurs in the second scenario, DSDV is unable to transmit the emergency message. After analysing these two instances, it is discovered that broadcast storm phenomena and destination unreachability are to be blamed. To get around this and improve the current DSDV protocol even more, multiple Road Side Units (RSU) and more dependable links with longer link lifetimes are used. The QoS parameters are plotted for both the existing and proposed approaches in an NS2 simulation that is made to simulate the scenario. The DSDV protocol not only demonstrates better packet delivery ratio and minimal packet loss when proposed technique is followed, but it is also able to send successful emergency messages in accident-prone situations to reduce risks. After analysis, it has been found that multiple RSUs deployment and selective hopping over a reasonable link lifetime strengthen DSDVs robustness and considerably reduce the broadcast storm problem. As a result, DSDV may use it to develop a successful and dependable collision avoidance system.

AB Nowadays, there is a growing awareness on the social and economic importance of the ocean. In this context, being able to carry out a diverse range of operations underwater is of paramount importance for many industrial sectors as well as for marine science and to enforce restoration and mitigation actions. Underwater robots allowed us to venture deeper and for longer time into the remote and hostile marine environment. However, traditional design concepts such as propeller driven remotely operated vehicles, autonomous underwater vehicles, or tracked benthic crawlers, present intrinsic limitations, especially when a close interaction with the environment is required. An increasing number of researchers are proposing legged robots as a bioinspired alternative to traditional designs, capable of yielding versatile multi-terrain locomotion, high stability, and low environmental disturbance. In this work, we aim at presenting the new field of underwater legged robotics in an organic way, discussing the prototypes in the state-of-the-art and highlighting technological and scientific challenges for the future. First, we will briefly recap the latest developments in traditional underwater robotics from which several technological solutions can be adapted, and on which the benchmarking of this new field should be set. Second, we will the retrace the evolution of terrestrial legged robotics, pinpointing the main achievements of the field. Third, we will report a complete state of the art on underwater legged robots focusing on the innovations with respect to the interaction with the environment, sensing and actuation, modelling and control, and autonomy and navigation. Finally, we will thoroughly discuss the reviewed literature by comparing traditional and legged underwater robots, highlighting interesting research opportunities, and presenting use case scenarios derived from marine science applications.

AB Given the severe traffic safety issue, tremendous efforts have been devoted to identify the crash contributing factors for developing and implementing safety improvement countermeasures. According to the study findings, driving behaviors have attributed to the majority crash occurrence, among which inadequate driving capability is a key factor. Therefore, a number of studies have been conducted for developing techniques associated with the driving capability assessment and its various improvement. However, the conventional assessment approaches, such as driving license exams and vehicle insurance quotes, have only focused on basic driving skill evaluations or aggregated driving style classifications, which failed to quantify driving capability from the safety perspective with respect to the complex driving scenarios. In this study, a novel longitudinal driving capacity assessment and ranking approach was developed with naturalistic driving data. Two Responsibility-Sensitive Safety (RSS) based driving capability indicators from the perspectives of risk exposure and severity were first proposed. Then, Bayesian Tobit quantile regression (BTQR) models were introduced to explore the relationships between driving capability indicators with trip level characteristics from the aspects of travel features, operational conditions, and roadway characteristics. The modeling results concluded that nighttime driving and higher average speed would lead to higher longitudinal collision risk and its severity. Besides, the BTQR models have provided varying factors significances among different quantile levels, for instance, driving duration is only significant at high quantiles for the driving capability indicators, implying that duration only affects drivers with large longitudinal risk exposures and strong close following tendencies. Furthermore, the case studies provided how to deploy the developed model to obtain the relative longitudinal driving capability rankings. Finally, the model applications from the aspects of commercial fleet safety management and comparing the autonomous vehicles' longitudinal driving behaviors with human drivers have been discussed.

AB With the proliferation of mobile devices characterizing modern cyber-physical systems, service switching and handoff over large coverage areas become key aspects of the Internet of Things (IoT), mainly when remotely controlling and interacting with mission-critical autonomous vehicles that potentially may cover quite large distances such as driverless cars and Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs). These requirements can now be fully satisfied by the widespread Fast handover for Proxy Mobile IPv6 (F-PMIPv6) technology, that can be yet considered as a cornerstone in emerging 5G communications, but, unfortunately, such an approach only supports homogeneous handover, that may result in a nontrivial problem due to the heterogeneity in mobile communications technologies characterizing the available cyber-physical solutions and IoT network access devices. Recently, many researchers developed efficient solutions for the integration of F-PMIPv6 and Media Independent Handover (MIH) to allow fast handover in a highly heterogeneous mobile network. However, these models lack the security features which are necessary to protect IoT devices during handoffs. In this paper, a new security protocol, MIH-based secure cross-layer handover protocol for Fast Proxy Mobile IPv6 networks (MIH-SPFP), is proposed, incorporating the features of Secure Protocol for Fast-PMIPv6 (SPFP) into F-PMIPv6-MIH and reducing the security risks during the handover. The proposed solution also provides low latency by reducing the re-authentication path during the inter-Mobile Access Gateway (MAG) handovers. The security of the proposed protocol has been analyzed by using Burrows-Abadi-Needham (BAN) logic and Automated Validation of Internet Security Protocols and Applications (AVISPA) tool and its performance has been evaluated through numerical simulation by selecting "Marathon Broadcasting" as a case study. Results show that the proposed protocol not only effectively secures the handover process but is also more efficient compared with the standard MIH handover solution.

AB Accelerated development of eco-friendly technologies, such as renewable energy (RE), smart grids, and electric transportation will shape the future of electric power generation and supply. The power consumption characteristics of modern power systems are designed to be more flexible and easily controllable, which will also affect the sizing of power generation system. This paper presents a methodology for the joint capacity optimization of a typical residential standalone microgrid (MG) employing RE sources, i.e., solar photovoltaic (PV), wind turbines (WTs), diesel generators (DGs), and battery energy storage system (BESS). The MG supplies a residential community load comprising of typical residential load plus electric vehicles (EVs) charging load. The realistic mathematical models of PV, WT, diesel generation system, BESS, and EV load are formulated to improve the capacity optimization methodology, which involves various realistic constraints associated with the RE sources, diesel generation system, BESS, and EV load. The labyrinthine optimization problem is formulated and solved innovatively to 1) minimize the cost; 2) reduce greenhouse gases (GHG) emissions; and 3) curtail dump energy. All three objectives have special significance in designing a standalone MG, for example, cost is related to the economics, GHG emissions deal with global warming, and dump energy is related to the stability and economics of the system. The optimization problem is solved for different possible combinations of PV, WT, DG, and BESS to determine the best possible combination to serve the load effectively and economically. In addition, the impact of load shifting on the sizes of distributed generators and BESS in terms of per-unit cost and GHG emissions is analyzed using the concept of controllable loads. This study could be assumed as a powerful roadmap for decision makers, analysts, and policy makers.

AB Due to strong improvements and developments achieved in the last decade, it is clear that applied research using remote sensing technology such as unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) can provide a flexible, efficient, non-destructive, and non-invasive means of acquiring geoscientific data, especially aerial imagery. Simultaneously, there has been an exponential increase in the development of sensors and instruments that can be installed in UAV platforms. By combining the aforementioned factors, unmanned aerial system (UAS) setups composed of UAVs, sensors, and ground control stations, have been increasingly used for remote sensing applications, with growing potential and abilities. This paper's overall goal is to identify advantages and challenges related to the use of UAVs for aerial imagery acquisition in forestry and coastal environments for preservation/prevention contexts. Moreover, the importance of monitoring these environments over time will be demonstrated. To achieve these goals, two case studies using UASs were conducted. The first focuses on phytosanitary problem detection and monitoring of chestnut tree health (Padrela region, Valpacos, Portugal). The acquired high-resolution imagery allowed for the identification of tree canopy cover decline by means of multi-temporal analysis. The second case study enabled the rigorous and non-evasive registry process of topographic changes that occurred in the sandspit of Cabedelo (Douro estuary, Porto, Portugal) in different time periods. The obtained results allow us to conclude that the UAS constitutes a low-cost, rigorous, and fairly autonomous form of remote sensing technology, capable of covering large geographical areas and acquiring high precision data to aid decision support systems in forestry preservation and coastal monitoring applications. Its swift evolution makes it a potential big player in remote sensing technologies today and in the near future.

AB Recently, the emergence of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) has garnered significant attention due to their widespread applications, such as surveillance, mapping, reconnaissance, as well as commercial delivery, and photography. Despite the tremendous applications of UAVs, there are potential risks associated with drones that may impact flight safety. For instance, launching and releasing drones near airfields can pose serious threats to flight safety. Another challenge is the flying altitude. Flying at high altitudes might cause a collision with other aircraft, and flying at low altitudes can also pose a significant threat due to obstacles in the environment. Various regulations, such as airspace restrictions, flight altitude limits, and safety requirements, can limit the number of UAVs operating in a particular area. This, in turn, makes it challenging to specify the number of UAVs that can operate safely. To address these challenges, we propose an optimization strategy to maximize the number of UAVs that can operate while adhering to regulatory constraints. The problem is formulated and solved using an improved version of a population-based meta-heuristic, IPSO. In the proposed approach, we consider two distinct objective functions. The first one is the local objective function, which aims to minimize the energy consumption of the generated path by IPSO. This objective function is crucial in ensuring that the generated path is energy-efficient. The second objective function is the global objective function of the proposed approach, and aims to maximize the number of UAVs that can operate in a specific area. The proposed approach studies the impact of regulations such as obstacles and flying altitude on a region capacity. The results show that the proposed approach successfully increases the the region capacity, i.e., number of UAVs, to the maximum possible while ensuring safety and regulatory constraints.

AB To explore the airspace structure and safety performance of unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) system based on spatial digital twins (DTs), the study introduces DTs technology, and combines convolutional neural network (CNN) algorithm with UAV autonomous network. The DTs system of UAV is constructed by using wireless communication technology, and its security performance is simulated. The results show that in the analysis of the system packet loss rate, it is found that with the increase of the acquisition points, the amount of transmitted data only increases slightly, but the packet loss rate does not change significantly. In the analysis of the network performance of the unmanned aircraft system, it is found that the node energy-based weighted clustering algorithm (EWCA) can be used to increase the life of the overall network and enhance its availability by rationally controlling the number of nodes and the number of switching between clusters. As the number of nodes increases, the minimum survival time of each clustering algorithm decreases linearly. When the number of nodes is less than 600, the growth rate of cluster head is higher; When the number of nodes is more than 600, the curve growth is relatively smooth. In the analysis of the probability of network safety interruption, it is found that using the model constructed, when the energy acquisition coefficient is close to 0.5, the energy conversion efficiency is higher, the signal-to-noise ratio is larger. Also, when the number of intermediate nodes is increased to 10, the UAV has the best network safety performance. Therefore, through the research, it is found that the UAV DTs system constructed can significantly improve the safety performance of the UAV during its airspace flight. It can provide experimental references for the widespread application of the UAV in the later period.

AB Two traffic steams merging at a mainline-ramp intersection often leads to recurrent traffic accidents, delays, oscillations and pollution. Existing literature shows that we still lack efficient methods to address this issue considering stream-wide traffic optimality, due to the model complexity and computation challenge. To make up these gaps, this study developed an eventtriggered rolling horizon based systematical trajectory planning (RSTP), which expects to safely and smoothly merge two platoons (pure or mixed CAV) in a well-designed trajectory control zone at a mainline-ramp intersection. Specifically, the trajectory control zones on both mainline and ramp are divided into pre-merging, virtual-merging and post-merging subzones. The RSTP is only activated and then generates an optimal trajectory plan for the CAV platoons in the two pre-merging subzones by a mixed integer non-linear program (MINLP), when a new CAV approaches to the virtual merging subzone either on the mainline or ramp. The RSTP combined with a real-time correction mechanism enables the two platoons to smoothly merge at the end of the virtual merging subzone against certain level of disturbance, aiming to maximize stream-wide traffic performance. Using the unique features of the problem, a heuristic algorithm (MIA) is developed to efficiently solve the MINLPs. The numerical experiments built upon the NGSIM data show that the RSTP achieves expected performance under both pure CAV and CAV-HDV mixed traffic flow. The MIA can solve the MINLPs more quickly with a competitive solution quality than the existing solvers do in GAMS. The RSTP performs better under a traffic flow with higher CAV penetration. The real time re-planning mechanism works effectively to correct mild trajectory deviation occurring to a few CAVs.

AB The flying ad hoc network (FANET) is an emerging network focused on unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) that has attracted the attention of researchers around the world. Due to the cooperation between UAVs in this network, data transfer between these UAVs is very essential. Routing protocols must determine how to make routing paths for each UAV with others in a wireless ad hoc network to facilitate the data transmission between UAVs. Nowadays, reinforcement learning (RL), especially Q-learning, is an effective response for solving existing challenges in the routing approaches and adding features such as autonomous, self-adaptive, and self -learning to these approaches. In this paper, Q-learning is used to enhance and increase network performance, and a Q-learning-based routing method using an intelligent filtering algorithm called QRF is presented for FANETs. The main innovation in this paper is that QRF manages the size of the state space using the proposed filtering algorithm. This will increase the convergence rate of the Q-learning-based routing algorithm. On the other hand, QRF regulates the learning parameters related to Q-learning so that this scheme is better adapted to the FANET environment. In the last step, the network simulator version 2 (NS2) is employed to execute the simulation process related to QRF. In this process, five evaluation criteria, namely energy consumption, packet delivery rate, overhead, end-to-end delay, and network longevity are evaluated, and the results obtained from QRF are compared with those of QFAN, QTAR, and QGeo. The simulation results in this paper show that QRF makes a balanced energy distribution between UAVs and thus extends the network longevity. Moreover, the intelligent filtering algorithm designed in QRF has reduced delay in the routing process but is associated with communication overhead.

TI Multi-Scale Measures of Rugosity, Slope and Aspect from Benthic Stereo
   Image Reconstructions
SO PLOS ONE
LA English
DT Article
ID BISCAYNE NATIONAL-PARK; REEF; COMPLEXITY; TOPOGRAPHY
AB This paper demonstrates how multi-scale measures of rugosity, slope and aspect can be derived from fine-scale bathymetric reconstructions created from geo-referenced stereo imagery. We generate three-dimensional reconstructions over large spatial scales using data collected by Autonomous Underwater Vehicles (AUVs), Remotely Operated Vehicles (ROVs), manned submersibles and diver-held imaging systems. We propose a new method for calculating rugosity in a Delaunay triangulated surface mesh by projecting areas onto the plane of best fit using Principal Component Analysis (PCA). Slope and aspect can be calculated with very little extra effort, and fitting a plane serves to decouple rugosity from slope. We compare the results of the virtual terrain complexity calculations with experimental results using conventional in-situ measurement methods. We show that performing calculations over a digital terrain reconstruction is more flexible, robust and easily repeatable. In addition, the method is non-contact and provides much less environmental impact compared to traditional survey techniques. For diver-based surveys, the time underwater needed to collect rugosity data is significantly reduced and, being a technique based on images, it is possible to use robotic platforms that can operate beyond diver depths. Measurements can be calculated exhaustively at multiple scales for surveys with tens of thousands of images covering thousands of square metres. The technique is demonstrated on data gathered by a diver-rig and an AUV, on small single-transect surveys and on a larger, dense survey that covers over 3,750m(2). Stereo images provide 3D structure as well as visual appearance, which could potentially feed into automated classification techniques. Our multi-scale rugosity, slope and aspect measures have already been adopted in a number of marine science studies. This paper presents a detailed description of the method and thoroughly validates it against traditional in-situ measurements.

AB Unmanned-Aerial-Vehicles (UAVs) represent an active research topic over multiple fields for performing inspection, delivery and surveillance applications among other operations. However, achieving the utmost efficiency requires drones to perform these tasks without the need of human intervention, which demands a robust and accurate localization system for achieving a safe and efficient autonomous navigation. Nevertheless, currently used satellite-based localization systems like GPS are insufficient for high-precision applications, especially in harsh scenarios like indoor and deep urban environments. In these contexts, Local Positioning Systems (LPS) have been widely proposed for satisfying the localization requirements of these vehicles. However, the performance of LPS is highly dependent on the actual localization architecture and the spatial disposition of the deployed sensor distribution. Therefore, before the deployment of an extensive localization network, an analysis regarding localization architecture and sensor distribution should be taken into consideration for the task at hand. Nonetheless, no actual study is proposed either for comparing localization architectures or for attaining a solution for the Node Location Problem (NLP), a problem of NP-Hard complexity. Therefore, in this paper, we propose a comparison among synchronous LPS for determining the most suited system for localizing UAVs over urban scenarios. We employ the Cramer-Rao-Bound (CRB) for evaluating the performance of each localization system, based on the provided error characterization of each synchronous architecture. Furthermore, in order to attain the optimal sensor distribution for each architecture, a Black-Widow-Optimization (BWO) algorithm is devised for the NLP and the application at hand. The results obtained denote the effectiveness of the devised technique and recommend the implementation of Time Difference Of Arrival (TDOA) over Time of Arrival (TOA) systems, attaining up to 47% less localization uncertainty due to the unnecessary synchronization of the target clock with the architecture sensors in the TDOA architecture.

AB Marine object detection has received an increasing amount of attention due to its enormous application potential in the field of marine engineering, Remotely Operated Vehicles, and Autonomous Underwater Vehicles. It has made substantial progress in generic object detection with the prevalent trend of deep learning in the past few years. However, marine object detection in natural scenes remains certainly an unsolved problem. The challenges stem from low visibility, small size, serious occlusion, and dense distribution. In this article, we attempt to address the marine object detection problem by presenting a clever joint attention-guided dual-subnet network that can jointly learn both image enhancement and object detection tasks for end-to-end training. JADSNet attains significant performance gains by comprising two subnetworks: an image enhancement subnet and a marine object detection subnet. Essentially, the marine object detection subnet is an extended feature pyramid network with a dual attention-guided module and a multi-term loss function. It takes RetinaNet as a backbone and is responsible for classifying and locating objects. In the image enhancement subnet, feature extraction layers are shared with the marine object detection subnet and a feature enhancement module is used. A multi-term loss function is introduced to reduce false detection and miss detection caused by the mutual occlusion of marine objects. We build a new Marine Object Detection (MOD) dataset that contains more than 25,000 train-val and 3000 test underwater images. The experimental findings demonstrate that our JADSNet realize notable performance and reach 74.41% mAP on the MOD dataset. We also verify that the JADSNet method can be applied to object detection in foggy weather and achieve 49.54% mAP on the foggy dataset.

AB Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) can serve as means of delivery to enhance the effectiveness and accuracy of logistics distribution in various scenarios, such as emergency items delivery for disaster areas and logistics services for remote areas. This paper focuses on the problem of route planning for UAVs, which is the basis for UAVs to complete distribution tasks. Besides, to enhance the collaboration of UAVs during the delivery mission, this work also studies wireless resource (spectrum, power) allocation problem for multiple UAVs enabled communication networks. Due to the non-convex and combinatorial characteristics, it is challenging to obtain an optimal strategy for joint route planning and resource allocation issues within a finite time. To this end, the paths of UAVs are planned by the simulated annealing (SA) method in the first stage. Based on the preplanned paths, a double deep Q network (DDQN) based resource allocation method is proposed to maximize the average sum capacity of UAV-to-UAV (U2U) links and reduce transmission delay while minimizing the interference to UAV-to-infrastructure (U2I) links. Multi-UAV communication networks are reconnected according to the positions of UAVs changing in each time slot. Then each U2U link acting as an agent learns to improve spectrum and power allocation policy with imperfect knowledge of the environment. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed DDQN-based resource management scheme can achieve higher system communication capacity than a random scheme. Moreover, the successful transmission probability of U2U links obtained by the DDQN-based method is much higher than a Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) based method.

   human&#8211; machine interaction; takeover request (ToR)
AB With the further development of highly automated vehicles, drivers will engage in non-related tasks while being driven. Still, drivers have to take over control when requested by the car. Here, the question arises, how potentially distracted drivers get back into the control-loop quickly and safely when the car requests a takeover. To investigate effective human-machine interactions, a mobile, versatile, and cost-efficient setup is needed. Here, we describe a virtual reality toolkit for the Unity 3D game engine containing all the necessary code and assets to enable fast adaptations to various human-machine interaction experiments, including closely monitoring the subject. The presented project contains all the needed functionalities for realistic traffic behavior, cars, pedestrians, and a large, open-source, scriptable, and modular VR environment. It covers roughly 25 km(2), a package of 125 animated pedestrians, and numerous vehicles, including motorbikes, trucks, and cars. It also contains all the needed nature assets to make it both highly dynamic and realistic. The presented repository contains a C++ library made for LoopAR that enables force feedback for gaming steering wheels as a fully supported component. It also includes all necessary scripts for eye-tracking in the used devices. All the main functions are integrated into the graphical user interface of the Unity(R) editor or are available as prefab variants to ease the use of the embedded functionalities. This project's primary purpose is to serve as an open-access, cost-efficient toolkit that enables interested researchers to conduct realistic virtual reality research studies without costly and immobile simulators. To ensure the accessibility and usability of the mentioned toolkit, we performed a user experience report, also included in this paper.

TI Dynamic Sliding-Mode Control Scheme for Hypersonic Vehicles Considering
   Nonminimum Phase Characteristics and Performance Recovery
SO IEEE ACCESS

   recoverable; dynamic integral sliding-mode
ID FAULT-TOLERANT CONTROL
AB This paper presents a performance recoverable control scheme for air-breathing hypersonic vehicles (HSVs) with nonminimum phase characteristics. As elevator and throttle are the only two control inputs available for longitudinal trajectory tracking of HSVs, there are two representative problems emerged. One is the nonminimum phase behavior in pitch dynamics of HSVs due to elevator-to-lift coupling, which prevents the application of standard inversion-based control techniques. The other is the engine performance recovery control with the disabled propulsion system, when flight states of HSVs exceed the safe working boundary, causing engine flameout. In view of the above, a comprehensive control scheme is proposed to realize performance recoverable and high-precision trajectory tracking of nonminimum phase HSVs. First, a dynamic integral sliding-mode (DISM) control method based on the Byrnes-Isidori (B-I) normalized form is proposed, achieving asymptotic tracking of velocity and flight path angle (FPA) while stabilizing internal dynamics. The control method transforms the FPA tracking problem into a stabilization problem of an augmented system consisting of internal dynamics and dynamic compensator, making closed-loop pole adjustable, and thus improves the tracking performance. Second, on this basis, a performance recoverable control scheme is proposed to achieve the automatic performance recovery of HSVs when the engine flameout occurs due to the stall of the HSVs. It achieves temporary acceleration by adjusting the trajectory, thus obtaining the conditions for engine restart. The simulations of the nominal condition and engine flameout condition are presented, respectively, to verify the proposed control scheme. From the simulation results, the proposed control scheme is shown to have superior tracking accuracy with internal dynamics stable, and the robustness is fully verified by the Monte Carlo simulations. Especially, speed autonomous recovery and engine restart are achieved during the engine flameout, which demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed performance recovery control scheme.

AB Background
   There is growing interest in mining polymetallic nodules from the abyssal ClarionClipperton Zone (CCZ) in the tropical Pacific Ocean. Despite having been the focus of environmental studies for decades, the benthic megafauna of the CCZ remain poorly known. To predict and manage the environmental impacts of mining in the CCZ, baseline knowledge of the megafauna is essential. The ABYSSLINE Project has conducted benthic biological baseline surveys in the UK Seabed Resources Ltd polymetallic-nodule exploration contract area (UK-1). Prior to ABYSSLINE research cruises in 2013 and 2015, no biological studies had been done in this area of the eastern CCZ.
   New information
   Using a Remotely Operated Vehicle and Autonomous Underwater Vehicle (as well as several other pieces of equipment), the megafauna within the UK Seabed Resources Ltd exploration contract area (UK-1) and at a site similar to 250 km east of the UK-1 area were surveyed, allowing us to make the first estimates of megafaunal morphospecies richness from the imagery collected. Here, we present an atlas of the abyssal annelid, arthropod, bryozoan, chordate, ctenophore and molluscan megafauna observed and collected during the ABYSSLINE cruises to the UK-1 polymetallic-nodule exploration contract area in the CCZ. There appear to be at least 55 distinct morphospecies (8 Annelida, 12 Arthropoda, 4 Bryozoa, 22 Chordata, 5 Ctenophora, and 4 Mollusca) identified mostly by morphology but also using molecular barcoding for a limited number of animals that were collected. This atlas will aid the synthesis of megafaunal presence/absence data collected by contractors, scientists and other stakeholders undertaking work in the CCZ, ultimately helping to decipher the biogeography of the megafauna in this threatened habitat.

ID VERSATILE
AB The monocular simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) system is one of the most important among all visual or visual-inertial SLAM (VSLAM or VISLAM) systems due to its low cost, easy calibration and identification. Initialization is always crucial to bootstrap the monocular SLAM system. With the rapid growth of some quick-start required SLAM applications, e.g., augmented reality (AR) and unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), devising faster and more accurate initialization has become a central problem. Traditional initialization uses the first two frames to create landmarks and then computes camera poses for the subsequential frames, using a 3D-to-2D perspective-n-points (PnP) mechanism. In this paper, we propose a novel three-frame-only (3FO) initialization approach for the monocular SLAM system, which consists of two steps. In the first step, we use the first two frames to preinitialize poses and landmarks, and in the second step, we use the second and third frames to improve the preinitialization by using the scale consistency of the landmarks generated in the first step to filter out outliers and using inliers to generate more robust landmarks. In both steps, we use the pretrained multilayer perceptron (MLP) combined with homotopy continuation to solve the essential matrices. Finally, we perform a global bundle adjustment (BA) to refine the three camera poses and all the created landmarks. The proposed 3FO initialization approach is evaluated experimentally on the EuRoC benchmark data set with the initialization time and trajectory metrics. The results show that, compared to the traditional ORB-SLAM2 initialization, the 3FO approach reduces the initialization time by 5 times and improves the accuracy by 36.7% on average.

AB Morphological change and activity of submarine mud volcanoes (MVs) are still poorly understood. In this study, we integrated acoustic subbottom profiles, Autonomous Underwater Vehicle (AUV) high-resolution bathymetric and backscatter data, Remotely Operated Vehicle (ROV) seafloor observations, Bottom Water Temperatures (BWT), and compositions of gas samples collected from three research expeditions, to study the morphology and activity of the Helgoland mud volcano (Helgoland MV) in the Sorokin Trough of the Black Sea. Based on the micro bathymetric and backscatter maps, we conducted a geomorphological analysis which differentiates the Helgoland MV into five regions, which are: the active center, the inner crest, the inner moat, the outer crest, and an outer moat. Special seafloor features, such as gas bubble emissions, mud breccia and mud pools, were observed in different regions by ROV observations. They indicate a heterogeneous distribution of materials and activities at the Helgoland MV. Active mud extrusion from the center was inferred from BWT elevations (up to 1.652 degrees C) that showed the same orientation as a major fault (NW-SE) at the location. Methane stable carbon isotopes (-58.1 similar to -63.6 parts per thousand) and molecular compositions of light hydrocarbons (C-1/C2+ = 2836, CH4 = 99.545%, C2H6 = 0.033%, C3H8 = 0.002%, CO2 = 0.417%) suggest a predominance of biogenic hydrocarbons with an admixture of thermogenic gas. Circular faults surrounding the Helgoland MV, as observed in the bathymetric and sub-bottom profiles, are speculated to be formed due to subsidence of the MV caldera and gravity driven sediment movement. A conceptual model is proposed to explain the interrelationship between the seafloor morphology and activity of the Helgoland MV. Combining multidisciplinary data, especially from the application of ROVs and AUVs, broaden the scope in which the activity and morphology of submarine mud volcanoes can be investigated.

AB The internal and external disturbance of the quad tiltrotor unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) stem from its rotor tilting motion and wind disturbance, which affect the control stability of the quad tiltrotor UAV in full flight. This article proposes a control law design method based on the adaptive neural network extended state observer-based finite-time convergent sliding mode control (ANNESO-FTCSMC). The adaptive neural network obtains the unknown total disturbance term that needs to be compensated in the finite-time convergent sliding mode control. An extended state observer is used to estimate the state variables of the controlled plant. The stability of the ANNESO-FTCSMC controller is proved with the Lyapunov stability theory. The unknown total disturbance as the expanded state variable of the state observer has the advantage of high adaptability, and the ANNESO-FTCSMC has a strong ability to compensate for the internal and external disturbances of the system. Compared with traditional sliding mode control, ANNESO-FTCSMC does not contain switching terms, so ANNESO-FTCSMC is chattering-free and converges faster. Based on this method, the flight control system of the quad tiltrotor UAV is designed and verified by hardware-in-loop simulation. The hardware-in-loop simulation results of attitude control in different flight modes and trajectory tracking control in full flight show that the ANNESO-FTCSMC controller is suitable for the flight control of quad tiltrotor UAV. Compared with the PID controller and ADRC controller, ANNESO-FTCSMC controller has more stable flight state of quad tiltrotor UAV under different flight modes and the same total disturbance. The transition process of ANNESO-FTCSMC controller from helicopter mode to airplane mode is also smoother and will not have large fluctuations. Therefore, ANNESO-FTCSMC controller has strong antidisturbance and robustness.

ID VEHICLES; FRAMEWORK
AB Interacting with complex environments is a major challenge for autonomous vehicles (AVs), especially interacting with bicycles, because bicycle trajectories are difficult to predict. Bicycles typically interact with multiple traffic participants simultaneously, resulting in diverse and random trajectories, even sudden-change behavior. Sudden-change behavior of bicycles, which is hazardous for AVs but with sparse data, cannot be well learned by current deep-learning models due to the characteristics of "learning average behavior". Furthermore, the current domain knowledge of explicit trajectory laws integrated into the deep learning modes cannot be used to describe the implicit decision-making of cyclists which is a major factor affecting cyclists' sudden change behavior. Based on these observations, this paper develops a two-layer integrated framework for bicycle trajectory prediction. The trajectory generation layer is used to provide a kinematically feasible set of candidate trajectories, and then the trajectory selection layer is performed to select a reasonable trajectory by analyzing the cyclists' decision-making. In the trajectory generation layer, the kinematic laws are first used to determine a feasible set of endpoints, and then deep learning is utilized to learn and generate each complete trajectory under the known start and endpoints. In the trajectory selection layer, a utility-based model is proposed to analyze the decision-making for cyclists, which is defined as the cyclist's tradeoff between path efficiency and risk in the multiple interactions of the environment. Finally, the candidate with the maximum utility serves as the predicted trajectory. The reasonableness of the proposed model has been verified using the bicycle trajectory data from an intersection in Shanghai, China. Compared with the state-of-the-art models, the integrated model not only exhibits significantly lower errors but also fewer long-tail samples for the prediction error. In addition, it demonstrates a higher validity of predicting cycling decisions during sudden changes in behaviors.

AB 5G/Beyond 5G (B5G) networks provide connectivity to many heterogeneous devices, raising significant security and operational issues and making traditional infrastructure management increasingly complex. In this regard, new frameworks such as Anastacia-H2020 or INSPIRE-5GPlus auto-mate the management of next-generation infrastructures, especially regarding policy-based security, abstraction, flexibility, and extensibility. This paper presents the design, workflow, and implementation of a security solution based on Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs), able to extend 5G/B5G security framework capabilities with UAV features like dynamic service provisioning in specific geographic areas. The proposed solution allows enforcing UAV security policies in proactive and reactive ways to automate UAV dynamic deployments and provisioning security Virtual Network Functions (VNFs) in the onboard Multi-access Edge Computing (MEC) node. A UAV has been ensembled from scratch to validate the proposal, and a raspberry-pi has been onboarded as compute node. The implementation provides a VNF for dynamic UAV management, capable of dynamically loading waypoints into the flight controller to address reactive autonomous flights, and an ML -based VNF capable of detecting image patterns. According to the security policies, the onboard VNFs can be dynamically configured to generate alerts to the framework and apply local reactions depending on the detection made. In our experiments, we measured the time it takes for the solution to be ready after receiving a security policy for detecting patterns in a specific geographical area. The time it takes for the solution to react automatically was also measured. The results show that the proactive flow configuration considering ten waypoints can be enforced in less than 3 s, and a local reactive flow can be enforced in around 1 s. We consider that the results are promising and aligned with other security enabler solutions as part of existing 5G/6G security frameworks.

AB Using unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) for data collecting in remote places is advantageous because of UAVs' low cost and extended range mobility. To facilitate the operation of time-sensitive applications, the acquired data is processed as geographically close to the end user as is practically possible. The suggested paradigm for energy-efficient UAV-assisted Internet of Things data gathering integrates trajectory and resource optimization. The three essential features of the paradigm are data collection, the optimal UAV trajectory, and data scheduling. This work utilizes an innovative data gathering technique and an optimal scheduling paradigm that the authors explicitly devised for intelligent farms. While gathering data, the sensors are arranged in a manner which is entirely random to produce the best clustering that can be generated based on multiple objectives such as distance, latency, energy, trust, and quality of service (QoS). The lion mated with cats optimization (LMCO) is a novel hybrid optimization technique proposed to discover an ideal cluster head. The lion algorithm and the regular cat-mouse-based optimization method are brought together in this model to create the LMCO model. The UAV creates an ideal straight line collision-free path for its trajectory by utilizing the LMCO model and anticipated values for the received signal strength indicator. This enables the UAV to collect data from all clusters in the region that is being investigated. The data is delivered by the UAV to the base station (B5) closest to it. In the second step, the BS will choose the cloud node that is the most easily accessible based on the best possible combination of five factors: power efficiency, response rate, availability, execution time, and QoS. After that, an existing model is contrasted with the proposed model in terms of energy consumption, distance traveled, latency, and response time, among other metrics.

ID WIMAX
AB With the rapid development of internet, new technologies and new domains of activities are increasingly created with an exponential pace. Therefore, network operators and service providers experience an astonishing demand in terms of network services' performance. Vehicular Ad hoc Networks (VANETs), which have evolved to Internet of Vehicles (IoV), are one of these new technologies with high demand in connectivity. This is due to their two critical characteristics (their high mobility and their frequent dynamic topology changes), since they generate scattered networks. Therefore, a high network's performance has become a critical issue for connected and autonomous vehicles deployment. This is due to the fact that VANETs need a high coverage density in order to work efficiently. In order to address this issue, the Heterogeneous Vehicular Networks (HVN) paradigm has appeared. It consists in a hybridization of the vehicular network (IEEE 802.11p) and the cellular networks (3G/LTE/4G). This makes the vertical handover to be one of the key technologies for the IoV deployment. In this paper, we propose a vertical handover mechanism, denoted Proxy MIPv6-based Mobile Internal Vertical Handover (PMIP-MIVH), which uses a logical interface and a Distributed PMIPv6 scheme in order to improve the handover performance and consequently the overall network's performance. Numerical model analysis show that our proposed solution (PMIP-MIVH) performs well in terms of handover connection durations, handover latency and session continuity. Finally, we have evaluated our solution using the well known network simulator NS3. We conducted performance comparison with existing PMIP-based solutions in terms of Packet Delivery Ratio (PDR), End-to-end delay, jitter and throughput metrics. Simulation results also show that our solution outperforms the considered existing solutions and therefore validate the analytical results. (c) 2020 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

ID SIMULTANEOUS LOCALIZATION
AB State of the art approaches to Multi-robot localization and mapping still present multiple issues to be improved, offering a wide range of possibilities for researchers and technology. This paper presents a new algorithm for visual Multi-robot simultaneous localization and mapping, used to join, in a common reference system, several trajectories of different robots that participate simultaneously in a common mission. One of the main problems in centralized configurations, where the leader can receive multiple data from the rest of robots, is the limited communications bandwidth that delays the data transmission and can be overloaded quickly, restricting the reactive actions. This paper presents a new approach to Multi-robot visual graph Simultaneous Localization and Mapping(SLAM) that aims to perform a joined topological map, which evolves in different directions according to the different trajectories of the different robots. The main contributions of this new strategy are centered on: (a) reducing to hashes of small dimensions the visual data to be exchanged among all agents, diminishing, in consequence, the data delivery time, (b) running two different phases of SLAM, intra-and inter-session, with their respective loop-closing tasks, with a trajectory joining action in between, with high flexibility in their combination, (c) simplifying the complete SLAM process, in concept and implementation, and addressing it to correct the trajectory of several robots, initially and continuously estimated by means of a visual odometer, and (d) executing the process online, in order to assure a successful accomplishment of the mission, with the planned trajectories and at the planned points. Primary results included in this paper show a promising performance of the algorithm in visual datasets obtained in different points on the coast of the Balearic Islands, either by divers or by anAutonomous Underwater Vehicle (AUV) equipped with cameras.

TI MC-SDN: Supporting Mixed-Criticality Real-Time Communication Using
   Software-Defined Networking
SO IEEE INTERNET OF THINGS JOURNAL

DE Cyber-physical systems (CPSs); mixed-criticality (MC) scheduling;
   real-time communication; software-defined networking (SDN)
AB Despite recent advances, there still remain many problems to design reliable cyber-physical systems. One of the typical problems is to achieve a seemingly conflicting goal, which is to support timely delivery of real-time flows while improving resource efficiency. Recently, the concept of mixed-criticality (MC) has been widely accepted as useful in addressing the goal for real-time resource management. However, it has not been yet studied well for real-time communication. In this paper, we present the first approach to support MC flow scheduling on switched Ethernet networks leveraging an emerging network architecture, software-defined networking (SDN). Though SDN provides flexible and programmatic ways to control packet forwarding and scheduling, it yet raises several challenges to enable real-time MC flow scheduling on SDN, including: 1) how to handle (i. e., drop or re-prioritize) out-of-mode packets in the middle of the network when the criticality mode changes and 2) how the mode change affects end-to-end transmission delays. Addressing such challenges, we develop MC-SDN that supports real-time MC flow scheduling by extending SDN-enabled switches and OpenFlow protocols. It manages and schedules MC packets in different ways depending on the system criticality mode. To this end, we carefully design the mode change protocol that provides analytic mode change delay bound, and then resolve implementation issues for system architecture. For evaluation, we implement a prototype of MC-SDN on top of Open vSwitch, and integrate it into a real world network testbed as well as a 1/10 autonomous vehicle. Our extensive evaluations with the network testbed and vehicle deployment show that MC-SDN supports MC flow scheduling with minimal delays on forwarding rule updates and it brings a significant improvement in safety in a real-world application scenario.

AB Aim: Coral reef communities occurring in deeper waters have received little research effort compared to their shallow-water counterparts, and even such basic information as their location and extent are currently unknown throughout most of the world. Using the Great Barrier Reef as a case study, habitat suitability modelling is used to predict the distribution of deep-water coral reef communities on the Great Barrier Reef, Australia. We test the effectiveness of a range of geophysical and environmental variables for predicting the location of deep-water coral reef communities on the Great Barrier Reef.
   Location: Great Barrier Reef, Australia.
   Methods: Maximum entropy modelling is used to identify the spatial extent of two broad communities of habitat-forming megabenthos phototrophs and heterotrophs. Models were generated using combinations of geophysical substrate properties derived from multibeam bathymetry and environmental data derived from Bio-ORACLE, combined with georeferenced occurrence records of mesophotic coral communities from autonomous underwater vehicle, remotely operated vehicle and SCUBA surveys. Model results are used to estimate the total amount of mesophotic coral reef habitat on the GBR.
   Results: Our models predict extensive but previously undocumented coral communities occurring both along the continental shelf-edge of the Great Barrier Reef and also on submerged reefs inside the lagoon. Habitat suitability for phototrophs is highest on submerged reefs along the outer-shelf and the deeper flanks of emergent reefs inside the GBR lagoon, while suitability for heterotrophs is highest in the deep waters along the shelf-edge. Models using only geophysical variables consistently outperformed models incorporating environmental data for both phototrophs and heterotrophs.
   Main Conclusion: Extensive submerged coral reef communities that are currently undocumented are likely to occur throughout the Great Barrier Reef. High-quality bathymetry data can be used to identify these reefs, which may play an important role in resilience of the GBR ecosystem to climate change.

AB Swarm-GAP is a heuristic that combines a swarm intelligence strategy with the generalized assignment problem (GAP) method. This approach is especially appropriate when there are agents engaged in a collaborative task, but in general, heuristics have drawbacks to optimize resource allocation. A previous work proposed the usage of three swarm-GAP variants to solve the task allocation problem among agents representing a group of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) aiming at the optimization of their resources usage applied in the context of static environments. However, there is a lack of empirical assessment of these algorithms in dynamic scenarios, i.e., with some attributes changing along the system execution. Such changes represent important features of real-world application scenarios, such as in military operations in which a number of non-expected events may happen, e.g., loss of members of the UAV-team or onboard sensor failure. Therefore, the contributions of this work are the performance evaluation of the original algorithms in dynamic context, and the extension of these algorithms to properly address more realistic dynamic scenarios. Considering changes in some attributes of the environment, a trade-off in terms of the quality in the mission performance and the overhead in the communication among the UAVs is explored. The empirical assessment of the original algorithms and the proposed extensions were performed by conducting independent replications in a scenario where the number of agents (UAVs) changes at runtime and adaptations occur autonomously to maintain the mission execution. The acquired results provide evidence that the proposed solution is capable of dealing with dynamic scenarios, covering the gap left by other works in the literature, and enriching the realism of applications in autonomous intelligent systems.

AB The Swift mission, scheduled for launch in 2004, is a multiwavelength observatory for gamma-ray burst (GRB) astronomy. It is a first-of-its-kind autonomous rapid-slewing satellite for transient astronomy and pioneers the way for future rapid-reaction and multiwavelength missions. It will be far more powerful than any previous GRB mission, observing more than 100 bursts yr(-1) and performing detailed X-ray and UV/optical afterglow observations spanning timescales from 1 minute to several days after the burst. The objectives are to (1) determine the origin of GRBs, (2) classify GRBs and search for new types, (3) study the interaction of the ultrarelativistic outflows of GRBs with their surrounding medium, and (4) use GRBs to study the early universe out to z>10. The mission is being developed by a NASA-led international collaboration. It will carry three instruments: a new-generation wide-field gamma-ray (15-150 keV) detector that will detect bursts, calculate 1'-4' positions, and trigger autonomous spacecraft slews; a narrow-field X-ray telescope that will give 5" positions and perform spectroscopy in the 0.2-10 keV band; and a narrow-field UV/optical telescope that will operate in the 170-600 nm band and provide 0".3 positions and optical finding charts. Redshift determinations will be made for most bursts. In addition to the primary GRB science, the mission will perform a hard X-ray survey to a sensitivity of similar to1 mcrab (similar to2x10(-11) ergs cm(-2) s(-1) in the 15-150 keV band), more than an order of magnitude better than HEAO 1 A-4. A flexible data and operations system will allow rapid follow-up observations of all types of high-energy transients, with rapid data downlink and uplink available through the NASA TDRSS system. Swift transient data will be rapidly distributed to the astronomical community, and all interested observers are encouraged to participate in follow-up measurements. A Guest Investigator program for the mission will provide funding for community involvement. Innovations from the Swift program applicable to the future include (1) a large-area gamma-ray detector using the new CdZnTe detectors, (2) an autonomous rapid-slewing spacecraft, (3) a multiwavelength payload combining optical, X-ray, and gamma-ray instruments, (4) an observing program coordinated with other ground-based and space-based observatories, and (5) immediate multiwavelength data flow to the community. The mission is currently funded for 2 yr of operations, and the spacecraft will have a lifetime to orbital decay of similar to8 yr.

AB Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) enabled networks can enhance wireless connectivity and support emerging services. However, this would require system-level understanding to modify and extend the existing terrestrial network infrastructure. In this study, the authors integrated UAVs as user equipment and base stations into an existing long term evolution (LTE)-Advanced heterogeneous network (HetNet) and provide system-level insights of this three-tier LTE-Advanced air-ground HetNet (AG-HetNet). The performance of AG-HetNet was evaluated through brute-force technique and heuristics algorithms in terms of the fifth percentile spectral efficiency (5pSE) and coverage probability. In particular, system-wide 5pSE and coverage probability were compared, when unmanned aerial base stations (UABSs) are deployed on a fixed hexagonal grid and when their locations are optimised using a genetic algorithm (GA) and elitist harmony search algorithm based on the genetic algorithm (eHSGA); while jointly optimising the inter-cell interference coordination (ICIC) and cell range expansion (CRE) network parameters for different ICIC techniques. The simulation results show that the heuristic algorithms (GA and eHSGA) outperform the brute-force technique and achieve better peak values of coverage probability and 5pSE. Simulation results also show that a trade-off exists between peak values and computation time when using heuristic algorithms. Furthermore, the three-tier hierarchical structuring of reduced power subframes further-enhanced ICIC (FeICIC) defined in 3GPP Rel-11 provides considerably better 5pSE and coverage probability than the 3GPP Rel-10 with almost blank subframes eICIC. They also investigated the network performance for different practical deployment heights of UABS and they found low-altitude UABSs to perform sparsely better than medium-altitude UABSs.

AB The proliferation of unmanned aerial system (UAS) technology has made counter unmanned aerial systems (C-UAS) a ubiquitous weapon in UAS conflicts. The advancement of UAS (drones) has elevated them to be highly relied upon assets for military applications and they have become a weapon of choice for nonstate groups with nefarious intent. These groups employ the technology for surveillance, battlespace management, propaganda, and aerial strike attacks, often to considerable effect. Radars are the primary sensor for most C-UAS to combat threat UAS. They provide persistent detection, tracking, and classification at ranges beyond visual line of sight (LOS). Additionally, they are capable of 24/7 operation in all-weather conditions. This article provides insight on future radar advancements for C-UAS. Prior to describing radar advancements, a detailed overview of existing challenges and current solutions is presented. The challenges are expounded upon to provide an understanding of how they impact radar performance. Existing radar solutions are also discussed providing insight into how C-UAS radar challenges are being solved today. This article provides insight into what is on the technological horizon for C-UAS radars.

AB Side-scan sonar (SSS) is attracting increasing attention in ocean exploration for its utility and stability on autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs). Existing SSS image recognition methods mainly employ deep neural networks (DNNs) for various tasks. However, the effectiveness of DNN-based approaches is limited in situations with zero samples. In this letter, a multifeature fusion self-attention network (MFSANet) is proposed to generate SSS images of novel categories, transforming this problem into a conventional supervised learning problem. Specifically, optical-acoustic image pairs are used as inputs to the network to synthesize pseudo-SSS images. First, the shallow and deep features of the input images are extracted by different layers of the encoder. Then, the long-range dependencies of the acoustic images are efficiently modeled with the proposed simplified self-attention module (SSAM). Finally, the acoustic features are appropriately aggregated to each position of the optical features to efficiently generate pseudo-SSS samples for training the classification network. In addition, a novel contrastive loss is proposed to optimize the cross-modal feature space distribution. Experimental results demonstrate that our method can efficiently generate high-quality pseudo-SSS samples, which improves the accuracy of zero-shot SSS image recognition.

AB This paper proposes a methodological framework that incorporates probabilistic facility dis-ruption risks, last-mile customers travel path choices, and the induced traffic congestion near the facilities into the consideration of service facility location planning. The customers can be pedestrians, drones, or any autonomous vehicles that do not have to travel via fixed channels to access a service facility. Analytical models are developed to evaluate the expected performance of a facility location design across an exponential number of facility disruption scenarios. In each of these scenarios, customers travel to a functioning facility through a continuous space, and their destination and path choices under traffic equilibrium are described by a class of partial differential equation (PDE). A closed-form solution to the PDE is derived in an explicit matrix form, and this paper shows how the traffic equilibrium patterns across all facility disruption scenarios can be evaluated in a polynomial time. These new analytical results are then incorporated into continuous and discrete optimization frameworks for facility location design. Numerical experiments are conducted to test the computational performance of the proposed modeling framework.

AB Trip destination prediction is an area of increasing importance in many applications such as trip planning, autonomous driving and electric vehicles. Even though this problem could be naturally addressed in an online learning paradigm where data is arriving in a sequential fashion, the majority of research has rather considered the offline setting. In this paper, we present a unified framework for trip destination prediction in an online setting, which is suitable for both online training and online prediction. For this purpose, we develop two clustering algorithms and integrate them within two online prediction models for this problem. We investigate the different configurations of clustering algorithms and prediction models on a real-world dataset. We demonstrate that both the clustering and the entire framework yield consistent results compared to the offline setting. Finally, we propose a novel regret metric for evaluating the entire online framework in comparison to its offline counterpart. This metric makes it possible to relate the source of erroneous predictions to either the clustering or the prediction model. Using this metric, we show that the proposed methods converge to a probability distribution resembling the true underlying distribution with a lower regret than all of the baselines.

AB During task execution, the autonomous robots would likely pass through many narrow corridors along with mobile obstacles in dynamically complex environments. In this case, the off-line path planning algorithm is rather difficult to be directly implemented to acquire the available path in real-time. Hence, this article proposes a probabilistic roadmap algorithm based on the obstacle potential field sampling strategy to tackle the online path planning, called Obstacle Potential field-Probabilistic Roadmap Method (OP-PRM). The obstacle potential field is introduced to determine the obstacle area so as to construct the potential linked roadmap. Then the specific range around the obstacle boundary is justified as the target sampling area. Based on this obstacle localization, the effectiveness of the sampling points falling into the narrow corridors can be increased greatly for feasible roadmap construction. Furthermore, an incremental heuristic D* Lite algorithm is applied to search the shortest paths between the starting point and the target point on the roadmap. Simulation experiments demonstrate that the OP-PRM path planning algorithm can enable robots to search the optimal path fast from the starting point to the destination and effectively cross narrow corridors in complex dynamic environments.

AB Offshore pipelines and structures require regular marine growth removal and inspection to ensure structural integrity. These operations are typically carried out by Remotely Operated Vehicles (ROVs) and demand reliable and accurate feedback signals for operating the ROVs efficiently under harsh offshore conditions. This study investigates and quantifies how sensor delays impact the expected control performance without the need for defining the control parameters. Input-output (IO) controllability analysis of the open-loop system is applied to find the lower bound of the H-infinity peaks of the unspecified optimal closed-loop systems. The performance analyses have shown that near-structure operations, such as pipeline inspection or cleaning, in which small error tolerances are required, have a small threshold for the time delays. The IO controllability analysis indicates that off-structure navigation allow substantial larger time delays. Especially heading is vulnerable to time delay; however, fast-responding sensors usually measure this motion. Lastly, a sensor comparison is presented where available sensors are evaluated for each ROV motion's respective sensor-induced time delays. It is concluded that even though off-structure navigation have larger time delay tolerance the corresponding sensors also introduce substantially larger time delays.

TI An End-to-End Lane Detection Model with Attention and Residual Block
SO COMPUTATIONAL INTELLIGENCE AND NEUROSCIENCE
LA English
DT Article
ID VEHICLES
AB Lane detection, as one of the most important core functions in the autonomous driving environment, is still an open problem. In particular, pursuing high accuracy in complex scenes, such as no line and multiple lane lines, is an urgent issue to be discussed and solved. In this paper, a novel end-to-end lane detection model combining the advantages of attention mechanism and residual block is proposed to address the problem. A residual block alleviates the possible gradient problem. An attention block can help the proposed model centralize on where to focus in the process of learning feature representation, which can make the model itself more sensitive to the feature representation of lane lines through convolutional operations. Additionally, the U-shaped structure with three downsampling operations preserves the image resolution and the original lane line information in the image to the greatest extent. The U-shaped structure can directly output the prediction results to eliminate many complex or unnecessary calculation processes. The experimental results on two public lane detection datasets show that the lane detection performance of the proposed model can achieve high accuracy, and the corresponding weight sizes are only 2.25 M. Finally, to further explain the effectiveness of the proposed model, the unavoidable troubles encountered in the experiment are discussed.

AB A thermal camera can robustly capture thermal radiation images under harsh light conditions such as night scenes, tunnels, and disaster scenarios. However, despite this advantage, neither depth nor ego-motion estimation research for the thermal camera have not been actively explored so far. In this paper, we propose a self-supervised learning method for depth and ego-motion estimation from thermal images. The proposed method exploits multi-spectral consistency that consists of temperature and photometric consistency loss. The temperature consistency loss provides a fundamental self-supervisory signal by reconstructing clipped and colorized thermal images. Additionally, we design a differentiable forward warping module that can transform the coordinate system of the estimated depth map and relative pose from thermal camera to visible camera. Based on the proposed module, the photometric consistency loss can provide complementary self-supervision to networks. Networks trained with the proposed method robustly estimate the depth and pose from monocular thermal video under low-light and even zero-light conditions. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to simultaneously estimate both depth and ego-motion from monocular thermal video in a self-supervised manner.

TI Twilight Zone Observation Network: A Distributed Observation Network for
   Sustained, Real-Time Interrogation of the Ocean's Twilight Zone
SO MARINE TECHNOLOGY SOCIETY JOURNAL
LA English
DT Article
AB The ocean's twilight zone (TZ) is a vast, globe-spanning region of the ocean. Home to myriad fishes and invertebrates, mid-water fishes alone may constitute 10 times more biomass than all current ocean wild-caught fisheries combined. Life in the TZ supports ocean food webs and plays a critical role in carbon capture and sequestration. Yet the ecological roles that mesopelagic animals play in the ocean remain enigmatic. This knowledge gap has stymied efforts to determine the effects that extraction of mesopelagic biomass by industrial fisheries, or alterations due to climate shifts, may have on ecosystem services provided by the open ocean. We propose to develop a scalable, distributed observation network to provide sustained interrogation of the TZ in the northwest Atlantic. The network will leverage a "tool-chest" of emerging and enabling technologies including autonomous, unmanned surface and underwater vehicles and swarms of low-cost "smart" floats. Connectivity among in-water assets will allow rapid assimilation of data streams to inform adaptive sampling efforts. The TZ observation network will demonstrate a bold new step towards the goal of continuously observing vast regions of the deep ocean, significantly improving TZ biomass estimates and understanding of the TZ's role in supporting ocean food webs and sequestering carbon.

AB Practical aerial swarm applications are limited by the need to provide fast, robust feedback. To consider how biological agents incorporate visual feedback in multiagent environments, this study extends a well-developed model of bioinspired visual feedback for individual agent to feedback in multiagent dynamic environments. A multiagent visual model is developed and analyzed for an individual agent operating in a group of other agents. The theoretical model indicates a stable equilibrium trajectory within the neighboring agents. When a minority of agents conducting bioinspired visual feedback are introduced into a planar swarm simulation, results show robustness of agents to perturbations from reference condition. The bioinspired feedback rule is implemented experimentally using ground microbots for two cases identified by a theoretical observability condition. The experimental performance of the single agent in an established swarm is consistent with the theoretical stability and observability predictions. The results indicate insect visuomotor response can help participate in established swarms, and indicate the importance of optic flow input in maintaining group motion.

ID GRADIENT; VISION
AB The perception of the environment is key for autonomous driving applications. To increase the accuracy of perception in different environmental contexts vehicles can rely on both camera and LiDAR sensors that provide complementary information about the same features. Therefore, a sensor fusion method can improve the detection accuracy by combining the information of both sensors. Recently, many sensor fusion methods have been proposed that rely on deep neural networks that typically require a lot of resources to be executed in real-time. Therefore, we propose a resource efficient sensor fusion approach with a new neural network optimization method called knowledge-based pruning. The general principle is to prune the neural network guided by the location of the knowledge within the network that is unveiled with explainable AI methods. More specifically, in this work we propose a pruning method that uses layer-wise relevance propagation (LRP) to localize the network knowledge. The considered sensor fusion method uses off-the-shelve pretrained networks which we optimize for our application using the LRP pruning method. This can be used as a form of transfer learning as a pretrained model is optimized to be applied for a subset of the tasks it was originally trained for. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB In recent years, a rising number of incidents between Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) and planes have been reported at airports and airfields. A design scheme for an airport obstacle-free zone monitoring UAV system based on computer vision is proposed. The system integrates the functions of identification, tracking, and expelling and is mainly used for low-cost control of balloon airborne objects and small aircrafts. First, a quadcopter dynamic model and 2-Degrees of Freedom (2-DOF) Pan/Tilt/Zoom (PTZ) model are analyzed, and an attitude back-stepping controller based on disturbance compensation is designed. Second, a low and slow small-target self-identification and tracking technology is constructed against a complex environment. Based on the You Only Look Once (YOLO) and Kernel Correlation Filter (KCF) algorithms, an autonomous target recognition and high-speed tracking plan with great robustness and high reliability is designed. Third, a PTZ controller and automatic aiming strategy based on Anti-Windup Proportional Integral Derivative (PID) algorithm is designed, and a simplified, automatic-aiming expelling device, the environmentally friendly gel ball blaster, which features high speed and high accuracy, is built. The feasibility and stability of the project can be verified through prototype experiments.

AB Lane keeping is a key task in driving, and it plays an important role in staying safe while driving. However, conventional lane-keeping assistance systems (LKASs) have a limited level of automation, while fully autonomous lane-keeping systems have shortcomings regarding reliability. To address these issues, an advanced LKAS with two switchable assistance modes, namely, the lane departure prevention mode and the lane-keeping co-pilot mode, is proposed in this paper. First, the system structure is constructed. Then, the functions and control strategies for the two assistance modes are defined. Next, the controller algorithms are designed using the learning-based model predictive control (LBMPC) method to compensate for modeling errors. Within the framework of LBMPC, an oracle is built to learn the unmodeled dynamics using an extended Kalman filter. Moreover, optimization problems are formulated to achieve the control objectives regarding driving safety and driver acceptance. Finally, driver-in-the-loop experiments carried out on a driving simulator prove that both assistance modes are effective. Furthermore, the lane-keeping co-pilot mode can help reduce the driving burden in the sense of avoiding frequent steering correction.

ID VISION; SYSTEM
AB The fully autonomous operation of multirotor unmanned air vehicles (UAVs) in many applications requires support of precision landing. Onboard camera and fiducial marker have been widely used for this critical phase due to its low cost and high effectiveness. This paper proposes a six-degrees-of-freedom (DoF) pose estimation solution for UAV landing based on an artificial marker and a micro-electromechanical system (MEMS) inertial measurement unit (IMU). The position and orientation of the landing maker are measured in advance. The absolute position and heading of the UAV are estimated by detecting the marker and extracting corner points with the onboard monocular camera. To achieve continuous and reliable positioning when the marker is occasionally shadowed, IMU data is fused by an extended Kalman filter (EKF). The error terms of the IMU sensor are modeled and estimated. Field experiments show that the positioning accuracy of the proposed system is at centimeter level, and the heading error is less than 0.1 degrees. Comparing to the marker-based approach, the roll and pitch angle errors decreased by 33% and 54% on average. Within five seconds of vision outage, the average drifts of the horizontal and vertical position were 0.41 and 0.09 m, respectively.

AB The first commercial fleets of Robo-Taxis will be on the road soon. Today important efforts are made to anticipate future Robo-Taxi services. Fleet size is one of the key parameters considered in the planning phase of service design and configuration. Based on multi-agent approaches, the fleet size can be explored using dynamic demand response simulations. Time and cost are the most common variables considered in such simulation approaches. However, personal taste variation can affect the demand and consequently the required fleet size. In this paper, we explore the impact of user trust and willingness-to-use on the Robo-Taxi fleet size. This research is based upon simulating the transportation system of the Rouen-Normandie metropolitan area in France using MATSim, a multi-agent activity-based simulator. A local survey is made in order to explore the variation of user trust and their willingness-to-use future Robo-Taxis according to the sociodemographic attributes. Integrating survey data in the model shows the significant importance of traveler trust and willingness-to-use varying the Robo-Taxi use and the required fleet size.

AB Alkyl ligands with an amine or thiol headgroup have been chosen to investigate their effectiveness in preventing copper nanowire (Cu NW) oxidation in hydrothermal and hygrothermal environments. Ligand desorption has been found to be the key reason for Cu NWs to oxidize in a wet environment. Alkylamines interact with Cu NWs through weak coordination bonding, which would desorb easily, rendering Cu NWs prone to oxidation. Adding excess alkylamines in the aqueous solution can suppress the Cu NW oxidation, and keep the Cu NWs oxidation-free upon solution processing and long-term storage. In contrast, alkylthiols can strongly bind on Cu NW surfaces through thiolate bonding, which provides better oxidation protection than alkylamines even in hydrothermal and hygrothermal environments. Furthermore, it has been found that for the alkyl chains containing 12 carbons or longer, the alkyl chain length would have little effect on the oxidation-resistant properties of Cu NWs when the ligands are strongly bound to Cu NW surfaces. In addition to oxidation resistance, a shorter alkyl chain length is found to favor current transport between Cu NWs for potential applications in transparent flexible electronics and autonomous vehicles.

TI Aerial Control System for Spectrum Efficiency in UAV-to-Cellular
   Communications
SO IEEE COMMUNICATIONS MAGAZINE

DT Article
ID NETWORKS
AB The next generation of mobile systems, 5G, will be the communication standard that accommodates the proliferation of the Internet of Things (IoT). Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) are envisioned to support many applications in providing 5G connectivity to the 10T, by extending high-speed connectivity from the sky to objects on the ground, or even by carrying onboard some loT devices. However, given their critical nature, the management of UAVs induces high exchange of control messages with the ground control station, resulting in the crowded spectrum used by cellular networks. The authors raise the problem of degrading the network spectrum with UAVs' management messages, and discuss the need for an efficient orchestration system. In this article, they propose a novel scheme, dubbed the aerial control system, which is based on separating the data plane from the control plane of UAVs, and pushing the latter to be performed in the air by UAVs. The solution provides an orchestration logic that takes advantage of the autonomous nature of UAVs to organize UAVs in one or several clusters. UAV-to-UAV communication enables spectrum reuse and avoids crowding the network with management messages, while dedicating more 5G spectrum for ensuring more bandwidth to the IoT through UAV-to-infrastructure communication.

AB Shuttle-based compact systems are new automated multideep unit-load storage systems with lifts that can potentially achieve both low operational cost and large volume flexibility. In this paper, we develop novel queuing network models to estimate the performance of both single-tier and multitier shuttle-based compact systems. Each tier is modeled as a multiclass semi-open queuing network, whereas the vertical transfer is modeled using an open queue. For a multitier system, the models corresponding to tiers and vertical transfer are linked together using the first and second moment information of the queue departure processes. The models can handle both specialized and generic shuttles and both continuous and discrete lifts. The accuracy of the models is validated through both simulation and a real case. Errors are acceptable for conceptualizing initial designs. Numerical studies provide new design insights. Results show that the best way to minimize expected throughput time in single-tier systems is to have a depth/width ratio around 1.25. Moreover, specialized shuttles are recommended for multitier systems because the higher cost of generic shuttles is not balanced by savings in reduced throughput time and equipment needs.

ID RECEIVED SIGNAL PARAMETERS; TRANSMITTER MOTION
AB Currently, almost unrestricted access to low-lying areas of airspace creates an opportunity to use unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), especially those capable of vertical take-off and landing (VTOL), in transport services. UAVs become increasingly popular for transporting postal items over small, medium, and large distances. It is forecasted that, in the near future, VTOL UAVs with a high take-offweightwill also deliver goods to very distant and hard-to-reach locations. Therefore, UAVnavigation plays a very important role in the process of carrying out transport services. At present, during the flight phase, drones make use of the integrated global navigation satellite system (GNSS) and the inertial navigation system (INS). However, the inaccuracy of GNSS + INS makes it unsuitable for landing and take-off, necessitating the guidance of a human UAV operator during those phases. Available navigation systems do not provide sufficiently high positioning accuracy for an UAV. For this reason, full automation of the landing approach is not possible. This paper puts forward a proposal to solve this problem. The authors show the structure of an autonomous system and a Doppler-based navigation procedure that allows for automatic landing approaches. An accuracy evaluation of the developed solution for VTOL is made on the basis of simulation studies.

AB Limited on-board energy resources of autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) demand design of an appropriate controller to achieve optimal energy consumption while tracking a commanded path accurately for some envisaged applications. The unstructured oceanic environment calls for a robust control law which is capable of handling parametric uncertainties and environmental disturbances. Though switching surface control has been proven to be an effective strategy for underwater operations, it provides no scope for energy optimization. For an energy critical mission, it is desirable to minimize the net control effort through advanced mathematical modelling, even at the cost of compromising accuracy within a reasonable bound. With this aspect in mind, the present work addresses these two issues (i.e. energy and accuracy) together through design of a novel controller based on sliding mode control in association with Euler-Lagrange based classical optimal control. Mathematical modelling and simulation results are presented to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed controller with real life parameters of an experimentally validated AUV, designed and developed for 150 m depth of operation at sea.

ID DIVISION; ESTERS
AB Self-propelled motion of micrometer-sized substances has drawn much attention as an autonomous transportation system. One candidate vehicle is a chemically driven micrometer-sized oil droplet. However, to the best of our knowledge, there has been no report of a chemical reaction system controlling the three-dimensional motion of oil droplets underwater. In this study, we developed a molecular system that controlled the self-propelled motion of 4-heptyloxybenzaldehyde oil droplets by using novel gemini cationic surfactants containing carbonate linkages (2G12C). We found that, in emulsions containing sodium hydroxide, the motion time of the self-propelled oil droplets was longer in the presence of 2G12C than in the presence of gemini cationic surfactants without carbonate linkages. Moreover, in 2G12C solution, oil droplets at rest underwent unidirectional, self-propelled motion in a gradient field toward higher concentration of sodium hydroxide. Even though they stopped within several seconds, they restarted in the same direction. 2G12C was gradually hydrolyzed under basic conditions to produce a pair of the corresponding monomeric surfactants, which exhibit different interfacial properties from 2G12C. The prolonged and restart motion of the oil droplets were explained by the increase in the heterogeneity of the interfacial tension of the oil droplets.

ID LOCALIZATION
AB Geolocating multiple targets of interest on the ground from an aerial platform is an important activity in many applications, such as visual surveillance. However, due to the limited measurement accuracy of commonly used airborne sensors (including altimeters, accelerometer, gyroscopes, and so on) and the small size, complex motion, and a large number of ground targets in aerial images, most of the current unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)-based ground target geolocation algorithms have difficulty in obtaining accurate geographic location coordinates online, especially at middle and high altitudes. To solve these problems, in this article, a novel online ground multitarget geolocation framework using a UAV platform is proposed, which minimizes the introduction of sensor error sources and uses only monocular aerial image sequences and global positioning system (GPS) data to perform parallel processing of target detection and rapid 3-D sparse geographic map construction and target geographic location estimations, thereby improving the accuracy and speed of ground multitarget online geolocation. In this framework, a detection algorithm based on deep learning is first adopted to improve the accuracy and robustness of small target detection in aerial images by constructing an aerial image dataset. Then, we propose a novel target geolocation algorithm based on 3-D map construction, which combines continuous images and GPS data collected online using a UAV platform to generate a 3-D geographic map and accurately estimates the GPS location of the target center pixel through projection and triangulation of the map points on the image. Finally, we design a data transmission architecture that selects multiple processes to perform image acquisition, target detection, and target geolocation tasks in parallel and utilizes database communication between the processes to achieve accurate online geolocation of ground targets in aerial images, regardless of whether the target is in a static or moving state. To evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed framework, we build an online ground multitarget geolocation system using a quad-rotor UAV and carry out a large number of experiments in simulations and real environments. Qualitative and quantitative experimental results proved that the framework can accurately locate ground targets in various complex environments, such as parks, highways, schools, cities, different flight altitudes (50-2000 m), and different attitude angles, and the average positioning error is approximately 1 m at 2000 m for cities with rich 3-D structures.

AB In challenging tasks such as large-scale resource detection, deep-sea exploration, prolonged cruising, extensive topographical mapping, and operations within intricate current regions, AUV swarm technologies play a pivotal role. A core technical challenge within this realm is the precise determination of relative positions among AUVs within the cluster. Given the complexity of underwater environments, this study introduces an integrated and high-precision underwater cluster positioning method, incorporating advanced image restoration algorithms and enhanced underwater visual markers. Utilizing the Hydro-Optical Image Restoration Model (HOIRM) developed in this research, image clarity in underwater settings is significantly improved, thereby expanding the attenuation coefficient range for marker identification and enhancing it by at least 20%. Compared to other markers, the novel underwater visual marker designed in this research elevates positioning accuracy by 1.5 times under optimal water conditions and twice as much under adverse conditions. By synthesizing the aforementioned techniques, this study has successfully developed a comprehensive underwater visual positioning algorithm, amalgamating image restoration, feature detection, geometric code value analysis, and pose resolution. The efficacy of the method has been validated through real-world underwater swarm experiments, providing crucial navigational and operational assurance for AUV clusters.

ID REGISTRATION
AB LiDAR odometry is a fundamental task for high-precision map construction and real-time and accurate localization in autonomous driving. However, point clouds in urban road scenes acquired by vehicle-borne lasers are of large amounts, "near dense and far sparse" density, and contain different dynamic objects, leading to low efficiency and low accuracy of existing LiDAR odometry methods. To address the above issues, a simulation-based self-supervised line extraction in urban road scene is proposed, as a pre-processing for LiDAR odometry to reduce the amount of input and the interference from dynamic objects. A simulated dataset is first constructed according to the characteristics of point clouds in urban road scenes; and then, an EdgeConv-based network, named LO-LineNet, is used for pre-training; finally, a model transferring strategy is adopted to transfer the pre-trained model from a simulated dataset to real-world scenes without ground-truth labels. Experimental results on the KITTI Odometry Dataset and the Apollo SouthBay Dataset indicate that the proposed method can accurately extract reliable lines in urban road scenes in a self-supervised way, and the use of the extracted reliable lines as input for odometry can significantly improve its accuracy and efficiency in urban road scenes.

AB Estimating the traversability of terrain should be reliable and accurate in diverse conditions for autonomous driving in off-road environments. However, learning-based approaches often yield unreliable results when confronted with unfamiliar contexts, and it is challenging to obtain manual annotations frequently for new circumstances. In this letter, we introduce a method for learning traversability from images that utilizes only self-supervision and no manual labels, enabling it to easily learn traversability in new circumstances. To this end, we first generate self-supervised traversability labels from past driving trajectories by labeling regions traversed by the vehicle as highly traversable. Using the self-supervised labels, we then train a neural network that identifies terrains that are safe to traverse from an image using a one-class classification algorithm. Additionally, we supplement the limitations of self-supervised labels by incorporating methods of self-supervised learning of visual representations. To conduct a comprehensive evaluation, we collect data in a variety of driving environments and perceptual conditions and show that our method produces reliable estimations in various environments. In addition, the experimental results validate that our method outperforms other self-supervised traversability estimation methods and achieves comparable performances with supervised learning methods trained on manually labeled data.

AB This paper is concentrated on three-dimensional (3D) trajectory tracking control for over-actuated autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) in attitude space. In order to design the guidance, navigation, and control system for this problem, a nonlinear compound line-of-sight (NCLOS) guidance law is introduced to stabilize the position errors. Considering the nonlinear relationship between hydrodynamic angle and orientation angle, the kinematic controller is designed based on the NCLOS guidance law to converge the attitude errors, especially in roll degree of freedom. Due to the perturbation of parameters and uncertain interferences, a dynamic controller is proposed based on fast terminal sliding mode control and adaptive anti-interference law to ensure the finite -time stability for the filtering errors of virtual velocity by backstepping technology. Also, the global stability of the whole system is verified. After that, a damped BFGS sequential quadratic programming algorithm is introduced to solve the multi-objectives and multi-constraints optimization problem for the rudder control allocation in attitude space. Finally, the numerical simulations are conducted with validity and adaptability performances in 3D trajectory tracking control for over-actuated AUVs.

ID ADAPTIVE-CONTROL; NEURAL-NETWORK; SYSTEM
AB Autonomous robots require control tuning to optimize their performance, such as optimal trajectory tracking. Controllers, such as the Proportional-Integral-Derivative (PID) controller, which are commonly used in robots, are usually tuned by a cumbersome manual process or offline data-driven methods. Both approaches must be repeated if the system configuration changes or becomes exposed to new environmental conditions. In this work, we propose a novel algorithm that can perform online optimal control tuning (OCTUNE) of a discrete linear time-invariant (LTI) controller in a classical feedback system without the knowledge of the plant dynamics. The OCTUNE algorithm uses the backpropagation optimization technique to optimize the controller parameters. Furthermore, convergence guarantees are derived using the Lyapunov stability theory to ensure stable iterative tuning using real-time data. We validate the algorithm in realistic simulations of a quadcopter model with PID controllers using the known Gazebo simulator and a real quadcopter platform. Simulations and actual experiment results show that OCTUNE can be effectively used to automatically tune the UAV PID controllers in real-time, with guaranteed convergence. Finally, we provide an open-source implementation of the OCTUNE algorithm, which can be adapted for different applications.

AB This study presents a new adaptive fuzzy sliding-mode control method for the leader-follower consensus problem of uncertain non-square nonlinear systems in the presence of input saturation and dead-zone. In the proposed approach, to transform the dynamic equations of every agent into fully-actuated multi-input/multi-output nonlinear systems, some auxiliary inputs are defined based on the weighted pseudo-inverse theory. Furthermore, the effects of input nonlinearities and the introduced terms due to the system transformation are considered as part of the unknown nonlinear dynamic model. The auxiliary input vector of each agent consists of a fuzzy term employed to approximate the unknown nonlinear model and a robust term to compensate for any possible mismatches. Therefore, by employing the adaptation laws proposed based on a Lyapunov function, the output vectors of the fuzzy systems and the upper bounds of the approximation errors are computed. The closed-loop asymptotic stability is proved using the second Lyapunov theorem and Barbalat's lemma. Furthermore, the effectiveness of the proposed method is verified by the leader-follower consensus control of a group of REMUS autonomous underwater vehicles.

AB Traditional methodologies for precise inspection of bridges (pavement, beams, column cap, column, joints and inside box girder, etc.) with By-bridge equipment, Aerial Work Platform (AWP) or via ropes have several limits that can be overcome by using Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs). The constant development in this field allows us to go beyond the manual control and the use of a single UAV. In the context of inspection rules, this research provides new inputs to the multilevel approach used today and to the methods of structural inspection with drones. Today, UAV-based inspections are limited by manual and/or semi-automatic control with many restrictions on trajectory settings, especially for areas of difficult access with Global Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSS) denied that still require the intervention of a human operator. This work proposes the use of autonomous navigation with a fleet of UAVs for infrastructural inspections. Starting from a digital twin, a solution is provided to problems such as the definition of a set of reference trajectories and the design of a position controller. A workflow to integrate a generic Bridge Management System (BMS) with this type of approach is provided.

AB The aim of the present research work is to design a control law for a quadcopter drone based on the Virtual Attractive-Repulsive Potentials (VARP) theory. VARP theory, originally designed to enable path following by a small wheeled robot, will be tailored to control a quadcopter drone, hence allowing such device to learn flight planning. The proposed strategy combines an instance of VARP method to control a drone's attitude (SO(3)-VARP) and an instance of VARP method to control a drone's spatial location (R-3-VARP). The resulting control strategy will be referred to as double-VARP method, which aims at making a drone follow a predefined path in space. Since the model of the drone as well as the devised control theory are formulated on a Lie group, their simulation on a computing platform is performed through a numerical analysis method specifically designed for these kinds of numerical simulations. A numerical simulation analysis is used to assess the salient features of the proposed regulation theory. In particular, resilience against shock-type disturbances are assessed numerically.

AB Although energy efficiency is quite a cliche ' term, it is a topic that attracts an increasing attention the last decade, especially in the context of cities and as a means to address emerging challenges like sustainability and climate change. Several models have been introduced to conceptualize and calculate the urban energy system, and to demonstrate the variants that calibrate the local energy efficiency. Nevertheless, cutting-edge technologies like blockchain, electrical-and even autonomous-vehicles, smart building systems, Artificial Intelligence (AI) and big data etc. are growing within cities and question the identified urban energy efficiency, since they demand enormous amounts of power. In this regard, policy makers are concerned of the emerging technologies' energy efficiency and their impact on the urban energy system and they attempt to introduce corresponding standards for their development. This article focuses on the impact of AI and big data in city's energy efficiency. More specifically, a literature analysis is performed and returned a taxonomy of existing energy efficiency assessment models under the lens of AI and big data. Moreover, the definition of a unified assessment model for AI and big data energy efficiency is approached.

   replacement; Collision control
AB In the near future, vehicular networks are expected to provide and consume a variety of services for autonomous driving, connected car, and Internet of Things (IoT). For practical service scenarios, it is necessary to consider the characteristics of the dynamic environment and Quality of Services (QoS) in a vehicular network. The goal of this paper is to maximize service delivery ratio while meeting QoS factors. We present three issues to be addressed by a road side unit (RSU) acting as a fog server. The first issue is the scheduling of services with different effective time. The second is the RSU cache replacement strategy considering limited storage space. The third is the QoS-based message collision control for channels that multiple vehicles share. This paper solves these three issues by leveraging Deep Q Network (DQN), one of deep reinforcement learning techniques. To this end, the three problems are defined as Markov Decision Process (MDP) problems and the effectiveness of the proposed method is demonstrated through experiments. Experimental results substantiate that the proposed method based on DQN can find a policy that is adaptive to situations through learning for each defined problem. (C) 2021 Elsevier Inc.

AB Electric wheelchairs make it easier for disabled and elderly people to live, move, interact, and participate in society. Moving a wheelchair in open spaces is relatively easy, but in closed and small spaces, maneuvering is difficult. Solutions to such problems for people with disabilities are applicable to a relatively small group of recipients and are mostly custom-made solutions, whose considerable cost is a significant barrier to accessibility. New technologies can provide an opportunity to improve the quality of life of people with disabilities in this aspect. Using selected elements of complex automation and control systems, cost-effective solutions can be created that facilitate the functioning of people with disabilities. This paper presents an analysis of hazards and problems when maneuvering a wheelchair in narrow passageways, as well as the authors' solution to this problem, and the concept and assumptions of a mechatronic anti-collision system based on 2D LiDAR laser scanners. This solution is composed of a proprietary 2D rotating scanner mechanism that ensures the acquisition of 3D images of the environment around the wheelchair. Preliminary tests of this solution yielded promising results. Further research will include miniaturization of the device.

AB The composite cylindrical shell pressure structure is widely used for autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV). To analyze the critical buckling problem of variable stiffness (VS) composite pressure structure of AUV, a discrete finite element (DFE) method based on the curve fiber path function is developed in this work. A design and optimization method based on the radial basis function surrogate method is proposed to optimize the critical buckling pressure for a VS composite cylindrical shell. Both the DFE and surrogate methods are verified to be valid by comparison with the experimental data from the listed references. The effects of the geometric parameter and fiber angle on the critical buckling pressure are studied for different cylindrical shell cases. The results indicate that the proposed simulation model and optimization method are accurate and efficient for the buckling analysis and optimization of a VS composite cylindrical shell. Optimization result shows that the optimum critical buckling pressure for the VS cylindrical shell is improved and is 21.1% larger than that of the constant stiffness cylindrical shell under the same geometric and boundary condition.

TI Modelling and Simulation of Distributed UAV Swarm Cooperative Planning

SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF AEROSPACE ENGINEERING
LA English
DT Article
AB As an emerging topic, the swarm of autonomous unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) has been attracting great attention. Due to the indeterminacy of sensors, distributed cooperative swarms have been considered to be efficient and robust but challenging to design and test. To facilitate the development of distributed swarms, it has been proposed to utilise a simulation platform for cooperative UAVs using imperfect perception. However, the existing simulation platforms cannot satisfy this demand due to a few reasons. First, they are designed for a specific purpose, and their functionalities are difficult to extend. Second, the existing platforms lack compatibility to be applied to different types of scenarios. Third, the modelling of these platforms is too simplified to simulate flight motion dynamic and noisy communication accurately, which may cause a difference in performance between the simulation and real-world application. To address the mentioned issues, this paper models the problem and proposes a simulation platform for distributed swarm cooperative perception, which addresses software engineering concerns and provides a set of extendable functionalities of a cooperative swarm, including communication, estimation, perception fusion, and path planning. The applicability of the proposed platform is verified by simulations with the real-world application. The simulation results demonstrate that the proposed system is viable.

   This work can be applied to integrate autonomous unmanned aerial vehicles in civil airspace.
   This paper presents a software architecture for Unmanned aerial system Traffic Management (UTM). The work is framed within the U-space ecosystem, which is the European initiative for UTM in the civil airspace. We propose a system that focuses on providing the required services for automated decision-making during real-time threat management and conflict resolution, which is the main gap in current UTM solutions. Nonetheless, our software architecture follows an open-source design that is modular and flexible enough to accommodate additional U-space services in future developments. In its current implementation, our UTM solution is capable of tracking the aerial operations and monitoring the airspace in real time, in order to perform in-flight emergency management and tactical deconfliction. We show experimental results in order to demonstrate the UTM system working in a realistic simulation setup. For that, we performed our tests with the UTM system and the operators of the aerial aircraft located at remote locations with the consequent communication issues, and we showcased that the system was capable of managing in real time the conflicting events in two different use cases.

ID ANGLE
AB The collective and cyclic pitch propeller (CCPP) is a novel concept designed to propel and manoeuvre autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs). Collective pitch control governs the generated thrust, while through cyclic pitch control a manoeuvring force/side-force is generated. Recent work concluded that new solutions are needed to achieve large side-forces without compromising the observed phase shift. In this paper, increasing the blade surface area is rationalised as the most effective pathway to achieve improved CCPP performance. A three-dimensional numerical RANS-based periodic numerical model was used to evaluate three alternative blade designs. Clear performance improvements were realised by the new blade design, manifested in the ability to generate larger side-forces, both absolute and relative based on the actual surface area, at much smaller phase shifts. A performance improvement relation was established, stating that optimal improvement is realised by increasing both the blade's surface area and aspect ratio. At higher aspect ratios, the side-force is produced in a more efficient manner, both from a general force behaviour and a side-force force generation perspective. Finally, an important note was made regarding the future introduction of blade twist in order to address an observed effect on the 'neutral' pitch angle.

TI The Fourth Industrial Revolution: Will it change pharmacy practice?
SO RESEARCH IN SOCIAL & ADMINISTRATIVE PHARMACY
LA English
DT Article
AB The industrial world is at the beginning of a Fourth Industrial Revolution (4IR). This era will radically change the human use of technology, with major implications for the ways people live and work. This commentary asks: will 4IR change pharmacy practice? The first three revolutions created the pharmaceutical industry and gave pharmacists a near-monopoly over drug supply. 4IR could do the opposite and create alternative, non-pharmaceutical means of treating patients as well reducing the involvement in medicines supply. If the pharmacy sector becomes stuck in traditional, linear thinking that assumes the future will be an extension of the past, then the fourth revolution may be less of an opportunity and more of a threat. The sector faces the "innovator's dilemma" when responding to 4IR. Should the pharmacy profession disrupt their current activities in order to: (i) do things better, (ii) do new things, and (iii) deter competition? To maintain its position in the medical marketplace, pharmacy needs to discover how to work with AI, robotics, IoT, autonomous vehicles, 3-D printing, nanotechnology, biotechnology, materials science, energy storage, and quantum computing. If the new game is understood, pharmacists may become the playmaster of tomorrow. If not, then the practice of pharmacy may be replaced by innovative new ways of meeting patient pharmaceutical needs.

AB In this study, the object association issue is tackled in order to ensure a correct affiliation of perceived objects with known ones. The proposed approach is based on the evidence theory and includes multiple object features in order to manage pairing issues in a complex environment. Two heterogeneous information sources are built based on kinematic features related to the objects: their position and size on one hand and their direction of motion on the other hand. A study on the estimation of the belief expressed by these independent sources is performed. The multiple features are managed through a hierarchical fusion which includes two levels of combination. The first level is a pairwise combination, fusing position and orientation data of each pair of objects and the second one processes sequentially the previously combined information over all possible associations. This paper also investigates the effectiveness of the association according to different combination operators at both levels. The performance of the proposed approach is demonstrated in the Intelligent Transportation Systems context for which environmental perception is crucial. The validation exploits a large amount of real data issued from a camera and a 3D LiDAR from the KITTI database.

TI PLIN: A Network for Pseudo-LiDAR Point Cloud Interpolation

   networks; depth completion; video interpolation
AB LiDAR sensors can provide dependable 3D spatial information at a low frequency (around 10 Hz) and have been widely applied in the field of autonomous driving and unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV). However, the camera with a higher frequency (around 20 Hz) has to be decreased so as to match with LiDAR in a multi-sensor system. In this paper, we propose a novel Pseudo-LiDAR interpolation network (PLIN) to increase the frequency of LiDAR sensor data. PLIN can generate temporally and spatially high-quality point cloud sequences to match the high frequency of cameras. To achieve this goal, we design a coarse interpolation stage guided by consecutive sparse depth maps and motion relationship. We also propose a refined interpolation stage guided by the realistic scene. Using this coarse-to-fine cascade structure, our method can progressively perceive multi-modal information and generate accurate intermediate point clouds. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first deep framework for Pseudo-LiDAR point cloud interpolation, which shows appealing applications in navigation systems equipped with LiDAR and cameras. Experimental results demonstrate that PLIN achieves promising performance on the KITTI dataset, significantly outperforming the traditional interpolation method and the state-of-the-art video interpolation technique.

AB Building inspection is a vital task because infrastructure damage puts people at risk or causes economic losses. Thanks to the technological breakthroughs in regard to Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) and intelligent systems, there is a real possibility to implement an inspection by means of these technologies. UAVs allow reaching difficult places and, depending on the hardware carried onboard, take data or compute algorithms to understand the environment. This paper proposes a real-time robust altitude control strategy for a quadrotor aircraft, also a convolutional neuronal network for crack recognition is developed. The main idea of this proposal is to lay the background for an autonomous system for the inspection of structures using a UAV. For the robust control, a combination of two control actions, one linear (PD) and another nonlinear (Sliding Mode) is used. The combination of these control actions allows increasing the system's performance. To verify the satisfactory performance of proposed control law, simulations and experimental results with a quadrotor, in the presence of disturbances, are presented. For crack recognition in images, several experiments were carried out validating the proposed model. For CNN training, a database of cracks was built from images taken from the Internet.

AB Localization is among the most important prerequisites for autonomous navigation. Vision-based systems have got great attention in recent years due to numerous camera advantages over other sensors. Reducing the computational burden of such systems is an active research area making them applicable to resource-constrained systems. This paper aims to propose and compare a fast monocular approach, named ARM-VO, with two state-of-the-art algorithms, LibViso2 and ORB-SLAM2, on Raspberry Pi 3. The approach is a sequential frame-to-frame scheme that extracts a sparse set of well-distributed features and tracks them in upcoming frames using Kanade-Lucas-Tomasi tracker. A robust model selection is used to avoid degenerate cases of fundamental matrix. Scale ambiguity is resolved by incorporating known camera height above ground. The method is open-sourced [] and implemented in ROS mostly using NEON C intrinsics while exploiting the multi-core architecture of the CPU. Experiments on KITTI dataset showed that ARM-VO is 4-5 times faster and is the only method that can work almost real-time on Raspberry Pi 3. It achieves significantly better results than LibViso2 and is ranked second after ORB-SLAM2 in terms of accuracy.

AB The proven efficacy of learning-based control schemes strongly motivates their application to robotic systems operating in the physical world. However, guaranteeing correct operation during the learning process is currently an unresolved issue, which is of vital importance in safety-critical systems. We propose a general safety framework based on Hamilton-Jacobi reachability methods that can work in conjunction with an arbitrary learning algorithm. The method exploits approximate knowledge of the system dynamics to guarantee constraint satisfaction while minimally interfering with the learning process. We further introduce a Bayesian mechanism that refines the safety analysis as the system acquires new evidence, reducing initial conservativeness when appropriate while strengthening guarantees through real-time validation. The result is a least-restrictive, safety-preserving control law that intervenes only when the computed safety guarantees require it, or confidence in the computed guarantees decays in light of new observations. We prove theoretical safety guarantees combining probabilistic and worst-case analysis and demonstrate the proposed framework experimentally on a quadrotor vehicle. Even though safety analysis is based on a simple point-mass model, the quadrotor successfully arrives at a suitable controller by policy-gradient reinforcement learning without ever crashing, and safely retracts away from a strong external disturbance introduced during flight.

AB Underwater sensor networking is generally regarded as an emerging technology in conducting oceanic exploration and research in an automated and effective manner. As underwater operations become more sophisticated and Autonomous Underwater Vehicles (AUVs) become more advanced, there is an increasing demand for real-time video streaming from AUVs to remotely steer them and to probe the environment. However, real-time video streaming requires high bandwidth. To help overcome this obstacle, we propose a hybrid solution that combines acoustic and optical communications. In our hybrid solution, optics provide good quality real-time video streaming. Acoustic maintains a "thin" channel for the network topology and transmission control. The acoustic channel is also used for still frame video delivery when the optical channel fails. In particular, we enable optical communications by acoustic-assisted alignment and use acoustic communications as a backup when the optical signal is interrupted. The main contribution of this research is to enable reliable, real-time video streaming without underwater optical cables. Another important contribution is the smooth transition between the acoustic and optical video delivery mode, by leveraging image processing algorithms to compress the key frames before transmitting them on the acoustic channel.

DE Machine learning; swimming robots; underwater acoustics
AB When an aspect-dependent target is insonified by an acoustic source, distinct features are produced in the resulting bistatic scattered field. These features change as the aspect between the source and the target is varied. This paper describes the use of these features for estimation of the target aspect angle using data collected by an autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV). An experiment was conducted in November 2014 in Massachusetts Bay to collect data using a ship-based acoustic source producing 7-9-kHz linear frequency modulation (LFM) chirps insonifying a steel pipe. The true target orientation was unknown, as the target was dropped from the ship with no rotation control. The AUV Unicorn, fitted with a 16-element nose array, was deployed in data collection behaviors around the target, and the ship was moved to create two target aspects. A support vector machine regression model was trained using simulated scattering bistatic field data. This model was then used to estimate the target aspect angle from the data collected during the experiment. The difference between the estimates was consistent with experimental observations of relative source positioning. The simulation-based model appeared successful in estimating the target aspect angle despite uncertainties in target and source location and mismatch between true environment and simulation parameters.

DE complex systems; competition; modeling; dynamics
AB With the number and variety of commercial drones and UAVs (Unmanned Aerial Vehicles) set to escalate, there will be high future demands on popular regions of airspace and communication bandwidths. This raises safety concerns and hence heightens the need for a generic quantitative understanding of the real-time dynamics of multi-drone populations. Here, we explain how a simple system design built around system-level competition, as opposed to cooperation, can be used to control and ultimately reduce the fluctuations that ordinarily arise in such congestion situations, while simultaneously keeping the on-board processing requirements minimal. These benefits naturally arise from the collective competition to choose the less crowded option, using only previous outcomes and built-in algorithms. We provide explicit closed-form formulae that are applicable to any number of airborne drones N, and which show that the necessary on-board processing increases slower than N as N increases. This design therefore offers operational advantages over traditional cooperative schemes that require drone-to-drone communications that scale like N-2, and also over optimization and control schemes that do not easily scale up to general N. In addition to populations of drones, the same mathematical analysis can be used to describe more complex individual drones that feature N adaptive sensor/actuator units.

AB In this paper, volumetric imaging via multipass circular synthetic aperture sonar (CSAS) is demonstrated using an autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV). A multidimensional aperture is synthesized by performing a series of circular scans at varying grazing angles around targets and coherently combining the backscattering information from the set of scans to form high-resolution volumetric images. A data-driven technique for precision alignment of the individual scans comprising the multipass set enables synthesis of a multidimensional array. To beamform in the vertical dimension using the irregular and undersampled multipass aperture, a compressive-sensing-based approach is adopted which is similar to methods used in analogous synthetic aperture radar tomography applications but modified to accommodate for the wider fractional bandwidth of the synthetic aperture sonar (SAS) system. The modification exploits a joint sparsity assumption in the vertical scattering profile at different subbands and adapts a standard joint sparse solving algorithm to the relevant case in which the sparsity profile is common between solution vectors but the sensing matrices are different. Results are shown for a variety of targets, including proud and obliquely buried unexploded ordnance, a 2-1 solid aluminum cylinder, and a steel oil drum.

AB Bluegill sunfish pectoral fins represent a remarkable success in evolutionary terms as a means of propulsion in challenging environments. Attempts to mimic their design in the context of autonomous underwater vehicles have overwhelmingly relied on the analysis of steady swimming. Experimental observations of maneuvers reveal that the kinematics of fin and wake dynamics exhibit characteristics that are distinctly different from steady swimming. We present a computational analysis that compares, qualitatively and quantitatively, the wake hydrodynamics and performance of the bluegill sunfish pectoral fin for two modes of swimming: steady swimming and a yaw turn maneuver. It is in this context that we comment on the role that flexibility plays in the success of the pectoral fin as a versatile propulsor. Specifically, we assess the performance of the fin by conducting a "virtual dissection" where only a portion of fin is retained. Approximately 90% of peak thrust for steady swimming is recovered using only the dorsal half. This figure drops to 70% for the yaw turn maneuver. Our findings suggest that designs based on fin analysis that account for various locomotion modes can lead to more robust performance than those based solely on steady swimming.

AB This paper introduces a novel hardware system structure and systematic digital signal processing algorithms for the automatic localization of an autonomous mobile robot by merging dead-reckoning and ultrasonic measurements. The multisensorial dead-reckoning (DR) subsystem is based on optimal filtering that merges heading readings from a magnetic compass, a rate-gyroscope, and two encoders mounted on the robot wheels to compute the dead-reckoned location estimate. The novel ultrasonic localization subsystem consists of one ultrasonic transmitter and one radio-frequency (RF) controlled switch mounted at a known location fixed to an inertial frame of reference, four ultrasonic receivers, and one RF controlled switch installed on the mobile robot, Four ultrasonic time-of-flight (TOF) measurements together with the dead-reckoned location information are used to update the vehicle's position by utilizing the extended Kalman filtering (EKF) algorithm. The proposed algorithms are implemented using a host PC 586 computer and standard C++ programming techniques. The system prototype together with the experimental results were used to confirm that the system not only retains high accuracy and magnetic interference immunity, but also provides a simple and practical structure for use and installation/calibration.

ID AIRCRAFT; FLIGHT
AB A swarm of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) can be used for many applications, including disaster relief, search and rescue, and establishing communication networks, due to its mobility, scalability, and robustness to failure. However, a UAV swarm's performance is typically limited by each agent's stored energy. Recent works have considered the usage of thermals, or vertical updrafts of warm air, to address this issue. One challenge lies in a swarm of UAVs detecting and taking advantage of these thermals. Inspired by hawks, a swarm could take advantage of thermals better than individuals due to the swarm's distributed sensing abilities. To determine which emergent behaviors increase survival time, simulation software was created to test the behavioral models of UAV gliders around thermals. For simplicity and robustness, agents operate with limited information about other agents. The UAVs' motion was implemented as a Boids model, replicating the behavior of flocking birds through cohesion, separation, and alignment forces. Agents equipped with a modified behavioral model exhibit dynamic flocking behavior, including relative ascension-based cohesion and relative height-based separation and alignment. The simulation results show the agents flocking to thermals and improving swarm survival. These findings present a promising method to extend the flight time of autonomous UAV swarms.

AB Frequency-modulated continuous wave radar sensors play an essential role for assisted and autonomous driving as they are robust under all weather and light conditions. However, the rising number of transmitters and receivers for obtaining a higher angular resolution increases the cost for digital signal processing. One promising approach for energy-efficient signal processing is the usage of brain-inspired spiking neural networks (SNNs) implemented on neuromorphic hardware. In this article we perform a step-by-step analysis of automotive radar processing and argue how spiking neural networks could replace or complement the conventional processing. We provide SNN examples for two processing steps and evaluate their accuracy and computational efficiency. For radar target detection, an SNN with temporal coding is competitive to the conventional approach at a low compute overhead. Instead, our SNN for target classification achieves an accuracy close to a reference artificial neural network while requiring 200 times less operations. Finally, we discuss the specific requirements and challenges for SNN-based radar processing on neuromorphic hardware. This study proves the general applicability of SNNs for automotive radar processing and sustains the prospect of energy-efficient realizations in automated vehicles.

AB Urban Air Mobility (UAM) constitutes a future aerial mobility alternative, which concerns the use of electric and autonomous aerial vehicles for transporting people throughout a planned network of vertiports. To materialize UAM, several actors of the air and urban transport ecosystem play a vital role. This paper describes the insights gathered from 32 key stakeholders around the world to present and frame the key aspects for the future implementation of UAM. The participants include representatives from the UAM industry such as airports, airlines, aviation consulting companies, academia, and authorities. The data collection encompasses various key research areas, covering topics such as UAM strengths, weaknesses, opportunities and risks, requirements for implementation, concept integration in the existing transport system, specific use cases, business models, and end-user segments. The research aims at setting up the stakeholder scene and expanding the current literature for UAM by engaging key decision makers and experts towards shaping the new mobility era. The results demonstrate that ensuring certification standards for UAM fleets and updating the current legal and regulatory framework are the main prerequisites for UAM's realization. In addition, the usage of UAM for transporting cargo or for air ambulance services are the most mature business models for the coming decade.

AB In this article, based on feedback linearized approach and linear quadratic regulator optimization control approach using particle swarm optimization, the almost disturbance decoupling, input amplitude reduction, tuning parameter optimization, controllable convergence rate, improved suspension and globally exponential stability multi-performances of highly nonlinear multi-input multi-output full-car uncertain system are simultaneously achieved without applying any nonlinear function approximator including neural network approach and fuzzy logic approach. The article proposes a new method to achieve the optimal control matrices of LQR such that the composite controller can reduce the amplitudes of system control inputs. Determination of the LQR tuning parameters is conventionally determined via trial and error approach. In addition to being very troublesome, it is difficult to find the globally best tuning matrices with LQR method. This study has first proposed the convergence rate formula of the nonlinear system response as the fitness function of LQR approach by using PSO optimization algorithm to take the place of the conventional trial and error method and locally Jacobian linearized approach under the guarantee of globally exponential stability. The simulation results show how the full-car system can be controlled optimally and satisfactorily and confirm the superiority of the proposed method.

AB Near-seafloor bathymetric and magnetic data have been collected by Autonomous Underwater Vehicle (AUV) and manned submersible (DSS) over a volcanically active area southeast of Futuna Island, French Territory of Wallis-and-Futuna, in the Southwestern Pacific Ocean. Located at the edge of the Lau and North Fiji basins, at the convergence of the Pacific and Australian plates, this area is characterized by intense volcanic and tectonic activity. Direct observation by submersible reveals that the seafloor is covered by recent lava flows, volcanoes and large, active or inactive calderas filled by smooth lava flows and eventually hosting hydrothermal sites. We investigate the volcanic chronology by combining a Bayesian inversion of the AUV-gridded magnetic data with an inversion of the submersible data specifically designed to estimate the rock magnetic polarity and absolute magnetization. We show that some volcanoes predate the last (Brunhes-Matuyama) magnetic polarity reversal 780 kyr ago whereas their neighbors exhibit a normal polarity and appear to be recent. This result suggests that the seafloor in this region has undergone continuous and sparse volcanic activity over the last few million years. (C) 2020 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.

AB Travel-based multitasking and the possibility to perform activities during travel are important factors that can make a transportation mode attractive. However, serious crowding in public transportation systems might adversely affect the passengers' free choice to participate in activities during travel. This study aims to examine how crowding in public transportation systems is related to discrete-continuous choices in different types of multitasking options using a data set of 500 commuters in the Tokyo Metropolitan Area. Employing a multiple discrete-continuous extreme value model, this study investigates the relationship between crowding levels and multitasking behavior. The results show that high crowding levels, relative to being seated, have a significantly negative association with many multitasking options, which suggests the importance of seat availability. The estimation results also show that information and communication technology (ICT)-dependent leisure activities and non-ICT active activities, such as reading and talking with other passengers, have the lowest satiation and higher baseline preference constants, which indicates that they are preferred by passengers. Meanwhile, crowding levels were observed to have a significant relationship with these multitasking activities. Finally, the key findings, contributions, and policy implications of the findings are discussed.

DE Unmanned aerial vehicles; autonomous robot cooperation; aerial

AB In this article we propose a framework for a hierarchical model for cooperation between unmanned airplanes in large groups. We argue that the swarm approach to cooperation between a large number of mobile robots is ineffective when robots can be equipped with efficient communication, precise location hardware and with complex control algorithms. The proposed model, analogous to the organisation of a team of people, is an intermediate solution, between the swarm approach and central control. The bottom layer of the model includes unmanned airplanes that perform tasks related to the mission goals, such as capturing images, looking for objects through image analysis, etc. These airplanes are organised in teams, and each team is controlled by the superior airplane. Two top layers are ground-based: the central computer and the human operator, and their functions are mostly defining the goals, planning and optimisation of the mission. We present two examples of response to events, related to failure or loss of an airplane. We discuss how the proposed model can manage possible interruptions of communication and security issues, and how collision avoidance can be implemented. Finally, we point out that, although the control structure is different than in the swarm approach, swarm intelligence can still be used to optimise missions.

AB Traffic sign recognition plays an important role in autonomous vehicles as well as advanced driver assistance systems. Although various methods have been developed, it is still difficult for the state-of-the-art algorithms to obtain high recognition precision with low computational costs. In this paper, based on the investigation on the influence that color spaces have on the representation learning of convolutional neural network, a novel traffic sign recognition approach called DP-KELM is proposed by using a kernel-based extreme learning machine (KELM) classifier with deep perceptual features. Unlike the previous approaches, the representation learning process in DP-KELM is implemented in the perceptual Lab color space. Based on the learned deep perceptual feature, a kernel-based ELM classifier is trained with high computational efficiency and generalization performance. Through the experiments on the German traffic sign recognition benchmark, the proposed method is demonstrated to have higher precision than most of the state-of-the-art approaches. In particular, when compared with the hinge loss stochastic gradient descent method which has the highest precision, the proposed method can achieve a comparable recognition rate with significantly fewer computational costs.

AB This article investigates a generalized dynamic predictive control (GDPC) strategy with a novel autonomous tuning mechanism of the horizon for a class of nonlinear systems subject to mismatched disturbances. As a new incremental function for the predictive control method, the horizon can be determined autonomously with respect to the system working conditions, instead of selecting a fixed value via experience before, which is able to effectively improve the control performance optimization ability to a certain extent considering different system perturbation levels. To this aim, firstly, a nonrecursive composite control framework is constructed based on a series of disturbance observations via higher-order sliding modes. Secondly, by designing a simple one-step scaling gain update mechanism into the receding horizon optimization, the horizon can be therefore adaptively tuned according to its real-time practical operating conditions. A three-order numerical simulation and a typical engineering application of permanent magnet synchronous motor drive system are carried out to demonstrate the effectiveness and conciseness of the proposed GDPC method.

AB Recognizing facial expressions plays a crucial role in various multimedia applications, such as human-computer interactions and the functioning of autonomous vehicles. This paper introduces a hybrid feature extraction network model to bolster the discriminative capacity of emotional features for multimedia applications. The proposed model comprises a convolutional neural network (CNN) and deep belief network (DBN) series. First, a spatial CNN network processed static facial images, followed by a temporal CNN network. The CNNs were fine-tuned based on facial expression recognition (FER) datasets. A deep belief network (DBN) model was then applied to integrate the segment-level spatial and temporal features. Deep fusion networks were jointly used to learn spatiotemporal features for discrimination purposes. Due to its generalization capabilities, we used a multi-class support vector machine classifier to classify the seven basic emotions in the proposed model. The proposed model exhibited 98.14% recognition performance for the JaFFE database, 95.29% for the KDEF database, and 98.86% for the RaFD database. It is shown that the proposed method is effective for all three databases, compared with the previous schemes for JAFFE, KDEF, and RaFD databases.

AB Solar disk velocity difference is a novel celestial navigation measurement, which can be obtained by four spectrometers installed on the four corners of the quadrangular pyramid. However, the characteristic of the spacecraft's high dynamic results in the spectrometer installation error. Spectrometer installation error has an obvious influence on navigation accuracy. To solve this problem, an augmented state Sun direction/solar disk velocity difference integrated navigation is proposed. After analyzing the influence of spectrometer installation error on the solar disk velocity difference measurement, the spectrometer installation error is augmented into the state vector. The state model and measurement model of the augmented state Sun direction/solar disk velocity difference integrated navigation considering spectrometer installation error are established. Unscented Kalman filter (UKF) is used to estimate and correct spectrometer installation error. Simulation results show that the proposed method greatly suppresses the effect of spectrometer installation error on navigation accuracy. Furthermore, the effects of the Sun sensor accuracy, the sample time, the number of spectrometers, and the spectrometer installation error value on the navigation performance are analyzed.

TI Simulation of acoustic reflection and backscatter from arctic sea-ice
SO JOURNAL OF THE ACOUSTICAL SOCIETY OF AMERICA
LA English
DT Article
ID ELASTIC PROPERTIES; THICKNESS; WAVES
AB The rapidly warming Arctic ocean demands new ways to monitor and characterize changes in sea-ice distribution, thickness, and mechanical properties. Upward-looking sonars mounted on autonomous underwater vehicles offer possibilities for doing so. Numerical simulations were made of the signal received by an upward-looking sonar under a smooth ice sheet using a wavenumber integration code. Demands on sonar frequency and bandwidth for pulse-echo measurements were analyzed. For typical sea-ice physical properties found in the Arctic ocean, even in highly attenuating sea-ice, there is significant information to be extracted from the received acoustic signal. Discrete resonance frequencies in the signal may be related to leaky Lamb waves, and the frequencies are connected to the ratio of the shear wave speed-to-thickness of the ice sheet. The periodicity of the multiple reflections of a pulse-compressed signal may be related to the ratio of compressional wave speed-to- thickness. Decay rates of both types of signals are indicative of the wave attenuation coefficients. Simulations of the acoustic reflection by rough water-ice interfaces were made. Smaller levels of roughness were found to enhance the acoustic signal, while greater levels of roughness are detrimental to the sea-ice characterization process.

AB To improve the autonomous collision avoidance capability of an unmanned surface vehicle (USV) under complex working conditions, this study proposes a local track planning algorithm for USVs based on collision hazard assessment. This algorithm uses hierarchical analysis and discrepancy method to determine the collision risk index (CRI) values of different encounter scenarios, and then introduces fuzzy inference theory to construct a quantitative collision hazard assessment model based on the principle of combining subjective and objective assessment and the pessimistic principle of class classification, which provides a decision basis for a collision avoidance plan. In response to the unexpected encounter, an improved vector field histogram algorithm is proposed to use the CRI value of the obstacle as the key parameter of the histogram, solve the restricted area by removing the grid model and threshold improvement, establish the cost function to calculate the optimal sailing interval under the rules and dynamics constraints of the Convention on International Regulations for Preventing Collisions at Sea (COLREGS), and realise the local target point by tracking local track planning during autono-mous collision avoidance. Simulation and on-lake experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the collision hazard assessment model and local track planning algorithm proposed in this paper.

AB This study analyzes the kinematic characteristics and flow field information of zebrafish in straight and steering acceleration states using time-resolved particle image velocimetry to explore how vortices are generated and controlled to achieve the desired motion. The important role of the high- and low-pressure zones in the wake of zebrafish wavy propulsion is also presented by quantifying the pressure field around the zebrafish. With their precise body and motion control, fish have a movement advantage that cannot be achieved by artificial machinery. Exploring the evolutionary process of the fish structure and surrounding flow field during zebrafish autonomous propulsion is helpful for understanding the active control means and propulsion mechanism of fish. Zebrafish were constrained in a transparent water tank, and laser and image acquisitions systems were used to capture their spontaneous movement behavior. The results show that the pull provided by the low-pressure area and the thrust provided by the high-pressure area together provide the forward power of the zebrafish. The findings from this analysis of the bending control and propulsion mechanism of the zebrafish body can facilitate the optimal design of underwater vehicle propulsion methods, such as the propulsion efficiency and maneuverability of a bionic propeller.

AB During the water entry process, autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) take a long time to reach a horizontal attitude. To reduce the time and distance required to adjust the attitude, an AUV with an asymmetric nose shape is proposed in this paper. A numerical model based on the volume of fluid (VOF) method is established to describe the cavity and trajectory characteristics of an AUV with a high-speed water entry. Since the velocity of the AUV impacting the water surface is greater than 0.3 Ma, the Tait equation is used to describe the compressibility effects in water, and the air phase is modelled as an ideal gas. The simulation results, such as cavitation shape and velocity, are compared with the experimental data from an earlier study. Good comparative results reveal the accuracy and performance of the employed numerical method. Subsequently, the computational fluid dynamics (CFD) code Fluent is used to simulate and analyse the variations in the trajectory characteristics with different water entry velocities, water entry angles, nose shapes and rudder deflection angles. The results obtained in this study can provide a good guideline for the trajectory control and nose shape design of an AUV.

DE Qualitative representation; curved directed line; spatiotemporal data
   representation; traffic research; pattern detection
AB In this paper, we represent (moving) point configurations along a curved directed line qualitatively by means of a system of relational symbols based on two distance descriptors: one representing distance along the curved directed line and the other representing signed orthogonal distance to the curved directed line. The curved directed line represents the direction of the movement of interest. For instance, it could be straight as in the case of driving along a highway or could be curved as in the case of an intersection or a roundabout. Inspired by the Point Calculus, the order between the points on the curved directed line is described by means of a small set of binary relations (<,=>) acting upon the distance descriptors. We call this representation the Point-Descriptor-Precedence-Static (PDPS) representation at a time point and Point-Descriptor-Precedence-Dynamic (PDPD) representation during a time interval. To illustrate how the proposed approach can be used to represent and analyse curved movements, some basic micro-analysis traffic examples are studied. Finally, we discuss some extensions of our work to highlight the practical benefits of PDP in identifying motion patterns that could be useful in GIS, autonomous vehicles, sports analytics, and gait analysis.

AB Proton exchange membrane (PEM) fuel cells have been a long pursuit due to its high efficiency and environmental benign, and PEM fuel cell vehicles have already been commercialized and are being pushed on the market worldwide. One of key components, fuel cell compressors in the balance of plant, and the air supply were thoroughly reviewed in this paper. Following the governing laws and fundamental theory about compressors, the type and characteristics of various fuel cell compressors were summarized. Roots, screw, centrifugal compressors and some supercharger or turbocharger among most positive displacement and dynamic compressors were considered as the best options for the on board application. Their application by automotive manufacturers was briefly introduced. Due to the autonomous air supply in PEM fuel cell engine, various control logics and strategies for the air supply were extensively reviewed. The sole control including PID control, model predictive control, sliding mode control, fuzzy control, neural control, etc, and the hybrid or hierarchical structures of control like parenting, parallel, and combined structures were systematically discussed, which might shed light on the future research.

AB Several industrial indoor positioning systems utilize LEDs as beacons and cameras as sensors: The LED beacons transmit their identity, using various means of visible light communication (VLC) techniques. To avoid flickering effects, the transmission frequency is usually much higher than the sampling frequency of ordinary cameras, thus undersampling occurs. In this paper, a potential problem of undersampled protocols is highlighted: If the transmitter and receiver are not synchronized, the frequency slip between the transmitter and receiver clocks will periodically cause a burst of potential decoding errors. If the frequency slip is small (i.e., good-quality clocks are used in both the transmitter and the receiver), the time between bursts of errors is longer but at the same time the length of the bursts are also longer. An error analysis is provided as a function of protocol parameters and various error sources. Based on the results the robust-undersampled phase-shift on-off keying (UPSOOK) protocol is introduced, which guarantees the correct operation even in the presence of clock inaccuracies, as well as other error sources such as sensor noise, jitter, camera saturation, without the utilization of any error correcting codes. The properties of the proposed robust-UPSOOK protocol are demonstrated using simulations and measurements.

   Orientation estimation
AB Accurate pedestrian orientation estimation of autonomous driving helps the ego vehicle obtain the intentions of pedestrians in the related environment, which are the base of safety measures such as collision avoidance and prewarning. However, because of relatively small sizes and high-level deformation of pedestrians, common pedestrian orientation estimation models fail to extract sufficient and comprehensive information from them, thus having their performance restricted, especially monocular ones which fail to obtain depth information of objects and related environment. In this paper, a novel monocular pedestrian orientation estimation model, called FFNet, is proposed. Apart from camera captures, the model adds the 2D and 3D dimensions of pedestrians as two other inputs according to the logic relationship between orientation and them. The 2D and 3D dimensions of pedestrians are determined from the camera captures and further utilized through two feedforward links connected to the orientation estimator. The feedforward links strengthen the logicality and interpretability of the network structure of the proposed model. Experiments show that the proposed model has at least 1.72% AOS increase than most state-of-the-art models after identical training processes. The model also has competitive results in orientation estimation evaluation on KITTI dataset. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

ID EDUCATION; COMPETENCE; CARE
AB Background: In the USA, the Accreditation Council of Graduate Medical Education, Educational Innovations Project is a partner in reshaping residency training to meet increasingly complex systems of health care delivery.
   Aim: We describe the creation and implementation of milestones as a vehicle for translating educational theory into practice in preparing residents to provide safe, autonomous patient care.
   Method: Six program faculty leaders, all with advanced medical education training, met in an iterative process of developing, implementing, and modifying milestones until a final set were vetted.
   Results: We first formed the profile of a Master Internist. We then translated it into milestone language and implemented its integration across the program. Thirty-seven milestones were applied in all settings and rotations to reach explicit educational outcomes. We created three types of milestones: Progressive, build one on top of the other to mastery; additive, adding multiple behaviors together to culminate in mastery; and descriptive, using a proscribe set of complex, predetermined steps toward mastery.
   Conclusions: Using milestones, our program has enhanced an educational model into explicit, end of training goals. Milestone implementation has yielded positive results toward competency-based training and others may adapt our strategies in a similar effort.

AB The goal of the European project muFly is to build a fully autonomous micro helicopter, which is comparable to a small bird in size and mass. The rigorous size and mass constraints infer various problems related to energy efficiency, flight stability and overall system design. In this research, aerodynamics and flight dynamics are investigated experimentally to gather information for the design of the helicopter's propulsion group and steering system. Several test benches are designed and built for these investigations. A coaxial rotor test bench is used to measure the thrust and drag torque of different rotor blade designs. The effects of cyclic pitching of the swash plate and the passive stabilizer bar are studied on a test bench measuring rotor forces and moments with a 6-axis force sensor. The gathered knowledge is used to design a first prototype of the muFly helicopter. The prototype is described in terms of rotor configuration, structure, actuator and sensor selection according to the project demands, and a first version of the helicopter is shown. As a safety measure for the flight tests and to analyze the helicopter dynamics, a 6DoF vehicle test bench for tethered helicopter flight is used.

AB An Integrated Sediment Disturber (ISD) was developed to study the effects of repeated physical disturbances on sediment geochemistry and associated benthic fauna. The ISD is capable to generate a strong, more or less uniform mixing of surface sediments by three rotating fork-like disturber units of approximately 1 m in diameter. Perturbations can be set at different intensities and frequencies, e. g., on times scales of hours, days, or weeks, depending on the experimental design. The ISD carries an Autonomous Positioning Drive (APD) module, which allows the three-dimensional positioning of sensors by a programmable controller. The three circular disturbed zones and an undisturbed control area in-between can be monitored at specified frequencies using a microprofiler with microelectrodes for measuring various parameters (e. g., oxygen, pH, hydrogen sulphide). All operations are supervised by a digital stills camera. Sediment sampling at the start and end point using coring devices handled by divers (and potentially undertaken using a Remotely Operated Vehicle) provides material to study shifts in biodiversity of the small sediment-inhabiting biota and alterations in ecosystem functioning in response to perturbations and the changing geochemical characteristics of surface sediments.

AB The maximum likelihood probabilistic data association (ML-PDA) tracking algorithm is effective in tracking Very Low Observable targets (i.e., very low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) targets in a high false alarm environment). However, the computational complexity associated with obtaining the track estimate in many cases has precluded its use in real-time scenarios. Previous ML-PDA implementations used a multi-pass grid (MPG) search to find the track estimate. Two alternate methods for finding the track estimate are presented-a genetic search and a newly developed directed subspace (DSS) search algorithm. Each algorithm is tested using active sonar scenarios in which an autonomous underwater vehicle searches for and tracks a target. Within each scenario, the problem parameters are varied to illustrate the relative performance of each search technique. Both the DSS search and the genetic algorithm are shown to be an order of magnitude more computationally efficient than the MPG search, making possible real-time implementation. In addition, the DSS search is shown to be the most effective technique at tracking a target at the lowest SNR levels-reliable tracking down to 5 dB (postprocessing SNR in a resolution cell) using a 5-frame sliding window is demonstrated, this being 6 dB better than the MPG search.

AB A novel and completely autonomous guided wave system for flood detection in the hollow cross-beam members of offshore steel oil rigs is presented. Underwater non-destructive testing methods such as ultrasound have been used to inspect for the presence of seawater in these applications, often in conjunction with remote operating vehicles. Alternatively, a monolithic PZT guided wave transducer which can be permanently attached to a sub-sea installation and that can be powered by the action of the seawater is now being developed. Upon activation, the transducer transmits an ultrasound-encoded signal to a receiver, in the form of a real-time digital signal processing system at the surface level. Experiments have been carried out using a jointed steel pipe structure, 10 m in length, 0.5 m in diameter and 16 mm in thickness, completely immersed in seawater. The transmitter was attached to the inner wall of a spur pipe and configured to generate narrow bandwidth, low frequency ultrasonic chirp signals, coupled to the pipe as an axisymmetric mode. Results confirmed that although some attenuation occurs, the system signal processing system successfully identified the signals above the background noise.

AB The assessment of multiple incoming autonomous underwater vehicles (multi-AUVs) and threat prioritization are critical to underwater defense. To solve problems troubling multi-AUV threat assessment solutions, such as difficult data analysis, high subjectivity, and rigid prioritization logic, we propose the PROMETHEE algorithm based on fusion weights calculated twice by entropy and an analytic network process (ANP), respectively. First, according to AUV detection performance and underwater confrontation situation analysis, the main criteria and indicators of threat assessment are determined. The threat assessment system is provided by unified measurement of these indicators. Then, through analysis and assessment, the weighting algorithm is designed using entropy and ANP. The subjective weight calculated based on ANP and the objective weight obtained based on the entropy method are fused twice to obtain the combined weights, and the influence of subjective and objective factors on problem analysis is considered. Finally, by analyzing the simulation results of a multi-AUV, it is proven that the proposed algorithm is scientific and effective for AUV threat assessment. According to the experimental results, accurate evaluation of the target improved by at least 10%, enabling delivery of results close to the real confrontation situation with high reliability.

AB With the development of autonomous/smart technologies and the Internet of Things (IoT), tremendous wireless sensor nodes (WSNs) are of great importance to realize intelligent mechanical engineering, which is significant in the industrial and social fields. However, current power supply methods, cable and battery for instance, face challenges such as layout difficulties, high cost, short life, and environmental pollution. Meanwhile, vibration is ubiquitous in machinery, vehicles, structures, etc., but has been regarded as an unwanted by-product and wasted in most cases. Therefore, it is crucial to harvest mechanical vibration energy to achieve in situ power supply for these WSNs. As a recent energy conversion technology, triboelectric nanogenerator (TENG) is particularly good at harvesting such broadband, weak, and irregular mechanical energy, which provides a feasible scheme for the power supply of WSNs. In this review, recent achievements of mechanical vibration energy harvesting (VEH) related to mechanical engineering based on TENG are systematically reviewed from the perspective of contact-separation (C-S) and freestanding modes. Finally, existing challenges and forthcoming development orientation of the VEH based on TENG are discussed in depth, which will be conducive to the future development of intelligent mechanical engineering in the era of IoT.

AB A reliable and accurate 3D tracking framework is essential for predicting future locations of surrounding objects and planning the observer's actions in numerous applications such as autonomous driving. We propose a framework that can effectively associate moving objects over time and estimate their full 3D bounding box information from a sequence of 2D images captured on a moving platform. The object association leverages quasi-dense similarity learning to identify objects in various poses and viewpoints with appearance cues only. After initial 2D association, we further utilize 3D bounding boxes depth-ordering heuristics for robust instance association and motion-based 3D trajectory prediction for re-identification of occluded vehicles. In the end, an LSTM-based object velocity learning module aggregates the long-term trajectory information for more accurate motion extrapolation. Experiments on our proposed simulation data and real-world benchmarks, including KITTI, nuScenes, and Waymo datasets, show that our tracking framework offers robust object association and tracking on urban-driving scenarios. On the Waymo Open benchmark, we establish the first camera-only baseline in the 3D tracking and 3D detection challenges. Our quasi-dense 3D tracking pipeline achieves impressive improvements on the nuScenes 3D tracking benchmark with near five times tracking accuracy of the best vision-only submission among all published methods.

AB In the interest of driving safety, it is essential to understand driver risk assessment to develop human-centred automated driving systems. Visual perception plays a core role in observing, analysing, and predicting driving crash risks. Furthermore, comprehensive progress of visual perception has been achieved in the development of risk perception metrics. However, it is still of interest to understand driver control behaviours, which depend on visual perception. Therefore, the objective of this literature review is to assess the potential of coupling time-remaining cues for risk perception and braking control behaviour. First, conventional risk perception metrics are classified based on trajectory, contact, and state principles, along with new analysis metrics that have been derived from conventional ones. Then, the analysis metrics are discussed based on visual perception information. Next, driver risk assessment is summarised according to the environment, driver, and object characteristics. Moreover, braking behaviour models are compared in relation to visual perception variables, action affordances, and behaviour dynamics. The current review further discusses the possibility of applying driver behaviour modelling to perception, navigation, and spatial awareness in autonomous vehicles. This human-centred approach has the potential to improve interaction between drivers and automation.

AB A lot of manual work goes into identifying a topic for an article. With a large volume of articles, the manual process can be exhausting. Our approach aims to address this issue by automatically extracting topics from the text of large numbers of articles. This approach takes into account the efficiency of the process. Based on existing N-gram analysis, our research examines how often certain words appear in documents in order to support automatic topic extraction. In order to improve efficiency, we apply custom filtering standards to our research. Additionally, delete as many noncritical or irrelevant phrases as possible. In this way, we can ensure we are selecting unique keyphrases for each article, which capture its core idea1. For our research, we chose to center on the autonomous vehicle domain, since the research is relevant to our daily lives. We have to convert the PDF versions of most of the research papers into editable types of files such as TXT. This is because most of the research papers are only in PDF format. To test our proposed idea of automating, numerous articles on robotics have been selected. Next, we evaluate our approach by comparing the result with other models.

AB In this paper, a robust adaptive control scheme is proposed for the trajectory tracking control of underactuated surface vessels (USVs) subject to unknown dynamics, external disturbances and input saturation. First, a coordinate transformation is introduced to deal with the underactuation problem of the USV. A Gaussian error function and an adaptive neural network (NN) are adopted to approximate the saturation function and the unknown dynamics, respectively. Then, an adaptive robust integral of the sign of the error (RISE) feedback term is introduced in feedback control design to compensate the NN and saturation approximation residual errors and unknown external disturbances. On the basis of the above, a robust adaptive trajectory tracking control law is proposed incorporating a coordinate transformation, Gaussian error function and NN into RISE method. In addition, the adjustable-online adaptive feedback gain reduces the conservativeness of the control design. The theoretical analysis indicates that the designed robust adaptive control law can force USVs to track the desired trajectory while guaranteeing the asymptotic tracking performance. Simulation results verify the effectiveness of the novel robust adaptive trajectory tracking control scheme.

AB Since autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) are increasing popular in maritime applications, underwater wireless communication with multiple users is becoming more important and practical. In this paper, we investigate the resource allocation in underwater acoustic networks (UAN) with time division multiple access (TDMA) technique. When the uncertain channel state information (CSI) derived from the movement of AUVs in underwater environment is considered, probability constraints are introduced to guarantee the quality of service (QoS). A joint optimization algorithm is proposed, in order to schedule time for energy harvesting (EH) and wireless information transfer (WIT); the proposed algorithm also allocates transmit power to multiple AUVs to maximize the sum-throughput over a time period. The constraints of outage probability and available energy are both considered. The probability constraint is first transformed into an equivalent formulation. Furthermore, an approach with low computational complexity is proposed for power allocation and time assignment based on the residual energy of the buoy. In extensive simulation experiments, the proposed algorithm shows significant throughput increases in long term compared to baseline schemes, and better performance in terms of convergence and energy efficiency (EE) can be achieved.

AB In order to obtain the hydrodynamic coefficients that can save cost and meet the accuracy requirements, a new hydrodynamic test platform based on a 6DoF (six degrees of freedom) parallel mechanism is proposed in this paper. The test platform can drive the ship to move in six degrees of freedom. By using this experimental platform, the corresponding hydrodynamic coefficients can be measured. Firstly, the structure of the new device is introduced. The working principle of the model is deduced based on the mathematical model. Then the hydrodynamic coefficients of a test ship model of a KELC tank ship with a scale of 1:150 are measured and 8 typical hydrodynamic coefficients are obtained. Finally, the measured data are compared with the value of a real ship. The deviation is less than 10% which meets the technical requirements of the practical project. The efficiency of measuring the hydrodynamic coefficients of physical models of ships and offshore structures is improved by the device. The method of measuring the hydrodynamic coefficients by using the proposed platform provides a certain reference for predicting the hydrodynamic performance of ships and offshore structures.

AB Drones are increasingly used to deliver packages with high efficiency in several areas. We study a multi-warehouse drone delivery system, considering the allocation rule that all warehouses share the drones and the allocation rule that each warehouse owns its drones. Both plug-in charge and battery swap strategies are investigated for battery management. We examine the random and closest drone to warehouse assignment rules, and design a heuristic to improve the drone to warehouse assignment rule. A closed queueing network is built to estimate the maximum throughput capacity and a cost minimisation model is developed for cost analysis. We validate the analytical model by simulation and conduct numerical experiments to analyse the operating polices. The results show that the closest drone to warehouse assignment rule outperforms the random drone to warehouse assignment rule when the number of drones is not large, and our heuristic can improve the throughput capacity by about 13.31%. The battery swap strategy provides a better throughput capacity than the plug-in charge strategy in most cases, while it needs more investment. Moreover, the shared allocation rule gives a larger throughput capacity than the dedicated allocation rule, and it reduces the operating cost by about 30.70%.

Research shows that this is kind of collision is responsible for up 40% of all insurance claims and for up to 30 % of all claim costs worldwide. Therefore, This paper describes a monetary and prospective method for assessment based on an in-depth insurance accident database, experimental tests or simulations and naturalistic driving studies that evaluate the monetary effectiveness of an advanced driver assistance system.
   The main focus of this paper is to present a method using real-world advanced driver assistance system performance tests in combination with naturalistic driving data to derive representative field effectiveness for parking and maneuvering collisions by two representative and exemplary experimentally-tested, low-speed autonomous emergency braking systems installed in two different luxury vehicles. Furthermore, aspects of test evaluation, measuring instrumentation and lest result evaluation are proposed and discussed in order to achieve a monetary effectiveness assessment of advanced driver assistance systems. Finally, monetary effectiveness oil motor own damage collision insurance for both systems are presented.

AB This study aims to develop a three-dimensional image reconstruction method based on the Laser Line Scan (LLS) technique to establish the binocular stereo-vision system for the preliminary research of obstacle detection technique of Autonomous Underwater Vehicle (AUV). A coordinate mapping relationship between 2D pixel coordinate and 3D world coordinate, which can be used to reconstruct 3D objects from 2D scan data, is established by means of direct camera calibration in air and water. In the experiments, the target object was originally designed by Computer-Aided Design (CAD) model and fabricated by the 3D printer. Subsequently, the qualities of point clouds acquired from the target object would be analyzed and compared in the stability water tank at National Cheng Kung University. The acquired point clouds would be used for polygonal surface estimation of the target object by Bonjean curve fitting method in water, with the reference results in air. The acquisition of raw point clouds has been accessed via the transformation to grayscale, histogram equalization, image binarization and skeletonization thinning. Consequently, the results evaluated by our stereo-vision system indicate the reliability and performance in the stability water tank before the application to the obstacle-avoidance of the AUV.

AB Extracting road information from point clouds obtained through mobile laser scanning (MLS) is essential for autonomous vehicle navigation, and has hence garnered a growing amount of research interest in recent years. However, the performance of such systems is seriously affected due to varying point density and noise. This paper proposes a novel three-dimensional (3D) local feature called the binary kernel descriptor (BKD) to extract road information from MLS point clouds. The BKD consists of Gaussian kernel density estimation and binarization components to encode the shape and intensity information of the 3D point clouds that are fed to a random forest classifier to extract curbs and markings on the road. These are then used to derive road information, such as the number of lanes, the lane width, and intersections. In experiments, the precision and recall of the proposed feature for the detection of curbs and road markings on an urban dataset and a highway dataset were as high as 90%, thus showing that the BKD is accurate and robust against varying point density and noise.

AB Measurements of the particulate beam attenuation coefficient at multiple wavelengths in the ocean typically exhibit a power law dependence on wavelength, and the slope of that power law has been related to the slope of the particle size distribution (PSD), when assumed to be a power law function of particle size. Recently, spectral backscattering coefficient measurements have been made using sensors deployed at moored observatories, on autonomous underwater vehicles, and even retrieved from space-based measurements of remote sensing reflectance. It has been suggested that these backscattering measurements may also be used to obtain information about the shape of the PSD. In this work, we directly compared field-measured PSD with multispectral beam attenuation and backscattering coefficients in a coastal bottom boundary later. The results of this comparison demonstrated that (1) the beam attenuation spectral slope correlates with the average particle size as suggested by theory for idealized particles and PSD; and (2) measurements of spectral backscattering also contain information reflective of the average particle size in spite of large deviations of the PSD from a spectral power law shape.

AB Legged robots have the potential to navigate in challenging terrain, and thus to exceed the mobility of wheeled vehicles. However, their control is more difficult as legged robots need to deal with foothold computation, leg trajectories and posture control in order to achieve successful navigation. In this paper, we present a new framework for the hydraulic quadruped robot HyQ, which performs goal-oriented navigation on unknown rough terrain using inertial measurement data and stereo-vision. This work uses our previously presented reactive controller framework with balancing control and extends it with visual feedback to enable closed-loop gait adjustment. On one hand, the camera images are used to keep the robot walking towards a visual target by correcting its heading angle if the robot deviates from it. On the other hand, the stereo camera is used to estimate the size of the obstacles on the ground plane and thus the terrain roughness. The locomotion controller then adjusts the step height and the velocity according to the size of the obstacles. This results in a robust and autonomous goal-oriented navigation over difficult terrain while subject to disturbances from the ground irregularities or external forces. Indoor and outdoor experiments with our quadruped robot show the effectiveness of this framework.

AB We discuss the problem of inspecting an underwater structure, such as a submerged ship hull, with an autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV). Unlike a large body of prior work, we focus on planning the views of the AUV to improve the quality of the inspection, rather than maximizing the accuracy of a given data stream. We formulate the inspection planning problem as an extension to Bayesian active learning, and we show connections to recent theoretical guarantees in this area. We rigorously analyze the benefit of adaptive re-planning for such problems, and we prove that the potential benefit of adaptivity can be reduced from an exponential to a constant factor by changing the problem from cost minimization with a constraint on information gain to variance reduction with a constraint on cost. Such analysis allows the use of robust, non-adaptive planning algorithms that perform competitively with adaptive algorithms. Based on our analysis, we propose a method for constructing 3D meshes from sonar-derived point clouds, and we introduce uncertainty modeling through non-parametric Bayesian regression. Finally, we demonstrate the benefit of active inspection planning using sonar data from ship hull inspections with the Bluefin-MIT Hovering AUV.

AB n recent years, unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)remote sensing has developed rapidly in the field of farml and information monitoring. Real-time and accurate access to farm-land information and crop growth dynamics is a prerequisite for the implementation of precision agriculture. Machine learning identifies existing knowledge to acquire new knowledge, promotes the development of Artificial Intelligence, and brings a large number of data training sets for machine learning. This arti-cle aims to ensure the safe operation of agricultural information systems and guarantee the data security of intelligent agricul-ture. The machine learning method explores the wireless network deployment of the UAV system. The geographical location deploy-ment of agricultural information security can effectively carryout rapid security detection of agricultural information security.First, the UAV-assisted information acquisition system was stud-ied. Besides, a double deepQ-network (DDQN) algorithm for location deployment based on geography position information(GPI) was proposed to quickly optimize the deployment loca-tion of UAVs. GPI can avoid the complicated calculation process of channel state information. The DDQN algorithm was intro-duced to obtain the functional relationship between the GPIand the optimal UAV deployment position, forming a new GPI-Learning strategy. In addition, the convolutional neural network(CNN) and long short-term memory (LSTM) are integrated asthe CNN-LSTM algorithm to build the intrusion detection systemfor Agricultural Internet of Things (AIoT) for agriculture. In the integrated network structure of the system, LSTM is responsible for data transmission, and CNN is capable of network model building. Combined with the influence of various parameters onthe performance of the UAV deployment location algorithm, the simulation experiment set the population size as 36, the discov-ery probability as 0.25, the step scaling factor as 0.8, and theLevy flight index as 1.25. The network throughput performanceof the GPI-Learning algorithm combined with cuckoo search wasbetter than other algorithms under different numbers of UAVs.On the KDD-CUP99 data set, the accuracy and detection rate ofthe AIoT intrusion detection system based on the CNN+LSTMalgorithm reached 93.5% and 94.4%, respectively. In general,the AIoT intrusion detection system reported here has crucialpractical reference value for the safe operation of agriculturalinformation systems.

AB The shuttle-based storage/retrieval system (SBS/RS) is a new type of automatic warehouse system. More and more enterprises choose it because of its dense storage structure, small footprint, high efficiency, and many other advantages. Each enterprise has different requirements for system efficiency, the number of storage units, and the size of the warehouse. It makes sense to study the design of the minimum cost Shuttle-Based Storage/Retrieval System under the limitation of warehouse space size to meet enterprise requirements on the number of cargos and enterprise needs on system efficiency. An optimization model to minimize the system cost is established, and a heuristic algorithm is designed in this paper. Through the experiment, we identified that different system selection schemes and the configuration of facilities in the system under different throughput capacity requirements. The relationship between the system's total cost, unit cost, and design scheme of the system is found. This study can guide designers and planners to design a more reasonable system. Under the different needs of enterprises, build a Shuttle-Based Storage/Retrieval System with the lowest cost.

AB The complex aerodynamic changes of the tilt-rotor UAV (TRUAV) in the transition process show strong nonlinearity, which brings a great impact on the stability of the vehicle attitude. This study aims to design a PPO-based RL controller for attitude control in the transition process. A reinforcement-learning PPO approach is used to learn the control strategy by interacting directly with the environment. And the reward function is designed and improved for the transition process. The performance of the proposed controller is tested and compared by simulation. The results show that the PPO algorithm is more suitable for the tilt-rotor transition process control than the A2C algorithm. Our proposed reward function improves the attitude control performance and the designed RL controller has good adaptability to changes in the takeoff weight, the diagonal wheelbase and the tilt rate. This study highlights the effectiveness and potential of reinforcement learning for tilt-rotor UAV transition process attitude control. These findings contribute to the advancement of autonomous flight systems by providing insights into the application of reinforcement learning algorithms. These results have important implications for the development of intelligent flight control systems and could guide future research in this area.

TI Estimation of Azimuth Angle Using an Ultrasonic Sensor for Automobile

AB A typical ultrasonic sensor has a major lobe that extends beyond 45 degrees. Because the wide beam of the ultrasonic sensor's main lobe, which is used for straightforward distance measurement, has a low angular resolution, conventional methods such as incidence angle and linear angle measurements cannot accurately determine the azimuthal angle. Determining whether one or more objects are present in a single beam is also challenging. In this study, the azimuthal angles of two or more objects placed beneath a single beam are determined by the Doppler frequency shift. An ultrasonic sensor is mounted on an automobile to transmit and receive an ultrasound when the car moves towards stationary objects. The sensor picks up the object's reflected Doppler shift signal. The azimuth angle of the objects is determined by estimating the received Doppler shift signal using a standard signal processing method. Near-field motion detection systems and autonomous driving heavily rely on the ability to evaluate the azimuthal angle of objects in a vehicle's surroundings using the Doppler Effect. These are examples of low-cost technology and active safety, which the experimental results support. Based on the results and error estimation, there is an average error of less than 3% between measured and computed values.

AB Radar-based gesture recognition can play a vital role in autonomous vehicles' interaction with vulnerable road users (VRUs). However, in automotive scenarios the same gesture produces strongly differing radar responses owing to the wide range of variations such as position, orientation, or ego-motion. Since including all kinds of modifications in a measured dataset is laborious, gesture simulations alleviate the measurement effort and increase the robustness against edge and corner cases. Hence, this article presents a flexible geometric human target model allowing the direct introduction of a wide range of modifications, while it facilitates the handling of shadowing effects and multiradar constellations. Using the proposed simulation model, a dataset recorded with a radar sensor network consisting of three chirp sequence (CS) radars is resimulated based on the motion data simultaneously captured with a stereo video system. Completely substituting the measured by the simulated data for training, a convolutional neural network (CNN) classifier still achieves 80.4% cross-validation accuracy on a challenging gesture set, compared with 89.4% for training on the measured data. Moreover, using the simulated data the classifier is shown to successfully generalize to new scenarios not observed in measurements.

AB Advanced driver-assistance system features in current vehicles (as precursor to fully autonomous, connected vehicular systems) will rely on 5G network links. Specifically, enabling various real-time operational aspects (e.g. emergency messaging), performance of ultra-reliable low-latency communications (URLLC) specified by 3GPP Release 16 is of direct relevance. A key challenge in achieving URLLC goals is the natural tension between simultaneously achieving high reliability (low block error rate or BLER) and low latency. When operating in a dynamic (i.e. significant time-varying channels due to vehicular mobility) environment, link adaptation is fundamental to URLLC implementation. In this paper, we introduce a new Markov Chain model for link adaptation that predicts the three key performance indicators (KPIs): end-to-end link latency, throughput and BLER as a function of the modulation and coding scheme used. The predictions from the Markov Chain model are supported by Monte Carlo simulations for various mobility scenarios, to explore how 5G network parameters may be adapted to achieve desired benchmarks, e.g. maximizing link throughput while providing strict latency and BLER bounds.

AB An immense body of research has focused on path-planning and following of wheeled robots in unstructured surfaces. Nonholonomic robots traveling over deformable terrains together with complex operating conditions, however, pose further challenges in terms of a higher demand for robustness and optimality. In this paper, a Chaos-enhanced Accelerated Particle Swarm Optimization (CAPSO) algorithm is employed for planning an optimal path of a wheeled robot, so as to ensure shortest path from the starting point to the target location together with safety through guaranteed avoidance of collisions with static and dynamic obstacles. The fundamental terramechanics concepts are employed to derive essential forces and moments acting on the wheeled robot. Subsequently, a kineto-dynamic model of the robot is developed for designing a novel robust control algorithm based on an exponential-integral-sliding mode (EISMC) scheme and a RBF-NN approximator. The results revealed that the proposed algorithm is responsive and robust to withstand adverse effects of structured and unstructured uncertainties by using the designed adaptation law according to the Lyapunov stability theorem. The effectiveness of the proposed algorithm is also validated against several reported frameworks. (c) 2020 ISTVS. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

ID TRANSMISSION; RADIO
AB With the consolidation of the Internet of Things (IoT), the unmanned aerial vehicle- (UAV-) based IoT has attracted much attention in recent years. In the IoT, cognitive UAV can not only overcome the problem of spectrum scarcity but also improve the communication quality of the edge nodes. However, due to the generation of massive and redundant IoT data, it is difficult to realize the mutual understanding between UAV and ground nodes. At the same time, the performance of the UAV is severely limited by its battery capacity. In order to form an autonomous and energy-efficient IoT system, we investigate semantically driven cognitive UAV networks to maximize the energy efficiency (EE). The semantic device model for cognitive UAV-assisted IoT communication is constructed. And the sensing time, the flight speed of UAV, and the coverage range of UAV communication are jointly optimized to maximize the EE. Then, an efficient alternative algorithm is proposed to solve the optimization problem. Finally, we provide computer simulations to validate the proposed algorithm. The performance of the joint optimization scheme based on the proposed algorithm is compared to some benchmark schemes. And the simulation results show that the proposed scheme can obtain the optimal system parameters and can significantly improve the EE.

AB In recent years, deep learning and computer vision have been applied to solve complex problems across many domains. In urban studies, these technologies have been instrumental in the development of smart cities and autonomous vehicles. However, a knowledge gap is present when it comes to informal urban regions in less developed countries. How can deep learning and artificial intelligence untangle the complexities of informality to advance urban modelling? In this paper, we introduce a framework for multipurpose realistic-dynamic urban modelling using deep convolutional neural networks. The purpose of the framework is twofold: (1) to sense and detect informality and slums in urban scenes from aerial and street-level images and (2) to detect pedestrian and transport modes. The model has been trained on images of urban scenes in cities across the globe. The framework shows strong validation performance in the identification of planned and unplanned regions, despite broad variations in the classified images. The algorithms of the URBAN-i model are coded in Python and the trained models can be applied to images of any urban setting, including informal settlements and slum regions.

AB Rear-end collision prediction has gained an increasing attention for safety improvement in smart cities. It is urgent to design efficient warning strategies for rear-end collisions which is one of the main causes of traffic accidents. The existing researches have been conducted to predict the collisions. Learning-based methods are proposed to solve this complicated issue, which the traditional methods are difficult to solve. However, due to some limitations in terms of the feature extraction and prediction performance, back-propagation learning methods are facing challenge. In this paper, we proposed a novel Rear-end Collision Prediction Mechanism with deep learning method (RCPM), in which a convolutional neural network model is established. In RCPM, the dataset is smoothed and expanded based on genetic theory to alleviate the class imbalance problem. The preprocessed dataset is divided into training and testing sets as the input to train our convolutional neural network model. The experimental results show that compared with the Honda, Berkeley and multi-layer perception neural-network-based algorithms, RCPM effectively improves performance to predict rear-end collisions.

AB With the recent demands for more efficient clean renewable energy sources, wind turbines are designed that have large rotor blade diameters. These large-sized wind turbines need to be periodically monitored to prevent catastrophic failures. This paper aims to develop a practice for obtaining the vibration characteristics of wind turbine blades that can be eventually used for structural health monitoring of these structures. This monitoring technique needs to be robust and non-contact to prevent any interference with the operation of the wind turbine. In this work, a digital image correlation (DIC) system installed on a drone is used as a sensing technique to obtain the dynamic characteristics of rotating wind turbine blades. The DIC uses a stereo-camera system to record the deflections of the blades and provides non-contact measurements. The unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) enables on-site robust measurements. Furthermore, a dynamic stitching technique is used after DIC measurement to obtain vibration characteristics of the entire blade with high accuracy. The proposed health monitoring technique can be used by engineers for remote structural health monitoring of wind turbines during operation in both offshore and inland wind farms.

AB The shuttle-based storage and retrieval system (SBS/RS) is a relatively new part-to-picker order picking system. We have developed a performance estimation and design algorithm for the SBS/RS. The performance estimation is based on a queuing model. The design algorithm aims to find the minimum cost configurations in terms of number of tiers, aisles, lifts and workstations with given throughput, tote capacity and order cycle time requirements. We used simulation driven by parameters abstracted from an actual SBS/RS to verify the performance estimation, and applied the design algorithm in the case study. The results indicate that: (1) compared to simulation results, the throughput of the performance estimation is nearly identical when the arrival rate is below the maximum capacity; (2) the design algorithm yields a configuration with 28.1% cost reduction in the current system. In addition, we also compared the shuttle system with the competing robotic order fulfilment system (robotic system in short) in terms of facility cost, building cost and order cycle time. We found that the shuttle system is a better choice if large storage capacity and high throughput are required whereas the robotic order fulfilment system performs better if small storage capacity and low throughput are required.

AB An autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) is used for exploring marine resources and monitoring infrastructure facilities. Because an AUV is powered by batteries, it needs to be lifted out of the water to have them replaced or recharged. Thus, wirelessly feeding power to an AUV under the sea would improve the efficiency of marine activities. However, it is difficult to wirelessly power an object under the sea because seawater has high conductivity. We examine the electromagnetic field in lossy materials such as a conductor, a coil cover, and seawater. We design a wireless magnetic resonance-based power transfer system with multiple coils using bandpass filter (BPF) theory. The coil structure is sealed so that water cannot enter it. We perform experiments on this system completely immersed in seawater and measure the coil coupling coefficient, efficiency, and wattage. The results confirm wireless power transfer exceeding a distance of 10 m in an undersea setting. We verify the transmission efficiency by changing the receiving-coil position on the central axis of the transfer coils. Furthermore, we confirm a dependence on transfer on the order of 1 to 100 W.

SO IEEE ROBOTICS AND AUTOMATION LETTERS

DE Optimization and optimal control; robot safety; autonomous vehicle

ID NAVIGATION; STABILITY
AB Robots are entering an age of ubiquity, and to operate effectively, these systems must typically satisfy a series of constraints (e.g., collision avoidance, obeying speed limits, maintaining connectivity). In addition, modern applications hinge on the completion of particular tasks, such as driving to a certain location or monitoring a crop patch. The dichotomy between satisfying constraints and completing objectives creates a need for constraint-satisfaction frameworks that are composable with a pre-existing primary objective. Barrier functions have recently emerged as a practical and the composable method for constraint satisfaction, and prior results demonstrate a system of Boolean logic for nonsmooth barrier functions as well as a composable controller-synthesis framework; however, this prior work does not consider dynamically changing constraints (e.g., a robot sensing and avoiding an obstacle). Consequently, the main theoretical contribution of this letter extends nonsmooth barrier functions to time-varying barrier functions with jumps. In a practical instantiation of the theoretical main results, this letter revisits a classic problem by formulating a collision-avoidance framework and composing it with a nominal controller. Experimental results show the efficacy of this framework on a light detection and ranging (LIDAR)-equipped differential-drive robot in a real-time obstacle-avoidance scenario.

DT Article
ID MILLIMETER-WAVE; NETWORKS; IMPACT
AB Vehicular communications essentially support automotive applications for safety and infotainment. For this reason, industry leaders envision an enhanced role for vehicular communications in the fifth generation of mobile communications technology. Over the years, the number of vehicle-mounted sensors has increased steadily, which potentially leads to more volume of critical data communications in a short time. Also, emerging applications such as remote/autonomous driving and infotainment such as high-definition movie streaming require data-rates on the order of multiple Gb/s. Such high data rates require a large system bandwidth, but very limited bandwidth is available in the sub-6 GHz cellular bands. This has sparked research interest in the millimeter wave (mmWave) band (10 GHz-300 GHz), where a large bandwidth is available to support the high data rate and low latency communications envisioned for emerging vehicular applications. However, leveraging mmWave communications requires a thorough understanding of the relevant vehicular propagation channels, which are significantly different from those investigated below 6 GHz. Despite their significance, very few investigations of mmWave vehicular channels are reported in the literature. This work highlights the key attributes of mmWave vehicular communication channels and surveys the recent literature on channel characterization efforts in order to provide a gap analysis and propose possible directions for future research.

AB This paper presents a contribution to the problem of obtaining an optimal synthesis for shortest paths for a unicycle guided by an on-board limited Field-Of-View (FOV) sensor, which must keep a given landmark in sight. Previous works on this subject have provided an optimal synthesis for the case in which the FOV is limited in the horizontal directions (H-FOV, i.e., left and right boundaries). In this paper we study the complementary case in which the FOV is limited only in the vertical direction (V-FOV, i.e., upper and lower boundaries). With respect to the H-FOV case, the vertical limitation is all but a simple extension. Indeed, not only the geometry of extremal arcs is different, but also a more complex structure of the synthesis is revealed by analysis. We will indeed show that there exist initial configurations for which the optimal path does not exist. In such cases, we provide an epsilon-optimal path whose length approximates arbitrarily well any other shorter path. Finally, we provide a partition of the motion plane in regions such that the optimal or epsilon-optimal path from each point in that region is univocally determined.

AB Tractor-trailer systems have been widely used to increase load transportation capacity. Control of these systems started from motion aid facilities in human-driven vehicles, to fully autonomous mobile robots in recent years. In fact, tractor-trailer wheeled robot (TTWR) has been proposed as a modular robotic system in which an actuated mobile robot tows (a) passive trailer(s). The mobility of such highly non-linear systems is restricted due to the presence of non-holonomic constraints of wheels, also the system severe underactuated nature. These conditions generate major difficulties in system stabilization, i.e., to park or reach a given configuration for the overall system. This leads to a challenging control problem for research that is the focus of this paper. To this end, dynamics model of the TTWR is first developed. Next, a switching kinematic controller is designed to stabilize the system around a desired configuration. The proposed kinematic control algorithm is developed based on switching between several finite-time controllers. Then, a non-model-based dynamics controller is developed to produce actuator torques, which demands low computations for real-time implementations. Experimental results reveal the merits of the proposed controller that could be a promising efficient controller for corresponding industrial applications.

DT Article
DE underwater image analysis; pattern recognition; machine learning
AB Marine researchers continue to create large quantities of benthic images e.g., using AUVs (Autonomous Underwater Vehicles). In order to quantify the size of sessile objects in the images, a pixel-to-centimeter ratio is required for each image, often indirectly provided through a geometric laser point (LP) pattern, projected onto the seafloor. Manual annotation of these LPs in all images is too time-consuming and thus infeasible for nowadays data volumes. Because of the technical evolution of camera rigs, the LP's geometrical layout and color features vary for different expeditions and projects. This makes the application of one algorithm, tuned to a strictly defined LP pattern, also ineffective. Here we present the web-tool DELPHI, that efficiently learns the LP layout for one image transect/collection from just a small number of hand labeled LPs and applies this layout model to the rest of the data. The efficiency in adapting to new data allows to compute the LPs and the pixel-to-centimeter ratio fully automatic and with high accuracy. DELPHI is applied to two real-world examples and shows clear improvements regarding reduction of tuning effort for new LP patterns as well as increasing detection performance.

AB It has been discussed in the literature that the mobility of a mobile sensor network (MSN) can be used to improve its sensing coverage. How the mobility can efficiently be managed toward a better coverage, however, remains unanswered. In this paper, motivated by classical dynamics that study the movement of objects, we propose the concept of network dynamics and define the associated potential functions that capture the operational goals, as well as the environment of an MSN. We find that in managing the mobility of an MSN, Newton's laws of motion in classical dynamics are insufficient, for they introduce oscillations into the movement of sensor nodes. Instead, in network dynamics, the laws of motion are formulated using the steepest descent method in optimization. Based on the network dynamics model, we first devise a parallel and distributed algorithm (Parallel and Distributed Network Dynamics (PDND)) that runs on each sensor node to guide its movement. PDND then turns sensor nodes into autonomous entities that are capable of adjusting their locations according to the operational goals and environmental changes. After that, we formally prove the convergence of PDND. Finally, we apply PDND in three applications to demonstrate its effectiveness.

AB Artificial Intelligence (AI) is being increasingly implemented within road transport systems worldwide. Next generation of AI, Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) is imminent, and is anticipated to be more powerful than current AI. AGI systems will have a broad range of abilities and be able to perform multiple cognitive tasks akin to humans that will likely produce many expected benefits, but also potential risks. This study applied the EAST Broken Links approach to forecast the functioning of an AGI system tasked with managing a road transport system and identify potential risks. In total, 363 risks were identified that could have adverse impacts on the stated goals of safety, efficiency, environmental sustainability, and economic performance of the road system. Further, risks beyond the stated goals were identified; removal from human control, mismanaging public relations, and self-preservation. A diverse set of systemic controls will be required when designing, implementing, and operating future advanced technologies.Practitioner summary: This study demonstrated the utility of HFE methods for formally considering risks associated with the design, implementation, and operation of future technologies. This study has implications for AGI research, design, and development to ensure safe and ethical AGI implementation.

AB Efficient exploration strategies are vital in tasks such as search-and-rescue missions and disaster surveying. Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) have become particularly popular in such applications, promising to cover large areas at high speeds. Moreover, with the increasing maturity of onboard UAV perception, research focus has been shifting toward higher-level reasoning for multi-robot missions. However, autonomous navigation and exploration of previously unknown large spaces still constitute an open challenge, especially when the environment is cluttered and exhibits large and frequent occlusions due to high obstacle density, as is the case of forests. Moreover, the problem of long-distance wireless communication in such scenes can become a limiting factor, especially when automating the navigation of a UAV fleet. In this spirit, this work proposes an exploration strategy that enables multiple UAVs to quickly explore complex scenes in a decentralized fashion. By providing the decision-making capabilities to each UAV to switch between different execution modes, the proposed strategy is shown to strike a great balance between cautious exploration of yet completely unknown regions and more aggressive exploration of smaller areas of unknown space. This results in full coverage of forest areas in multi-UAV setups up to 30% faster than the state of the art.

ID OBJECT DETECTION; ASSIGNMENT
AB Multi-object tracking technology plays a crucial role in many applications, such as autonomous vehicles and security monitoring. This paper proposes a multi-object tracking framework based on the multi-modal information of 3D point clouds and color images. At each sampling instant, the 3D point cloud and image acquired by a LiDAR and a camera are fused into a color point cloud, where objects are detected by the Point-GNN method. And, a novel height-intensity-density (HID) image is constructed from the bird's eye view. The HID image truly reflects the shapes and materials of objects and effectively avoids the influence of object occlusion, which is helpful to object tracking. In two sequential HID images, a new rotation kernel correlation filter is proposed to predict the objects. Furthermore, an object retention module and an object re-recognition module are developed to overcome the object matching failure in the in-between frames. The proposed method takes full advantage of the multi-modal data and effectively achieves the information complementation to improve the accuracy of multi-object tracking. The experiments with the KITTI dataset show that the proposed method has the best performance among the existing traditional multi-object tracking methods.

DT Article
DE PSO; ABC; terrain-aided navigation
AB Position errors of inertial navigation systems (INS) increase over time after long-term voyages of the autonomous underwater vehicle. Terrain-aided navigation (TAN) can effectively reduce the accumulated error of the INS. However, traditional TAN algorithms require a long positioning time and need better positioning accuracy, and nonmatching and mismatching are prone to occur, especially when the initial position error is large. To solve this problem, a new algorithm combining the artificial bee colony (ABC) and particle swarm optimization (PSO) was proposed according to the principle of terrain matching, to improve the matching effect. Considering that PSO easily falls into a local optimum, the acceleration factor and inertia weight of PSO were improved. The improved PSO was called WAPSO. ABC was introduced based on WAPSO and could help WAPSO escape local optimum. The final algorithm was termed ABC search-based WAPSO (F-WAPSO). During the continuous iteration of particles, F-WAPSO seeks the optimal position for the particles. Simulation tests show that F-WAPSO can effectively improve the matching accuracy. When the initial position error is 1000 m, the matching error can be reduced to 93.5 m, with a matching time of only 13.7 s.

AB Intelligent Transportation System (ITS) is continuously evolving alongside communication technologies and autonomous driving, giving way to new applications and services. Considering the significant rise in traffic casualties, protecting vulnerable road users (VRU), such as pedestrians, cyclists, motorcycles, animals, etc., has become ever more critical. That said, technological advances alone can not meet the requirements of such crucial applications. Therefore, combining them with architectural revolutions, particularly cloud, fog, and edge computing, is essential. In this review, we scrutinize the VRU safety application with regard to technological evolution. This review establishes the foundations for designing resilient, more reliable, end-to-end VRU protection services. It illustrates the possibility of combining the performance of different technologies through exploiting 5G architectural advantages (function placement, direct/indirect communication, etc.) for the intended application. In the context of 5G architecture, collision avoidance systems consider network and application-related challenges and solutions. This survey provides standardization, studies, and project efforts related to the use case and considers the different types of messages in the V2VRU communication-based safety application. We investigate how adapting the application parameters to the network state and devices' available resources can use network resources efficiently and provide reliable services.

AB Diver-robot interaction is an exciting and recent field of study. There are different ways a diver and robot can interact, such as using tablets or detecting divers with cameras or sonars. A novel approach presented in this paper uses direct diver-robot communication. To facilitate communication for humans, we use typical diver gestures, which are transmitted to a robot using a wearable glove and acoustic communications. Following previous work by the University of Zagreb and the University of Auckland, a collaboration to control an autonomous under-water vehicle based on a wearable diver glove has been made possible through the EU Marine Robots project. Under this project, Trans-National Access trials allow Laboratory for Underwater Systems and Technologies, University of Zagreb, to offer its robots and infrastructure to external partners. Initial trials with the University of Auckland, which were planned to take place on site, were transformed into remote access trials. This paper reports on these challenging trials and collaboration given the distance and time zone difference. The key point is to demonstrate the possibility of having a diver remotely controlling a robot using typical gestures recognized by a wearable glove and transmitted via acoustic modems (and the Internet for the remote connection).

ID DOCKING
AB In this paper, an optical guiding and docking scheme is designed, and a node integrating laser positioning guidance and communication functions is developed. Through experiments, it is verified that the laser docking system has the function of guiding and communicating the autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) with the support of the seabed observation network. It can provide two-dimensional position information for underwater platforms to navigate the media to sea network nodes and enable visual contact between them. The integrated terminals are small enough (6 cm in diameter) to be installed on small underwater platforms, such as AUVs. To safely work at a depth of thousands of meters, the devices have cylindrical shapes rather than spherical shapes. However, the cylindrical shell confines the view angle of the receiver. An optical system and a photodiode array are adopted to enlarge the cylindrical-shaped receiver's view angle. The positioning algorithm is designed based on the optical lens system and the photodiode array. In a small-pool experiment, this system is tested to achieve a data rate of 1 Mbit/s at a distance of 4 m. Positioning algorithms are also confirmed preliminarily in the small-pool experiment, and the error of the positioning algorithm is discussed. (C) 2022 Optica Publishing Group

AB The main advantage of the incremental dynamics formulation is its property of replacing state-dependent aspects of the system dynamics by measurements, solely requiring modeling the input-dependent dynamics. However, incremental controllers assume that state derivative measurements are available. The lack of accurate sensors and communication delay may appear as limitations for the use of incremental techniques. This article applies a second-order differentiator (SOD) for estimating state derivatives and attenuate measurement noise, and an input scaling gain (ISG) for attenuating the effects of high-frequency noise and delay in the feedback loop. A complete analysis of the combined solution is carried out using an incremental nonlinear dynamic inversion (INDI) strategy. First, a simple linear single-input single-output model is used to evaluate the influence of design parameters in the closed-loop response and stability. Then, the combined SOD and ISG approach is illustrated in a more complex case application, where INDI is used to control the lateral motion of an autonomous airship, results of which corroborate the ISG as an asset to increase the maximum delay allowed in the feedback loop.

TI Path Optimization Model for Urban Transportation Networks under the
   Perspective of Environmental Pollution Protection
SO JOURNAL OF ADVANCED TRANSPORTATION
LA English
DT Article
ID AUTONOMOUS UNDERWATER VEHICLE; PLANNING METHOD
AB In view of the lack of consideration of environmental protection performance in the traditional path optimization model, a path optimization model for urban traffic networks from the perspective of environmental pollution protection is proposed. Firstly, the urban real-time traffic condition is expressed by the road traffic state index, and an integer programming model is established to optimize the route with the goal of low carbon and shortest distribution time. Then, a hybrid particle swarm optimization algorithm combined with adaptive disturbance mechanism based on variable neighborhood descent is designed, which can better carry out adaptive disturbance according to the situation that the population falls into local extreme value, and the 2-opt local search method is introduced to improve the quality of solution. Finally, the improved particle swarm optimization algorithm is used to solve the two-objective model to obtain the Pareto front solution set, that is, the path scheme under real-time traffic conditions. The experimental demonstration of the proposed model based on two application scenarios shows that its distribution cost, distribution time, and carbon emission are 1975 yuan, 27 h, and 213 kg, respectively, which are better than other comparison models and have high application value.

AB Modern lidar sensors are continuing to decrease in size, weight, and cost, but the demand for fast, abundant, and high-accuracy lidar observations is only increasing. The Livox Mid-40 lidar sensor was designed for use within sense-and-avoid navigation systems for autonomous vehicles, but has also found adoption within aerial mapping systems. In order to characterize the overall quality of the point clouds from the Mid-40 sensor and enable sensor calibration, a rigorous model of the sensor's raw observations is needed. This paper presents the development of an angular observation model for the Mid-40 sensor, and its application within an extended Kalman filter that uses the sensor's data to estimate the model's operating parameters, systematic errors, and the instantaneous prism rotation angles for the Risley prism optical steering mechanism. The analysis suggests that the Mid-40's angular observations are more accurate than the specifications provided by the manufacturer. Additionally, it is shown that the prism rotation angles can be used within a planar constrained least-squares adjustment to theoretically improve the accuracy of the angular observations of the Mid-40 sensor.

AB This article investigates the problem of deploying a swarm of UAVs equipped with gas sensors for industrial remote gas-plume sensing. This setup's objective is to continuously adjust the swarm formation to maximize the combined perception for the dynamically evolved plume's cloud, focusing around areas with the highest concentration/intensity. Initially, such a setup is formulated into an optimization problem, the solution of which could be acquired by the maximization of an appropriately defined objective function. Due to the model-free approach, this objective function's analytical form is not available, prohibiting standard gradient descent methodologies. To this end, a tracking algorithm is developed and studied, which operates in a distributed manner and enables the UAV swarm to build a common consensus dynamically, during the evolution of the leakage phenomenon. The overall performance is tested in a simulative yet realistic environment using ANSYS Fluent suite, considering a simultaneous gas leak incident at two different points. Aside from the standalone evaluation study, the proposed gas-plume tracking scheme is able to outperform a state-of-the-art alternative algorithm, namely Efficient Global Optimization (EGO), in various simulation setups, deploying a different number of UAVs on the field.

AB The challenges of deploying robots and autonomous vehicles call for further efforts to bridge the gap between the robotics, the real-time systems and the formal methods communities. Indeed, with robots being more and more involved in costly missions and contact with humans, a rigorous formal verification of their behavior in the presence of various real-time constraints is crucial. In order to increase our trust in its results, such verification should be carried out on models that are as close as possible to reality, and thus take into account hardware and OS specificities such as the number of cores provided by the robotic platform and the scheduling policy. In this paper, we propose a novel binary-search-inspired technique that allows to extend timed automata models of robotic specifications with dynamic-priority schedulers. Given a number of cores, the extended models can then be checked against various real-time and behavioral properties, including schedulability, within the same model checking framework. Our technique is implemented in an automatic translation from a robotic framework to UPPAAL, and evaluated on a real robotic case study, where it shows a significant gain in scalability as opposed to the counting technique used in the literature.

AB An adaptive relative pose controller for docking ports of two uncertain spacecraft in autonomous rendezvous and docking is developed. A novel relative translational and rotational model represented in the chaser body-fixed frame is derived first based on the classical Newton-Euler equations. Based on the proposed model, a six-degrees-of-freedom adaptive control law is presented based on norm-wise estimations for the unknown parameters of two spacecraft to decrease the online computational burden. Meanwhile, an adaptive robust control input is designed by introducing an exponential function of states to improve the response performance with respect to the traditional adaptive robust control. Moreover, a linear antiwindup compensator is employed to ensure the bounded performance of the control inputs. The explicit tuning rules for designing parameters are derived based on the stability analysis of the closed-loop system. It is proved in Lyapunov framework that all closed-loop signals are always bounded and the pose tracking error ultimately converges to a small neighborhood of zero. Simulation results validate the performance of the proposed robust adaptive control strategy.

AB Inspired by the ubiquitous lateral-line system of fish which plays an essential role in flow sensing and object detection, this paper presents a new sensor consisting of a radial field piezoelectric diaphragm in d(33) mode and a high aspect ratio pillar. Finite element analysis was conducted to simulate the in-plane poling released by inter-circulating electrodes and the vibration behavior of the sensor. Prototypes were fabricated by microfabrication combined with 3D printing. Impedance spectrums were examined to characterize the dynamic behaviors of the sensor. By utilizing a vibrating sphere to imitate the underwater disturbances, the performance of the sensor in sensing oscillatory flows was tested. Experimental results demonstrate that the sensor has a high sensitivity of 2.476 mV/(mm/s) and very good response ability to the low frequency hydrodynamic flow phenomena. Besides, the ability of the sensor in locating the vibrating sphere was illustrated. This sensor is miniaturized, light-weight, self-powered and low-cost. It provides a good prospect for the underwater sensing of autonomous underwater vehicles. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Rao-Blackwellized Particle Filters (RBPF) have been utilized to provide a solution to the SLAM problem. One of the main factors that cause RBPF failure is the potential particle impoverishment. Another popular approach to the SLAM problem are Scan Matching methods, whose good results require environments with lots of information, however fail in the lack thereof. To face these issues, in the current work techniques are presented to combine Rao-Blackwellized particle filters with a scan matching algorithm (CRSM SLAM). The particle filter maintains the correct hypothesis in environments lacking features and CRSM is employed in feature-rich environments while simultaneously reduces the particle filter dispersion. Since CRSM's good performance is based on its high iteration frequency, a multi-threaded combination is presented which allows CRSM to operate while RBPF updates its particles. Additionally, a novel method utilizing topological information is proposed, in order to reduce the number of particle filter resamplings. Finally, we present methods to address anomalous situations where scan matching can not be performed and the vehicle displays behaviors not modeled by the kinematic model, causing the whole method to collapse. Numerous experiments are conducted to support the aforementioned methods' advantages.

DT Article
ID COMMUNICATION; PERFORMANCE
AB Localization is one of the major aspects in underwater wireless sensor networks (UWSNs). Therefore, it is important to know the accurate position of the sensor node in large scale applications like disaster prevention, tactical surveillance, and monitoring. Due to the inefficiency of the global positioning system (GPS) in UWSN, it is very difficult to localize a node in underwater environment compared to terrestrial networks. To minimize the localization error and enhance the localization coverage of the network, two routing protocols are proposed; the first one is mobile autonomous underwater vehicle (MobiL-AUV) and the second one is cooperative MobiL (CO-MobiL). In MobiL-AUV, AUVs are deployed and equipped with GPS and act as reference nodes. These reference nodes are used to localize all the nonlocalized ordinary sensor nodes in order to reduce the localization error and maximize the network coverage. CO-MobiL is presented in order to improve the network throughput by using the maximal ratio combining (MRC) as diversity technique which combines both signals, received from the source and received from the relay at the destination. It uses amplify-and-forward (AF) mechanism to improve the signal between the source and the destination. To support our claims, extensive simulations are performed.

AB Vision-based road extraction is essentially important in many fields, such as for intelligent traffic and robot navigation. However, the road detection in urban or ill-structured roads is still very challenging at current stage, and the existing methods often suffer from high computational complexity. This paper reports a novel and efficient method for road detection in challenging scenes. First, the dark channel based image segmentation is proposed to distinguish a rough road region from complex background noise, which is envisioned to reduce the workload of road detection. Furthermore, instead of using the conventional pixel-wise soft voting, a new voting strategy based on the vanishing point and the properties of the segmented regions is proposed to further reduce the computation time of road extraction stage. Finally, the segmented region which has the maximum voting value is selected as the road region. Experimental results demonstrated that the proposed algorithm shows superior performance in different kinds of road scenes. It can remove the interference from pedestrians, vehicles and other obstacles. Our method is about 40 times faster in detection speed, when compared to a recently well-known approach.

ID AERIAL IMAGES; EXTRACTION
AB Lane-based road network information, such as lane geometry, destination, lane changing, and turning information, is important in vehicle navigation, driving assistance system, and autonomous driving. Such information, when available, is mainly input manually. However, manual methods for creating and updating data are not only costly but also time-consuming, labor-intensive, and prone to long delays. This paper proposes a hierarchical polygonization method for automatic generation and updating of lane-level road network data for navigation from a road marking database that is managed by government transport department created by digitizing or extraction from aerial images. The proposed method extends the hierarchy of a road structure from 'road-carriageway-lane' to 'road-carriageway-lane-basic lane'. Basic lane polygons are constructed from longitudinal road markings, and their associated navigational attributes, such as turning information and speed limit, are obtained from transverse road markings by a feature-in-polygon overlay approach. A hierarchical road network model and detailed algorithms are also illustrated in this paper. The proposed method can accelerate the process of generating and updating lane-level navigation information and can be an important component of a road marking information system for road management.

AB High-resolution magnetic surveys have been acquired over the partially sedimented Palinuro massive sulfide deposits in the Aeolian volcanic arc, Tyrrhenian Sea. Surveys flown close to the seafloor using an autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) show that the volcanic-arc-related basalt-hosted hydrothermal site is associated with zones of lower magnetization. This observation reflects the alteration of basalt affected by hydrothermal circulation and/or the progressive accumulation of a nonmagnetic deposit made of hydrothermal and volcaniclastic material and/or a thermal demagnetization of titanomagnetite due to the upwelling of hot fluids. To discriminate among these inferences, estimate the shape of the nonmagnetic deposit and the characteristics of the underlying altered areathe stockworkwe use high-resolution vector magnetic data acquired by the AUV Abyss (GEOMAR) above a crater-shaped depression hosting a weakly active hydrothermal site. Our study unveils a relatively small nonmagnetic deposit accumulated at the bottom of the depression and locked between the surrounding volcanic cones. Thermal demagnetization is unlikely but the stockwork extends beyond the limits of the nonmagnetic deposit, forming lobe-shaped zones believed to be a consequence of older volcanic episodes having contributed in generating the cones.

AB High-performance real-time stereo vision system is crucial to various stereo vision applications, such as robotics, autonomous vehicles, multiview video coding, freeview TV, and 3-D video conferencing. In this paper, we proposed a high-performance hardware-friendly disparity estimation algorithm called mini-census adaptive support weight (MCADSW) and also proposed its corresponding real-time very large scale integration (VLSI) architecture. To make the proposed MCADSW algorithm hardware-friendly, we proposed simplification techniques such as using mini-census, removing proximity weight, using YUV color representation, using Manhattan color distance, and using scaled-and-truncate weight approximation. After applied these simplifications, the MCADSW algorithm was not only hardware-friendly, but was also 1.63 times faster. In the corresponding realtime VLSI architecture, we proposed partial column reuse and access reduction with expanded window to significantly reduce the bandwidth requirement. The proposed architecture was implemented using United Microelectronics Corporation (UMC) 90 nm complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor technology and can achieve a disparity estimation frame rate of 42 frames/s for common intermediate format size images when clocked at 95 MHz. The synthesized gate-count and memory size is 563k and 21.3 kB, respectively.

AB A network of coastal observatories is being built around the United States. While the motivations for developing these systems do not originate from marine sanctuaries per se, the sanctuaries stand to gain an unprecedented opportunity to benefit from real-time data and nowcasting/forecasting models. The construction of the observatories is being fueled by the rapid development in three enabling observational technologies. These technologies include (1) data acquisition systems that track the international constellation of IR and ocean color satellites; (2) nested grids multi-static SeaSonde surface current radars; and (3) a growing fleet of autonomous underwater vehicles. These observational assets are coupled to nowcast/forecast data assimilative models. These systems will allow the mean behavior in marine ecosystems to be defined while also providing real-time data that will allow adaptive sampling. The ability to adoptively sample the environment will allow scientists to make shrewd decisions about when and where to sample. Given this, developing the new approaches to measure critical biological processes and the geographic boundaries of those processes should be a key focus for the marine biology community. This will alter how scientists approach scientific questions in coastal waters.

AB This paper proposes a novel efficient obstacle recognition system for helping the navigation of mobile robots, which is designed to operate in connection with agent-based control architectures (its insertion in the whole agent-based control system is exemplified). The capability of recognizing objects allows defining more complex behaviors to be programmed, as well as the association of different behaviors to distinct objects recognized by the robot A single CCD camera and a group of ultrasonic transducers responsible for activating the camera whenever the robot gets close to any obstacle compose the system here proposed, whose operation is characterized as a 2 1/2-D vision system. Although being simple and cheap, this system allows recognizing a set of meaningful objects present in the robot workspace, even when more than one object is present in the scene, like it is shown in the examples presented. A main feature regarding this system is also that all the sensorial data art? processed onboard the robot, and demands non intensive computation for interpreting the sensorial information. Finally, a control system including the recognition system here proposed is shown, whose objective is to guide the robot outside the lab, through a door the system recognizes.

AB High-resolution ocean temperature, salinity, current, and turbulence data were collected at an Arctic thermohaline front in the Nansen Basin. The front was close to the sea ice edge and separated the cold and fresh surface melt water from the warm and saline mixed layer. Measurements were made on 18 September 2018, in the upper 100m, from a research vessel and an autonomous underwater vehicle. Destabilizing surface buoyancy fluxes from a combination of heat loss to the atmosphere and cross-front Ekman transport by down-front winds reduced the potential vorticity in the upper ocean. Turbulence structure in the mixed layer was generally consistent with turbulence production through convection by heat loss to atmosphere and mechanical forcing by moderate winds. Conditions at the front were favorable for forced symmetric instability, a mechanism drawing energy from the frontal geostrophic current. A clear signature of increased dissipation from symmetric instability could not be identified; however, this instability could potentially account for the increased dissipation rates at the front location down to 40m depth that could not be explained by the atmospheric forcing. This turbulence was associated with turbulent heat fluxes of up to 10 Wm(-2), eroding the warm and cold intrusions observed between 30 and 60m depth. A Seaglider sampled across a similar frontal structure in the same region 10 days after our survey. The submesoscale-to-turbulence-scale transitions and resulting mixing can be widespread and important in the Atlantic sector of the Arctic Ocean.
   Plain Language Summary On 18 September 2018, high-resolution temperature, salinity, current, and turbulence data were collected near a surface temperature and salinity front in the Nansen Basin north of Svalbard, within the framework of the Nansen Legacy Project. Measurements were performed from the research icebreaker Kronprins Haakon and using an autonomous underwater vehicle. The front separates warm and salty Atlantic-origin waters from cold and fresh Arctic-origin waters. Energetic turbulence in the upper 30 m was consistent with convection by heat loss to the atmosphere and mechanical forcing by moderate winds at the surface of the ocean. At the front, the conditions were favorable for forced symmetric instability, a mechanism drawing energy from the large-scale current. The contribution to turbulence from this instability could not be clearly identified but can be potentially important. Such observations linking 1-3 km scales to turbulence in the Arctic Ocean are rare. Turbulence at a front in the Arctic has consequences on the heat and nutrient transport from the slope to the deep Arctic Basin. A Seaglider sampled across a similar frontal structure in the same region end of September 2018. Observed frontal structure and mixing processes can be common in the Atlantic sector of the Arctic Ocean.

AB A tidally driven alongshore flow on the western coast of O'ahu Hawai'i is examined using velocity measurements from an autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) along with time series observations of the alongshore pressure gradient. Depth-averaged velocities over the forereef shelf are reconstructed from AUV-based velocity observations as a function of cross-shore distance assuming a sinusoidal tidal periodicity. Ensemble phase averages of the alongshore pressure gradient and velocities from multiple AUV surveys reveal characteristics akin to an oscillatory boundary layer, with the nearshore flow leading the offshore flow in phase and with a corresponding velocity attenuation at shallower depths. Analysis of the depth-averaged alongshore momentum equation indicates that the cross-shore structure and evolution of the tidal boundary layer is well described by a balance between the local acceleration, the barotropic pressure gradient, and bottom drag. This primary balance allows estimation of the drag coefficient as a function of cross-shore distance over depths spanning from 24 to 6m. Results indicate that drag coefficients range from 0.004 to 0.010 [0.002] over a 600m cross-shore forereef section. These estimates are in good agreement with previous results obtained at the 12m isobath using fixed observations and compare favorably with roughness estimates from LIDAR and AUV-based mapping. Roughness data suggest that larger scales, with wavelengths of O(10m), play a more significant role than smaller meter-scale roughness in determining the drag on the tidal flow.
   Plain Language Summary Flow in the inner shelf region outside of the surf zone regulates cross-shelf transport of heat, mass, and momentum, affecting coastal distributions of larvae and nutrients as well as pollutants. This transport is strongly affected by the structure and variability in the predominantly alongshore flow and by turbulence driven by flow over the rough seabed. This study examines the cross-shore structure of the alongshore tidally driven flow for a coral forereef environment on the western coast of O'ahu, Hawai'i, using velocity measurements obtained using an autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) along with measurements of pressure and velocity from fixed, bottom-mounted instruments. The tidal periodicity of the flow allows a reconstruction of the spatial flow structure over an average tidal cycle which highlights strong frictional effects close to shore that weaken with distance from shore. The observed alongshore flow structure is well described by a simple momentum balance between pressure force, acceleration, and friction which yields estimates of the bottom drag coefficient as a function of cross-shore distance. Comparisons between cross-shore patterns in drag and bottom roughness indicate that the flow is best correlated with longer wavelength roughness (>20m).

AB Despite the COVID-19 pandemic, the current era offers the ultimate possibility for prosperous corporate life, especially in the transport sector. Industry 4.0 covers artificial intelligence, big data, or industrial IoT, and thus spatial cognition algorithms, traffic flow prediction, autonomous vehicles, and smart sustainable mobility are not far away. The mentioned tools have already been implemented by enterprises in emerging countries. This exploration focused on transportation within the V4 region from 2016-2021. This article aims to confirm the positive sequel of applying Industry 4.0 to chosen indicators of profitability. The positive, negative, or no shift in the development of 534 businesses was based on Pettitt's test. The Pearson chi-square test disclosed the significant dependency between Industry 4.0 and shifts in profitability ratios. Then, more than 25% of enterprises involved in Industry 4.0 had positive shifts in ROA, ROC, ROS, and ROR. The research proved not only its balanced effect but also its augmented force through the z-test of proportion. This investigation may provide multiple proofs for connected sectors with transportation to adapt the tools of Industry 4.0 and deliver the call for the governments in the V4 region to make this tool more achievable.

AB In modern applications such as robotics, autonomous vehicles, and speaker localization, the computational power for sound source localization applications can be limited when other functionalities get more complex. In such application fields, there is a need to maintain high localization accuracy for several sound sources while reducing computational complexity. The array manifold interpolation (AMI) method applied with the Multiple Signal Classification (MUSIC) algorithm enables sound source localization of multiple sources with high accuracy. However, the computational complexity has so far been relatively high. This paper presents a modified AMI for uniform circular array (UCA) that offers reduced computational complexity compared to the original AMI. The complexity reduction is based on the proposed UCA-specific focusing matrix which eliminates the calculation of the Bessel function. The simulation comparison is done with the existing methods of iMUSIC, the Weighted Squared Test of Orthogonality of Projected Subspaces (WS-TOPS), and the original AMI. The experiment result under different scenarios shows that the proposed algorithm outperforms the original AMI method in terms of estimation accuracy and up to a 30% reduction in computation time. An advantage offered by this proposed method is the ability to implement wideband array processing on low-end microprocessors.

AB Millimeter wave (MMW) communication, noted for its merit of wide bandwidth and high-speed transmission, is also a competitive implementation of the Internet of Everything (IoE). In an always-connected world, mutual data transmission and localization are the primary issues, such as the application of MMW application in autonomous vehicles and intelligent robots. Recently, artificial intelligence technologies have been adopted for the issues in the MMW communication domain. In this paper, MLP-mmWP, a deep learning method, is proposed to localize the user with respect to MMW communication information. The proposed method employs seven sequences of beamformed fingerprints (BFFs) to estimate localization, which includes line-of-sight (LOS) and non-line-of-sight (NLOS) transmissions. As far as we know, MLP-mmWP is the first method to apply the MLP-Mixer neural network to the task of MMW positioning. Moreover, experimental results in a public dataset demonstrate that MLP-mmWP outperforms the existing state-of-the-art methods. Specifically, in a simulation area of 400 x 400 m(2), the positioning mean absolute error is 1.78 m, and the 95th percentile prediction error is 3.96 m, representing improvements of 11.8% and 8.2%, respectively.

AB Fifth-generation (5G) cellular networks have led to the implementation of beyond 5G (B5G) networks, which are capable of incorporating autonomous services to swarm of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs). They provide capacity expansion strategies to address massive connectivity issues and guarantee ultra-high throughput and low latency, especially in extreme or emergency situations where network density, bandwidth, and traffic patterns fluctuate. On the one hand, 6G technology integrates AI/ML, IoT, and blockchain to establish ultra-reliable, intelligent, secure, and ubiquitous UAV networks. 6G networks, on the other hand, rely on new enabling technologies such as air interface and transmission technologies, as well as a unique network design, posing new challenges for the swarm of UAVs.Keeping these challenges in mind, this article focuses on the security and privacy, intelligence, and energy-efficiency issues faced by swarms of UAVs operating in 6G mobile network. In this state-of-the-art review, we integrated blockchain and AI/ML with UAV networks utilizing the 6G ecosystem. The key findings are then presented, and potential research challenges are identified. We conclude the review by shedding light on future research in this emerging field of research.

AB Recently, many studies have presented on realizing novel mobility technologies with consideration for aging society. The aim of these studies is to establish autonomous driving technology (ADT). The objects of ADT are mainly four-wheel motor vehicles. On the other hand, ADT for motorcycles has not been fully addressed yet. Motorcycles have straight-line stability in the state of high-speed driving. However, their stability tends to diminish when being driven at extremely low speed. This study addresses how a motorcycle should be stabilized under low-speed driving. From the viewpoint of actual use, including high-speed driving, major structural changes should be avoided. In order to obtain a linearized motorcycle model without skidding, a model based on SPACAR, a finite element method computation program, is introduced. Furthermore, velocity-dependent gain-scheduling control is applied to utilize the feedback control gains obtained by the linearized model with respect to velocity. Following the deceleration simulation success in the authors' previous paper, we mainly verify the experimental investigation of the above model and control system design. The gain-scheduling method is improved from that in the previous simulation study. The experimental responses show stable driving at 1.5 km/h.

AB The IPT system has been studied for underwater applications such as autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) and subsea sensors. However, it rarely comparatively shows the performance of the IPT system in air, freshwater, and seawater. Based on the fore-mentioned research background, this paper presents a survey of the properties of the IPT system in different mediums. Here, a 100 W power-level experimental IPT prototype is built and tested. The resonant frequency is set at 300 kHz with a gap range from 10 to 190 mm. The comparison is focused on the efficiency, mutual inductance, coupling coefficient, coil resistance, and quality factor of the IPT system. The IPT system is placed in air, freshwater, and seawater with the same settings. What's more, the magnetic fields of coupling coils in air, freshwater, and seawater are presented in this paper. This paper could be acted as a reference to optimize the IPT system and facilitate future IPT research for underwater applications by analysing the performance of the IPT system in different mediums. The 3D Ansys Maxwell simulation of the IPT system is also given here to study the magnetic fields.

Current applications mainly depend on single UAV operations, which face critical limitations such as mission range or resilience. Using several autonomous UAVs as a swarm is a promising approach to overcome these. However, designing an efficient swarm is a challenging task, since its global behaviour emerges solely from local decisions and interactions. These properties make classical multirobot design techniques not applicable, while evolutionary swarm robotics is typically limited to a single use case. This work, thus, proposes an automated swarming algorithm design approach, and more precisely, a generative hyper-heuristic relying on multi-objective reinforcement learning, that permits us to obtain not only efficient but also reusable swarming behaviours. Experimental results on a three-objective variant of the Coverage of a Connected UAV Swarm problem demonstrate that it not only permits one to generate swarming heuristics that outperform the state-of-the-art in terms of coverage by a swarm of UAVs but also provides high stability. Indeed, it is empirically demonstrated that the model trained on a certain class of instances generates heuristics and is capable of performing well on instances with a different size or swarm density.

AB In current decades, significant advancements in robotics engineering and autonomous vehicles have improved the requirement for precise depth measurements. Depth estimation (DE) is a traditional task in computer vision that can be appropriately predicted by applying numerous procedures. This task is vital in disparate applications such as augmented reality and target tracking. Conventional monocular DE (MDE) procedures are based on depth cues for depth prediction. Various deep learning techniques have demonstrated their potential applications in managing and supporting the traditional ill-posed problem. The principal purpose of this paper is to represent a state-of-the-art review of the current developments in MDE based on deep learning techniques. For this goal, this paper tries to highlight the critical points of the state-of-the-art works on MDE from disparate aspects. These aspects include input data shapes and training manners such as supervised, semi-supervised, and unsupervised learning approaches in combination with applying different datasets and evaluation indicators. At last, limitations regarding the accuracy of the DL-based MDE models, computational time requirements, real-time inference, transferability, input images shape and domain adaptation, and generalization are discussed to open new directions for future research.

AB This article presents an optimization-based control framework for the autonomous forced landing of a fixed-wing unmanned aircraft (UA). A two-level model-predictive control (MPC) scheme is proposed to realize this framework, where an economic model-predictive control (EMPC) in a long piecewise constant fashion is proposed at the high level, while a short fixed-horizon linear time-varying MPC at the low level responds to fast dynamics of UA and tracks the optimal path provided by the high-level controller, alleviating computational burden compared to the high-frequency single-layer MPC scheme. Compared with a single EMPC setup with high sampling frequency, this hierarchical EMPC controller can significantly reduce the computational complexity and make it feasible to be implemented in real time. In addition, it also responds to disturbances (e.g., wind) and aircraft fast dynamics in a timely manner. The recursive feasibility and stability of the high- and low-level MPC schemes are established. The performance of the proposed EMPC forced landing function is illustrated by simulation case studies on both Aerosonde and Skywalker X8, compared favorably with competing schemes.

AB Voice assistants have manifested their existence in the vehicle over the last decade. Further technological developments in the area of voice recognition and interactions with users open up the opportunity for new customer-centric user scenarios. In the following work, eight dialog use cases and two different interaction types were examined in detail. The focus of this work is to answer the research question to which extent do users prefer task-oriented multi-turn dialogs over the question-and-answer single-turn dialogs in certain driving situations. Employing a three-step online survey in 2020, participants were asked about their preferences for the assistant's interaction type, use case as well as the perceived usefulness and pleasantness. The authors found that users preferred multi-turn conversations over single-turn conversations for all defined use case scenarios. As further challenges for the future development of voice assistants in the automotive context, the changed driving situation due to e.g. progress in autonomous driving and the focus on an integration of the voice modality as a direct function should be considered.

AB Accurate 3D perception is vital for the localization of mobile robots and autonomous vehicles. Sparse 3D LIDAR scanners and 3D vision sensors (stereo and RGB-D cameras) are commonly used environment perception sensors. The former could provide accurate but sparse-range data, while the latter is dense but full of uncertainty. Since the acquired depth map by each sensor alone could not accurately perceive complex surrounding environment, an innovative probabilistic fusion model based on Bayesian Kriging (BK) is proposed for dense high-precision depth map estimation, to fully utilize the complementary characteristics of the two distinct sensors. Combing the geometric piece-wise planar hypotheses of the scene, the noisy disparity map from the 3D vision sensor is segmented into multiple small planes. In each segmented plane, the BK-based fusion estimator is founded to predict depth for each pixel with sparse scattered LIDAR points. In particular, we focus on analyzing the spatial variation prior and correlation between these two types of data, based on regionalized variable theory. Experiments on various scenes of KITTI stereo datasets are carried out to demonstrate the effectiveness of our algorithm, and validate the superiority compared with existing fusion methods.

AB The next-generation wireless networks are expected to support a number of computation-intensive and delay-sensitive applications such as virtual reality (VR), autonomous driving, telesurgery and unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs). Since many devices are computation and power limited, mobile edge computing (MEC) has been deemed as a promising way to enhance computation service. In this paper, we propose a novel cooperative MEC that exploits the combination of non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) and multiple helpers. In the proposed system featuring a user, multiple helpers and a base station (BS), the user can simultaneously offload its computation-intensive tasks to the helpers using NOMA when there is no strong direct transmission link between the user and the BS. Then, the helpers can compute and offload these tasks through NOMA. Thus, in the proposed scheme, the computation and offloading modes at the helpers are determined with respect to the optimized task offloading decision factor. The simulation results show that the proposed NOMA-based cooperative MEC significantly increases the total offloading data under the latency constraints compared to the benchmark schemes featuring one helper with strong direct transmission link.

AB In Underwater Wireless Sensor Network, for mobile target localization schemes, there exists long propagation delay of sensor nodes' messages. Further, the flexibility of node localization schemes to adapt in harsh underwater environment is the major issue. As propagation delay is one of the principal aspects that disturb the time harmonisation of underwater sensor nodes for communication. It must be adjusted to attain precise and accurate localization. In this article, we propose an energy-efficient localization scheme based on mobility and propagation delay prediction. Precise synchronization time is accomplished by forecasting the long propagation delay. Anchor node mobility prediction procedure is intended to analyse and record its speed at every localization period. Then, the propagation delay is compensated to attain rapid reporting of localization. The ordinary nodes make localization, utilizing the expected speed vectors obtained from the anchor nodes. The proposed scheme is tested in simulator NS-2.30 all-in-one with multiple runs and average of these runs is considered. The replicating outcomes exhibit, that the proposed method increases overall energy efficiency by 16%, localization cost by 26%, and delay by 28%, which are the major concern for localization scheme.

AB This article presents a novel method for exactly reformulating nondifferentiable collision avoidance constraints into smooth, differentiable constraints using strong duality of convex optimization. We focus on a controlled object whose goal is to avoid obstacles while moving in an n-dimensional space. The proposed reformulation is exact, does not introduce any approximations, and applies to general obstacles and controlled objects that can be represented as the union of convex sets. We connect our results with the notion of signed distance, which is widely used in traditional trajectory generation algorithms. Our method can be applied to generic navigation and trajectory planning tasks, and the smoothness property allows the use of general-purpose gradient- and Hessian-based optimization algorithms. Finally, in case a collision cannot be avoided, our framework allows us to find "least-intrusive" trajectories, measured in terms of penetration. We demonstrate the efficacy of our framework on an automated parking problem, where our numerical experiments suggest that the proposed method is robust and enables real-time optimization-based trajectory planning in tight environments. Sample code of our example is provided at https://github.com/XiaojingGeorgeZhang/OBCA.

AB Traffic signs play an important role for Advanced Driver Assistance Systems (ADAS) as well as for autonomous driving vehicles. Most of the works done focus on recognizing symbol based signs leaving apart important information provided by other type of signs like complementary panels or text based signs. In this paper, we include detection and classification of both symbol and text based signs focusing on the most common ones found in European urban environments. The system consists of three stages, traffic sign detection, refinement and classification. The detection and refinement is performed using Mask R-CNN while the classification is achieved with a proposed Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) architecture. We introduced the extended version of the German Traffic Sign Detection Benchmark (GTSDB), labeled in a pixel manner (masks) with 164 classes grouped into 8 categories. It is used for the detection and classification steps. Experimental results on German environments show that our proposed system is capable of detecting all categories of traffic signs while at the same time recognizing them with high accuracy achieving comparable performance with the state of the art.

AB In the Internet-of-Things (IoT) era, user authentication is essential to ensure the security of connected devices and the customization of passive services. However, conventional knowledge-based and physiological biometric-based authentication systems (e.g., password, face recognition, and fingerprints) are susceptible to shoulder surfing attacks, smudge attacks, and heat attacks. The powerful sensing capabilities of IoT devices, including smartphones, wearables, robots, and autonomous vehicles enable continuous authentication (CA) based on behavioral biometrics. The artificial intelligence (AI) approaches hold significant promise in sifting through large volumes of heterogeneous biometrics data to offer unprecedented user authentication and user identification capabilities. In this survey article, we outline the nature of CA in IoT applications, highlight the key behavioral signals, and summarize the extant solutions from an AI perspective. Based on our systematic and comprehensive analysis, we discuss the challenges and promising future directions to guide the next generation of AI-based CA research.

AB Product development, especially in aerospace, has become more and more interconnected with its operational environment. In a constant changing world, the operational environment will be subjected to changes during the life cycle of the product. The operational environment will be affected by not only technical and non-technical perturbations, but also economical, managerial and regulatory decisions, thus requiring a more global product development approach. One way to try tackling such complex and intertwined problem advocates studying the envisioned product or system in the context of system of systems (SoS) engineering. SoSs are all around us, probably in any field of engineering, ranging from integrated transport systems, public infrastructure systems to modern homes equipped with sensors and smart appliances; from cities filling with autonomous vehicle to defence systems.
   Since also aerospace systems are certainly affected, this work will present a holistic approach to aerospace product development that tries spanning from needs to technology assessment. The proposed approach will be presented and analysed and key enablers and future research directions will be highlighted from an interdisciplinary point of view. Consideration of the surrounding world will require to look beyond classical engineering disciplines.

TI Detection scheme for a partially occluded pedestrian based on occluded

ID SYSTEM
AB Object detections are critical technologies for the safety of pedestrians and drivers in autonomous vehicles. Above all, occluded pedestrian detection is still a challenging topic. We propose a new detection scheme for occluded pedestrian detection by means of lidar-radar sensor fusion. In the proposed method, the lidar and radar regions of interest (RoIs) have been selected based on the respective sensor measurement. Occluded depth is a new means to determine whether an occluded target exists or not. The occluded depth is a region projected out by expanding the longitudinal distance with maintaining the angle formed by the outermost two end points of the lidar RoI. The occlusion RoI is the overlapped region made by superimposing the radar RoI and the occluded depth. The object within the occlusion RoI is detected by the radar measurement information and the occluded object is estimated as a pedestrian based on human Doppler distribution. Additionally, various experiments are performed in detecting a partially occluded pedestrian in outdoor as well as indoor environments. According to experimental results, the proposed sensor fusion scheme has much better detection performance compared to the case without our proposed method. (c) The Authors.

AB This issue handles the ability of using segmentation results of sidescan sonar images for long term registration. This study take a part of AUV (Autonomous Underwater Vehicle) navigation problems, particularly to correct the drift of navigation sensors.
   Principle of images formation with this type of engines and the main properties are first reminded. Some images are shown, which allows us to understand difficulties of this type of data to realise AUV positioning. Then, we decide that segmentation results of sidescan images provide us landscapes on which registration will be able.
   Segmentation is then explained. It is supervised type on five classes, rocks, ripples, sand, mud and shadow. Using Gabor filters provides classifying parameters and classification is realised by the nearest neighbour. This is made step by step, refining step by step the segmentation.
   In order to know which landscapes may be extracted to enable the positioning, a statement is then realised on the obtained results, The registration methodology is then quickly explained and several results are commented. This allows us to realise a final conclusion on the ability to use results of segmentation of sonar images to make registration and to give possibilities and limits of this type of positioning system.

AB The flexibility, adaptability, and resilience of even simple brains are unmatched by any current technology. Recent unexpected difficulties in realising truly autonomous vehicles, making reliable medical diagnoses, detecting offensive online content and even just recognising faces, show that brains remain significantly functionally more capable than we can currently emulate. Fittingly, in recent years we have made significant progress identifying computational principles that underlie neural function. We are beginning to dispense with the overly simplistic stimulus-driven encode/transmit/decode doctrine. Instead we must embrace the brain's inherent dynamic complexity and emergent properties and explain how plasticity moulds the dynamics to capture useful couplings across brain regions and between the brain, the body, and the world. While certainly not complete, we have sufficient evidence that a synthesis of these ideas could result in a deeper understanding of neural computation and which could potentially be used to construct new AI technologies with unique capabilities. I discuss the relevant neuroscientific principles, the advantages they have for computation, and how they can benefit AI. Limitations of current AI are now generally recognised. I postulate that we understand enough about the brain to immediately offer novel AI formulations.

AB Nowadays, high-precision navigation is a fundamental prerequisite for autonomous driving technology. How -ever, it is often difficult for a stand-alone sensor to meet the needs of high-precision navigation in complex scenarios. To address this problem, we propose a tightly coupled precise point positioning (PPP)/inertial navi-gation system (INS)/Vision/LiDAR integration method to achieve high-precision, continuous and reliable navi-gation in urban environments. The multi-GNSS carrier phase and pseudorange measurements, low-cost microelectromechanical system (MEMS) inertial measurement units (IMU) records, sparse visual landmarks and extracted LiDAR edge/planar features are directly fused at the observation level through a centralized Extended Kalman Filter (EKF). The vehicle experiments in different GNSS availability conditions were conducted to evaluate the proposed method. Results indicate that our proposed PPP/INS/Vision/LiDAR integration can maintain sub-meter level positioning in both GNSS half-open-sky and difficult environments, with improvements of (50.7%, 58.6%, 54.3%) and (46.2%, 55.0%, 58.8%) relative to PPP/INS/Vision and PPP/INS/LiDAR, respectively. Moreover, both visual and LiDAR information can significantly improve the velocity and attitude estimation performance, especially for the heading.

AB Hundreds of full-depth temperature and salinity profiles collected by Deepglider autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) in the North Atlantic reveal robust signals in eddy isopycnal vertical displacement and horizontal current throughout the entire water column. In separate glider missions southeast of Bermuda, subsurface-intensified cold, fresh coherent vortices were observed with velocities exceeding 20 cm s(-1) at depths greater than 1000 m. With vertical resolution on the order of 20 m or less, these full-depth glider slant profiles newly permit estimation of scaled vertical wavenumber spectra from the barotropic through the 40th baroclinic mode. Geostrophic turbulence theory predictions of spectral slopes associated with the forward enstrophy cascade and proportional to inverse wavenumber cubed generally agree with glider-derived quasi-universal spectra of potential and kinetic energy found at a variety of locations distinguished by a wide range of mean surface eddy kinetic energy. Water-column average spectral estimates merge at high vertical mode number to established descriptions of internal wave spectra. Among glider mission sites, geographic and seasonal variability implicate bottom drag as a mechanism for dissipation, but also the need for more persistent sampling of the deep ocean.

AB Underwater wireless sensor networks (UWSNs) are promising, emerging technologies for the applications in oceanic research. UWSN contains high number of sensor nodes and autonomous underwater vehicles that are deployed to perform the data transmission in the sea. In UWSN networks, the sensors are placed in the buoyant which are highly vulnerable to selfish behavioural attack. In this paper, the major challenges in finding secure and optimal route navigation in UWSN are identified and in order to address them, Entropy based ACO algorithm (E-ACO) is proposed for secure route selection. Moreover, the Selfish Node Recovery (SNR) using the Grasshopper Optimisation Algorithm (GOA) is used to minimize the packet loss in the UWSN. The performance of the proposed E-ACO method is compared with existing routing methods such as Secure Authentication with Protected Data Aggregation (SAPDA), Secure Energy Efficient and Cooperative Routing (SEECR), Fault Resilient Routing using Moth Flame Optimization (FRR-MFO) and Improved ACO (TACO) method. The packet delivery ratio of the proposed E-ACO with 500 nodes is 0.89 which is higher than other existing methods such as SAPDA, SEECR, FRR-MFO and TACO.

AB Shortwave infrared (SWIR) photodetectors are being actively researched for their application in autonomous vehicles, biometric sensors, and night vision. However, most of the SWIR photodetectors that have been studied so far are produced by complex semiconductor fabrication processes and have low sensitivity at room temperature because of thermal noise. In addition, the low wavelength band of the SWIR photodetectors currently used has a detrimental effect on the human eye. To overcome these disadvantages, we propose a solution-processed PbS SWIR photodetector that can minimize harmful effects on the human eye. In this study, we synthesized PbS quantum dots (QDs) that have high absorbance peaked at 1410 nm and fabricated SWIR photodetectors with a conductive polymer, poly(3-hexylthiophene) (P3HT), using the synthesized PbS QDs. The characteristics of the synthesized PbS QDs and the current-voltage (I-V) characteristics of the fabricated PbS SWIR photodetectors were measured. It was found that the maximum responsivity of the optimized PbS SWIR photodetector with P3HT was 2.26 times that of the PbS SWIR photodetector without P3HT. Moreover, due to the high hole mobility and an appropriate highest occupied molecular orbital level of P3HT, the former showed a lower operating voltage.

AB Over the last few years, several authors have presented contrasting models to describe the response of boulders to extreme waves, but the absence of direct observation of movements has hindered the evaluation of these models. The recent development of online video-sharing platforms in coastal settings has provided the opportunity to monitor the evolution of rocky coastlines during storm events. In September 2018, a surveillance camera of the Marine Protected Area of Plemmirio recorded the movement of several boulders along the coast of Maddalena Peninsula (Siracusa, Southeastern Sicily) during the landfall of the Mediterranean tropical-like cyclone (Medicane) Zorbas. Unmanned autonomous vehicle (UAV) photogrammetric and terrestrial laser scanner (TLS) surveys were performed to reconstruct immersive virtual scenarios to geometrically analyze the boulder displacements recorded in the video. Analyses highlighted that the displacements occurred when the boulders were submerged as a result of the impact of multiple small waves rather than due to a single large wave. Comparison between flow velocities obtained by videos and calculated through relationships showed a strong overestimation of the models, suggesting that values of flow density and lift coefficient used in literature are underestimated.

AB While in many parts of the urban world the variety of means of transport increase, in the rural valleys of Tajikistan, people still have limited access to any means of transport. As such, local communities may easily get stranded and isolated from food markets and healthcare facilities. Based on ethnographic fieldwork in the Bartang Valley of the Autonomous Kuhistoni-Badakhshon Province of Tajikistan, this paper aims to understand how situations of involuntary immobility emerge in the region. On the theoretical level, the paper demonstrates the value of motility as a conceptual term to explore why people face involuntary immobility. In a context of physical remoteness, environmental variability and dilapidated infrastructure, new facets of the concept of motility are revealed, notably on the ways inhabitants navigate through adverse mobility conditions. The paper is articulated around the three dimensions of motility: accessibility, mobility skills and appropriation of mobility. Results show that most people in Bartang have a low motility due to the lack of vehicles, frequent environmental hazards and the demanding set of competencies required to be mobile. This low motility induces involuntary immobility which is more commonly experienced by particular groups but affects most inhabitants when the road is closed.

DE Traffic sign recognition; Few-shot learning; Clustering; Randomization
AB Reliable and fast traffic sign recognition (TSR) that locates the traffic sign from an image and then estimates its category is a crucial perception function for Advanced Driver Assistance Systems (ADAS) of autonomous vehicles. Most of the popular deep convolutional neural networks (DCNNs) based TSR techniques advocate discriminative feature learning for traffic signs against their appearance variability. However, such feature learning scheme may suffer from the diversity of traffic signs categories, especially when samples within each category are limited for model training (i.e., few-shot learning). Here, we present a generative feature learning based TSR network with well generalization capacity and high computational efficiency. Instead of relying on large amounts of supervision to learn discriminative features, our method devotes to learn common but unique properties of class-specific traffic signs with few training samples. Specifically, we combine clustering inductive bias with a random neural network, and then exploit computational advantages offered by a fast random projection algorithm. Experiments on two TSR benchmarks illustrate that our method achieves comparable or higher recognition accuracy than state-of-the-art DCNN-based methods with less training data and inference time consumption.

DT Article
DE Kinematics; 3-degree-of-freedom modeling; vehicle engineering;

AB This article presents a kinematic analysis of a four-wheeled mobile robot in three-dimensions, introducing computational mechanics. The novelty lies in (1) the type of robot that is analyzed, which has been scarcely dealt with in the literature, and (2) the methodology used which enables the systematic implementation of kinematic algorithms using the computer. The mobile robot has four wheels, four rockers (like an All-Terrain Mobile Robot), and a main body. It also has two actuators and uses a drive mechanism known as differential drive (like those of a slip/skid mobile robot). We characterize the mobile robot as a set of kinematic closed chains with rotational pairs between links and a higher contact pair between the wheels and the terrain. Then, a set of generalized coordinates are chosen and the constraint equations are established. A new concept named "driving modes" has been introduced because some of the constraint equations are derived from these. The kinematics is the first step in solving the dynamics of this robot in order to set a control algorithm for an autonomous car-like robot. This methodology has been successfully applied to a real mobile robot, "Robotnik," and the results are analyzed.

AB This paper introduces and studies the application of Constrained Sampling Evolutionary Algorithms in the framework of an UAV based search and rescue scenario. These algorithms have been developed as a way to harness the power of Evolutionary Algorithms (EA) when operating in complex, noisy, multimodal optimization problems and transfer the advantages of their approach to real time real world problems that can be transformed into search and optimization challenges. These types of problems are denoted as Constrained Sampling problems and are characterized by the fact that the physical limitations of reality do not allow for an instantaneous determination of the fitness of the points present in the population that must be evolved. A general approach to address these problems is presented and a particular implementation using Differential Evolution as an example of CS-EA is created and evaluated using teams of UAVs in search and rescue missions. The results are compared to those of a Swarm Intelligence based strategy in the same type of problem as this approach has been widely used within the UAV path planning field in different variants by many authors.

AB The upwelling system off southern Peru has been observed using an autonomous underwater vehicle (a Slocum glider) during October-November 2008. Nine cross-front sections have been carried out across an intense upwelling cell near 148 degrees S. During almost two months, profiles of temperature, salinity, and fluorescence were collected at less than 1-km resolution, between the surface and 200-m depth. Estimates of alongshore absolute geostrophic velocities were inferred from the density field and the glider drift between two surfacings. In the frontal region, salinity and biogeochemical fields displayed cross-shore submesoscale filamentary structures throughout the mission. Those features presented a width of 10-20 km, a vertical extent of; 150 m, and appeared to propagate toward the shore. They were steeper than isopycnals and kept an aspect ratio close to f/N, the inverse of the Prandtl ratio. These filamentary structures may be interpreted mainly as a manifestation of submesoscale turbulence through stirring of the salinity gradients by the mesoscale eddy field. However, meandering of the front or cross-frontal wind-driven instabilities could also play a role in inducing vertical velocities.

AB Achieving excellent generalization on perceiving real traffic scenarios with diversity is the long-term goal for building robust autonomous driving systems. A recent theoretical study shows that the generalization on the worst-group of test samples is far more difficult than others. Therefore, we propose to discover potential shortness of certain perception module by analyzing its worst-scenario performance. However, with the benchmark datasets growing huge and tremendous, exhaustive searching for the worst perception scenario (WPS) seems to be time consuming and unnecessary. To address this, we present an automatic searching scheme empowered by reinforcement learning. In this case, worst scenario mining is formulated as the discrete search on the Visual Operation Design Domain (ODD), namely scenario representation, by optimizing LSTM-RNN controller with the worst-performance reward. Moreover, a time-efficient K-reciprocal re-ranking technique is utilized to match the predicted scenario parameters with existing test data. The proposed method has been validated by finding the most challenging scenarios for various vehicle detectors on KITTI, BDD100k and our own benchmark set EVB. Furthermore, searching performances w.r.t different Visual ODDs are investigated and it is found that visual representations through generative adversarial network contribute to a better performance.

AB Accurate localization is a critical task in underwater navigation. Typical localization methods use a set of acoustic sensors and beacons to estimate relative position, whose geometric configuration has a significant impact on the localization accuracy. Although there is much effort in the literature to define optimal 2D or 3D sensor placement, the optimal sensor placement in irregular and constrained 3D surfaces, such as autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) or other structures, is not exploited for improving localization. Additionally, most applications using AUVs employ commercial acoustic modems or compact arrays, therefore the optimization of the placement of spatially independent sensors is not a considered issue. This article tackles acoustic sensor placement optimization in irregular and constrained 3D surfaces, for inverted ultra-short baseline (USBL) approaches, to improve localization accuracy. The implemented multi-objective memetic algorithm combines an evaluation of the geometric sensor's configuration, using the Cramer-Rao Lower Bound (CRLB), with the incidence angle of the received signal. A case study is presented over a simulated homing and docking scenario to demonstrate the proposed optimization algorithm.

AB A roadside sensing unit can provide over-the horizon perception information for autonomous vehicles due to its high perception perspective. However, numerous challenges need to be overcome such as the missing detection of small objects and occluded objects. To this end, this study proposed a fixed perspective perception (FPP) module, which considered background subtraction and a fixed camera for small object detection. The proposed FPP module was divided into two parts: a grayscale background subtraction (GBS) submodule and a background-current image fusion (BCF) submodule. Specifically, the GBS submodule introduces background spatial information into a current frame, and the BCF submodule combines feature maps of a current frame and background by using channel attention. Moreover, we designed an object detection network called FPPNet which uses the FPP module to facilitate small object detection. Experimental results demonstrate that the FPPNet achieved 39.8% average precision small (APS) and 65.7% AP in a Dair-V2X-I dataset. Futhermore, we conducted an extension of the FPP module to mainstream object detection networks such as CenterNet, Faster-Rcnn, and RetinaNet. Experimental results show that the proposed module can effectively improve small object detection accuracy of the networks mentioned earlier.

ID MULTIARMED BANDIT
AB The Distributed Multi-Armed Bandit (DMAB) is a powerful framework for studying many network problems. The DMAB is typically studied in a paradigm, where signals activate each agent with a fixed probability, and the rewards revealed to agents are assumed to be generated from fixed and unknown distributions, i.e., stochastic rewards, or arbitrarily manipulated by an adversary, i.e., adversarial rewards. However, this paradigm fails to capture the dynamics and uncertainties of many real-world applications, where the signal that activates an agent, may not follow any distribution, and the rewards might be partially stochastic and partially adversarial. Motivated by this, we study the asynchronously stochastic DMAB problem with adversarial corruptions where the agent is activated arbitrarily, and rewards initially sampled from distributions might be corrupted by an adversary. The objectives are to simultaneously minimize the regret and communication cost, while robust to corruption. To address all these issues, we propose a Robust and Distributed Active Arm Elimination algorithm, namely RDAAE, which only needs to transmit one real number (e.g., an arm index, or a reward) per communication. We theoretically prove that the performance of regret and communication cost smoothly degrades when the corruption level increases.

ID OPTIMIZATION
AB In this article presents a trajectory planning approach toward safe and smooth robot motion in dynamic environments. We develop a hierarchical planning framework with a global planner generating the shortest path between the robot and the navigation target. Specially, a virtual target (VT) is set to run on the global path with a designed velocity. At the local level, the robot chases the VT and tracks the global path when traveling through the dynamic environment. We employ the model predictive control (MPC) framework for the local path generation. In particular, the prediction horizon of the MPC is adaptively changed concerning the distance between the robot and the VT. It implicitly reflects the crowdedness of the environment, which helps reduce the environmental uncertainty. Besides, we develop an event-triggered mechanism that executes the local plan aperiodically to release the computational burden. Based on the local chasing and tracking performance, we develop a global path replanning scheme in response to the untraversable area emerging in the dense environment. The developed framework is validated through extensive experiments in dynamic environments, demonstrating that the robot can reach the target faster and showcase a safer and smoother trajectory in the navigation.

AB Underwater glider (UG) is one of the most promising autonomous observation platforms for long-term ocean observation, which can glide through seawater columns by adjusting its buoyancy and attitude. Hydrodynamic shape, especially the wing parameters, has an important influence on the glide performance of UG. In this paper, a sweep wing strategy inspired by the swift wings is proposed to apply pre-adjustable sweep wings for UGs, so as to improve the glide performance in different glide conditions. The approximate model that describes the relationship between the hydrodynamic coefficients of UG and the wing sweep angles is established with computational fluid dynamics method. By importing the approximate models into the dynamic model, the glide performance analysis, including endurance ability and trajectory accuracy, is performed to analyze the effect of the various sweep wings. The analysis results indicate that different sweep angles of wings are required by UG to obtain the optimal ability in gliding range, gliding duration, turn and resisting current, and the sweep wing strategy is useful for UG to improve its performance in observation mission due to the uncertainty of ocean environment.

AB Trajectory planning is one of the indispensable and critical components in robotics and autonomous systems. As an efficient indirect method to deal with the nonlinear system dynamics in trajectory planning tasks over the unconstrained state and control space, the iterative linear quadratic regulator (iLQR) has demonstrated noteworthy outcomes. In this article, a local-learning-enabled constrained iLQR algorithm is herein presented for trajectory planning based on hybrid dynamic optimization and machine learning. Rather importantly, this algorithm attains the key advantage of circumventing the requirement of system identification, and the trajectory planning task is achieved with a simultaneous refinement of the optimal policy and the neural network system in an iterative framework. The neural network can be designed to represent the local system model with a simple architecture, and thus it leads to a sample-efficient training pipeline. In addition, in this learning paradigm, the constraints of the general form that are typically encountered in trajectory planning tasks are preserved. Several illustrative examples on trajectory planning are scheduled as part of the test itinerary to demonstrate the effectiveness and significance of this work.

AB Purpose The disinfection robot developed by the authors and team focuses on achieving fast and precise disinfection under a given or specific disinfection zone. This looks to solve problems with traditional robots that pay less attention to the level, efficiency and zones of disinfection. To effectively support and guarantee normal running for the whole system, a digital twin system is applied to the disinfection robot. This study aims to achieve fast, precise and thorough disinfection via the developed mobile robot. Design/methodology/approach The designed robot is composed primarily of the following three parts: a mobile platform, a six-axis robotic arm and a ultraviolet-C (UVC) LED array. The UVC LED array is installed on the end-effector to achieve large-scale, precise manipulation. The adoption of all types of advanced sensors and the development of an intuitive and user-friendly client interface are helpful in achieving remote control, path planning, data monitoring and custom disinfection functions. Findings Disinfection of three different locations in the laboratory was performed; the dosage distribution of the surface as radiated by the UVC robot was detected; and feasibility of development was validated.

AB Modern vehicles rely on a multitude of sensors and cameras to both understand the environment around them and assist the driver in different situations. Lane detection is an overall process as it can be used in safety systems such as the lane departure warning system (LDWS). Lane detection may be used in steering assist systems, especially useful at night in the absence of light sources. Although developing such a system can be done simply by using global positioning system (GPS) maps, it is dependent on an internet connection or GPS signal, elements that may be absent in some locations. Because of this, such systems should also rely on computer vision algorithms. In this paper, we improve upon an existing lane detection method, by changing two distinct features, which in turn leads to better optimization and false lane marker rejection. We propose using a probabilistic Hough transform, instead of a regular one, as well as using a parallelogram region of interest (ROI), instead of a trapezoidal one. By using these two methods we obtain an increase in overall runtime of approximately 30%, as well as an increase in accuracy of up to 3%, compared to the original method.

AB The focus of this work is to present a novel methodology for optimal distribution of a swarm formation on either side of an obstacle, when evading the obstacle, to avoid overpopulation on the sides to reduce the agents' waiting delays, resulting in a reduced overall mission time and lower energy consumption. To handle this, the problem is divided into two main parts: 1) the disturbance phase: how to morph the formation optimally to avoid the obstacle in the least possible time in the situation at hand, and 2) the convergence phase: how to optimally resume the intended formation shape once the threat of potential collision has been eliminated. For the first problem, we develop a methodology which tests different formation morphing combinations and finds the optimal one, by utilizing trajectory, velocity, and coordinate information, to bypass the obstacle. For the second problem, we utilize thin-plate splines (TPS) inspired temperature function minimization method to bring the agents back from the distorted formation into the desired formation in an optimal manner, after collision avoidance has been successfully performed. Experimental results show that, in the considered test scenario, the proposed approach results in substantial energy savings as compared with the traditional methods.

DT Review
DE Absolute visual localization; UAV; Navigation; Satellite imagery;
   Computer vision; Deep learning
AB Research on unmanned aerial vehicles is growing as they are becoming less expensive and more available than before. The applications span a large number of areas and include border security, search and rescue, wildlife surveying, firefighting, precision agriculture, structure inspection, surveying and mapping, aerial photography, and recreative applications. These applications can require autonomous behavior which is only possible with a precise and robust self-localization. Until recently, the favored approach to localization was based on inertial sensors and global navigation satellite systems. However, global navigation satellite systems have multiple shortcomings related to long-distance radio communications (e.g. non-line-of-sight reception, multipath, spoofing). This motivated the development of new approaches to supplement or supplant satellite navigation. Absolute visual localization is one of the two main approaches to vision-based localization. The goal is to locate the current view of the UAV in a reference satellite map or georeferenced imagery from previous flights. Various approaches were proposed in this area and this paper review most of the literature in this field since 2015. The problematic at hand is analyzed and defined. Existing approaches are reviewed in 4 categories: template matching, feature points matching, deep learning and visual odometry. (c) 2020 Published by Elsevier B.V.

AB Li metal batteries have been considered as the most promising batteries with high energy density for cutting-edge electronic devices such as electric vehicles, autonomous aircrafts, and smart grids. However, Li metal anode faces the issues of safety and capacity deterioration, which are closely related to Li dendrite growth. In this paper, we review the main strategies to improve the performance of Li metal anode. Due to Li dendrite's catastrophic influence, suppression of Li dendrite growth is prerequisite for each strategy. Apart from Li dendrite, interfacial resistance between electrolyte and electrode, ionic conductivity of electrolytes, mechanical strength, and volume fluctuation of Li metal anode are also discussed in these strategies. We outline these strategies based on the classifications of constructing solid electrolyte interphase, engineering of solid-state electrolyte and adopting matrix for Li metal anode. Each strategy is illustrated and discussed in detail by exemplification. For better understanding, some important theories related to Li metal anode have been also introduced. Finally, the outlooks for future research of Li metal anode are presented.

DE Multi-AUV; cooperative hunting; decentralized search; angle matching;

AB As one of the challenges of multi-AUV (multiple autonomous underwater vehicle) systems, the realization of group security defence is of great significance. This article studies the multi-AUV cooperative hunting in two- and three-dimensional underwater environments. A comprehensive hunting algorithm based on besieging circle shrinking is proposed to control multi-AUVs to search and capture invaders. The invader hunting process consists of three steps: first, multi-AUVs search for invaders in unknown environments. To expand the search scope as far as possible and reduce the repeated search rate, a decentralized search strategy is adopted to search for invaders. Once any invader is detected by an AUV, the discoverer acts as the leader to form a dynamic hunting team. Next, the hunting team determines a besieging point based on an angle matching algorithm. AUVs use direction optimization strategies to navigate to the besieging point while avoiding obstacles. Finally, when all the AUVs reach their exact besieging points to satisfy the encirclement contraction condition, the encirclement will shrink to capture the invader. Simulations and experiments prove the feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed algorithm. Compared with the bio-inspired neural network algorithm, the proposed algorithm performs better.

AB A vortex-based method is presented for the hydroelastic analysis of a hydrofoil in flapping motion, operating as a biomimetic thruster. The system performs combined heaving and pitching motion with appropriate phase difference. As a first approximation, the foil is assumed to be very thin permitting to neglect thickness effects as higher-order contributions to the hydrodynamics. Moreover, the flapping thruster is considered to be flexible, free to deform under inertia and reactive forces caused by its forced motion and hydrodynamic pressure, respectively. The proposed method is validated through a series of comparisons with other models, as well as experimental results, for the case where the foil is clamped at its leading edge, while its trailing edge acts as a free end. It is illustrated that chordwise flexibility can significantly improve the propulsive efficiency. For demonstration purposes, a realistic propulsion problem concerning an autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) is studied, indicating an efficiency increase almost 10% in comparison with the rigid case. The present method can serve as a useful tool for the preliminary design, as well as for the assessment and dynamic control of such biomimetic systems for marine propulsion and energy recovery.

AB Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to propose that the three-dimensional information of obstacles should be identified to allow unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) to detect and avoid obstacles existing in their flight path.
   Design/methodology/approach - First, the approximate outline of obstacles was detected using multi-scale-oriented patches (MOPS). At the same time, the spatial coordinates of feature points that exist in the internal outline of the obstacles were calculated through the scale-invariant feature transform (SIFT) algorithm. Finally, the results from MOPS and the results from the SIFT algorithm were merged to show the three-dimensional information of the obstacles.
   Findings - As the method proposed in this paper reconstructs only the approximate outline of obstacles, a quick calculation can be done. Moreover, as the outline information is combined through SIFT feature points, detailed three-dimensional information pertaining to the obstacles can be obtained.
   Practical implications - The proposed approach can be used efficiently in GPS-denied environments such as certain indoor environments.
   Originality/value - For the autonomous flight of small UAVs having a payload limit, this paper suggests a means of forming three-dimensional information about obstacles with images obtained from a monocular camera.

AB Recently a significant amount of attention has been paid towards the development of man-made synthetic catalytic micro- and nanomotors that can mimic biological counterparts in terms of propulsion power, motion control, and speed. However, only a few applications of such self-propelled vehicles have been described. Here the magnetic control of self-propelled catalytic Ti/Fe/Pt rolled-up microtubes (microbots) that can be used to perform various tasks such as the selective loading, transportation, and delivery of microscale objects in a fluid is shown; for instance, it is demonstrated for polystyrene particles and thin metallic films ("nanoplates"). Microbots self-propel by ejecting microbubbles via a platinum catalytic decomposition of hydrogen peroxide into oxygen and water. The fuel and surfactant concentrations are optimized obtaining a maximum speed of 275 mu m s(-1) (5.5 body lengths per second) at 15% of peroxide fuel. The microbots exert a force of around 3.77 pN when transporting a single 5 mu m diameter particle; evidencing a high propulsion power that allows for the transport of up to 60 microparticles. By the introduction of an Fe thin film into the rolled-up microtubes, their motion can be fully controlled by an external magnetic field.

AB An evolutionary algorithm based framework, a combination of modified, breeder genetic algorithms incorporating characteristics of classic genetic algorithms, is utilized to design an offline/online path planner for unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) autonomous navigation. The path planner calculates a curved path line with desired characteristics in a three-dimensional (3-D) rough terrain environment, represented using B-Spline curves, with the coordinates of its control points being the evolutionary algorithm artificial chromosome genes.
   Given a 3-D rough environment and assuming flight envelope restrictions, two problems are solved: i) UAV navigation using an offline planner in a known environment, and, ii) UAV navigation using an online planner in a completely unknown environment. The offline planner produces a single B-Spline curve that connects the starting and target points with a predefined initial direction. The online planner, based on the offline one, is given on-board radar readings which gradually produces a smooth 3-D trajectory aiming at reaching a predetermined target in an unknown environment; the produced trajectory consists of smaller B-Spline curves smoothly connected with each other. Both planners have been tested under different scenarios, and they have been proven effective in guiding an UAV to its final destination, providing near-optimal curved paths quickly and efficiently.

AB The NASA Extreme Environment Mission Operations (NEEMO) 15 mission was focused on evaluating techniques for exploring near-Earth asteroids (NEAs). It began with a University of Delaware autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) systematically mapping the coral reef for hundreds of meters surrounding the Aquarius habitat. This activity is akin to the type of "far-field survey" approach that may be used by a robotic precursor in advance of a human mission to a NFA Data from the far-field survey were then examined by the NEEMO science team and follow-up exploration traverses were planned, which used Deepworker single-person submersibles. Science traverses at NEEMO 15 were planned according to a prioritized list of objectives developed by the science team. These objectives were based on review and discussion of previous related marine science research, including previous marine science saturation missions conducted at the Aquarius habitat. AUV data were used to select several areas of scientific interest. The Deepworker science traverses were then executed at these areas of interest during 4 days of the NEEMO 15 mission and provided higher resolution data such as coral species distribution and mortality. These traverses are analogous to the "near-field survey" approach that is expected to be performed by a Multi-Mission Space Exploration Vehicle (MMSEV) during a human mission to a NEA before extravehicular activities (EVAs) are conducted. In addition to the science objectives that were pursued, the NEEMO 15 traverses provided an opportunity to test newly developed software and techniques. Sample collection and instrument deployment on the NEA surface by EVA crew would follow the "near-field survey" in a human NEA mission. Sample collection was not necessary for the purposes of the NEEMO science objectives; however, the engineering and operations objectives during NEEMO 15 were to evaluate different combinations of vehicles, crew members, tools, and equipment that could be used to perform these science objectives on a NEA. Specifically, the productivity and acceptability of simulated NEA exploration activities were systematically quantified and compared when operating with different combinations of crew sizes and exploration systems including MMSEVs, EVA jet packs, and EVA translation devices. Data from NEEMO 15 will be used in conjunction with data from software simulations, parametric analysis, other analog field tests, anchoring models, and integrated testing at Johnson Space Center to inform the evolving architectures and exploration systems being developed by the Human Spaceflight Architecture Team.

AB GNSS is indispensable to self-driving vehicles by delivering decimeter-level or better absolute positioning solutions. Such a high precision normally requires a convergence time spanning seconds to minutes, which is, however, unrealistic in extremely difficult driving conditions where GNSS signals are obstructed frequently. Such convergences, no matter how short, will greatly risk and discredit autonomous driving in satisfying stringent life safety standards. In this study, we therefore developed an extendable GNSS precise point positioning (PPP) model to exploit the advanced Galileo/BeiDou-3 more-than-three-frequency signals with the goal of achieving instant or single-epoch 10-30 cm positioning accuracy and over 99% availability for the horizontal components over wide areas. In particular, uncombined Galileo/BeiDou-3 signals on all available frequencies were injected simultaneously into PPP to perform single-epoch wide-lane ambiguity resolution (PPP-WAR) after phase bias calibrations on raw observations. Experimenting on the Galileo five-frequency data from 36 stations in Australia, we found that instant PPP-WAR was accomplished at more than 99.5% of all epochs; we achieved an instant positioning accuracy of 0.10 and 0.11 m (1 sigma) for the east and north components, respectively, using Galileo E1/E5a/E5/E5b/E6 signals from less than 10 satellites, while 0.16 and 0.23 m using BeiDou-3 B1C/B1I/B2a/B2b/B3I signals from only 5-6 satellites per epoch observed by 10 stations within China. Moreover, we carried out vehicle-borne experiments collecting multi-frequency Galileo/BeiDou-3 signals in the case of overpass and tunnel adversities. With 7 Galileo/BeiDou-3 satellites per epoch on average, instant PPP-WAR reached a mean positioning accuracy of 0.23 and 0.24 m for the horizontal components, which can be further improved to 0.14 and 0.12 m when multi-epoch filtering is preferably enabled. More encouragingly, though this positioning accuracy can also be ensured with triple-frequency data, the data redundancy favored by even more frequencies can reduce the high-precision recovery time from up to 4 s to 2 s in the case of total signal blockages. With the rapidly ongoing deployment of Galileo, BeiDou-3 and other GNSS constellations, we can envision an instant global positioning service characterized by around 20 cm horizontal accuracy and over 99% availability for self-driving vehicles.

SO IEEE ROBOTICS AND AUTOMATION LETTERS

DT Article
DE LIDAR image fusion; LIDAR segmentation
AB 2D RGB images and 3D LIDAR point clouds provide complementary knowledge for the perception system of autonomous vehicles. Several 2D and 3D fusion methods have been explored for the LIDAR semantic segmentation task, but they suffer from different problems. 2D-to-3D fusion methods require strictly paired data during inference, which may not be available in real-world scenarios, while 3D-to-2D fusion methods cannot explicitly make full use of the 2D information. Therefore, we propose a Bidirectional Fusion Network with Cross-Modality Knowledge Distillation (CMDFusion) in this work. Our method has two contributions. First, our bidirectional fusion scheme explicitly and implicitly enhances the 3D feature via 2D-to-3D fusion and 3D-to-2D fusion, respectively, which surpasses either one of the single fusion schemes. Second, we distillate the 2D knowledge from a 2D network (Camera branch) to a 3D network (2D knowledge branch) so that the 3D network can generate 2D information even for those points not in the FOV (field of view) of the camera. In this way, RGB images are not required during inference anymore since the 2D knowledge branch provides 2D information according to the 3D LIDAR input. We show that our CMDFusion achieves the best performance among all fusion-based methods on SemanticKITTI and nuScenes datasets.

AB The traditional manual detection of aircraft skin is subjective and inefficient. In order to achieve rapid damage detection, this paper proposes an aircraft skin damage detection and evaluation framework by combining gray level co-occurrence matrix (GLCM) and cloud model. In the experimental stage, the UAV picks up the damage image of the aircraft, and the texture feature data is output by using the GLCM algorithm. The introduction of the cloud model evaluation system makes the skin damage type be quickly judged. The results show that the proposed method has good recognition ability for aircraft skin damage, and the identification accuracy of the verification image set reaches 85%. In the validation image set, 50 % of the corrosion spalling images were judged to be normal, which may be due to the similarity of the two types of texture features, and also indicates that the initial stage of skin damage starts from pitting. When evaluating the damage image, 59 % of the cloud droplets fall in the normal level, indicating that the damage is not serious, and the damage maintenance of the aircraft can be delayed according to the usage.

AB Features from LiDAR and cameras are considered to be complementary. However, due to the sparsity of the LiDAR point clouds, a dense and accurate RGB/3D projective relationship is difficult to establish especially for distant scene points. Recent works try to solve this problem by designing a network that learns missing points or dense point density distributions to compensate for the sparsity of the LiDAR point cloud. In this work, we propose to use an imagine-and-locate process, called UYI. The objective of this module is to improve the point cloud quality and is independent of the detection network used for inference. We accomplish this task through a GAN based cross-modality module which uses an image as input to infer a dense LiDAR shape. Boosted by our UYI block, our experiments show a significant performance improvement in all tested baseline models. In fact, benefiting from the plug-and-play characteristics of our module, we were able to push the performance of existing state-of-the-art model to a new height.

AB Task allocation is crucial for autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) collaboration in multi-AUV maritime search and rescue missions. In real projects, there are possible target areas existing in task areas, which are not expected to be divided. Motivated by such a special situation, this paper proposes an area partitioning method to allocate the task to multiple AUVs and maintain the possible target area as a whole. First, the spatial structure of the task area is defined by the spiked Morse decomposition, which divides the task area according to a set of angles. Then, we perform a variational transformation to determine the optimal angles using the AUV order. Next, a customized backtracking method is introduced to determine the optimal AUV order which divides the task area among the multiple AUVs without disturbing the possible target areas. The proposed methodology is validated under various challenging scenarios using a different number of AUVs. The empirical results show that the divided possible target areas and workload variance were superior to the comparison methods. This indicates that the proposed method can generate stable solutions that effectively reduce the segmentation of possible target areas and keep the workload of the multiple AUVs balanced.

AB Application of Vehicular Ad Hoc Networks (VANETs) aims to help in the solution of some problems that have arisen in road transportation systems via short-range, low-latency mobile communication. The application of V2X (Vehicle-to-Everything) communication technologies to the next generation of Advanced Driver Assistance Systems (ADAS) is essential to the extension of the operational design domain (ODD) of the systems to provide safe, secure, and efficient automated driving solutions. Due to the safety-critical nature of the problem, the large-scale testing of V2X enabled ADAS solutions to evaluate and measure the anticipated quality and functionality of the experimental system is of great significance. This article proposes a novel ADAS application prototyping framework, using declarative programming, built on top of the popular Artery/OMNeT++ simulator. The framework is capable of simulating V2X-enabled ADAS applications using accurate network simulation and realistic simulated traffic on real-world maps. The solution features XML descriptions for application specification. The sensor model of Artery is used to provide information to applications. By using the simulator, one can conclude the performance of the applications and discover locations, circumstances and design patterns, where design limits should apply.

AB The development of large-scale cluster intelligence will inevitably lead to new problems of adversarial game control. Aiming at the problem of high dimension and high dynamics in the process of unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) cluster confrontation game, and the traditional optimal control algorithm cannot meet the requirements of timeliness, the evolution strategies (ESs) optimization method is proposed and applied to large-scale UAV cluster. It effectively avoids the problem that it is difficult to obtain accurate gradients when using reinforcement learning to deal with high-dimensional models, and promotes autonomous UAVs to find strategies with higher performance. First, the confrontation game models including UAV motion, cluster behavior patterns and interaction are established. Second, two UAV cluster game algorithms using the OpenAI evolution strategy (OpenAI ES) and integrated evolution strategy (IES) are presented. Finally, the large-scale UAV attack and defense confrontation scenarios have been established, and different sampling proportions and different numbers of UAVs are fully simulated. The results show that the two proposed algorithms can effectively solve large-scale UAV cluster confrontation game problems, especially the adaptive IES algorithm, which has better performance and shows more strategic behavior for the UAVs, which improves the effectiveness and robustness of confrontation strategies.

AB In recent years, with rapid technological advancement in both computing hardware and algorithm, Artificial Intelligence (AI) has demonstrated significant advantage over human being in a wide range of fields, such as image recognition, education, autonomous vehicles, finance, and medical diagnosis. However, AI-based systems are generally vulnerable to various security threats throughout the whole process, ranging from the initial data collection and preparation to the training, inference, and final deployment. In an AI-based system, the data collection and pre-processing phase are vulnerable to sensor spoofing attacks and scaling attacks, respectively, while the training and inference phases of the model are subject to poisoning attacks and adversarial attacks, respectively. To address these severe security threats against the AI-based systems, in this article, we review the challenges and recent research advances for security issues in AI, so as to depict an overall blueprint for AI security. More specifically, we first take the lifecycle of an AI-based system as a guide to introduce the security threats that emerge at each stage, which is followed by a detailed summary for corresponding countermeasures. Finally, some of the future challenges and opportunities for the security issues in AI will also be discussed.

AB The rapid development of Internet-of-Things in smart grid has enabled millions of grid-connected distributed controllable resources (DCR; e.g., electric vehicles, controllable loads) to provide service to the grid, such as frequency regulation and demand response. The integration of these DCRs may become a large virtual power plant network with various characteristics. This poses great challenges from both control and management perspectives, e.g., computation/communication burden, optimization complexity, scalability limitation, prosumer privacy, etc. In this article, we propose an effective autonomous incentive-based DCR control and management framework to integrate a large amount of DCRs to provide grid services, which simultaneously provides accurate active power adjustment to the grid, optimizes DCR allocations, and maximizes the profits for all prosumers and system operators. A model-free deep deterministic policy gradient-based method is designed to find the optimal incentives in a continuous action space to encourage prosumers to adjust their power consumptions. The method is implemented in a consortium open-source blockchain platform, Hyperledger Fabric, which facilitates controls and transaction management. To demonstrate the effectiveness of the framework, extensive experimental studies are conducted using real-world data.

ID UNDERWATER ACOUSTIC COMMUNICATION; CHANNEL ESTIMATION
AB The growing interest in developing autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) and creating underwater sensor networks (USNs) has led to a need for communication tools in underwater environments. For obvious reasons, wireless means of communication are the most desirable. However, conducting research in real conditions is troublesome and costly. Moreover, as hydroacoustic propagation conditions change very significantly, even during the day, the assessment of proposed underwater wireless communication methods is very difficult. Therefore, in the literature, there are considered simulators based on real measurements of underwater acoustic (UWA) channels. However, these simulators make an assumption that, during the transmission of elementary signals, the impulse response does not change. In this article, the authors present the results of the measurements realized in a towing tank where the transmitter could move with a precisely set velocity and show that the analyzed channel was non-stationary, even during the time of the transmission of a single chirp signal. The article presents an evaluation method of channel stationarity at the time of the chirp transmission, which should be treated as novelty. There is also an analysis of the impulse responses measured in motion in a towing tank.

AB A Sustainable Smart City (SSC) has become the largest industrial sector that encompasses advanced cognitive, information, and computing methods for providing better big data handling to enhance the quality of life and urban operations with optimized resource utilization. Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) are used as Air Taxis (ATs) in SSC, bypassing traffic congestion. However, the integration of ATs in SSC is very challenging, seeking high safety and security for the passengers. Such an autonomous system carries vital information, becoming vulnerable to furtive False Data Injection Attacks (FDIA), which have not received considerable research attention heretofore. To address the problem, this article establishes a model-free FDIA employing a recurrent deterministic policy gradient to exploit the data integrity of AT's sensors, leading to collisions. Thereafter, a decentralized threat detection model, a deep optimized attentive federated aggregation learning is deployed, to counteract the threat and protect the data privacy of each AT. The suggested method is parallelizable and can accurately detect an unobservable FDIA in a distributed manner. The simulation findings show that the proposed attack-defense model investigates in-depth system's vulnerabilities and tackles the risk with a higher detection rate and reduced computing cost while maintaining privacy preservation that surpasses modern approaches.

AB With the development of autonomous driving technology and the internet, automotive human-machine interface (HMI) technology has become an important part of contemporary automotive design. Currently, global automakers are designing a variety of innovative in-car HMIs that illustrate the direction of automotive design in the new era from the perspective of technological aesthetics and experience design. However, sleek designs and innovative experience methods must be built on the basis of safety. Therefore, it is necessary to summarize existing research in the field of automotive HMI and construct a literature review of automotive design research. In this paper, literature on automotive HMI from the Scopus database was analyzed using bibliometric methods such as descriptive analysis, keyword co-occurrence, and literature co-citation network analysis. The final mapping analysis revealed that the current automotive HMI research literature primarily focuses on user research, interface research, external environment research, and technology implementation research related to automotive HMI. The three main stages of automotive HMI research include conceptual construction, system and technology refinement, and user perception research from the perspective of driver assistance and information recognition. Additionally, burst detection suggests that future research should focus on driver assistance, trust levels, and e-HMI information communication.

AB Collective behaviours such as swarm formation of autonomous agents offer the advantages of efficient movement, redundancy, and potential for human guidance of a single swarm organism. However, tuning the behaviour of a group of agents so that they swarm, is difficult. Behaviour-bootstrapping algorithms permit agents to self-tune behaviour adapted for their physical form and associated movement constraints. This paper proposes a reinforce-ment learning framework to tune collective motion behaviours from random behaviours. The learning process is guided by a novel reward function capable of autonomously detecting generic collective motion behaviours from sensor data about the relative velocity and position of neighbouring agents. Our reward function is de-signed using a meta-learner trained on a human-labelled collective motion dataset. We demonstrate that our reinforcement learner can tune the behaviour of randomly moving groups so that structured collective motion emerges. We compare our framework to an existing developmental evolutionary framework for this purpose. Our results demonstrate that the proposed learning framework can generate behaviours with different collective motion characteristics more quickly than existing approaches. In addition, the trained reinforcement learner can tune the behaviour of robots with movement characteristics that it has not been trained on.

AB The formation control problem for leader-follower wheeled mobile robots (WMRs) is investigated in this article. A formation control strategy is proposed based on the embedded control technique. Different from the conventional design philosophy of designing the formation controller based on the formation tracking errors directly, the proposed strategy decomposes the formation control task into two subtasks. One is the virtual signal generator (i.e., virtual follower) design, and the other is the trajectory tracking controller design. The virtual signal generator is devised to act as a virtual follower such that it ``achieves'' the desired formation control goal, whose output is taken as the reference trajectory for the follower. To solve the subtask of trajectory tracking controller design, an unconstrained controller and a constrained controller with saturated velocities are designed, respectively. A rigorous stability analysis of the closed-loop system is given under these two kinds of controllers. Comparative simulations and experiments among the unconstrained controller with higher gains/lower gains and the constrained controller are given to illustrate the feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed formation control strategy.

AB Simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) is one of the key technologies used in sweepers, autonomous vehicles, virtual reality and other fields. This paper presents a dense three-channel color images composed of red, green and blue and depth images SLAM reconstruction algorithm based on convolutional neural network (CNN) of multi-layer image invariant feature transformation. The main contribution of the system lies in the construction of a CNN based on multi-layer image invariant feature, which optimized the extraction of Oriented FAST and Rotated Brief(ORB) feature points and the reconstruction effect. After the feature point matching, pose estimation, loop detection and other steps, the 3D point clouds were finally spliced to construct a complete and smooth spatial model. The system can improve the accuracy and robustness in feature point processing and pose estimation. Comparative experiments show that the optimized algorithm saves 0.093 s compared to the ordinary extraction algorithm while guaranteeing a high accuracy rate at the same time. The results of reconstruction experiments show that the spatial models have more clear details, smoother connection with no fault layers than the original ones. The reconstruction results are generally better than other common algorithms, such as Kintinuous, Elasticfusion and ORBSLAM2 dense reconstruction.

AB To reduce congestion, environmental damage, and negative health impact in large urban areas plenty of novel concepts for last-mile distribution have been innovated in the recent years. The concept treated in this paper are mobile parcel lockers that are able to change their locations during the day, either autonomously or moved by a human driver. By relocating lockers their reach towards addressees also varying their whereabouts over the day can be increased. This paper optimizes the changing locations of lockers, such that customers are at some time during the planning horizon within a predefined range of their designated locker. Our aim is to minimize the locker fleet when satisfying all customers. We formulate the resulting mobile locker location problem and provide suited exact solution procedures. To asses the potential whether mobile lockers are a promising last-mile concept, worth the investment required to develop it to a market-ready solution, we benchmark the necessary fleet size of mobile lockers with the required number of their stationary counterparts. Our results show that considerable reductions are possible. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB The effects of climate-driven ocean change on reef habitat-forming species are diverse(1,2) and can be deleterious to the structure and functioning of seafloor communities(3-5). Although responses of shallow coral- or seaweed-based reef communities to environmental changes are a focus of ecological research in the coastal zone(1,4-6), the ecology of habitat-forming organisms on deeper mesophotic reefs remains poorly known. These reefs are typically highly biodiverses(7,8) and productive as a result of massive nutrient recycling(9). Based on seafloor imagery obtained from an autonomous underwater vehicle(8), we related change in community composition on deep reefs (30-90 m) across a latitudinal gradient (25-45 degrees S) in southeastern Australia to high-resolution environmental and oceanographic data, and predicted future changes using downscaled climate change projections for the 2060s(10-12). This region is recognized as a global hotspot for ocean warming(13). The models show an overall tropicalization trend in these deep temperate reef communities, but different functional groups associate differentially to environmental drivers and display a diversity of responses to projected ocean change. We predict the emergence of novel deep-reef assemblages by the 2060s that have no counterpart on reefs today, which is likely to underpin shifts in biodiversity and ecosystem functioning.

AB Traffic sign recognition (TSR) is considered as one of the most important modules of driver assistance system (DAS). It can be used as a decision supporting tool for driver and autonomous vehicles. Eventually, TSR is a large-scale feature learning problem and hence attracted the attention of researchers recently. The essential parameters such as huge training dataset size, recognition accuracy and computational complexity need to be considered while designing a practical TSR system. In this paper, we have used higher order spectra (HOS) coupled with texture based features to develop an efficient TSR model. These features represent the shape and content of the traffic signs clearly. Then a subspace learning method with graph embedding under linear discriminant analysis framework is used to increase the discrimination power between various traffic symbols. As a result the proposed method attained a maximum recognition accuracy of 98.89%. The proposed method is evaluated using two publicly available datasets such as, Belgium traffic sign classification (BTSC) and German traffic sign recognition benchmark (GTSRB). Our experimental results demonstrate that the proposed approach is computationally efficient and shows promising recognition accuracy. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB This paper describes the design of new centralized acceleration-based controllers for the multitask problem of motion planning and control of a coordinated lead-carrier team fixed in a dual-formation within an obstacle-ridden environment. A d phi-strategy, where d and phi are Euclidean measures with respect to the lead robot, is developed to ensure virtual connectivity of the carrier robots to the lead robot. This connectivity, built into the system itself, inherently ensures globally rigid formation between each lead-carrier pair of the team. Moreover, a combination of target configuration, d phi-strategy, orientation consensus, and avoidance of end-effector of robots results in a second, locally rigid formation (not infinitesimally rigid). Therefore, for the first time, a dual-formation control problem of a lead-carrier team of mobile manipulators is considered. This and other kinodynamic constraints have been treated simultaneously via the overarching Lyapunov-based control scheme, essentially a potential field method favored in the field of robotics. The formulation of this new scheme, demonstrated effectively via computer simulations, is timely, given that the current proposed engineering solutions, allowing autonomous vehicles on public roads, include the development of special lanes imbued with special sensors and wireless technologies.

AB Vertical distribution of bioluminescent organisms throughout the water column in the Porcupine Seabight and Porcupine Abyssal plain area of the NE Atlantic Ocean was measured using a free-falling autonomous vehicle equipped with a high-sensitivity video system viewing stimulated flashes of light from impacts on a mesh screen. Data were recorded from 500 m depth down to the sea floor at depths from 740 to 4808 m during spring and autumn of 2001 and 2002. Bioluminescent organisms decreased in abundance from a maximum of 80 m(-3) at 600 m depth to a mean of 0.5 to 1.2 m(-3) at depths greater than 3000 m. During autumn, a seasonally enhanced peak of abundance (mean 27.19 m(-3), compared with 7.52 m(-3) in spring) centred at 1420 m within the depth range of occurrence of Mediterranean intermediate water. It is hypothesised that this bioluminescent layer reflects seasonal increase in deep pelagic biomass fed by downward transport of organic matter following the spring peak of primary production in the surface layers. The bioluminescent layer is a large-scale regional phenomenon extending over 100s of kilometres.

AB Although vision-based drowsiness detection approaches have achieved great success on empirically organized datasets, it remains far from being satisfactory for deployment in practice. One crucial issue lies in the scarcity and lack of datasets that represent the actual challenges in real-world applications, e.g. tremendous variation and aggregation of visual signs, challenges brought on by different camera positions and camera types. To promote research in this field, we introduce a new large-scale dataset, FatigueView, that is collected by both RGB and infrared (IR) cameras from five different positions. It contains real sleepy driving videos and various visual signs of drowsiness from subtle to obvious, e.g. with 17,403 different yawning sets totaling more than 124 million frames, far more than recent actively used datasets. We also provide hierarchical annotations for each video, ranging from spatial face landmarks and visual signs to temporal drowsiness locations and levels to meet different research requirements. We structurally evaluate representative methods to build viable baselines. With FatigueView, we would like to encourage the community to adapt computer vision models to address practical real-world concerns, particularly the challenges posed by this dataset.

AB There is a strong trend in the development of control systems for multi-rotor unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), where minimization of a control signal effort is conducted to extend the flight time. The aim of this article is to shed light on the problem of shaping control signals in terms of energy-optimal flights. The synthesis of a UAV autonomous control system with a brain emotional learning based intelligent controller (BELBIC) is presented. The BELBIC, based on information from the feedback loop of the reference signal tracking system, shows a high learning ability to develop an appropriate control action with low computational complexity. This extends the capabilities of commonly used fixed-value proportional-integral-derivative controllers in a simple but efficient manner. The problem of controller tuning is treated here as a problem of optimization of the cost function expressing control signal effort and maximum precision flight. The article introduces several techniques (bio-inspired metaheuristics) that allow for quick self-tuning of the controller parameters. The performance of the system is comprehensively analyzed based on results of the experiments conducted for the quadrotor model.

TI Quantifying Location Privacy for Navigation Services in Sustainable

   quantification
AB Current connected and autonomous vehicles will contribute to various and green vehicular services. However, sharing personal data with untrustworthy Navigation Service Providers (NSPs) raises serious location concerns. To address this issue, many Location Privacy-Preserving Mechanisms (LPPMs) have been proposed. In addition, several quantification methods have been designed to help understand location privacy and illustrate how location privacy is leaked. However, their assessment is insufficient due to the incomplete assumptions about the adversary's model. In particular, users tend to request the same navigation routes from home to workplace and acquire traffic information along the route. An adversary can collect the coordinates of adjacent locations and infer the two true locations. In this paper, we provide a formal framework for the analysis of LPPMs in navigation services. Our framework captures extra information that is available to an adversary performing localization attacks. By formalizing the adversary's performance, we also propose and justify two new metrics to quantify location privacy in navigation services, namely accuracy and visibility. We assess the efficacy of two popular LPPMs for location privacy, i.e., differential privacy and k-anonymity. Experimental results demonstrate that the adversary can recover users' locations with a high probability.

TI Anti-misalignment and lightweight magnetic coupler with H-shaped
   receiver structure for AUV wireless power transfer
SO IET POWER ELECTRONICS
LA English
DT Article
ID UNDERWATER; DESIGN
AB Inductive power transmission technology provides a new way to solve the energy problem of autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs). The performance of the magnetic coupler determines the system transfer capacity. A novel open-type magnetic coupler with a simple structure, lightweight, strong anti-misalignment performance and high self-inductance stability is proposed for the arc-shaped shell of AUV. The proposed magnetic coupler employs an arc-shaped transmitter and the receiver uses an H-shaped ferrite core to realize the close coupling of magnetic flux in the vertical direction. The parameters of the magnetic coupler are optimized based on ANSYS Maxwell simulation, which ensures its coupling performance and anti-misalignment performance while minimizing the volume and weight of the receiver. To verify the proposal, a wireless charging system with a 183.9 g receiver is built. The maximum self-inductance change rate of the coil and maximum coupling coefficient change rate under the conditions of axial misalignment from -25 mm to 25 mm and rotational misalignment from -10 degrees to 10 degrees are 2.9% and 14.3%, respectively. In the case of full alignment, it can deliver 735.6 W at a DC-DC efficiency of 90.87%.

AB In this study, to cope with time-varying delay in acoustic communication under non-Gaussian noise caused by outliers, a novel robust delay filtering algorithm is proposed for cooperative localization of autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs). First, the modified measurement equations of the nonlinear cooperative location system with time-varying delay are derived, and the delay caused by the information processing and propagation of the underwater acoustic modem is converted into measurement bias. Second, to improve the robustness of the system with outliers caused by abnormal measurement values of underwater acoustic communication and Doppler velocity log (DVL), the statistical similarity measure (SSM) is introduced to construct the cost function. This is accomplished by quantifying the similarity between the state vector and the predicted state vector, similarity between the delay measurement, and modified predicted delay measurement. Finally, the modified measurement noise variance is obtained by maximizing the cost function, and two algorithms for the approximate solution of the nonlinear cost function are presented. The proposed robust delayed algorithm alleviates the impacts of delayed measurement with outliers on localization accuracy. The effectiveness and potential of the proposed filter are verified by lake trials.

AB Frost is a natural disaster that can cause catastrophic damages in agriculture, while traditional temperature monitoring in orchards has disadvantages such as being imprecise and laborious, which can lead to inadequate or wasteful frost protection treatments. In this article, we presented a heating requirement assessment methodology for frost protection in an apple orchard utilizing unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)-based thermal and RGB cameras. A thermal image stitching algorithm using the BRISK feature was developed for creating georeferenced orchard temperature maps, which attained a sub-centimeter map resolution and a stitching speed of 100 thermal images within 30 s. YOLOv4 classifiers for six apple flower bud growth stages in various network sizes were trained based on 5040 RGB images, and the best model achieved a 71.57% mAP for a test dataset consisted of 360 images. A flower bud mapping algorithm was developed to map classifier detection results into dense growth stage maps utilizing RGB image geoinformation. Heating requirement maps were created using artificial flower bud critical temperatures to simulate orchard heating demands during frost events. The results demonstrated the feasibility of the proposed orchard heating requirement determination methodology, which has the potential to be a critical component of an autonomous, precise frost management system in future studies.

ID DRIVER DISTRACTION
AB The distracted phone-use behaviours among pedestrians, like Texting, Game Playing and Phone Calls, have caused increasing fatalities and injuries. However, the research of phone-related distracted behaviour by pedestrians has not been systemically studied. It is desired to improve both the driving and pedestrian safety by automatically discovering the phone-related pedestrian distracted behaviours. Herein, a new computer vision-based method is proposed to detect the phone-related pedestrian distracted behaviours from a view of intelligent and autonomous driving. Specifically, the first end-to-end deep learning based Two-Branch Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) is designed for this task. Taking one synchronised image pair by two front on-car GoPro cameras as the inputs, the proposed two-branch CNN will extract features for each camera, fuse the extracted features and perform a robust classification. This method can also be easily extended to video-based classification by confidence accumulation and voting. A new benchmark dataset of 448 synchronised video pairs of 53,760 images collected on a vehicle is proposed for this research. The experimental results show that using two synchronised cameras obtained better performance than using one single camera. Finally, the proposed method achieved an overall best classification accuracy of 84.3% on the new benchmark when compared to other methods.

AB When operating a conditionally automated vehicle, humans occasionally have to take over control. If the driver is out of the loop, a certain amount of time is necessary to gain situation awareness. This work evaluates the potential of stereoscopic 3D (S3D) dashboards for presenting smart S3D take-over-requests (TORs) to support situation assessment. In a driving simulator study with a 4 x 2 between-within design, we presented 3 smart TORs showing the current traffic situation and a baseline TOR in 2D and S3D to 52 participants doing the n-back task. We further investigate if non-standard locations affect the results. Take-over performance indicates that participants looked at and processed the TORs' visual information and by that, could perform more safe take-overs. S3D warnings in general, as well as warnings appearing at the participants' focus of attention and warnings at the instrument cluster, performed best. We conclude that visual warnings, presented on an S3D dashboard, can be a valid option to support take-over while not increasing workload. We further discuss participants' gaze behavior in the context of visual warnings for automotive user interfaces.

AB Autonomous vehicles, smart manufacturing, heterogeneous systems, and new high-performance embedded computing (HPEC) applications can benefit from the reuse of code coming from the high-performance computing world. However, unlike for HPC, energy efficiency is critical in embedded systems, especially when running on battery power. Code base from HPC mostly relies on the message passing interface (MPI) message passing runtime to deal with distributed systems. MPI has been designed primarily for performance and not for energy efficiency. One drawback is the way messages are received, in an energy-consuming busy-wait fashion. In this work, we study a simple approach in which receiving processes are put to sleep instead of constantly polling. We implement this strategy at the user level to be transparent to the MPI runtime and the application. Experiments are conducted with OpenMPI, MPICH, and MPC, using a video processing application and a software-distributed shared memory system deployed over two heterogeneous platforms, including the Christmann RECS|Box Antares Microserver. Results show significant energy savings. In some particular cases involving process colocation, we also observe better performance using our strategy which can be explained by a better sharing of the computing resource.

AB This paper proposes a saturated output-feedback trajectory tracking controller for an autonomous tractor with N-trailer with guaranteed desired performance specifications. At first, an input-output model of the tractor with N-trailer system is presented by a proper selection of the output variables vector. Based on a prescribed performance technique, a nonlinear transformation between the constrained errors to unconstrained ones is used to develop an open-loop error dynamic model in terms of the unconstrained filtered tracking error. Then, a saturated neural adaptive input-output feedback linearizing controller with a nonlinear observer is proposed to stabilize the tracking errors to the vicinities of the zero with a guaranteed prescribed performance in the presence of model uncertainties while avoiding the velocity measurements and reducing the risk of the actuator saturation simultaneously. Finally, a semi-global uniform ultimate boundedness stability of the closed-loop control system is proved via Lyapunov's direct method. At last, a computer simulation example will be provided to demonstrate the controller effectiveness for practical applications. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Future autonomous spacecraft rendezvous with uncooperative or unprepared objects will be enabled by vision-based navigation, which imposes great computational challenges. Targeting short duration missions in low Earth orbit, this paper develops high-performance avionics supporting custom computer vision algorithms of increased complexity for satellite pose tracking. At algorithmic level, we track 6D pose by rendering a depth image from an object mesh model and robustly matching edges detected in the depth and intensity images. At system level, we devise an architecture to exploit the structure of commercial system-on-chip FPGAs, i.e., Zynq7000, and the benefits of tightly coupling VHDL accelerators with CPU-based functions. At implementation level, we employ our custom HW/SW co-design methodology and an elaborate combination of digital circuit design techniques to optimize and map efficiently all functions to a compact embedded device. Providing significant performance per watt improvement, the resulting VBN system achieves a throughput of 10-14 FPS for 1 Mpixel images, with only 4.3 watts mean power and 1U size, while tracking ENVISAT in real-time with only 0.5% mean positional error.

AB Pedestrian detection is a critical perception task for autonomous driving and intelligent vehicle, and it is challenging due to the potential variation of appearance and pose of human beings as well as the partial occlusion. In this paper, we present a novel pedestrian detection method via four-layer laser scanner. The proposed approach deals with the occlusion problem by fusing the segment classification results with past knowledge integration from tracking process. First, raw point cloud is segmented into the clusters of independent objects. Then, three types of features are proposed to capture the comprehensive cues, and 18 effective features are extracted with the combination of the univariate feature selection algorithm and feature correlation analysis process. Next, based on the segment classification at individual frame, the track classification is conducted further for consecutive frames using particle filter and probability data association filter. Experimental results demonstrate that both back-propagation neural network and Adaboost classifiers based on 18 selected features have their own advantages at the segment classification stage in terms of pedestrian detection performance and computation time, and the track classification procedure can improve the detection performance particularly for partially occluded pedestrians in comparison with the single segment classification procedure.

DT Article
ID ALGORITHM; RANGE
AB This paper considers the problem of estimating the trajectory of an autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) via a single passive receiver, without any anchor nodes or receiving arrays, and with the only help of a sequence of known acoustic signals emitted by the AUV. This scenario is of interest in case multilateration-based alternatives would require the deployment of many receivers and imply exceedingly high costs, e.g., for the coverage of wide areas. The proposed method exploits the knowledge of environmental parameters such as the sound speed profile, bathymetry and bottom sediments in order to estimate the location of the AUV, taking advantage of the spatial dependency of channel impulse responses that arises from the diverse bathymetry around the receiver. This dependency is captured by comparing channel estimates against a database of channel responses, pre-computed through an acoustic propagation model. This yields multiple likely AUV locations, which are filtered via a path tracking method similar to the Viterbi algorithm, in order to estimate the trajectory of the AUV. Results obtained both from simulations and from a sea experiment show that the proposed method can estimate node locations and paths with a small error, especially considering the use of a single receiver.

AB The recent advances in state estimation, perception, and navigation algorithms have significantly contributed to the ubiquitous use of quadrotors for inspection, mapping, and aerial imaging. To further increase the versatility of quadrotors, recent works investigated the use of an adaptive morphology, which consists of modifying the shape of the vehicle during flight to suit a specific task or environment. However, these works either increase the complexity of the platform or decrease its controllability. In this letter, we propose a novel, simpler, yet effective morphing design for quadrotors consisting of a frame with four independently rotating arms that fold around the main frame. To guarantee stable flight at all times, we exploit an optimal control strategy that adapts on the fly to the drone morphology. We demonstrate the versatility of the proposed adaptive morphology in different tasks, such as negotiation of narrow gaps, close inspection of vertical surfaces, and object grasping and transportation. The experiments are performed on an actual, fully autonomous quadrotor relying solely on onboard visual-inertial sensors and compute. No external motion tracking systems and computers are used. This is the first work showing stable flight without requiring any symmetry of the morphology.

AB Search and tracking is the problem of locating a moving target and following it to its destination. In this work, we consider a scenario in which the target moves across a large geographical area by following a road network and the search is performed by a team of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs). We formulate search and tracking as a combinatorial optimization problem and prove that the objective function is submodular. We exploit this property to devise a greedy algorithm. Although this algorithm does not offer strong theoretical guarantees because of the presence of temporal constraints that limit the feasibility of the solutions, it presents remarkably good performance, especially when several UAVs are available for the mission. As the greedy algorithm suffers when resources are scarce, we investigate two alternative optimization techniques: Constraint Programming (CP) and AI planning. Both approaches struggle to cope with large problems, and so we strengthen them by leveraging the greedy algorithm. We use the greedy solution to warm start the CP model and to devise a domain-dependent heuristic for planning. Our extensive experimental evaluation studies the scalability of the different techniques and identifies the conditions under which one approach becomes preferable to the others.

AB A novel nonlinear attitude error model based on square root cubature information filter (SR-CIF) is proposed aiming to speed up the convergence rate of DVL-aided strapdown inertial navigation system (SINS) in-motion initial alignment for autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) when both large initial heading error and large initial level attitude errors exist The new nonlinear attitude error model and measurement model are applicable for initial alignment after a short-time coarse alignment with large attitude errors exist. The SR-CIF embeds the whole iterative process into the data structure framework of the information filtering, replacing the covariance matrix in the square root cubature Kalman filter (SR-CKF) with an information matrix which simplifies the filter initialization. The square root technology ensures the symmetry and positive definiteness of the information matrix with enhanced stability of the filter. The simulation and experimental results indicate that the proposed DVL-aided alignment filter is effective with large initial attitude errors. The rate of convergence and estimation accuracy of the SR-CIF is higher than that of the conventional SR-CKF with large attitude misalignments.

AB Responsive materials, which can adapt and operate autonomously under dynamic conditions, are a stepping stone towards functional, life-like systems inspired by fueled self-assembly processes in nature. Complex coacervate core micelles (C3Ms) comprising oppositely charged macromolecules constitute a novel class of polymeric micelles ideally suited for use as responsive nanoscopic delivery vehicles of hydrophilic and hydrophobic cargo. To fully exploit their potential, it is important that the C3Ms form and fall apart in an autonomous fashion as orchestrated by dynamic cues in their environment. Herein a means to temporally program the self-regulated C3M coassembly pathway, using a modulated base-catalyzed feedback system, is presented. Incorporated in the C3Ms is a pH responsive polyfluorene-based conjugated polyelectrolyte (CPF) as a building block and trace amounts of a molecular sensor (doxorubicin HCl) as cargo, both of which report on micellar coassembly and disassembly via binding-induced fluorescence quenching. CPF additionally reports on the pH of its microenvironment as its pH-dependent conformational states are mirrored in the transitions of its vibronic bands. This experimental design enables one to monitor solution pH, C3M disassembly and reassembly, as well as cargo release and recapture noninvasively in a closed system with real time florescence experiments.

AB This paper presents the formulation of a flocking control algorithm for a group of autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs). A leader-follower control strategy is employed to flock a group of AUVs along a predefined desired path. In this approach, leader AUVs are assumed to have global knowledge of the desired trajectory and the follower AUVs are not provided with this information. For keeping all the AUVs connected in a group, a flocking center is estimated. This flocking center is a virtual point whose position at any instant of time can he predicted by using a consensus algorithm. The controllers for the leader and follower AUVs are developed by implementing mathematical and fuzzy artificial potential functions. A group of four AUVs is considered for analyzing the efficacy of the developed control algorithm. Simulations are carried out both in obstacle-free and obstacle-rich environments. From the obtained results, it is observed that the proposed fuzzy flocking control algorithm provides effective cooperative motion control of multiple AUVs along the desired paths and avoid obstacles successively. It is also observed that the flocking controller developed based on fuzzy artificial potential function outperforms the controller with mathematical potential functions despite uncertainties owing to external disturbances.

AB Obstacle avoidance is a necessary behavior to guarantee the safety of an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV). However, it is a challenge for the UAV to detect and avoid high-speed flying obstacles such as other UAVs or birds. In this paper, we propose a generic framework that integrates an autonomous obstacle detection module and a reinforcement learning (RL) module to develop reactive obstacle avoidance behavior for a UAV. In the obstacle detection module, we design a saliency detection algorithm using deep convolution neural networks (CNNs) to extract monocular visual cues. The algorithm imitates human's visual detection system, and it can accurately estimate the location of obstacles in the field of view (FOV). The RL module uses an actor-critic structure that chooses the RBF neural network to approximate the value function and control policy in continuous state and action spaces. We have tested the effectiveness of the proposed learning framework in a semi-physical experiment. The results show that the proposed saliency detection algorithm performs better than state-of-the-art, and the RL algorithm can learn the avoidance behavior from the manual experiences.

ID MARINE; INVASIONS
AB In recent years, the Pterois Volitans, also known as the red lionfish, has become a serious threat by rapidly invading US coastal waters. Being a fierce predator, having no natural predator, being adaptive to different habitats, and being with high reproduction rates, the red lionfish has enervated current endeavors to control their population. This paper focuses on the first steps to reinforce these efforts by employing autonomous vehicles. To that end, an assistive underwater robotic scheme is designed to aid spear-hunting divers to locate and more efficiently hunt the lionfish. A small-sized, open source ROV with an integrated camera is programmed using Deep Learning methods to detect red lionfish in real time. Dives are restricted to a certain depth range, time, and air supply. The ROV program is designed to allow the divers to locate the red lionfish before each dive, so that they can plan their hunt to maximize their catch. Lightweight, portability, user-friendly interface, energy efficiency, and low cost of maintenance are some advantages of the proposed scheme. The developed system's performance is examined in areas currently invaded by the red lionfish in the Gulf of Mexico. The ROV has shown success in detecting the red lionfish with high confidence in real time.

AB Nowadays, the field of mobile robotics is experiencing a quick evolution, and a variety of autonomous vehicles is available to solve different tasks. The advances in computer vision have led to a substantial increase in the use of cameras as the main sensors in mobile robots. They can be used as the only source of information or in combination with other sensors such as odometry or laser. Among vision systems, omnidirectional sensors stand out due to the richness of the information they provide the robot with, and an increasing number of works about them have been published over the last few years, leading to a wide variety of frameworks. In this review, some of the most important works are analysed. One of the key problems the scientific community is addressing currently is the improvement of the autonomy of mobile robots. To this end, building robust models of the environment and solving the localization and navigation problems are three important abilities that any mobile robot must have. Taking it into account, the review concentrates on these problems; how researchers have addressed them by means of omnidirectional vision; the main frameworks they have proposed; and how they have evolved in recent years.

ID OPTIMIZATION; MECHANISM; MODEL
AB Swimming, turning, and whip-sweeping propulsion for carangiform locomotion of a fish robot are investigated by means of a 4-link planar tail and an autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV)-like model. It is observed that excellent acceleration occurs when a whip sweeping behavior has been applied to the fish tail. The forward speed can even increases twice to the nominal swimming via the simulation study. The efficient movement is thus incorporated to the fish robot for agile movement. The robot's swimming patterns realize the effect in terms of the forward swimming, turning swimming, acceleration increasing, descended swimming, ascended swimming, depth regulating, and self-stabilization. Verification is accomplished by incorporating the 4-link planar tail, AUV-like model, and a two degree-of-freedom (DOF) barycenter mechanism. The four-link planar tail and 2-DOF barycenter mechanism act, respectively, as the thrust generator and stabilizing actuator for the fish robot. Sliding mode control (SMC) has been applied for three-dimensional (3D) trajectory tracking. Simulation results illustrate satisfactory performances of the fish robot in terms of the fish-like behaviors and maneuverability, which are due to the consequence of the mimicked predator-fish behaviors and performance robustness of the SMC for trajectory tracking under ocean current perturbations and modeling uncertainties.

AB In this paper, we present a novel probabilistic generative model for multi-object traffic scene understanding from movable platforms which reasons jointly about the 3D scene layout as well as the location and orientation of objects in the scene. In particular, the scene topology, geometry, and traffic activities are inferred from short video sequences. Inspired by the impressive driving capabilities of humans, our model does not rely on GPS, lidar, or map knowledge. Instead, it takes advantage of a diverse set of visual cues in the form of vehicle tracklets, vanishing points, semantic scene labels, scene flow, and occupancy grids. For each of these cues, we propose likelihood functions that are integrated into a probabilistic generative model. We learn all model parameters from training data using contrastive divergence. Experiments conducted on videos of 113 representative intersections show that our approach successfully infers the correct layout in a variety of very challenging scenarios. To evaluate the importance of each feature cue, experiments using different feature combinations are conducted. Furthermore, we show how by employing context derived from the proposed method we are able to improve over the state-of-the-art in terms of object detection and object orientation estimation in challenging and cluttered urban environments.

AB This paper presents an approach to the challenging issue of passive source localization in shallow water using a mobile short horizontal linear array with length less than ten meters. The short array can be conveniently placed on autonomous underwater vehicles and deployed for adaptive spatial sampling. However, the use of such small aperture passive sonar systems makes it difficult to acquire sufficient spatial gain for localizing long-range sources. To meet the requirement, a localization approach that employs matched-field based techniques that enable the short horizontal linear array is used to passively localize acoustic sources in shallow water. Furthermore, the broadband processing and inter-position processing provide robustness against ocean environmental mismatch and enhance the stability of the estimation process. The proposed approach's ability to localize acoustic sources in shallow water at different signal-to-noise ratios is examined through the synthetic test cases where the sources are located at the endfire and some other bearing of the mobile short horizontal linear array. The presented results demonstrate that the positional parameters of the estimated source build up over time as the array moves at a low speed along a straight line at a constant depth.

DT Article
ID MARS ODYSSEY AEROBRAKING; ACCELEROMETER DATA; GLOBAL SURVEYOR
AB Aerobraking is a proven method of significantly increasing fire science payload that can be placed into low Mars orbits when compared to an all propulsive capture. However the aerobraking phase is long and has mission cost and risk implications. The main cost benefit is that aerobraking permits the use of a smaller and cheaper launch vehicle, but additional operational costs are incurred during the long aerobraking phase. Risk is increased due to the repeated thermal loading of spacecraft components and the multiple attitude kind propulsive maneuvers required for successful aerobraking. Both the cost and risk burdens can be significantly reduced by automating the aerobraking operations phase. All of the previous Mars orbiter missions that have used aerobraking have increasingly relied on onboard calculations during aerobraking. Even though the tempearature of spacecraft components has been the limiting factor, operational methods have relied on using a surrogate variable for mission control. This paper describes several methods, based directly on space craft component maximum temperature, tor autonomously predicting the subsequent aerobraking, orbits and prescribing apoapsis propulsive maneuvers to maintain the spacecraft within specified temperature limits. Specifically, this paper describes the rise of thermal response surface analysis in predicting the temperature of the spacecraft components and the corresponding uncertainty in this temperature prediction.

AB We examined the role of turbulence on the evolution of the spatial structure of a thin phytoplankton layer. The approach used the small autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV), T-REMUS (turbulence-remote environmental measuring units), which is equipped with optical and physical micro- and tine-scale sensors. As part of the Layered Organization in the Coastal Ocean (LOCO) experiment, T-REMUS was deployed in a very shallow region of Monterey Bay, California, USA, over an 8 h nighttime period in summer 2006. A thin layer of chlorophyll a (chl a) was observed throughout the entire experimental period. The center of the thin layer deepened with time, crossed isotherms, and then settled into a strong turbulence layer. This result is in sharp contrast to previous conclusions that biological thin layers only occur in regions of weak turbulence. Our observations indicated that the turbulence field itself was constrained to be in a thin layer by the surrounding strong density stratification. The chl a material, acting as a passive Lagrangian tracer, became embedded within the turbulent field. With time, both the turbulent field and the embedded chl a thin layer were observed to collapse vertically.

To provide depth information, 3D object detection involves the application of depth-perceiving sensors such as LiDAR, stereo cameras, RGB-D, RADAR, etc. The existing review articles on 3D object detection techniques are found to be focusing on either a singular modality (e.g., only LiDAR point cloud-based) or a singular application field (e.g., autonomous vehicle navigation). However, to the best of our knowledge, there is no review paper that discusses the applicability of 3D object detection techniques in other fields such as agriculture, robot vision or human activity detection. This study analyzes both singular and multimodal techniques of 3D object detection techniques applied in different fields. A critical analysis comprising strengths and weaknesses of the 3D object detection techniques is presented. The aim of this study is to facilitate future researchers and practitioners to provide a holistic view of 3D object detection techniques. The critical analysis of the singular and multimodal techniques is expected to help the practitioners find the appropriate techniques based on their requirement.

ID ILLUMINATION
AB Depth estimation based on a single RGB image (a.k.a. monocular depth estimation) is a challenging task, with applications in robotics, autonomous vehicles, and other areas. With the advance of deep learning, several monocular depth estimation approaches have emerged with remarkable results. However, it is still possible to observe deficiencies in the depth maps generated by current techniques. We present a deep neural network that takes the result produced by some existing monocular depth estimation approach and enhances it by adding the details that the depth map requires to be sharp. We train the proposed Depth Enhancer Neural Network (DENN) using a new loss function that compares the input color image of the scene to the color image produced by rendering it using the Phong reflection model. Our experiments show a clear visual improvement in the sharpness of the depth image produced by the DENN, leading to edge enhancement and regularity of planar surfaces without compromising non-planar objects. On average, the standard metrics show a 5% reduction in error when considering the quantitative results. This reduction is dependent on the initial monocular depth estimation technique used by DENN to train the model.

AB Autonomous driving heavily relies on light detection and ranging (LiDAR) and camera sensors, which can significantly improve the performance of perception and navigation tasks when fused together. The success of this cross-modality fusion hinges on accurate extrinsic calibration. In recent years, targetless LiDAR-camera calibration methods have gained increasing attention, thanks to their independence from external targets. Nevertheless, developing a targetless method for low-resolution LiDARs remains challenging due to the difficulty in extracting reliable features from point clouds with limited LiDAR beams. In this article, we propose a robust targetless method to solve this struggling problem. It can automatically estimate accurate LiDAR and camera poses and solve the extrinsic matrix through hand-eye calibration. Moreover, we also carefully analyze pose estimation issues existing in the low-resolution LiDAR and present our solution. Real-world experiments are carried out on an unmanned ground vehicle (UGV)-mounted multisensor platform containing a charged-coupled device (CCD) camera and a VLP-16 LiDAR. For evaluation, we use a state-of-the-art target-based calibration approach to generate the ground truth extrinsic parameters. Experimental results demonstrate that our method achieves low calibration error in both translation (3 cm) and rotation (0.59 degrees).

AB This paper investigates the high-precision path following of underactuated ships suffering from stochastic sea loads, where a novel adaptive neural network asymptotic control framework is fabricated. Based on the nonlinear 3-degree-of-freedom (3-DOF) motion model of the underactuated ship, the stochastic ship motion model is established by involving both unknown deterministic and stochastic disturbances, which is chosen as the control objective. To transform path following to tracking control, a novel virtual ship guidance approach is fabricated with generating smooth reference signals. Through the control scheme, the radial-basis-function neural networks (RBF NNs) are employed to approximate the total marine uncertainties. By introducing integral-bounded functions to control laws and adaptive laws, the asymptotic convergence of positional tracking errors is guaranteed with the aid of adaptive backstepping control. To ensure the computational simplicity, the adaptive laws are fabricated with the minimum learning parameters (MLPs). Via the important inequality of the neural basis function, the "algebraic loop"problem is successfully solved, such that the control logicality is guaranteed. Finally, the numerical experiments validate the high-precision tracking performance of the proposed scheme.

AB Thermography from unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV) is widely used for module condition surveys and defect detection in solar (photovoltaic) power plants. This article presents an optimized defect inspection procedure in which a two-stage autonomous flight strategy is adopted to reduce the operation time, and thereby the cost. The first stage is a fast high-altitude flight for rapid coverage of the entire plant. The resolution on the modules is then somewhat degraded, but adequate for detection of possible defect locations. In the second stage, an optimized flight path is calculated to revisit and image only the detected locations from a lower altitude, where the resolution is sufficient for the classification of defects. This concept is studied through simulations of different plant geometries and defect densities. The simulations are supported by actual data, including a plant-scale survey. The proposed strategy is shown to have the potential for significant savings in operation time, on the order of 60% in the experimental case with 2% module defects. Commonly reported defect densities of 0.5% to 1% will give even larger savings. The inspection strategy is shown to be especially beneficial for plant geometries representative of high latitudes.

AB With the development of deep learning, semantic segmentation has received considerable attention within the robotics community. For semantic segmentation to be applied to mobile robots or autonomous vehicles, real-time processing is essential. In this article, a new real-time semantic segmentation network, called the adjacent feature propagation network (AFPNet), is proposed to achieve high performance and fast inference. AFPNet executes in real time on a commercial embedded GPU. The network includes two new modules. The local memory module (LMM) is the first; it improves the upsampling accuracy by propagating the high-level features to the adjacent grids. The cascaded pyramid pooling module (CPPM) is the second; it reduces computational time by changing the structure of the pyramid pooling module. Using these two modules, the proposed AFPNet achieved 76.4% mean intersection-over-union on the Cityscapes test dataset, outperforming other real-time semantic segmentation networks. Furthermore, AFPNet was successfully deployed on an embedded board Jetson AGX Xavier and applied to the real-world navigation of a mobile robot, proving that AFPNet can be effectively used in a variety of real-time applications.

AB Drone is a piece of power-hungry equipment whose battery drains within the first few minutes of its takeoff, and the user has to physically change the battery to a fully charged one. Implementation of wireless power transfer (WPT) in unmanned aerial vehicles has started becoming a reality. However, the technology is prone to many problems, especially misalignment between transmitter and receiver coils. The WPT system faces a sudden decline in power transfer with few millimeters of lateral misalignment between the transmitter and the receiver coil. The proposed sensor-based tracking system creates a two-way communication between the transmitter and the receiver coil systems for exchanging maximum power point information. The transmitter coil is adjusted directly beneath the receiver coil for maximum power transfer. The proposed WPT charging system reduces the misalignment issue by a significant factor and achieves maximum coupling efficiency. At 10 mm vertical distance, 0 mm lateral displacement between transmitter and receiver coils, the system achieved 91.3% power transfer efficiency by wirelessly receiving 70 W of power. The system offers practical, autonomous charging use cases in surveying, agriculture, and mapping applications.

AB Panoptic segmentation of point clouds is a crucial task that enables autonomous vehicles to comprehend their vicinity using their highly accurate and reliable LiDAR sensors. Existing top-down approaches tackle this problem by either combining independent task-specific networks or translating methods from the image domain ignoring the intricacies of LiDAR data and thus often resulting in suboptimal performance. In this article, we present the novel top-down efficient LiDAR panoptic segmentation (EfficientLPS) architecture that addresses multiple challenges in segmenting LiDAR point clouds, including distance-dependent sparsity, severe occlusions, large scale-variations, and reprojection errors. EfficientLPS comprises of a novel shared backbone that encodes with strengthened geometric transformation modeling capacity and aggregates semantically rich range-aware multiscale features. It incorporates new scale-invariant semantic and instance segmentation heads along with the panoptic fusion module which is supervised by our proposed panoptic periphery loss function. Additionally, we formulate a regularized pseudolabeling framework to further improve the performance of EfficientLPS by training on unlabeled data. We benchmark our proposed model on two large-scale LiDAR datasets: nuScenes, for which we also provide ground truth annotations, and SemanticKITTI. Notably, EfficientLPS sets the new state-of-the-art on both these datasets.

AB Segmentation of street scenes is a key technology in the field of autonomous vehicles. However, conventional segmentation methods achieve low accuracy because of the complexity of street landscapes. Therefore, we propose an efficient atrous residual network (EAR-Net) to improve accuracy while maintaining computation costs. First, we performed feature extraction and restoration, utilizing depthwise separable convolution (DSConv) and interpolation. Compared with conventional methods, DSConv and interpolation significantly reduce computation costs while minimizing performance degradation. Second, we utilized residual learning and atrous spatial pyramid pooling (ASPP) to achieve high accuracy. Residual learning increases the ability to extract context information by preventing the problem of feature and gradient losses. In addition, ASPP extracts additional context information while maintaining the resolution of the feature map. Finally, to alleviate the class imbalance between the image background and objects and to improve learning efficiency, we utilized focal loss. We evaluated EAR-Net on the Cityscapes dataset, which is commonly used for street scene segmentation studies. Experimental results showed that the EAR-Net had better segmentation results and similar computation costs as the conventional methods. We also conducted an ablation study to analyze the contributions of the ASPP and DSConv in the EAR-Net.

AB This work proposes a one-dimensional chaotic map with a simple structure and three parameters. The phase portraits, bifurcation diagrams, and Lyapunov exponent diagrams are first plotted to study the dynamical behavior of the map. It is seen that the map exhibits areas of constant chaos with respect to all parameters. This map is then applied to the problem of pseudo-random bit generation using a simple technique to generate four bits per iteration. It is shown that the algorithm passes all statistical NIST and ENT tests, as well as shows low correlation and an acceptable key space. The generated bitstream is applied to the problem of chaotic path planning, for an autonomous robot or generally an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) exploring a given 3D area. The aim is to ensure efficient area coverage, while also maintaining an unpredictable motion. Numerical simulations were performed to evaluate the performance of the path planning strategy, and it is shown that the coverage percentage converges exponentially to 100% as the number of iterations increases. The discrete motion is also adapted to a smooth one through the use of B-Spline curves.

AB Light detection and ranging (LiDAR) sensors can measure the three-dimensional environment by irradiating near-infrared light and measuring the flight time of light scattered from objects. As the demand for three-dimensional measurement and imaging technology for future applications in autonomous vehicles increases, this technology has become increasingly important. In this paper, we propose an ultra-wide field-of-view (FOV) optical system for LiDAR sensors that can sequentially scan the beam emitted by a high-power laser through a compact and inexpensive beam steering system using a micro-actuator with a compact size and a fisheye lens. The proposed optical system for LiDAR sensors consists of a micro-actuator mounted focusing lens for beam steering, a fisheye lens with a wide FOV, and a relay lens to combine the intermediate image planes of the two lens systems effectively. We also proposed an optical system without a relay lens to modify the fisheye lens design to achieve a smaller size. To confirm the theoretical feasibility, we designed a practical optical system for LiDAR sensors with a FOV of approximately 176 degrees, which is much higher than the FOVs of other non-rotating LiDAR sensors.

AB The automotive industry is experiencing a phase of rapid innovation, with emergent technologies underpinning the realisation of self-driving cars, increased use of data and data analytics, sensors to enable car components to connect to the Internet-of-Things and the use of alternative energy sources, such as electric vehicles. Such innovations enable novel services, which in turn require actors within the automotive industry to change their business models. In this paper, we aim to identify novel automotive services that impact business models within the automotive industry. We use Q-methodology to explore and analyse the opinions of researchers and experts from the automotive industry. We find that four groups of services are expected to impact the business models in the automotive industry most: (1) personalised services, (2) generic mobility services; (3) shared mobility, and (4) connected cars. These are services at the level of the end-user, while more fundamental technology-based innovations, such as electrical driving, autonomous driving and Internet-of-Things applications, are scattered over different groups of end-user services. From these results, current business models can be analysed, and possible roadmaps for business model innovation can be developed.

ID LOCALIZATION
AB Nowadays, integration systems based on cameras and LRFs have been applied in many researches on robotics, such as autonomous navigation vehicles, and intelligent transportation systems. The systems using multiple sensors usually require extracting the-relative information of sensors posed, which support for processing. Therefore, the task of calibration of cameras and laser devices is very important. This paper presents an automatic calibration method for determining the relative position and direction of a camera with respect to a laser rangefinder. The calibration method makes use of depth discontinuities of calibration patterns, which emphasizes laser range-beams supporting easy automatic estimation of the occurred position of laser scans on the calibration pattern. The laser range scans are also used for estimating corresponding depth image points from the camera. Finally, the relative parameters between the camera and the laser device are discovered using the set of depth point correspondences of the LRF and the camera. This paper also presents new criterion for evaluating the error of extrinsic parameters estimation based on optimal error of angular deviation between the projection and back-projection of 3D corresponding points. The evaluation results demonstrate outperformance of this method.

AB This paper presents a new computationally efficient S&A algorithm for implementation in real-time applications for UAV. Based on a simplified optimisation approach, the proposed algorithm aims to provide a reliable resolution manoeuvre (horizontal and vertical) for multiple threat scenarios which include both air and ground threats/obstacles. In presence of a conflict risk, the avoidance manoeuvre is defined as step variation in the heading angle or altitude variation of the autopilots command. This step command is optimised in order to keep a minimum distance of separation between the ownship and all threats during the overall manoeuvre. The algorithm computes the separation distance between the UAV and the threats by calculating the future trajectories at each time step of both the ownship and the threat, while always taking into account the ownship performance envelope constraints. The algorithms were validated in simulation, where the ground threats were derived from the ground elevation maps, while for the aerial threats the aircraft communicate their flight data through an ADS-B mode S transponder. The resolution manoeuvre optimisation technique takes about 0.1 second to compute. Hence enabling the algorithm to cope with any rapid changes in the aerial threat trajectory.

ID ICCP
AB Gravity-aided navigation is an effective passive navigation method, which has a promising application in underwater autonomous vehicles. In order to enhance the real-time performance of the gravity matching algorithm, improve the positioning accuracy of the inertial navigation system (INS), reduce the influence of unknown initial position error, and strengthen the applicability of the gravity-aided navigation system. This article proposes a cascade algorithm based on the maximum correlation method and the extended Kalman filter (EKF) for the gravity-aided navigation system. This algorithm obtains the matching result of the maximum correlation method by the mean square difference (MSD) first. Then the result sequence of MSD and the gravity anomaly variation are introduced into the observation equation of the EKF to correct the position of INS. The effect of the initial position error can be reduced by the MSD method, while the EKF algorithm can improve the real-time performance of gravity matching. The postprocessing simulations of the actual ocean experiment show that the gravity-aided navigation cascade algorithm proposed in this article has good precision. And this algorithm also improves the stability and the applicability of the gravity matching algorithm.

AB Fifty years of evolution of transportation research is revisited based on bibliometric indicators of nearly 50,000 articles, the collective publication of all transportation journals. A multitude of objective indicators all consistently determined four major divisions in the field: (i) network analysis and traffic flow, (ii) economics of transportation and logistics, (iii) travel behaviour, and (iv) road safety. Trending themes of research within the abovementioned divisions respectively are: (i) macroscopic fundamental diagram and public transport network design, (ii) nil (no distinct trending topic), (iii) land-use, active transportation, residential self-selection, travel experience/satisfaction, social exclusion and transport/spatial equity, and (iv) statistical modelling of road accidents. Furthermore, clusters of research related to topics of (a) shared mobility, (b) electric mobility, and (c) autonomous mobility constitute trending topics that are each a cross between multiple divisions of the field. These outcomes document major directions to which the transportation research is headed. Additional outcome is determination of influential outsiders, seminal articles published by non-transportation journals that have proven instrumental in the development of transportation science.

AB Automation technology has received great attention recently and been expected to play an important role in future transport systems. Understanding determinants of travellers' intention to use the bus and recommend the service to others is critical to promote such new travel modes. Although previous studies have focused on plausible scenarios based on hypothetical behavioural reactions, predicted adoption intention and recommendation behaviour may not be consistent with those exhibited when the users are exposed to the real automated bus service. Using a panel survey conducted in Stockholm, where an automated bus services is currently operating in the mixed traffic environment on the public road, this study addresses this research gap by investigating public acceptance and usage of these automated buses. Applying a behavioural model, this study explores key influencing factors of automated bus use and word of mouth intention. The results indicate that users' needs and travel demands have a strong power to influence people's intentions to use such a new public travel mode and recommend the service to others. Furthermore, individuals' behaviour intention is found to have no significant effect on actual behaviour in this study, which suggests a gap between intention and action.

AB The negative effects of goods flows realisation are most visible in urban areas as the places of the greatest concentration of economic and social activities. The main goals of this article were to identify the applicable Industry 4.0 technologies for performing various city logistics (CL) operations, establish smart sustainable CL solutions (SSCL) and rank them in order to identify those which will serve as the base points for future plans and strategies for the development of smart cities. This kind of problem requires involvement of multiple stake-holders with their opposing goals and interests, and thus multiple criteria. For solving it, this article proposed a novel hybrid multi-criteria decision-making (MCDM) model, based on BWM (Best-Worst Method) and CODAS (COmbinative Distance-based ASsessment) methods in grey environment. The results of the model application imply that the potentially best SSCL solution is based on the combination of the concepts of micro-consolidation centres and autonomous vehicles with the support of artificial intelligence and Internet of Things technologies. The main contributions of the article are the definition of original SSCLs, the creation of a framework and definition of criteria for their evaluation and the development of a novel hybrid MCDM model.

AB Recently, two-dimensional (2D) MXenes have emerged as filler materials for electromagnetic interference (EMI) shielding polymer composites due to their extraordinary electrical conductivity, high surface area, hydrophilic nature, and flexibility. Three-dimensional (3D) Printing with MXenes appears to be a new paradigm for manufacturing EMI shielding structures, where complex and specific 3D architecture is often required. In this study, composite inks incorporating 2D Ti3C2Tx MXenes with highly thixotropic properties were developed for the liquid deposition modeling (LDM) 3D Printing method. The use of these inks enabled the fabrication of semitransparent EMI shielding 3D architectures. The 3D-Printed EMI shields exhibited excellent EMI shielding effectiveness (EMI SE), particularly in the X-band (similar to 231 dB/mm) and semi-transparency (54.61%) in the visible light range. Moreover, excellent thermal management capability with highly anisotropic thermal conductivity (anisotropic index: 3.6) was achieved through 3D Printing. It is anticipated that the approach developed in this study has potential for the fabrication of advanced EMI shielding architecture with good thermal management capability for various applications, for example, precision wireless communication devices using variable frequencies with multiple channels, autonomous driving vehicles, and the Internet of Things (IoT).

AB An accurate and computationally efficient SLAM algorithm is vital for autonomous vehicles. Most modern SLAM systems use feature detection approaches to limit computational requirements. Feature detection through a 3D point cloud can be a computationally challenging task. In this paper, we propose a feature-based SLAM algorithm using 2D image projections of the 3D laser point cloud. We use a camera parameters matrix to rasterize the 3D point cloud to an image. Then ORB feature detector is applied to these images. The proposed method gives repeatable and stable features in a variety of environments. Based on such features, we can estimate the 6dof pose of the robot. For loop detection, we employ a 2-step approach, i.e., nearest key-frame detection and loop candidate verification by matching features extracted from rasterized LIDAR images. We evaluate the proposed system with implementation on the KITTI dataset. Through experimental results, we show that the algorithm presented in this paper can substantially reduce the computational cost of feature detection from the point cloud and the whole SLAM system while giving accurate results.

AB How quickly can a driver perceive a critical hazard on or near the road? Evidence from vision research suggests that static scene perception is fast and holistic, but does this apply in dynamic road environments? Understanding how quickly drivers can perceive hazards in moving scenes is essential because it improves driver safety now, and will enable autonomous vehicles to work safely with drivers in the future. This paper describes a new, publicly available set of videos, the Road Hazard Stimuli, and a study assessing how quickly participants in the laboratory can detect and correctly respond to briefly presented hazards in them. We performed this laboratory experiment with a group of younger (20-25 years) and older (55-69 years) drivers, and found that while both groups only required brief views of the scene, older drivers required significantly longer to both detect (220 ms, younger; 403 ms, older) and correctly respond to hazards (388 ms younger; 605 ms older). Our results indicate that participants can perceive the scene and detect hazards holistically, without serially searching the scene, and can understand the scene and hazard sufficiently well to respond adequately with only slightly longer viewing durations.

AB Corals are crucial animals as they support a large part of marine life. The automatic classification of corals species based on underwater images is important as it can help experts to track and detect threatened and vulnerable coral species. However, this classification is complicated due to the nature of coral underwater images and the fact that current underwater coral datasets are unrealistic as they contain only texture images, while the images taken by autonomous underwater vehicles show the complete coral structure. The objective of this paper is two-fold. The first is to build a dataset that is representative of the problem of classifying underwater coral images, the StructureRSMAS dataset. The second is to build a classifier capable of resolving the real problem of classifying corals, based either on texture or structure images. We have achieved this by using a two-level classifier composed of three ResNet models. The first level recognizes whether the input image is a texture or a structure image. Then, the second level identifies the coral species. To do this, we have used a known texture dataset, RSMAS, and StructureRSMAS. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

DE Decentralized control; Unmanned aerial vehicles; Autonomous robots;

AB This paper describes the implementation of a decentralized consensus law with theoretically provable convergence properties on a multi-agent testbed comprising of quadrotors. It is shown that for small roll and pitch angles and well-tuned control loops, the quadrotor dynamics can be approximated as a pair of double integrators. Several experiments are carried out in an outdoor environment for validation of the consensus law which is based on double integrator dynamics. For any arbitrary initial positions of the quadrotors, the consensus law is able to drive them to an autonomously decided common point, given that the communication graph is connected at each instant of time. The resulting experimental trajectories and the consensus point matches with theoretical predictions. For guaranteeing real-time reliability required for such coordinated motion, a novel synchronized, time-slotted, scalable and fully airborne communication protocol is proposed. The protocol avoids data collisions and ensures real-time, reliable communication between agents. It can also address changing communication graph topologies, temporary link-breaks and additions. Using this underlying protocol, the quadrotors attain consensus for static and dynamic communication graphs. Experiments to observe the effect of communication rate on consensus performance are also conducted.

DE deep learning; autonomous intelligent robots; LiDAR; localization
AB Automated guided vehicles (AGVs) are important in modern factories. The main functions of an AGV are its own localization and object detection, for which both sensor and localization methods are crucial. For localization, we used a small imaging sensor named a single-photon avalanche diode (SPAD) light detection and ranging (LiDAR), which uses the time-of-flight principle and arrays of SPADs. The SPAD LiDAR works both indoors and outdoors and is suitable for AGV applications. We utilized a deep convolutional neural network (CNN) as a localization method. For accurate CNN-based localization, the quality of the supervised data is important. The localization results can be poor or good if the supervised training data are noisy or clean, respectively. To address this issue, we propose a quality index for supervised data based on correlations between consecutive frames visualizing the important pixels for CNN-based localization. First, the important pixels for CNN-based localization are determined, and the quality index of supervised data is defined based on differences in these pixels. We evaluated the quality index in indoor-environment localization using the SPAD LiDAR and compared the localization performance. Our results demonstrate that the index correlates well to the quality of supervised training data for CNN-based localization.

AB In this paper, we present a novel iterative learning control (ILC) algorithm for the leader-follower formation tracking problem of a class of nonlinear multiagent systems that are subject to actuator faults. Unlike most ILC works that require identical reference trajectories over the iteration domain, the desired line-of-sight (LOS) range and angle profiles can be iteration dependent based on different tasks and environment in each iteration. Furthermore, the LOS range and angle tracking errors are subject to iteration and time dependent constraint requirements. Both parametric and nonparametric system unknowns and uncertainties, in particular the control input gain functions that are not fully known, are considered. We show that under the proposed algorithm, the formation tracking errors can converge to zero uniformly over the iteration domain beyond a certain time interval in each iteration, while the constraint requirements on the LOS range and angle will not be violated during operations. A numerical simulation involving two agents in leader-follower formation is presented in the end to demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed algorithm.

AB Robust environmental perception is a crucial parameter for the development of autonomous ground vehicle applications, especially in the field of agricultural robotics which is one of the priorities for the Horizon 2020 robotics funding (EU funding program for research and innovation). Because of uncontrolled and changing environmental conditions in outdoor and natural environments, data from optical sensors classically used in mobile robotics can be compromised and unusable. In such situations, microwave radar can provide an alternative and complementary solution for perception tasks. The aim of this paper is to present PELICAN radar, a microwave radar specifically designed for mobile robotics applications, including obstacle detection, mapping, and situational awareness in general. PELICAN radar provides each second a view over 360 degrees of the surrounding environment, from 5 m up to 100 m. A description of the technological solutions adopted for the development of PELICAN radar (hardware and software) is presented. Results obtained in various outdoor and open environments, including urban and natural areas, are also described. Sets of PELICAN radar data are made available online for researchers interested in processing this type of data.

DT Article
AB CityMobil was an integrated project in the Sixth Framework Program of the European Union. The objective of the project was to achieve more effective organization of urban transport for more rational use of motorized traffic with less congestion and pollution, safer driving, a higher quality of living, and enhanced integration with spatial development. This objective was reached by developing integrated traffic solutions: advanced concepts for innovative autonomous and automated road vehicles for passengers and goods embedded in an advanced spatial setting. The project was split into two parts: (a) research and development and (b) demonstration. The primary aim of the research and development part was to identify, address, and, where possible, eliminate barriers that still blocked the large-scale implementation of automated transport systems in urban traffic. The heart of the demonstration part consisted of three large-scale implementations of automated transport systems in urban areas and a number of smaller showcases and demonstrations. CityMobil was a 5-year project that started in May 2006 and ended in December 2011. The project results were presented at a final conference in Brussels, Belgium. This paper provides an update of a paper presented in 2009 and includes an overview of the final CityMobil results. The detailed results are available on the CityMobil website: wwvv.citymobil-project.eu.

AB Mobile Ad hoc NETworks (MANETs) are distributed self-organizing networks that can change locations and configure themselves on the fly. This paper focuses on an algorithmic approach for the deployment of a MANET within an enclosed area, such as a building in a disaster scenario, which can provide a robust communication infrastructure for search and rescue operations. While a virtual spring mesh (VSM) algorithm provides scalable, self-organizing, and fault-tolerant capabilities required by a MANET, the VSM lacks the MANET's capabilities of deployment mechanisms for blanket coverage of an area and does not provide an obstacle avoidance mechanism. This paper presents a new technique, an extended VSM (EVSM) algorithm that provides the following novelties: 1) new control laws for exploration and expansion to provide blanket coverage, 2) virtual adaptive springs enabling the mesh to expand as necessary, 3) adapts to communications disturbances by varying the density and movement of mobile nodes, and 4) new metrics to assess the performance of the EVSM algorithm. Simulation results show that EVSM provides up to 16% more coverage and is 3.5 times faster than VSM in environments with eight obstacles.

AB This paper presents the design, architecture, implementation, and experimental results from a networked mobile sensor test-bed developed for collaborative sensor tracking applications. The test-bed comprises a fleet of networked mobile sensors, an indoor localization system, a control, debugging and management infrastructure, and a tiered wireless ad hoc network for seamless integration of the above three components and the existing wireless infrastructure. First, the software and hardware architectural details of a swarm capable autonomous vehicle (SCAV) system for our collaborative applications are presented. Second, the details of an indoor self-localization and Kalman filter based navigation system design for the SCAV platform are presented. Third, as an example multi-sensor application, a collaborative multi-target tracking problem and a heuristics-based networked solution are formulated. Finally, the performance of the collaborative tracking framework is evaluated on the laboratory test-bed for characterizing the impacts of localization and navigation errors on the distributed tracking performance. The experimental study also characterizes the tradeoff between the tracking performance and the consumed wireless bandwidth. The experimental results demonstrate a number of counterintuitive results due to various errors in sensor localization and navigation.

ID STABILITY ANALYSIS
AB Bacteria, bees, and birds often work together in groups to find food. A group of robots can be designed to coordinate their activities to search for and collect objects. Networked cooperative uninhabited autonomous vehicles are being developed for commercial and military applications. Suppose that we refer to all such groups of entities as "social foraging swarms." In order for such multiagent systems to succeed it is often critical that they can both maintain cohesive behaviors and appropriately respond to environmental stimuli (e.g., by optimizing the acquisition of nutrients in foraging for food). In this paper, we characterize swarm cohesiveness as a stability property and use a Lyapunov approach to develop conditions under which local agent actions will lead to cohesive foraging even in the presence of "noise" characterized by uncertainty on sensing other agent's position and velocity, and in sensing nutrients that each agent is foraging for. The results quantify earlier claims that social foraging is in a certain sense superior to individual foraging when noise is present, and provide clear connections between local agent-agent interactions and emergent group behavior. Moreover, the simulations show that very complicated but orderly group behaviors, reminiscent of those seen in biology, emerge in the presence of noise.

AB In the systems of industrial robotics and autonomous vehicles, instance segmentation is widely employed. However, manually labelling an object outline is time-consuming. In order to reduce annotation costs, we present a weakly supervised instance segmentation method in this article. A deeply convolutional network is first used to construct multi-scale feature maps for each object in the input image. After that, the encoder-decoder framework with dynamic convolution is utilised to enhance model capacity and efficiency, while avoiding the issues of anchor design, proposal selection, and RoIAlign implementation. In particular, Dynamic Heads are used in the encoder to create dynamic convolution kernels, while Instance Heads are used in the decoder to provide the global feature map. With dynamic convolution, each instance can be segmented independently, reducing interference with other instances and improving segmentation accuracy. Under the supervision of projection loss and pixel point colour pairing loss, the contours of each object are finally outlined. On the PASCAL VOC and MS COCO datasets, the proposed method is competitive with more sophisticated approaches. In the VOC dataset, segmentation performance achieved 37.6% average precision with ResNet-101 and FPN networks. The extensively visualised results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed encoder-decoder framework with dynamic convolution.

AB Methods based on 64-beam LiDAR can provide very precise 3D object detection. However, highly accurate LiDAR sensors are extremely costly: a 64-beam model can cost approximately USD 75,000. We previously proposed SLS-Fusion (sparse LiDAR and stereo fusion) to fuse low-cost four-beam LiDAR with stereo cameras that outperform most advanced stereo-LiDAR fusion methods. In this paper, and according to the number of LiDAR beams used, we analyzed how the stereo and LiDAR sensors contributed to the performance of the SLS-Fusion model for 3D object detection. Data coming from the stereo camera play a significant role in the fusion model. However, it is necessary to quantify this contribution and identify the variations in such a contribution with respect to the number of LiDAR beams used inside the model. Thus, to evaluate the roles of the parts of the SLS-Fusion network that represent LiDAR and stereo camera architectures, we propose dividing the model into two independent decoder networks. The results of this study show that-starting from four beams-increasing the number of LiDAR beams has no significant impact on the SLS-Fusion performance. The presented results can guide the design decisions by practitioners.

AB To solve the maneuvering decision problem in air combat of unmanned combat aircraft vehicles (UCAVs), in this paper, an autonomous maneuver decision method is proposed for a UCAV based on deep reinforcement learning. Firstly, the UCAV flight maneuver model and maneuver library of both opposing sides are established. Then, considering the different state transition effects of various actions when the pitch angles of the UCAVs are different, the 10 state variables including the pitch angle, are taken as the state space. Combined with the air combat situation threat assessment index model, a two-layer reward mechanism combining internal reward and sparse reward is designed as the evaluation basis of reinforcement learning. Then, the neural network model of the full connection layer is built according to an Asynchronous Advantage Actor-Critic (A3C) algorithm. In the way of multi-threading, our UCAV keeps interactively learning with the environment to train the model and gradually learns the optimal air combat maneuver countermeasure strategy, and guides our UCAV to conduct action selection. The algorithm reduces the correlation between samples through multi-threading asynchronous learning. Finally, the effectiveness and feasibility of the method are verified in three different air combat scenarios.

DE poisoning attack; machine learning; deep neural network; different
   classes
AB Deep neural networks show good performance in image recognition, speech recognition, and pattern analysis. However, deep neu-ral networks also have weaknesses, one of which is vulnerability to poison-ing attacks. A poisoning attack reduces the accuracy of a model by training the model on malicious data. A number of studies have been conducted on such poisoning attacks. The existing type of poisoning attack causes misrecognition by one classifier. In certain situations, however, it is neces-sary for multiple models to misrecognize certain data as different specific classes. For example, if there are enemy autonomous vehicles A, B, and C, a poisoning attack could mislead A to turn to the left, B to stop, and C to turn to the right simply by using a traffic sign. In this paper, we propose a multi-targeted poisoning attack method that causes each of several mod-els to misrecognize certain data as a different target class. This study used MNIST and CIFAR10 as datasets and Tensorflow as a machine learning li-brary. The experimental results show that the proposed scheme has a 100% average attack success rate on MNIST and CIFAR10 when malicious data accounting for 5% of the training dataset have been used for training.

AB Colorful, cholesteric patterns are ubiquitous in the bodies of insects and fishes. Bioinspired materials may be employed in smart coatings for optical communication, signaling, and camouflage. However, due to the fundamental challenges associated with such applications, the development of adaptive monolayers with continuous, hierarchical nanoscale and micrometer-scale structures, as found in nature, and design simplicity has not been fully explored. We show that controlling the local anisotropy of surface tension during the self-assembly of a twisted cholesteric oligomer can lead to the appearance of distinct coexisting colors in monolayer films. The reflection wavelength, which is proportional to the helical pitch, is tuned by forming transparent, surface-active films on the free side of a cholesteric film with a pitch gradient. Reflective colors are related to the internal nanoscale structure, as demonstrated by transmission electron microscopy. Open and self-sustaining bicolor tags are created. The surface design of these films allows the manipulation of their bulk chiral self-organization on a variety of substrates. Smart, reflective multicolor tags, including self-guiding systems for autonomous vehicles, functional facades, camouflage skins for robots, and anticounterfeiting labels, are the intended application.

AB Real-time registration of partially overlapping point clouds has emerging applications in cooperative perception for autonomous vehicles and multi-agent SLAM. The relative translation between point clouds in these applications is higher than in traditional SLAM and odometry applications, which challenges the identification of correspondences and a successful registration. In this paper, we propose a novel registration method for partially overlapping point clouds where correspondences are learned using an efficient point-wise feature encoder, and refined using a graph-based attention network. This attention network exploits geometrical relationships between key points to improve the matching in point clouds with low overlap. At inference time, the relative pose transformation is obtained by robustly fitting the correspondences through sample consensus. The evaluation is performed on the KITTI dataset and a novel synthetic dataset including low-overlapping point clouds with displacements of up to 30 m. The proposed method achieves on-par performance with state-of-the-art methods on the KITTI dataset, and outperforms existing methods for low overlapping point clouds. Additionally, the proposed method achieves significantly faster inference times, as low as 410 ms, between 5 and 35 times faster than competing methods. Our code and dataset are available at https://github.com/eduardohenriquearnold/fastreg.

AB This study introduces a method that allows the generation and safety evaluation of a scenario catalog derived from potential car-pedestrian conflict situations. It is based on open-source software components and uses the road layout standard OpenDRIVE to derive participants' motion profiles with the support of available accident data. The method was implemented upon the open-source framework openPASS and can simulate results for different active safety system setups and facilitates the prediction of system capabilities to decrease the relative impact velocities and collision configurations such as the point of impact. A demonstration case was performed where the scenario catalog was derived and used to evaluate pedestrian collisions with and without a generic autonomous emergency braking (AEB) system. The AEB system aims to intervene in the event of an impending collision and might affect the outcome of a baseline scenario. The study indicated a change in the collision configuration and identified conflict situations less affected by the system. A particularly interesting finding was that some scenarios even led to a higher number of collisions (at lower impact) for the AEB intervention in comparison to the baseline cases.

ID AUTONOMOUS-NAVIGATION; SYSTEM; SLAM
AB The problem of cooperative localization for a small group of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) in a Global Navigation Satellite System-denied environment is addressed in this paper. The presented approach contains two sequential steps: first, an algorithm called cooperative ranging localization, formulated as an extended Kalman filter, estimates each UAV's relative pose inside the group using intervehicle ranging measurements; second, an algorithm named cooperative magnetic localization, formulated as a particle filter, estimates each UAV's global pose through matching the group's magnetic anomaly measurements to a given magnetic anomaly map. In this study, each UAV is assumed to only perform a ranging measurement and data exchange with one other UAV at any point in time. A simulator is developed to evaluate the algorithms with magnetic anomaly maps acquired from airborne geophysical survey. The simulation results show that the average estimated position error of a group of 16 UAVs is approximately 20 m after flying about 180 km in 1 h. Sensitivity analysis shows that the algorithms can tolerate large variations of velocity, yaw rate, and magnetic anomaly measurement noises. Additionally, the UAV group shows improved position estimation robustness with both high- and low-resolution maps as more UAVs are added into the group.

AB A compact and lightweight mid-infrared laser absorption spectrometer has been developed as a mobile sensing platform for high-precision atmospheric methane measurements aboard small unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs). The instrument leverages two recent innovations: a novel segmented circular multipass cell (SC-MPC) design and a power-efficient, low-noise, intermittent continuous-wave (icw) laser driving approach. A system-on-chip hardware control and data acquisition system enables energy-efficient and fully autonomous operation. The integrated spectrometer weighs 2:1 kg (including battery) and consumes 18W of electrical power, making it ideally suited for airborne monitoring applications. Under stable laboratory conditions, the device achieves a precision (1 sigma) of 1:1 ppb within 1 s and 0:1 ppb CH4 at 100 s averaging time. Detailed investigations were performed to identify and quantify the effects of various environmental factors, such as sudden changes in pressure, temperature, and mechanical vibrations, which commonly influence UAV-mounted sensors. The instrument was also deployed in two feasibility field studies: an artificial methane release experiment and a study on vertical profiles in the planetary boundary layer. In both cases, the spectrometer demonstrated its airborne capability of capturing subtle and/or sudden changes in atmospheric CH4 mole fractions and providing real-time data at 1 s time resolution.

AB The localization represents one of the most important aspects of underwater acoustic sensor networks, offering three-dimensional monitoring of marine environment, military detection and attack missions. This paper proposes the Energy Optimized Distributed Localization Method (EODL) as an efficient technique for the distributed sensor network localization based on the mobile beacon water. This technique employs an Autonomous Underwater Vehicle (AUV) as the mobile beacon. The moving path of the AUV in the three-dimensional water environment and the time interval of the broadcast transmitting are found by applying a qualitative analysis of the superiority of the rectangular path. In such a technique, the unknown sensor node position is calculated by monitoring beacon signals without requiring time synchronization between nodes. We consider the innermost intersection body for the localization process, to calculate the geometric intersection relation of different information signal ranges. Then, we calculate the location information of the nodes. Moreover, the localization error analysis of the method will be presented. We compare the simulation results of the proposed method (EODL) with the LDSN. In addition, the experimental results verify that the proposed method introduces less error and higher coverage rate comparing with the conventional methods. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

AB The dominant practices of physical oceanography have recently shifted from being based on ship-based ocean sampling and sensing to being based on remote and robotic sensing using satellites, drifting floats and remotely operated and autonomous underwater vehicles. What are the implications of this change for the social relations of oceanographic science? This paper contributes to efforts to address this question, pursuing a situated view of ocean sensing technologies so as to contextualize and analyze new representations of the sea, and interactions between individual scientists, technologies and the ocean. By taking a broad view on oceanography through a 50-year shift from ship-based to remote and robotic sensing, I show the ways in which new technologies may provide an opportunity to fight what Oreskes has called ideologies of scientific heroism'. In particular, new sensing relations may emphasize the contributions of women and scientists from less well-funded institutions, as well as the ways in which oceanographic knowledge is always partial and dependent on interactions between nonhuman animals, technologies, and different humans. Thus, I argue that remote and robotic sensing technologies do not simply create more abstracted relations between scientists and the sea, but also may provide opportunities for more equitable scientific practice and refigured sensing relations.

AB In October 2012, the Centre for Maritime Research and Experimentation (CMRE, La Spezia, Italy) conducted trials from the NATO research vessel (RV) Alliance, off Elba Island, Italy. During this trial, data were collected by the Norwegian Defence Research Establishment (FFI, Kjeller, Norway) using a HUGIN autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) with interferometric synthetic aperture sonar (SAS) in repeated passes. Large linear structures (tens of meters by several meters) observed in both the SAS images and SAS bathymetry during the initial pass were absent in data taken on a repeated pass the following day. We suggest that these phenomena were not true seafloor features, but were caused by features in the water column, known as boluses, which can form after breaking internal wave events. The changes observed in acoustical intensity and phase appear to be caused by the interaction of the acoustical field with the lower average sound-speed structure of the bolus, constructing features in both SAS imagery and SAS bathymetry that looked like seabed topography. In this paper, we present examples and give an interpretation of the results based on an acoustical ray model. We discuss different techniques for recognizing these phenomena: repeat pass imaging and interferometry, multilook and multiaperture processing, and moving target analysis.

ID TRACKING
AB Curb detection is an essential component of Autonomous Land Vehicles (ALV), especially important for safe driving in urban environments. In this paper, we propose a fusion-based curb detection method through exploiting 3D-Lidar and camera data. More specifically, we first fuse the sparse 3D-Lidar points and high-resolution camera images together to recover a dense depth image of the captured scene. Based on the recovered dense depth image, we propose a filter-based method to estimate the normal direction within the image. Then, by using the multi-scale normal patterns based on the curb's geometric property, curb point features fitting the patterns are detected in the normal image row by row. After that, we construct a Markov Chain to model the consistency of curb points which utilizes the continuous property of the curb, and thus the optimal curb path which links the curb points together can be efficiently estimated by dynamic programming. Finally, we perform post-processing operations to filter the outliers, parameterize the curbs and give the confidence scores on the detected curbs. Extensive evaluations clearly show that our proposed method can detect curbs with strong robustness at real-time speed for both static and dynamic scenes.

AB The problem of determining the optimal geometric configuration of a sensor network that will maximize the range-related information available for multiple target positioning is of key importance in a multitude of application scenarios. In this paper, a set of sensors that measures the distances between the targets and each of the receivers is considered, assuming that the range measurements are corrupted by white Gaussian noise, in order to search for the formation that maximizes the accuracy of the target estimates. Using tools from estimation theory and convex optimization, the problem is converted into that of maximizing, by proper choice of the sensor positions, a convex combination of the logarithms of the determinants of the Fisher Information Matrices corresponding to each of the targets in order to determine the sensor configuration that yields the minimum possible covariance of any unbiased target estimator. Analytical and numerical solutions are well defined and it is shown that the optimal configuration of the sensors depends explicitly on the constraints imposed on the sensor configuration, the target positions, and the probabilistic distributions that define the prior uncertainty in each of the target positions. Simulation examples illustrate the key results derived.

DE Autonomous vehicles; Aircraft control; Airship; Feedback linearization;
   Minimum phase systems; Relative degree
AB A new concept of airship without thrust, elevator or rudder is considered in this paper. It is actuated by a moving mass and an internal air bladder with adjustable mass. This results into the motion of the center of gravity and the change of the net lift. The development of this concept of airship is motivated by energy saving. The moving mass and the airship's rigid body are viewed independently, which renders the modeling easy and displays clearly the interconnection of the two subsystems. An eight degrees-of-freedom (DOF) complete nonlinear mathematical model of this airship is derived through the Newton-Euler approach. The dynamics in the vertical plane are analyzed and controlled, using maximal feedback linearization. The modeling, analysis, and control are solved for special cases of the airship which become gradually complex. The most constrained case reduces to a two-DOF system. It is shown that the basic properties of this two-DOF mechanical system remain instrumental for the analysis and synthesis of advanced airships. These properties are far from being obvious when the most complex model is considered. (c) 2012 Elsevier Masson SAS. All rights reserved.

AB In this paper, the problem of detecting particular underwater structures, e.g., anodes used to join together separated sections of a pipeline, from visual images is addressed, Images are acquired by an autonomous underwater vehicle during sea-bottom surveys for pipeline inspection. Anodes with different characteristics, e.g., material, size, color, etc., can be found on the same pipeline but all are characterized by the same visual feature, i.e., an elliptical arc. To this end, a voting-based method able to detect elliptical arcs on the image plane is used to locate accurately anodes along the pipeline. Three dimensional (3D) geometric information about the scene, e.g., 3D equations of the pipeline borders, is used to reduce from 5 to 2 the dimensions of the parametric space needed for ellipse detection. Then, among the instances of detected ellipses on the image plane, false elliptical arcs, which are not compatible with the 3D scene geometry, are eliminated. Finally, the detection of consecutive true elliptical arcs over a long image sequence is used to infer the presence of an anode. Experimental tests on large sets of real underwater images have been performed to evaluate the effectiveness and the robustness of the method. (C) 2002 SPIE and IST.

AB Adversarial attacks can compromise the robustness of real-world detection models. However, evaluating these models under real-world conditions poses challenges due to resource-intensive experiments. Virtual simulations offer an alternative, but the absence of standardized benchmarks hampers progress. Addressing this, we propose an innovative instant-level data generation pipeline using the CARLA simulator. Through this pipeline, we establish the Discrete and Continuous Instant-level (DCI) dataset, enabling comprehensive experiments involving three detection models and three physical adversarial attacks. Our findings highlight diverse model performances under adversarial conditions. YOLO v6 demonstrates remarkable resilience, exhibiting just a marginal 6.59% average drop in average precision (AP). In contrast, the ASA attack yields a substantial 14.51% average AP reduction, twice the effect of other algorithms. We also note that static scenes yield higher recognition AP values, and outcomes remain relatively consistent across varying weather conditions. Intriguingly, our study suggests that advancements in adversarial attack algorithms may be approaching its "limitation". In summary, our work underscores the significance of adversarial attacks in real-world contexts and introduces the DCI dataset as a versatile benchmark. Our findings provide valuable insights for enhancing the robustness of detection models and offer guidance for future research endeavors in the realm of adversarial attacks.

AB Road marking system is a significant component of asphalt pavement, and it plays an irreplaceable role in improving traffic safety. The durability of road markings is critical to driving safety, especially for the autonomous vehicles in the future. It is also a major source of environmental contaminants in the road area. However, the currently used laboratory tests mainly focus on the measurement of the initial performance of road markings. This study developed an Accelerated Wearing Tester (AWT) to simulate the wearing process between tires and road markings. On the basis of the AWT results, durability and environmental risk of road markings was investigated. The results show that the skid resistance of road markings presents an obvious fluctuation with the wearing time. Environmental analysis indicates that the road marking promotes the emission of alkanes, benzenes, and halogenated alkanes, and can increase the content of lead and chromium in wearing products. Special attentions must be paid to the safety and environmental concerns of road marking materials. The method established in this study lays the foundation for the future improvement of driving safety and environmental friendship of road marking materials.

AB Context: In traditional software systems, Requirements Engineering (RE) activities are well-established and researched. However, building Artificial Intelligence (AI) based software with limited or no insight into the system's inner workings poses significant new challenges to RE. Existing literature has focused on using AI to manage RE activities, with limited research on RE for AI (RE4AI). Objective: This paper investigates current approaches for specifying requirements for AI systems, identifies available frameworks, methodologies, tools, and techniques used to model requirements, and finds existing challenges and limitations. Method: We performed a systematic mapping study to find papers on current RE4AI approaches. We identified 43 primary studies and analyzed the existing methodologies, models, tools, and techniques used to specify and model requirements in real-world scenarios. Results: We found several challenges and limitations of existing RE4AI practices. The findings highlighted that current RE applications were not adequately adaptable for building AI systems and emphasized the need to provide new techniques and tools to support RE4AI. Conclusion: Our results showed that most of the empirical studies on RE4AI focused on autonomous, self-driving vehicles and managing data requirements, and areas such as ethics, trust, and explainability need further research.

AB Featured Application Telepresence robot is useful for remote applications, healthcare and remote sensing. Background: The development of telepresence robots is getting much attention in various areas of human-robot interaction, healthcare systems and military applications because of multiple advantages such as safety improvement, lower energy and fuel consumption, exploitation of road networks, reduced traffic congestion and greater mobility. Methods: In the critical decision-making process during the motion of a robot, intelligent motion planning takes an important and challenging role. It includes obstacle avoidance, searching for the safest path to follow, generating appropriate behavior and comfortable trajectory generation by optimization while keeping road boundaries and traffic rules as important concerns. Results: This paper presents a state machine algorithm for avoiding obstacles and speed control design to a cognitive architecture named auto-MERLIN. This research empirically tested the proposed solutions by providing implementation details and diagrams for establishing the path planning and obstacle tests. Conclusions: The results validate the usability of our approach and show auto-MERLIN as a ready robot for short- and long-term tasks, showing better results than using a default system, particularly when deployed in highly interactive scenarios. The stable speed control of the auto-MERLIN in case of detecting any obstacle was shown.

AB With the rapid development of visual sensors and artificial intelligence (AI), video/image data has increased dramatically, especially in the era of AI-enabled intelligent transportation. In low-light imaging conditions, however, the camera only captures weak scene-reflected light. The visual data is thus inevitably affected by noise, low contrast, and poor brightness, and so on. It will have a negative influence on the development of vision-based traffic situational awareness, traffic safety management, and automatic/autonomous vehicles. To guarantee high-quality visual data, the multiscale deep stacking fusion enhancer (termed MDSFE) is proposed to enhance a low-light image. In particular, our MDSFE consists of four components, i.e., coarse extraction module (C-EM), coarse attention fusion module (C-AFM), multiscale dense enhancement module (M-DEM), and fine encoder-decoder fusion module (F-EDFM). The combination of these modules is capable of enhancing the abilities of feature mapping and expression. Experimental results on both synthetic and real-world scenarios have illustrated that the proposed method can provide superior enhancement results under different imaging conditions. It also has the capacity of improving the detection precision under low-light conditions.

AB This paper presents a method to determine the throughput of a multiple-aisle storage system. The main key feature of this approach is that the sequence of the ordered order is to be strictly adhered and the buffer-slots in front of every storage aisle are considered. Therefore, a merging process with several input streams with limited capacity is modelled. The invented approach is based on a superposition of different queueing systems with limited capacity, such as a M/M/1/K-queueing model. The accuracy of the invented approach is given by a comparison to a discrete event simulation. The approximation quality is very high, through an estimation error of less than 10% for some configurations and less than 2% for over 90% of all examined configurations. An example is presented to show the influence of the number of aisles and their capacity. The result is that the capacity of the aisle has a prime influence on the throughput, especially at a higher number of aisles. This approach serves a decision tool to determine the throughput of a multi-aisle storage system in an accurate and a simple manner.

AB This article proposes a novel adaptive robust control approach based on Gaussian processes (GPs) for the high-precision tracking problem of uncertain Euler-Lagrange (EL) systems with time-varying external disturbances. Given a prior dynamic model, the GP regression (GPR) technique is employed to obtain a nonparametric data-based uncertainty model, including its probabilistic confidence intervals. Based on the adaptive sliding mode control (ASMC) framework, the posterior means of GPs are utilized for dynamic compensation, whereas the posterior variances are applied to adjust the feedback gains. This proposed control strategy is robust against significant system uncertainty with low feedback gains. A novel adaptive law for updating hyperparameters based on tracking error feedback is presented, thereby improving the performance of both tracking control and GP modeling simultaneously. Compared to existing likelihood-based optimization methods, this hyperparameter adaptive law enables data-efficient and fast uncertainty learning for control applications. The proposed control strategy guarantees the semiglobal asymptotic convergence to zero tracking error with a specified probability. Simulations using an underwater robot model demonstrate that the utilization of GPs and hyperparameter adaptive law significantly improves the performance of tracking control and uncertainty learning.

AB The Internet of vehicular things (IoVT) is turning into an indubitably evolving area of interest in either industrial or academic domains. The tremendous information exchanging between IoVT devices enable the development of a wide variety of vehicular applications i.e., intelligent transportation systems and autonomous driving system, etc. However, the sensitivity of this information resulted in growing security privacy concerns. Remarkably, federated learning (FL) is a promising paradigm of distributed learning from vehicular data of distinct agents without communicating the raw data among them. FL can appropriately use the computation power of manifold agents to develop efficient and privacy-preserving solutions for IoVT environment. Thus, this study figures out the potential of the FL approach in developing efficient decentralized solutions that consider the security and privacy concerns of the IoVT system. A federated graph convolutional recurrent network (Fed-GCRN) is introduced to learn spatial-temporal information for traffic flows forecasting. The Fed-GCRN introduce an adaptive differential privacy mechanism to realize a better privacy performance tradeoff. Finally, the current challenges related to FL are discussed along with the hopeful future directions that enable the development of more intelligent, secure, and private IoVT applications.

AB Direction of arrival (DOA) estimation is an essential and fundamental part of array signal processing, which has been widely used in radio monitoring, autonomous driving of vehicles, intelligent navigation, etc. However, it remains a challenge to accurately estimate DOA for multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) radar in impulsive noise environments. To address this problem, an off-grid DOA estimation method for monostatic MIMO radar is proposed to deal with non-circular signals under impulsive noise. In the proposed method, firstly, based on the property of non-circular signal and array structure, a virtual array output was built and a real-valued sparse representation for the signal model was constructed. Then, an off-grid sparse Bayesian learning (SBL) framework is proposed and further applied to the virtual array to construct novel off-grid sparse model. Finally, off-grid DOA estimation was realized through the solution of the sparse reconstruction with high accuracy even in impulsive noise. Numerous simulations were performed to compare the algorithm with existing methods. Simulation results verify that the proposed off-grid DOA method enables evident performance improvement in terms of accuracy and robustness compared with other works on impulsive noise.

AB Unmanned helicopter (UH) is often utilized for raid missions because it can evade radar detection by flying at ultra-low altitudes. Path planning is the key technology to realizing the autonomous action of UH. On the one hand, the dynamically changing radar coverage area and the mountains in the low airspace environment will seriously affect the flight safety of UH. On the other hand, the huge state space of the three-dimensional (3D) environment will also make traditional algorithms difficult to converge. To address the above problems, a memory-enhanced dueling deep Q-network (ME-dueling DQN) algorithm was proposed. First, a comprehensive reward function was designed, which can guide the algorithm to converge quickly and effectively improve the sparse reward problem. Then, we introduced a dual memory pool structure and proposed a memory-enhanced mechanism, which can reduce invalid exploration, further improve the learning efficiency of the algorithm, and make the algorithm more stable. Finally, the path planning ability of the proposed algorithm in multiple experimental environments was verified. Experiments showed that the proposed algorithm has good environmental adaptability and can help UH to accurately identify dangerous areas and plan a safe and reliable flight path.

AB Ocean current (OC) prediction plays an important role for carrying out ocean-related activities. There are plenty of studies for OC prediction with deep learning to pursue better prediction performance, and the attention mechanism was widely used for these studies. However, the attention mechanism was usually combined with deep learning models rather than purely used to predict OC, or, if it was purely used, did not further optimize the attention weight. Therefore, a deep learning model based on weighted pure attention mechanism is proposed in this paper. This model uses the pure attention mechanism, introduces a weight parameter for the generated attention weight, and moves more attentions from other elements to the key elements based on weight parameter setting. To our knowledge, it is the first attempt to use the weighted pure attention mechanism to improve the OC prediction performance, and it is an innovation for OC prediction. The experiment results indicate that the proposed model can fully take advantage of the strengths from the pure attention mechanism; it can further optimize the pure attention mechanism and significantly improve the prediction performance, and is reliable for OC prediction with high performance for a wide time range and large spatial scope.

AB Coastal wetland monitoring plays an important role in the protection and restoration of ecosystems in this world. UAV-hyperspectral imaging, as an emerging technique for Earth observation and space exploration, provides the huge potential ability to identify different wetland species. In this work, a multilayer global spectral-spatial attention network (MGSSAN) is proposed for mapping coastal wetlands, which mainly consists of two major steps. First, a two-branch convolutional neural network (CNN) framework with residual connection is developed to obtain an initial classification probability map, in which one branch is used to capture the spectral information, the other branch is used to extract spatial information, and a global spectral-spatial attention module is designed to guide networks focusing on those features that are more discriminative. Second, an extended random walker method is utilized to optimize the initial classification probabilities, so as to yield the final map. Experiments performed on three wetland HSI datasets created by ourselves verify that the proposed method can obtain superior performance with respect to several state-of-the-art hyperspectral image classification methods.

AB This paper documents a case study of an automated mower to support sustainability at an airport. Mowing is an essential component of an airport's Wildlife Hazard Management Plan (WHMP), which reduces the risk of birds and other wildlife to aircraft operations. Many airports have large areas of land (hundreds or even thousands of acres), which requires significant resources to manage and mow; experience at the Purdue Airport (KLAF) suggests that automated mowing may support economic and environmental aspects of sustainability. Automated mowing supports economic efficiency by reducing personnel requirements, although personnel are still needed for inspections, maintenance, and "mower rescue" if there is a malfunction (technical or field issue). Automated mowing supports environmental impacts by reducing local emissions since the mower is powered by electricity rather than gasoline; this benefit would be increased with the use of solar-powered mowers. Automated mowing may not be viable everywhere, and factors such as terrain, access to available power, acreage, and location on the airfield (including proximity to protected areas) must be carefully considered. Although automated mowing will not completely replace traditional mowing in the near future, autonomous mowers in remote areas may be an appropriate practice to support airport sustainability.

AB Innovative applications in rapidly evolving domains such as robotic navigation and autonomous (driverless) vehicles rely on binocular computer vision systems that meet stringent response time and accuracy requirements. A key problem in these vision systems is stereo matching, which involves matching pixels from two input images in order to construct the output, a 3D map. Building upon the existing local stereo matching algorithms, this paper proposes a novel stereo matching algorithm that is based on a weighted guided filtering foundation. The proposed algorithm consists of three main steps; each step is designed with the goal of improving accuracy. First, the matching costs are computed using a unique combination of complementary methods (absolute difference, Census, and gradient algorithms) to reduce errors. Second, the costs are aggregated using an adaptive weighted guided image filtering method. Here, the regularization parameters are adjusted adaptively using the Canny method, further reducing errors. Third, a disparity map is generated using the winner-take-all strategy; this map is subsequently refined using a densification method to reduce errors. Our experimental results indicate that the proposed algorithm provides a higher level of accuracy in comparison to a collection of the existing state-of-the-art local algorithms.

   A bio-inspired underwater robot could find application in underwater exploration, environmental monitoring, and search and rescue. The high efficiency of this type of propulsion makes it suitable for applications in which great endurance is required.
   Interest in autonomous underwater vehicles is constantly increasing following the emerging needs of underwater exploration and military purposes. Thus, several new propulsion mechanisms are studied and developed. Fish swimming is a promising source of inspiration because they outperform conventional propellers in terms of energy efficiency and maneuvrability. Their advantages are not only due to the streamlined shape and their low-drag skin but also, above all, due to the particular fin motion, which makes thrust generation possible with small energy dissipation. This paper analyses the motion of batoid fishes that are considered highly efficient by biologists. Their motion is reproduced by different linkage mechanisms optimized to fit underwater robots. A bioinspired robot mimicking cownose ray locomotion is, then, designed and built. Numerical analysis of its dynamics allows us to measure the size of actuators and to estimate the robot behavior. Finally, the control algorithm that maintains the mechanism synchronization according to different strategies is described and some experimental results are presented.

AB Audio-based event detection poses a number of different challenges that are not encountered in other fields, such as image detection. Challenges such as ambient noise, low Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR) and microphone distance are not yet fully understood. If the multimodal approaches are to become better in a range of fields of interest, audio analysis will have to play an integral part. Event recognition in autonomous vehicles (AVs) is such a field at a nascent stage that can especially leverage solely on audio or can be part of the multimodal approach. In this manuscript, an extensive analysis focused on the comparison of different magnitude representations of the raw audio is presented. The data on which the analysis is carried out is part of the publicly available MIVIA Audio Events dataset. Single channel Short-Time Fourier Transform (STFT), mel-scale and Mel-Frequency Cepstral Coefficients (MFCCs) spectrogram representations are used. Furthermore, aggregation methods of the aforementioned spectrogram representations are examined; the feature concatenation compared to the stacking of features as separate channels. The effect of the SNR on recognition accuracy and the generalization of the proposed methods on datasets that were both seen and not seen during training are studied and reported.

AB Due to the unique nature of underwater acoustic communication, data collection from the Underwater Acoustic Sensor Networks (UASNs) is a challenging problem. It has been reported that data collection from the UASNs with the assistance of the autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) will be more convenient. The AUV needs to schedule a tour to contact all sensors once, which is a variant of the Traveling Salesman Problem. A hybrid optimization algorithm is proposed for the solution of the problem. The algorithm combines the quantum-behaved particle swarm optimization and improved ant colony optimization algorithms. It is an algorithm with quadratic complexity, which can yield approximate but satisfactory results for the problem. Simulation experiments are carried out to demonstrate the efficiency of the algorithm. Compared to the Self-Organizing Map based (SOM-based) algorithm, it not only plans a shorter tour, but also shortens the distance from the sensor to its closest way-point. Therefore, the algorithm can reduce the energy required for data transmission since the communication distance drops, and the service life of the sensor can be extended.

ID VEHICLE DETECTION
AB Object detection in aerial images is vital for autonomous guidance, navigation and control, and situational awareness. However, there are still many challenges facing researchers in this filed, including the target scales, the perspectives in taking pictures, and the highly complex background. The present paper introduces a robust object detector which is optimized for handling with multi-scale objects and the overhead capturing perspective object instances in aerial images. Firstly, in the feature extraction stage, an effective multi-scale detector (MSD) is designed to search for objects with different scales in feature maps. After that, when detecting a small target from a cluttered background, both the shallow and deep layer features are densely connected by the deconvolution after tackling the issues of low dimensionality in deep layers and inadequate representation of small objects. In the experiments part, we analyze the impacts of the above mentioned components on the model and make a comparison between the method at issue and other state-of-the-art approaches on two publicly-available datasets captured by satellites and high-altitude UAVs. The results show that the proposed method, which is applicable to a wider range of aerial images, is more effective and robust.

AB The integration of the Internet of Things (IoT) in our lives has become reality during the last decade. Mostly, IoT is considered a system of systems, where sensors make a big chunk of any IoT communication system. Similarly, in this paper, we introduce a notion of the Internet of Underwater Things (IoUT), where we consider a set of sensors deployed in the deep sea to form a communication network for any possible application, such as military, environmental, pollution surveillance, etc. Since it is too optimistic to recharge or replace sensor batteries in an underwater environment, efficient management of the available resources can extend the overall network lifetime. To do so, nodes clustering is a potential solution, however, exchange of multiple packets for cluster head selection requires a considerable amount of energy. In this paper, we present an autonomous unmanned vehicles (AUVs) assisted energy-efficient clustering (AEC) mechanism that introduces wake-up sleep cycle for the underwater nodes. AUV onus includes cluster creation, the cluster head nomination, and creation of a wakeup sleep schedule that relieves the additional burden from energy limited underwater sensor nodes. Due to no additional packets been exchanged, our protocol outperforms traditional clustering schemes and we validate this through simulations.

AB The autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) is widely used to search for unknown targets in the complex underwater environment. Due to the unpredictability of the underwater environment, this paper combines the traditional frontier exploration method with deep reinforcement learning (DRL) to enable the AUV to explore the unknown underwater environment autonomously. In this paper, a grid map of the search environment is built by the grid method. The designed asynchronous advantage actor-critic (A3C) network structure is used in the traditional frontier exploration method for target search tasks. This network structure enables the AUV to learn from its own experience and generate search strategies for the various unknown environment. At the same time, DRL and dual-stream Q-learning algorithms are used for AUV navigation to further optimize the search path. The simulations and experiments in an unknown underwater environment with different layouts show that the proposed algorithm can accomplish target search tasks with a high success rate, and it can adapt to different environments. In addition, compared to other search methods, the frontier exploration algorithm based on DRL can search a wider environment faster, which results in a higher search efficiency and reduced search time.

AB Autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) are widely used in the field of ocean engineering. Steady state analysis of a AUV is considered a necessary part in the design process. A rear dual propeller vector propulsion AUV is developed in this paper. Motivated by improving the AUV stability, a washout filter-based feedback optimization methodology for AUV is presented. First, with the AUV structural parameters, a AUV four degree-of-freedom mathematical model of the motion space is calculated to provide a mathematical basis for rock-bottom steady state control systems. Second, the transfer function of the filter is derived according to the pole-zero and root locus map of the AUV system. The washout filter correction model is established based on the root locus map and is connected in series with the AUV space-state model. The simulation analysis result shows that the stability of a system is greatly increased after the whole system is connected to the filter. Finally, the AUV thrust pool test and sailing test are carried out. The experimental results show that the proposed method can improve the thrust stability of a system. This method can be applied to AUV thrust control systems.

AB A vision-based obstacle detection system is a key enabler for the development of autonomous robots and vehicles and intelligent transportation systems. This paper addresses the problem of urban scene monitoring and tracking of obstacles based on unsupervised, deep-learning approaches. Here, we design an innovative hybrid encoder that integrates deep Boltzmann machines (DBM) and auto-encoders (AE). This hybrid auto-encode (HAE) model combines the greedy learning features of DBM with the dimensionality reduction capacity of AE to accurately and reliably detect the presence of obstacles. We combine the proposed hybrid model with the one-class support vector machines (OCSVM) to visually monitor an urban scene. We also propose an efficient approach to estimating obstacles location and track their positions via scene densities. Specifically, we address obstacle detection as an anomaly detection problem. If an obstacle is detected by the OCSVM algorithm, then localization and tracking algorithm is executed. We validated the effectiveness of our approach by using experimental data from two publicly available dataset, the Malaga stereovision urban dataset (MSVUD) and the Daimler urban segmentation dataset (DUSD). Results show the capacity of the proposed approach to reliably detect obstacles. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Neuromorphic hardware emulates dynamics of biological neural networks in electronic circuits offering an alternative to the von Neumann computing architecture that is low-power, inherently parallel, and event-driven. This hardware allows to implement neural-network based robotic controllers in an energy-efficient way with low latency, but requires solving the problem of device variability, characteristic for analog electronic circuits. In this work, we interfaced amixed-signal analog-digital neuromorphic processor ROLLS to a neuromorphic dynamic vision sensor (DVS) mounted on a robotic vehicle and developed an autonomous neuromorphic agent that is able to perform neurally inspired obstacle-avoidance and target acquisition. We developed a neural network architecture that can cope with device variability and verified its robustness in different environmental situations, e.g., moving obstacles, moving target, clutter, and poor light conditions. We demonstrate how this network, combined with the properties of the DVS, allows the robot to avoid obstacles using a simple biologically-inspired dynamics. We also show how a Dynamic Neural Field for target acquisition can be implemented in spiking neuromorphic hardware. This work demonstrates an implementation of working obstacle avoidance and target acquisition using mixed signal analog/digital neuromorphic hardware.

AB This paper models Robotic Mobile Fulfillment Systems and analyzes their performance. A Robotic Mobile Fulfillment System is an automated, parts-to-picker storage system where robots bring pods with products to a workstation. It is especially suited for e-commerce distribution centers with large assortments of small products, and with strong demand fluctuations. Its most important feature is the ability to automatically sort inventory and to adapt the warehouse layout in a short period of time. Queueing network models are developed for both single-line and multi-line orders, to analytically estimate maximum order throughput, average order cycle time, and robot utilization. These models can be used to quickly evaluate different warehouse layouts, or robot zoning strategies. Two main contributions are that the models include accurate driving behavior of robots and multi-line orders. The results show that: (1) the analytical models accurately estimate robot utilization, workstation utilization, and order cycle time, (2) maximum order throughput is quite insensitive to the length-to-width ratio of the storage area and (3) maximum order throughput is affected by the location of the workstations around the storage area.

AB We targeted a habitat used differentially by deep-diving, air-breathing predators to empirically sample their prey's distributions off southern California. Fine-scale measurements of the spatial variability of potential prey animals from the surface to 1 200 m were obtained using conventional fisheries echosounders aboard a surface ship and uniquely integrated into a deep-diving autonomous vehicle. Significant spatial variability in the size, composition, total biomass, and spatial organization of biota was evident over all spatial scales examined and was consistent with the general distribution patterns of foraging Cuvier's beaked whales (Ziphius cavirostris) observed in separate studies. Striking differences found in prey characteristics between regions at depth, however, did not reflect differences observed in surface layers. These differences in deep pelagic structure horizontally and relative to surface structure, absent clear physical differences, change our long-held views of this habitat as uniform. The revelation that animals deep in the water column are so spatially heterogeneous at scales from 10 m to 50 km critically affects our understanding of the processes driving predator prey interactions, energy transfer, biogeochemical cycling, and other ecological processes in the deep sea, and the connections between the productive surface mixed layer and the deep-water column.

ID VISION
AB Vision-based road detection is important for different applications in transportation, such as autonomous driving, vehicle collision warning, and pedestrian crossing detection. Common approaches to road detection are based on low-level road appearance (e.g., color or texture) and neglect of the scene geometry and context. Hence, using only low-level features makes these algorithms highly depend on structured roads, road homogeneity, and lighting conditions. Therefore, the aim of this paper is to classify road geometries for road detection through the analysis of scene composition and temporal coherence. Road geometry classification is proposed by building corresponding models from training images containing prototypical road geometries. We propose adaptive shape models where spatial pyramids are steered by the inherent spatial structure of road images. To reduce the influence of lighting variations, invariant features are used. Large-scale experiments show that the proposed road geometry classifier yields a high recognition rate of 73.57% +/- 13.1, clearly outperforming other state-of-the-art methods. Including road shape information improves road detection results over existing appearance-based methods. Finally, it is shown that invariant features and temporal information provide robustness against disturbing imaging conditions.

AB Due to costs, size and mass, commercially available inertial navigation systems are not suitable for small, autonomous flying vehicles like ALEX and other UAVs. In contrast, by using modern MEMS (or of similar class) sensors, hardware costs, size and mass can be reduced substantially. However, low-cost sensors often suffer from inaccuracy and are influenced greatly by temperature variation. In this work, such inaccuracies and dependence on temperature variations have been studied, modelled and compensated in order to reach an adequate quality of measurements for the estimation of attitudes. This has been done applying a Kalman Filter-based sensor fusion algorithm that combines sensor models, error parameters and estimation scheme. Attitude estimation from low-cost sensors is first realized in a Matlab/Simulink platform and then implemented on hardware by programming the micro controller and validated. The accuracies of the estimated roll and pitch attitudes are well within the stipulated accuracy level of +/-L5degrees for the ALEX. However, the estimation of heading, which is. mainly derived from the magnetometer readings, seems to be influenced greatly by the variation in local magnetic field.

AB Accompanied by the construction of new power system with renewable energy, like the offshore wind power and desert photovoltaic power, terrestrial ground 5G is no longer able to fulfill the communication requirement of industrial power IoT (IPIoT) with tremendous equipment in remote areas. Under this circumstances, we put forward the NOMA-enabled space-air-ground integrated IPIoT network (SAGIN-IPIoT) model, with a satellite to achieve wide coverage, and multiple UAVs to strengthen hot spot communication. NOMA is leveraged to improve system throughput by allowing the common frequency resource shared among multiple users. An energy-efficient (EE) maximization problem is formulated to jointly optimize subchannel and terminal power. However, since the objective involves both continuous and binary variables, it is a mixed integer nonlinear programming (MINLP) issue. Thus, we decompose it into two subproblems, which are respectively solved by matching game and Lagrange dual method with low complexity. According to the theoretical analysis and simulations, we can conclude that the method has better performance than the benchmark method.

ID INITIAL ALIGNMENT; SINS/DVL
AB The strap-down inertial navigation system (SINS) and Doppler velocity log (DVL) integrated navigation system are widely used for autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs). Whereas DVL works in the water tracking mode, the velocity provided by DVL is relative to the current layer and cannot be directly used to suppress the divergence of SINS errors. Therefore, the estimation and compensation of the ocean current velocity play an essential role in improving navigation positioning accuracy. In recent works, ocean currents are considered constant over a short term in small areas. In the common KF algorithm with the ocean current as a state vector, the current velocity cannot be estimated because the current velocity and the SINS velocity error are coupled. In this paper, two virtual metrology filter (VMF) methods are proposed for estimating the velocity of ocean currents based on the properties that the currents remain unchanged at the adjacent moments. New measurement equations are constructed to decouple the current velocity and the SINS velocity error, respectively. Simulations and lake tests show that both proposed methods are effective in estimating the current velocity, and each has its advantages in estimating the ocean current velocity or the misalignment angle.

AB Fine-grained urban environment instance segmentation is a fundamental and important task in the field of environment perception for autonomous vehicles. To address this goal, a model was designed with LiDAR pointcloud data and camera image data as the subject of study, and the reliability of the model was enhanced using dual fusion at the data level and feature level. By introducing the Markov Random Field algorithm, the Support Vector Machine classification results were optimized according to the spatial contextual linkage while providing the model with the prerequisite of the differentiation of similar but foreign objects, and the object classification and instance segmentation of 3D urban environments were completed by combining the Mean Shift. The dual fusion approach in this paper is a method for the deeper fusion of data from different sources, and the model, designed more accurately, describes the categories of items in the environment with a classification accuracy of 99.3%, and segments the different individuals into groups of the same kind of objects without instance labels. Moreover, our model does not have high computational resource and time cost requirements, and is a lightweight, efficient, and accurate instance segmentation model.

AB This article presents the research and results of field tests and simulations regarding an autonomous/robotic railway vehicle, designed to collect multiple information on safety and functional parameters of a surface railway and/or subway section, based on data fusion and machine learning. The maintenance of complex railways, or subway networks with long operating times is a difficult process and intensive resources consuming. The proposed solution delivers human operators in the fault management service and operations from the time-consuming task of railway inspection and measurements, by integrating several sensors and collecting most relevant information on railway, associated automation equipment and infrastructure on a single intelligent platform. The robotic cart integrates autonomy, remote sensing, artificial intelligence, and ability to detect even infrastructural anomalies. Moreover, via a future process of complex statistical filtering of data, it is foreseen that the solution might be configured to offer second-order information about infrastructure changes, such as land sliding, water flooding, or similar modifications. Results of simulations and field tests show the ability of the platform to integrate several fault management operations in a single process, useful in increasing railway capacity and resilience.</p>

AB Autonomous underwater vehicle based mobile networks (AUV-MNs) are utilized in a wide range of marine applications and are likely to play a key role in the implementation of beyond 5G mobile space, air, ground, and sea networks. Communication technology and positioning technology are two key technologies for AUV-MNs, both of which are dependent on the accurate measurement of the underwater acoustic range. Furthermore, with the development of artificial intelligence, the rapid and accurate calculation of underwater acoustic range becomes more important, which affects the decision-making performance of AUV-MNs. In this paper, we propose a fast calculation method of the underwater acoustic horizontal range to guarantee a low-cost, long-endurance AUV-MN (l(2)-AUV-MN-2.0). Using this fast calculation method, we can obtain an accurate horizontal range for the AUV-MNs in a simple manner, thus ensuring the performance of the AUV-MNs. We verify the feasibility and the robustness of the proposed method via simulations. Furthermore, this fast calculation method can be used in other types of ocean networks or systems, such as leader-follower based multi-AUVs collaborative operation networks, and underwater cellular-type networks.

AB Routing is one of the main drivers of the end-to-end performance of bundle transmissions over a disruption tolerant network given the potentially large impact of the temporary but long-term partitioning that can occur at different sections of the network. A neuromorphic networking approach that defines an adaptive bundle routing for disruption-tolerant networks (DTN) is proposed where spiking neuronal networks (SNN) are used to determine the routing decisions of autonomous agents. The event-driven information encoding of spiking neurons involves very low energy consumption, which makes this approach attractive for challenging DTN applications with limited access to energy sources. The SNNs are continually updated within an autonomic loop, which produces synapse strength updates that are proportional to the expected communication costs of the routing decisions. A reward shaping procedure and a delay-tolerant mechanism for finding the local link-state is proposed, which allows determining instantaneous learning rewards for the agents. The method was tested on an emulated space communications network with scheduled disruptions. The results show that the proposed cognitive routing approach offers improved bundle delivery performance under network congestion compared to the standard Contact Graph Routing.

DT Article
AB Up to 90% of global coral reefs are predicted to be severely degraded by 2050 under "business-as-usual" scenarios. To meet the scale and scope of this challenge, we propose designing and demonstrating a multi-modal system that can incorporate data from remote sensing (satellites, aircraft, and aerial drones), acoustics, genetics, sensor arrays, and low-cost imaging systems. The latter will be collected by low-cost smart sensing and autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) guided by adaptive sampling modeling software and rapidly analyzed using automated machine learning systems. Development and deployment will be linked to extensive and diversity-enhancing training programs. The Coral Sentinel System will be globally deployed to enable rapid-response adaptive management and to build public engagement in conservation interventions to save coral reefs.
   Phase 1 (Year 1) will involve testing assumptions, coalition building, fundraising, and initial system development. Phase 2 (Years 2-4) will focus on engineering and development with a pilot deployment in the Caribbean. Phase 3 (Years 5-6) will involve system expansion and iteration along the Tropical Eastern Pacific corridor. Phase 4 (Years 7-10) will involve global deployment to over 50 reef sites. This will lead during the following decade (Phase 5) to provisioning of low-cost Sentinel systems to coastal communities globally.

AB The need to block specific frequencies of electromagnetic (EM) waves in complex communication systems such as in wireless autonomous vehicles with EM absorption films is becoming increasingly important. Increasing safety requirements necessitate that the films operate with highly precise and accurate frequency selectivity, while commercial specifications demand extremely small thicknesses. Herein, we demonstrate that the mixing of ferroelectric BaTiO3 particles into a soft magnetic FeSiAl flake composite, followed by heat-pressing, not only enhances the electric permittivity,., which can be further tuned by oxygen vacancy engineering, but also increases the effective magnetic permeability, mu, by geometrically-induced suppression of eddy current losses and stressed-induced enhancements in the saturation magnetization. The enhanced refractive index (root epsilon mu) in conjunction with the dielectric and magnetic loss leads to perfect absorption at a unique thickness that is similar to 15-44% thinner than its magnetic counterpart and an order of magnitude less than a quarter wavelength. These results pave the way for developing highly precise frequency selective absorption films with subwavelength thicknesses, and also provide strategies for reducing the soft magnetic material content in high-frequency ferromagnetic applications for decreased materials cost and weight.

AB Terramechanics plays an important role in determining the design and control of autonomous robots and other vehicles that move on granular surfaces. Traction capabilities, slippage, and sinkage of a robot are governed by the interaction of a robot's appendage with the operating terrain. It is important to understand how the terrain flows under this appendage during such an interaction. In this work, dynamics of soil performance and locomotion performance of a lugged wheel travelling on soft soil are numerically investigated. Studies are conducted with a two-dimensional model by using the discrete element method to analyze the interactions between a lugged wheel and the soil. The soil performance is studied by examining the force distribution and evolution of force networks during the course of the wheel travel. For two different control modes, namely, slip-based wheel control and angular velocity-based wheel control, the performance parameters such as, sinkage, traction, traction efficiency, and power consumption of the wheel are compared for various wheel configurations. The findings of this work are expected to be useful for optimal design and control of the lugged wheel travelling on deformable surfaces. (C) 2021 ISTVS. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB In this paper, a neurodynamics-based output feedback scheme is proposed for distributed containment maneuvering of marine vessels guided by multiple parameterized paths without using velocity measurements. Each vessel is subject to internal model uncertainties and external disturbances induced by wind, waves, and ocean currents. In order to recover unmeasured velocity information as well as to identify unknown vessel dynamics, an echo state network (ESN) based observer using recorded input-output data is proposed for each vessel. Based on the observed velocity information of neighboring vessels, distributed containment maneuvering laws are developed at the kinematic level. Next, in order to shape the transient motion profile for vessel kinetics to follow, finite-time nonlinear tracking differentiators are employed to generate smooth reference signals as well as to extract the time derivatives of kinematic control laws. Finally, ESN-based dynamic control laws are constructed at the kinetic level. The stability of the closed-loop system is analyzed via input-to-state stability and cascade theory. Simulation results are provided to illustrate the efficacy of the proposed neurodynamics-based output feedback approach.

AB Autonomous Underwater Vehicles (AUVs) are increasingly important tools for marine applications. A reasonably reliable prediction of their six degrees of freedom (6DOF) motions is essential. The manoeuvrability of these unmanned submarines relies on the capability to predict the hydrodynamic forces on a freely moving submerged body. Numerical simulators integrating the full physics of the problem have been developed but their validation remains the key issue. Three-dimensional calculations still take too much computing power to complete the very large number of simulations which is required for a full validation procedure. Furthermore, a very large pool with expensive measuring devices is also necessary to obtain experimental results. It was therefore decided to construct a 2D hydrodynamic tunnel in which an object can move with three degrees of freedom solely subjected to gravity and hydrodynamic forces. In the present paper, we describe the experimental device ensuring a simple and rapid implementation of trials: a 2D channel with a constant uniform flow. A general validation is considered with an ellipse. The experimental trajectories are compared with the corresponding analytical results and discussed at the end of the paper. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

DE Obstacle avoidance; Wavefront algorithm; Reachable set; Grid map
AB Autonomous aviation continuously becomes more and more important. Algorithms that enable this autonomy have developed quickly in the last years. This paper describes a concept for a reactive path planning algorithm. The aim is to develop a method for static obstacle avoidance of an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) by calculating collision-free paths within the field of view of a UAV's obstacle detection sensor. In contrast to other algorithms, this method considers the properties of the obstacle detection sensors, plans paths that the UAV is able to track, and is applied in three-dimensional space without access to an inner loop controller. In this work we represent the field of view of a UAV as a grid map and apply the wavefront algorithm as the local path planning algorithm. We reduce the configuration space of UAVs within the field of view by calculating an approximated worst-case reachable set based on a linearized reference model. We evaluate the method with approximated specifications for the unmanned helicopters ARTIS and Yamaha RMAX, and with specifications for the obstacle detection sensors LIDAR - and stereo camera. Experiments show that this method is able to generate collision-free paths in a region constricted by obstacles.

AB Many microorganisms are advected in the lower atmosphere from one habitat to another with scales of motion being hundreds to thousands of kilometers. The concentration of these microbes in the lower atmosphere at a single geographic location can show rapid temporal changes. We used autonomous unmanned aerial vehicles equipped with microbe-sampling devices to collect fungi in the genus Fusarium 100 m above ground level at a single sampling location in Blacksburg, Virginia, USA. Some Fusarium species are important plant and animal pathogens, others saprophytes, and still others are producers of dangerous toxins. We correlated punctuated changes in the concentration of Fusarium to the movement of atmospheric transport barriers identified as finite-time Lyapunov exponent-based Lagrangian coherent structures (LCSs). An analysis of the finite-time Lyapunov exponent field for periods surrounding 73 individual flight collections of Fusarium showed a relationship between punctuated changes in concentrations of Fusarium and the passage times of LCSs, particularly repelling LCSs. This work has implications for understanding the atmospheric transport of invasive microbial species into previously unexposed regions and may contribute to information systems for pest management and disease control in the future.

ID DEFECTS
AB Photoelectric sensors are utilized in a range of safety-critical applications, such as medical devices and autonomous vehicles. However, the public exposure of the input channel of a photoelectric sensor makes it vulnerable to malicious inputs. Several studies have suggested possible attacks on photoelectric sensors by injecting malicious signals. While a few defense techniques have been proposed against such attacks, they could be either bypassed or used for limited purposes.
   In this study, we propose Lightbox, a novel defense system to detect sensor attacks on photoelectric sensors based on signal fingerprinting. Lightbox uses the spectrum of the received light as a feature to distinguish the attacker's malicious signals fromthe authentic signal, which is a signal from the sensor's light source. We evaluated Lightbox against (1) a saturation attacker, (2) a simple spoofing attacker, and (3) a sophisticated attacker who is aware of Lightbox and can combine multiple light sources tomimic the authentic light source. Lightbox achieved the overall accuracy over 99% for the saturation attacker and simple spoofing attacker, and robustness against a sophisticated attacker. We also evaluated Lightbox considering various environments such as transmission medium, background noise, and input waveform. Finally, we demonstrate the practicality of Lightbox with experiments using a single-board computer after further reducing the training time.

AB A robust interactive multiple model (RIMM) algorithm with the adaptive model set is proposed to improve the performance of inertial navigation system (INS) and Doppler velocity log (DVL) integrated navigation system under a complex measurement environment with undesirable heavy-tailed non-Gaussian noise. Specifically, an improved Huber kernel function is applied to the robust error state Kalman filter (ESKF) for its benefit of better resisting larger measurement outliers. In addition, a flexible adaptive model set update strategy is proposed where the model set is determined by the current and historical measurement information stored in the sliding window. Also, for the model set update, the main model is no longer fixed, and it will be determined based on the probability weights corresponding to each model. This innovative RIMM algorithm is compared with ESKF, interactive multiple model (IMM), and hybrid IMM (HIMM) through simulations, autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) lake trial, and semiphysical simulations. Experimental results show that our proposed algorithm has outstanding accuracy and robustness under a heavy-tailed non-Gaussian noise environment.

TI Compact and automated eDNA sampler for in situ monitoring of marine

AB Using environmental DNA (eDNA) to monitor biodiversity in aquatic environments is becoming an efficient and cost-effective alternative to other methods such as visual and acoustic identification. Until recently, eDNA sampling was accomplished primarily through manual sampling methods; however, with technological advances, automated samplers are being developed to make sampling easier and more accessible. This paper describes a new eDNA sampler capable of self-cleaning and multi-sample capture and preservation, all within a single unit capable of being deployed by a single person. The first in-field test of this sampler took place in the Bedford Basin, Nova Scotia, Canada alongside parallel samples taken using the typical Niskin bottle collection and post-collection filtration method. Both methods were able to capture the same aquatic microbial community and counts of representative DNA sequences were well correlated between methods with R-2 values ranging from 0.71-0.93. The two collection methods returned the same top 10 families in near identical relative abundance, demonstrating that the sampler was able to capture the same community composition of common microbes as the Niskin. The presented eDNA sampler provides a robust alternative to manual sampling methods, is amenable to autonomous vehicle payload constraints, and will facilitate persistent monitoring of remote and inaccessible sites.

DE ASBL positioning; AUV remote guidance; INS error correction
AB The low-cost, small-sized autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) is the preferred carrier for seabed operations. As all know, the inertial navigation system (INS) error drifts over time. Three or more seafloor datum signals are required when error-correcting the INS using the long baseline (LBL). Typically, a seafloor datum has an acoustic ranging capability of 15 km. However, the positioning ability of the conventional LBL is limited and cannot play the role of remote guidance when there is only a single datum. The paper proposes the Acoustic Synthetic Baseline (ASBL) positioning technology, which can achieve target positioning through multi-frame acoustic distance estimates between the measured target and the underwater datum. Firstly, the positioning principle of the ASBL is introduced, and the error distribution is analyzed in the paper. Secondly, a small-sized AUV is used to carry out the verification on the lake test, and the result shows that the ASBL positioning technology can play a guiding role. According to the statistics of the positioning results, the detection probability of less than 5% positioning error can reach more than 83%. The ASBL technology can reduce the dependence on the number of seafloor datums that convenience and operation efficiency can improve only by a single datum.

TI Gaussian Radar Transformer for Semantic Segmentation in Noisy Radar Data
SO IEEE ROBOTICS AND AUTOMATION LETTERS
LA English
DT Article
DE Semantic Scene Understanding; Deep Learning Methods
AB Scene understanding is crucial for autonomous robots in dynamic environments for making future state predictions, avoiding collisions, and path planning. Camera and LiDAR perception made tremendous progress in recent years, but face limitations under adverse weather conditions. To leverage the full potential of multi-modal sensor suites, radar sensors are essential for safety critical tasks and are already installed in most new vehicles today. In this letter, we address the problem of semantic segmentation of moving objects in radar point clouds to enhance the perception of the environment with another sensor modality. Instead of aggregating multiple scans to densify the point clouds, we propose a novel approach based on the self-attention mechanism to accurately perform sparse, single-scan segmentation. Our approach, called Gaussian Radar Transformer, includes the newly introduced Gaussian transformer layer, which replaces the softmax normalization by a Gaussian function to decouple the contribution of individual points. To tackle the challenge of the transformer to capture long-range dependencies, we propose our attentive up and downsampling modules to enlarge the receptive field and capture strong spatial relations. We compare our approach to other state-of-the-art methods on the RadarScenes data set and show superior segmentation quality in diverse environments, even without exploiting temporal information.

AB A new dynamic programming based algorithm for real-time simultaneous segmentation, compression, and C2 -smoothing of potentially infinite data streams - studied in the context of streaming sensor data - is shown to be both effective and (energy) efficient. Its three key elements - the cubic splinelet based adaptive search space, the objective function (combining two measures of approximation errors), and the two-phase search space reduction technique (combining segment length based pruning and surrogate based pruning) - are presented in detail. The output quality is measured in terms of the signal approximation accuracy and the corresponding compression ratio. The numerical results show that the new algorithm outperforms both reference algorithms for all test streams, in some cases-significantly (up to 32% smaller approximation errors and up to 41% higher compression ratios). Due to the effective search space auto-adaptation and special pruning techniques, in typical cases, this is obtained with significantly lower computational cost. The proposed algorithm can be applied to various domains including online compression and smoothing of streaming data coming from IoT devices, sensor networks, and sensors located in autonomous vehicles (cars, drones) and robots. The possible application areas also include real-time IoT analytics and embedded time-series databases.

DE Mars terrain; rovers; terrain classification; terrain visual features
AB It is important for Mars exploration rovers to achieve autonomous and safe mobility over rough terrain. Terrain classification can help rovers to select a safe terrain to traverse and avoid sinking and/or damaging the vehicle. Mars terrains are often classified using visual methods. However, the accuracy of terrain classification has been less than 90% in read operations. A high-accuracy vision-based method for Mars terrain classification is presented in this paper. By analyzing Mars terrain characteristics, novel image features, including multiscale gray gradient-grade features, multiscale edges strength-grade features, multiscale frequency-domain mean amplitude features, multiscale spectrum symmetry features, and multiscale spectrum amplitude-moment features, are proposed that are specifically targeted for terrain classification. Three classifiers, K-nearest neighbor (KNN), support vector machine (SVM), and random forests (RF), are adopted to classify the terrain using the proposed features. The Mars image dataset MSLNet that was collected by the Mars Science Laboratory (MSL, Curiosity) rover is used to conduct terrain classification experiments. The resolution of Mars images in the dataset is 256 x 256. Experimental results indicate that the RF classifies Mars terrain at the highest level of accuracy of 94.66%.

AB Mobile Ad hoc Networks (MANETs) are intended to work without a fixed framework and provide dependable interchanges to ground vehicles, boats, airplanes, or people and structure a self-mending process that will empower persistent correspondences in any event, when at least one of its nodes are debilitated or briefly expelled from the system. Notwithstanding, MANETs demonstrate themselves to be progressively harder to create for enormous systems with hundreds or thousands more nodes than initially envisioned. In our proposed technique, the node switches its communication mode depending on the connectivity of the adjacent nodes. The transmission power of each node will be calculated with the help of two major scenarios i.e., tree scenario and zone scenario. The autonomous clustering of the nodes among the tree and the zone scenario will be channelized by a comparison of the transmission power (residual energy) among the nodes. The inter and the intra communication of the node is also discussed in the paper. The result will be carried out by the simulation work in various perspectives, such as checking the percentage level of malicious nodes, traffic density, transmission power, and the longevity of nodes.

AB This article addresses a trajectory tracking control approach for an uncertain surface vessel using the new cascade structure of adaptive reinforcement learning (ARL) algorithm and kinematic controller, feed-forward term. Since a surface vessel is decoupled by kinematic sub-system and dynamic sub-system, the cascade control system is an ideal method for obtaining the tracking problem. In the proposed control structure, the dynamic control loop is designed to be the optimized method of the corresponding dynamic sub-system and the kinematic control loop is implemented by a nonlinear controller combining with feed-forward term. The online actor-critic architecture is considered in ARL algorithm to overcome the challenge of solving the Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman (HJB) equation. Additionally, the proposed controller is able to handle the difficulty of the non-autonomous optimal control problem by designing the ARL technique for the corresponding system with a small number of state variables. Based on theoretical analysis, the ARL based control design has been made to guarantee the uniformly ultimately bounded (UUB) stability of the closed system. Finally, the simulation results are illustrated to verify the effectiveness of the proposed control scheme.

ID DESIGN
AB This article addresses the development and experimental validation of a trajectory-tracking control for a miniature autonomous Quadrotor helicopter system (X4-prototype) using a robust algorithm control based on second-order sliding mode technique or also known as super-twisting algorithm in outdoor environments. This nonlinear control strategy guarantees the convergence in finite time to a desired path r(t) in the presence of external disturbances or uncertainties in the model affecting the appropriate behavior of our Quadrotor helicopter. For this purpose, a polynomial smooth curve trajectory is selected as a reference signal where the corresponding derivatives of the function are bounded. Moreover, we consider disturbances due to wind gusts acting on the aerial vehicle, and the reference signal is pre-programmed in an advanced autopilot system. The proposed solution consists of implementing a real-time control law based on super-twisting control using GPS measurements in order to obtain the position in the xy-plane to accomplish the desired trajectory. Simulation and experimental results of trajectory-tracking control are presented to demonstrate the performance and robustness of the proposed nonlinear controller in windy conditions.

ID MANAGEMENT; FRAMEWORK
AB The venue of new technologies such as autonomous vehicles implies the design not only of the product but also of services related to it. These systems are known as Product Service Systems (PSS). Moreover, they are not only PSS but also System of Systems (SoS). Up till now, research has been addressing the design of PSS and SoS separately. The PSS literature focuses mainly on the product servitization and the increasing heterogeneity of PSS elements. On the other hand, the SoS literature focuses on the relationships between SoS constituent systems and their management. Both research domains propose systems modeling approaches and systems architectural patterns independently according to PSSs and SoS development contexts. In order to address this gap and support PSSoS design and development, there is a need to identify necessary data, the PSSoS ontology. The proposed ontology is developed with the Unified Modeling Language (UML) and is structured in four views: the stakeholder view, the service view, the systems view, and the operational view. The proposed model has been validated by nine industrial experts as well as five industrial projects; and is illustrated via the case of Plug&Charge within one of the major automotive French constructors.

ID DISTRIBUTED CONTROL; SYNCHRONIZATION; SAFETY
AB This article is concerned with the co-design of fault detection and consensus control protocol for a class of multi-agent systems (MASs) subject to Denial-of-Service attack, where the attack behavior is hidden to the defender as the adversary may launch the attack with different durations but the defender may not know the real situation at each time instant. Due to the complicated attack behavior, a hidden semi-Markov process is introduced where only the observed attack modes emitted by the inaccessible ones are available. The probability density functions of sojourn time and the semi-Markov kernel are adopted to help analyze the combined fault detection and consensus control system. Sufficient conditions on the sigma-error mean square stability of MASs with mixed H-infinity/H- performance are established by using a set of Lyapunov functions that depend on the hidden and the observed attack modes. Moreover, the gain matrices of controller and detector are obtained by solving an optimization problem with some matrix inequality constraints. Finally, the simulation of autonomous unmanned underwater vehicles is used to show the effectiveness of the proposed results.

AB Recently, there has been a fairly rapid increase in interest in the use of UAV swarms both in civilian and military operations. This is mainly due to relatively low cost, greater flexibility, and increasing efficiency of swarms themselves. However, in order to efficiently operate a swarm of UAVs, it is necessary to address the various autonomous behaviors of its constituent elements, to achieve cooperation and suitability to complex scenarios. In order to do so, a novel method for modeling UAV swarm missions and determining behavior for the swarm elements was developed. The proposed method is based on bigraphs with tracking for modeling different tasks and agents activities related to the UAV swarm mission. The key finding of the study is the algorithm for determining all possible behavior policies for swarm elements achieving the objective of the mission within certain assumptions. The design method is scalable, highly automated, and problem-agnostic, which allows to incorporate it in solving different kinds of swarm tasks. Additionally, it separates the mission modeling stage from behavior determining thus allowing new algorithms to be used in the future. Two simulation case studies are presented to demonstrate how the design process deals with typical aspects of a UAV swarm mission.

ID BUOYANCY CONTROL
AB Hovering at any depth, is one of the most important requirements for underwater robotics, which calls for large-range buoyancy control ability. Although various underwater robotics have been proposed and developed, the requirements of noise-free, environmental tolerance, and low energy consumption in hovering manipulation, are still attracting a lot of attention for underwater tasks. Herein, a submersible soft-robotic platform driven by the self-contained liquid-vapor phase transition is developed. The proposed soft-robotic platform precisely modulates its buoyancy, showing an excellent positioning ability underwater. The proposed soft-robotic platform performs reversible rise-and-sink motions underwater, and generate a buoyancy force of 0.93N (131% of its weight) with an accuracy of +/- 2.5mN, at a heating temperature of 63 degrees C. It shows that more than 40% of the total buoyancy change is achieved within 55s, and the platform hovers in any depth in a range of 450mm (limited by the adopted water container) in 18s, with positioning fluctuation of 17.42mm. This soft-robotic platform demonstrates active vertical motions in water and suggests a feasible approach to develop noisy-free and high-reliability underwater robots, which guide the further design of autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs).

AB This paper proves the ultimately boundedness analysis for the trajectory tracking problem between the states of an uncertain nonlinear system represented by a Takagi-Sugeno (T-S) system and a given set of desired trajectories. The design of an output feedback controller includes a weighted contribution of the models included in the T-S design. The proposed T-S fuzzy estimates the state variables based on the output information, exclusively. The output-based controller design uses a time-dependent Lyapunov function yielding the characterisation of ultimate boundedness for the trajectory tracking error. Sufficient conditions are obtained to ensure the existence of positive-definite solutions for two coupled time-varying matrix Riccati equations, which are needed to solve the tracking problem. A simplified scheme determines the gains for the feedback controller and observer. The proposed control law solves the trajectory tracking of an autonomous underwater vehicle. In this case, numerical solutions show that the controller forced the convergence of the tracking error after 2.0 seconds. An alternative control design approach based on linear matrix inequalities (LMI) is used for comparison purposes. The suggested controller forces a faster convergence of the tracking error than the LMI-based one and provides a smaller ultimate bound.

AB Over the past few decades, interest in theories and algorithms for face recognition has been growing rapidly. Video surveillance, criminal identification, building access control, and unmanned and autonomous vehicles are just a few examples of concrete applications that are gaining attraction among industries. Various techniques are being developed including local, holistic, and hybrid approaches, which provide a face image description using only a few face image features or the whole facial features. The main contribution of this survey is to review some well-known techniques for each approach and to give the taxonomy of their categories. In the paper, a detailed comparison between these techniques is exposed by listing the advantages and the disadvantages of their schemes in terms of robustness, accuracy, complexity, and discrimination. One interesting feature mentioned in the paper is about the database used for face recognition. An overview of the most commonly used databases, including those of supervised and unsupervised learning, is given. Numerical results of the most interesting techniques are given along with the context of experiments and challenges handled by these techniques. Finally, a solid discussion is given in the paper about future directions in terms of techniques to be used for face recognition.

AB As a new type of part-to-picker storage system, the double-deep multi-tier shuttle system has been developed rapidly in the e-commerce industry because of its high flexibility, large storage capacity, and robustness. The system consists of a multi-tier shuttle sub-system that controls horizontal movement and a lift sub-system that manages vertical movement. The combination of shuttles and lifts, instead of a stacker crane in conventional automated storage and retrieval system, undertakes inbound/outbound tasks. Because of the complex structure and numerous equipment of the system, task scheduling has become a major difficulty in the outbound operation of the double-deep multi-tier shuttle system. Figuring out methods to improve the overall efficiency of task scheduling operations is the focus of current system application enterprises. This paper introduces the task scheduling problem for the shuttle system. Inspired from workshop production scheduling problems, we minimize the total time of a batch of retrieval tasks as the objective function, applying the modified Simulated Annealing Algorithms (SAAs) to solve the task scheduling problem. In conclusion, we verified the proposed model and the algorithm efficiency, using case studies.

AB The next generation of vehicles will be autonomous, connected, electric, and intelligent with distinct requirements such as high mobility, low latency, real-time applications, seamless connectivity, and security. Blockchain can provide a good solution to the issue of secure message dissemination or secure information sharing in vehicular networks with a weak trust relationship among the nodes. In this paper, we investigate the design of a regional blockchain for VANETs, where the blockchain is shared among nodes in a geographically bounded area. We investigate how to design the regional blockchain while achieving a low 51% attack success probability. We derive a condition that guarantees a low 51% attack success probability in terms of the numbers of good nodes and malicious nodes, the message delivery time, and the puzzle computation time. The condition can provide a useful guideline for selection of several control parameters guaranteeing the stable operation of the blockchain. We run several simulations to show the validity of the condition and investigate the effects of various parameters on the 51% attack success probability. Our analysis and simulation results show that maintaining a low message delivery time for good nodes is very important in protecting the stability of the blockchain system.

ID MOBILITY
AB It is expected that in the near future wireless sensor network (WSNs) will be more widely used in the mobile environment, in applications such as Autonomous Underwater Vehicles (AUVs) for marine monitoring and mobile robots for environmental investigation. The sensor nodes' mobility can easily cause changes to the structure of a network topology, and lead to the decline in the amount of transmitted data, excessive energy consumption, and lack of security. To solve these problems, a kind of efficient Topology Control algorithm for node Mobility (TCM) is proposed. In the topology construction stage, an efficient clustering algorithm is adopted, which supports sensor node movement. It can ensure the balance of clustering, and reduce the energy consumption. In the topology maintenance stage, the digital signature authentication based on Error Correction Code (ECC) and the communication mechanism of soft handover are adopted. After verifying the legal identity of the mobile nodes, secure communications can be established, and this can increase the amount of data transmitted. Compared to some existing schemes, the proposed scheme has significant advantages regarding network topology stability, amounts of data transferred, lifetime and safety performance of the network.

ID EXTRACTION
AB Combined databases of road markings and traffic signs provide a complete and full description of the present traffic legislation and instructions. Such databases contribute to efficient signage maintenance, improve navigation, and benefit autonomous driving vehicles. A system is presented for the automated creation of such combined databases, which additionally investigates the benefit of this combination for automated contextual placement analysis. This analysis involves verification of the co-occurrence of traffic signs and road markings to retrieve a list of potentially incorrectly signaled (and thus potentially unsafe) road situations. This co-occurrence verification is specifically explored for both pedestrian crossings and yield situations. Evaluations on 420 km of road have shown that individual detection of traffic signs and road markings denoting these road situations can be performed with accuracies of 98% and 85%, respectively. Combining both approaches shows that over 95% of the pedestrian crossings and give-way situations can be identified. An exploration toward additional co-occurrence analysis of signs and markings shows that inconsistently signaled situations can successfully be extracted, such that specific safety actions can be directed toward cases lacking signs or markings, while most consistently signaled situations can be omitted from this analysis.

AB Many mobile robots and autonomous vehicles designed for outdoor operation have incorporated ultrasonic sensors in their navigation systems, whose function is mainly to avoid possible collisions with very close obstacles. The use of these systems in more precise tasks requires signal encoding and the incorporation of pulse compression techniques that have already been used with success in the design of high-performance indoor sonars. However, the transmission of ultrasonic encoded signals outdoors entails a new challenge because of the effects of atmospheric turbulence. This phenomenon causes random fluctuations in the phase and amplitude of traveling acoustic waves, a fact that can make the encoded signal completely unrecognizable by its matched receiver. Atmospheric turbulence is investigated in this work, with the aim of determining the conditions under which it is possible to assure the reliable outdoor operation of an ultrasonic pulse compression system. As a result of this analysis, a novel sonar prototype based on complementary sequences coding is developed and experimentally tested. This encoding scheme provides the system with very useful additional features, namely, high robustness to noise, multi-mode operation capability (simultaneous emissions with minimum cross talk interference), and the possibility of applying an efficient detection algorithm that notably decreases the hardware resource requirements.

AB Mobile devices such as smartphones and autonomous vehicles increasingly rely on deep neural networks (DNNs) to execute complex inference tasks such as image classification and speech recognition, among others. However, continuously executing the entire DNN on mobile devices can quickly deplete their battery. Although task offloading to cloud/edge servers may decrease the mobile device's computational burden, erratic patterns in channel quality, network, and edge server load can lead to a significant delay in task execution. Recently, approaches based on split computing (SC) have been proposed, where the DNN is split into a head and a tail model, executed respectively on the mobile device and on the edge server. Ultimately, this may reduce bandwidth usage as well as energy consumption. Another approach, called early exiting (EE), trains models to embed multiple "exits" earlier in the architecture, each providing increasingly higher target accuracy. Therefore, the tradeoff between accuracy arid delay can be tuned according to the current conditions or application demands. In this article, we provide a comprehensive survey of the state of the art in SC and EE strategies by presenting a comparison of the most relevant approaches. We conclude the article by providing a set of compelling research challenges.

AB Underwater solar cells (UWSCs) provide an ideal alternative to the energy supply for long-endurance autonomous underwater vehicles. However, different from conventional solar cells situated on land or above water, UWSCs give preference to use wide bandgap semiconductors (>= 1.8 eV) as light absorber to match underwater solar spectra. Among wide bandgap semiconductors, FAPbBr(3) perovskite is under prime consideration owing to its matching optical bandgap (approximate to 2.3 eV), outstanding photoelectric properties, easier processability, etc. Unfortunately, for FAPbBr(3) solar cells, substantial interface defects greatly limit the charge carrier extraction efficiency, thus limiting the device performance, especially in underwater low-light environments. This study employs a molecular self-assembly strategy to effectively eliminate the interfacial defects. As a result, a great improvement in power conversion efficiency (PCE) from 6.44% to 7.49% is obtained, which is among the best efficiency reported for inverted FAPbBr(3) solar cells up to date. Besides, a champion PCE of 30% is obtained under 520 nm monochromatic light irradiation (4.8 mW cm(-2)). These results demonstrate that FAPbBr(3) solar cells present a tremendously promising application in UWSCs.

AB Aiming at the problems of cooperative control for multiple surface vessels (MSVs), such as unknown environmental disturbances, unavailable velocities, model uncertainties, actuator saturation, and limited action times of the actuator, an event-triggered fixed-time distributed output feedback sliding mode cooperative control method with input saturation is proposed. The scheme ensures the practical fixed-time stability of the cooperative control system. First, a fixed-time extended state observer (FxESO) is designed to provide the estimations of velocities and lumped disturbances including unknown environmental disturbances and model uncertainties. Second, to deal with the actuator saturation, a fixed-time auxiliary dynamic system is designed. Third, a fixed-time non-singular terminal sliding mode manifold (FxNTSMM) is introduced to effectively eliminate singularity and improve chattering of the system. Finally, an event-triggered distributed controller based on FxNTSMM and FxESO is proposed. An event-triggered condition can avoid unnecessary actions of the actuator, and Zeno phenomenon is avoided by theoretical proof. In addition, the upper bound of the convergence time is independent of the initial state. Simulation results are given to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed control scheme.

AB The development of human-robot interaction has been continuously increasing for the last decades. Through this development, it has become simpler and safe interactions using a remotely controlled telepresence robot in an insecure and hazardous environment. The audio-video communication connection or data transmission stability has already been well handled by fast-growing technologies such as 5G and 6G. However, the design of the physical parameters, e.g., maneuverability, controllability, and stability, still needs attention. Therefore, the paper aims to present a systematic, controlled design and implementation of a telepresence mobile robot. The primary focus of this paper is to perform the computational analysis and experimental implementation design with sophisticated position control, which autonomously controls the robot's position and speed when reaching an obstacle. A system model and a position controller design are developed with root locus points. The design robot results are verified experimentally, showing the robot's agreement and control in the desired position. The robot was tested by considering various parameters: driving straight ahead, right turn, self-localization and complex path. The results prove that the proposed approach is flexible and adaptable and gives a better alternative. The experimental results show that the proposed method significantly minimizes the obstacle hits.

ID AUTONOMOUS CARS
AB The advancement of automation in safety-critical systems has opened the door to newer opportunities in several fields. However, the increasing complexity has led to more risks and the need for better safety assessment. Safety testing of Automated Driving Systems (ADS) became an important research topic due to the potential benefits of reducing traffic congestion, time, and even accidents; however, safety remains an ongoing issue. We analyzed the existing literature from the past twenty-five years by performing backward snowballing to identify the proposed safety testing approaches for ADS. From 44 selected publications, we identified safety features, testing methods, techniques, tools, and datasets used for testing an ADS, considering both multi-module and end-to-end driving systems. The community is mostly focused on multi-module driving systems, working on units of functionality related to collision avoidance, lane keeping, and warnings, testing the vehicles on-road and in simulated environments with different driving scenarios, combining different methods and techniques, and proposing custom solutions. A major research gap seems to be the lack of safety testing approaches integrating the advantages of on-road testing with simulation testing. For future research, this study provides an introductory overview of the field for researchers and practitioners interested in ADS safety testing.

TI Path Planning For Unmanned Surface Vehicles Based On Modified Artificial
   Fish Swarm Algorithm With Local Optimizer
SO MATHEMATICAL PROBLEMS IN ENGINEERING
LA English
DT Article
AB The appeal for safe navigation of autonomous surface vessels (ASVs) has deemed the path planning problem as an attractive research interest. However, most of the previous works to solve the path planning problem focus on finding the shortest and collision-free path, but the solutions are scarcely satisfied by the safety requirements and constraints related to the USVs' mechanical systems. To address this challenge, we present a novel path planning method based on a modified artificial fish swarm algorithm in combination with a path optimizer. The modifications are made from two perspectives: (1) Four customized operators and an adaptive factor are applied to improve the convergence performance of the algorithm. (2) A local path optimizer is proposed to enhance its feasibility of cooperating with the USV control system. Path safety, path smoothness, and nonholonomic constraints are considered. The path planning benchmark experiments have demonstrated its superior performance in terms of efficiency and path quality compared to other state-of-the-art algorithms. Moreover, the proposed method is also integrated into the USV's control system in a practical environment with satisfactory feasibility. The simulation results provide strong evidence that the proposed method can be regarded as a practical approach for USV path planning problems.

ID FILTER; WATER
AB The poor quality of underwater images has become a widely-known cause affecting the performance of the underwater development projects, including mineral exploitation, driving photography, and navigation for autonomous underwater vehicles. In recent years, deep learning-based techniques have achieved remarkable successes in image restoration and enhancement tasks. However, the limited availability of paired training data (underwater images and their corresponding clear images) and the requirement for vivid color correction remain challenging for underwater image enhancement, as almost all learning-based methods require paired data for training. In this study, instead of creating the time-consuming paired data, we explore the unsupervised training strategy. Specifically, we introduce a universal cross-domain GAN-based framework to generate high -quality images to address the dependence on paired training data. To ensure the vivid colorfulness, the color loss is designed to constrain the training process. Also, a feature fusion module (FFM) is proposed to increase the capacity of the whole model as well as the dual discriminator channel adopted in the architecture. Extensive quantitative and perceptual experiments show that our approach overcomes the limitation of paired data and obtains superior performance over the state-of-the-art on several underwater benchmarks in terms of both accuracy and model deployment.

AB Audio recognition can be used in smart cities for security, surveillance, manufacturing, autonomous vehicles, and noise mitigation, just to name a few. However, urban sounds are everyday audio events that occur daily, presenting unstructured characteristics containing different genres of noise and sounds unrelated to the sound event under study, making it a challenging problem. Therefore, the main objective of this literature review is to summarize the most recent works on this subject to understand the current approaches and identify their limitations. Based on the reviewed articles, it can be realized that Deep Learning (DL) architectures, attention mechanisms, data augmentation techniques, and pretraining are the most crucial factors to consider while creating an efficient sound classification model. The best-found results were obtained by Mushtaq and Su, in 2020, using a DenseNet-161 with pretrained weights from ImageNet, and NA-1 and NA-2 as augmentation techniques, which were of 97.98%, 98.52%, and 99.22% for UrbanSound8K, ESC-50, and ESC-10 datasets, respectively. Nonetheless, the use of these models in real-world scenarios has not been properly addressed, so their effectiveness is still questionable in such situations.

AB Multi-autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) cooperative localization has become a research hotspot in the marine navigation field. In this paper, a filtering algorithm for slave AUV with compass failure is proposed based on 'two-master-one slave' cooperative localization model. In this algorithm, the course angle is unknown, and non-Gaussian measurement noise caused by measurement outliers is considered. The cooperative localization model is reconstructed, and a filtering algorithm is derived whose performance will not be affected by the unknown course angle. Moreover, the maximum information potential (MIP) criterion is introduced into a recursive model to deal with the non-Gaussian measurement noise in a complicated underwater environment. Simultaneously, the kernel bandwidth is adaptively adjusted by the innovation matrix and the measurement error covariance matrix. The proposed algorithm can accurately estimate the variation of the unknown course angle without expanding the dimension of state under the condition of non-Gaussian measurement noise. Finally, the proposed algorithm is verified through field experiments. The results show that the proposed algorithm has higher accuracy and robustness than other existing algorithms.

AB Deep learning (DL) models have achieved impressive performance in various domains such as medicine, finance, and autonomous vehicle systems with advances in computing power and technologies. However, due to the black-box structure of DL models, the decisions of these learning models often need to be explained to end-users. Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) provides explanations of black-box models to reveal the behavior and underlying decision-making mechanisms of the models through tools, techniques, and algorithms. Visualization techniques help to present model and prediction explanations in a more understandable, explainable, and interpretable way. This survey paper aims to review current trends and challenges of visual analytics in interpreting DL models by adopting XAI methods and present future research directions in this area. We reviewed literature based on two different aspects, model usage and visual approaches. We addressed several research questions based on our findings and then discussed missing points, research gaps, and potential future research directions. This survey provides guidelines to develop a better interpretation of neural networks through XAI methods in the field of visual analytics. (c) 2021 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB This paper considers the leader-follower synchronization control of under-actuated marine vessels for underway replenishment. An integrated guidance and control method is presented to achieve the underway replenishment operations despite of unknown model uncertainties, external disturbances, and unknown velocities of the leader vessel. Specifically, a velocity observer based on a robust exact differentiator (RED) is firstly designed to estimate the unknown velocity of the leader vessel. Next, a finite-time light-of-sight guidance law based on the velocity observer is developed to synchronize the follower vessels with the leader vessel. Then, two disturbance observers based on REDs are designed to estimate the total disturbances composed of model uncertainties and external disturbances at the kinetic level. With the aid of the RED-based disturbance observers, an anti-disturbance nonlinear control law is presented to track the desired guidance signals in finite time. The tracking errors of the closed-loop system are proved to be ultimately uniformly bounded via Lyapunov stability theory. Finally, an example is utilized to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed anti-disturbance synchronization control method for multiple under-actuated marine vessels.

AB We investigate the monolithicintegration of RF antennas onto a silicon-based integrated microwave photonics (IMWP) chip for short-range millimeter-wave (mmW) communication. The unification of antenna with photonic integrated circuits (PICs) reduces system loss for high data rate communication by eliminating parasitic interconnects. This integration of electronics (antenna) with photonics will be a key milestone leading to increased bandwidth capability and ubiquitous wireless links for emerging applications such as 5G, Internet of Things (IoT), autonomous vehicles, high data rate point-to-point communication, and wireless sensors. Through simulation above 20 GHz, we compare the transmission of three on-chip antenna structures designed in a commercial silicon photonics (SiPh) process and consider them for both inter and intra-chip communication. Results provide insight on the transmission gain variations relative to the antenna orientation from their distinct radiation pattern. The folded monopole structure provides superior gain, smaller footprint with layout flexibility, and good transmission spectrum. The analysis supports the idea of a monolithic mmW transmitter integrated with on-chip antennas on IMWP chip.

AB Wave glider is a revolutionary ocean surface autonomous vehicle, which has the ability to convert surface wave motion into forward propulsion. Theoretically, the endurance of the wave glider is unlimited because of the consistent wave energy resources in ocean. Therefore, it has a broad application prospect in ocean survey and observation. However, due to the characteristics of low speed, underactuation and weak maneuvering of the wave glider, the maneuverability is of great significance in improving the cruising efficiency. In this paper, an 8 degree-of-freedom (DOF) mathematical model of the wave glider based on the active propeller control is developed. The performances of two kinds of controllers, i.e., the propeller based controller and the conventional rudder based controller, are compared in simulations in terms of course response, course keeping and turning. Experiments were conducted in the wave tank with the active control based wave glider named "SJTU Mouse". The results demonstrate that the propeller control based wave glider has better maneuverability than the conventional rudder control based wave glider. Finally, sea trial with the "SJTU Mouse" was also conducted, and the results show that the propeller control based wave glider can track the desired course and desired path well under the complex ocean disturbances.

AB Enhancing traffic efficiency and alleviating (even circumventing) traffic congestion with advanced traffic signal control (TSC) strategies are always the main issues to be addressed in urban transportation systems. Since model predictive control (MPC) has a lot of advantages in modeling complex dynamic systems, it has been widely studied in traffic signal control over the past 20 years. There is a need for an in-depth understanding of MPC-based TSC methods for traffic networks. Therefore, this paper presents the motivation of using MPC for TSC and how MPC-based TSC approaches are implemented to manage and control the dynamics of traffic flows both in urban road networks and freeway networks. Meanwhile, typical performance evaluation metrics, solution methods, examples of simulations, and applications related to MPC-based TSC approaches are reported. More importantly, this paper summarizes the recent developments and the research trends in coordination and control of traffic networks with MPC-based TSC approaches. Remaining challenges and open issues are discussed towards the end of this paper to discover potential future research directions.

AB Cooperative hunting by a multi-AUV system in unknown 3D underwater environment is not only a research hot spot but also a challenging task. To conduct this task, each AUV needs to move quickly without obstacle collisions and cooperate with other AUVs considering the overall interests. In this paper, the heterogeneous AUVs cooperative hunting problem is studied, including two main tasks, namely the search and pursuit of targets, and a novel spinal neural system-based approach is proposed. In the search stage, a partition and column parallel search strategy is used in this paper, and a search formation control algorithm based on an improved spinal neural system is proposed. The presented search algorithm not only accomplishes the search task but also maintains a stable formation without obstacle collisions. In the cooperative pursuit stage, a dynamic alliance method based on bidirectional negotiation strategy and a pursuit direction assignment method based on improved genetic algorithm are presented, which can realize the pursuit task efficiently. Finally, some simulations are conducted and the results show that the proposed approach is capable of guiding multi-AUVs to achieve the hunting tasks in unknown 3D underwater environment efficiently.

ID CITIES
AB One of the main evolving trends in the transport system is the assimilation of Information and Communications Technologies (ICTs) and other sophisticated hi-technology innovations into it. Those processes and practices are increasingly referred to as the "Smart Mobility" paradigm. In this paradigm, 'smart' and 'sustainable' are often considered synonymous, or at least complementary to each other. This research aims to examine the extent to which 'smart' and 'sustainable' are aligned with each other by conducting a survey amongst the main actors within smart mobility. These actors are referred to as transport innovators or entrepreneurs. The survey of n = 117 entrepreneurs shows that there is a mismatch between interpretation and understanding of what is 'smart' and what is 'sustainable'. It is clear that the concern of those transport entrepreneurs is primarily with commercial considerations and that their appreciation of what it takes to advance towards a more sustainable transport system is lacking. The belief amongst those entrepreneurs, it emerges, is that technological developments alone, specifically with respect to autonomous and connected vehicles, can lead to sustainable transport. This should be a real concern if those same actors are the ones who lead and pave the way forward for transport planning.

DE Underwater Wireless Sensor Networks; Data gathering; Importance level of

ID LOCALIZATION; DESIGN
AB In Underwater Wireless Sensor Networks (UWSNs), if sensors rely on multi-hop transmission to send sensing data to the sink above the water, sensors that are closer to the water's surface will deplete energy sooner because they share a larger load of the packet relaying work. This problem becomes worse if the water being monitored is very deep. This imbalance in energy consumption can be effectively mitigated by using an Autonomous Underwater Vehicle (AUV) to collect data. However, if the data to collect are important, the delay time required by this data gathering method may be too long. In this study, we integrate the two data gathering mechanisms mentioned above, namely utilization of AUVs and multi-hop transmission, to reduce the problem of unbalanced energy consumption and long delay time. Moreover, we also investigate how to determine the importance level of data and set delay time requirements without domain knowledge. Our purpose is to deliver data of higher importance to the sink within the delay time requirement. Our experimental results confirm that the proposed method can effectively mitigate the imbalance in energy consumption, reduce the delay time required for delivering important data, and also prolong the network lifetime.

ID IDENTITY
AB Introduction The ability to make daily autonomous occupational choices has been identified as a human right and positively linked to wellbeing. Those marginalized from choice are considered at risk of occupational injustice. Disadvantaged young people are one group who may be marginalized from making such choices. Occupational choice is largely assumed to be an internal, individual process based on abilities and motivation, within environmental boundaries. From an external, contextual standpoint, this process has been scantly explored. This research, underpinned by an occupational justice perspective, sought understanding of disadvantaged young peoples' daily choices.
   Method Qualitative and participative methods were used. Nine young people, aged 11-14 participated in Photovoice and photo elicitation interviews. Data were analysed thematically.
   Findings Occupational choices are contextually informed and constrained, as illustrated by three themes: a limited perception of choices, choices informed by a need to stay connected to others and choices as a vehicle for social positioning.
   Conclusion Occupational choices do not appear to emanate from internal interests and abilities but rather from necessitated and mandated actions based on socio-cultural expectations. This suggests that occupational therapists must pay closer attention to the social context that informs choices to improve wellbeing of at-risk young people.

AB This brief studies distributed containment control for double-integrator dynamics in the presence of both stationary and dynamic leaders. In the case of stationary leaders, we propose a distributed containment control algorithm and study conditions on the network topology and the control gains to guarantee asymptotic containment control in any dimensional space. In the case of dynamic leaders, we study two cases: leaders with an identical velocity and leaders with nonidentical velocities. For the first case, we propose two distributed containment control algorithms to solve, respectively, asymptotic containment control under a switching directed network topology and finite-time containment control under a fixed directed network topology. In particular, asymptotic containment control can be achieved for any dimensional space if the network topology is fixed and for only the 1-D space if the network topology is switching. For the second case, we propose a distributed containment control algorithm under a fixed network topology where the communication patterns among the followers are undirected and derive conditions on the network topology and the control gains to guarantee asymptotic containment control for any dimensional space. Both simulation results and experimental results on a multi-robot platform are provided to validate some theoretical results.

AB In order to explore the law of major and extra serious traffic accidents on expressways in China, a total of 802 cases of major and extra serious traffic accidents on expressways in the past 10 years were collected, and statistical analysis was conducted from the aspects of time distribution, spatial distribution, accident form, and accident cause. The results show that in the past 10 years, the incidence and casualties of major and extra-serious traffic accidents on expressways have shown a fluctuating downward trend. In January, May, August, and November every year, between 6: 00 and 8: 00 every day is the highest incidence of accidents. The Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region, Heilongjiang Province, Fujian Province, and Anhui Province have more accidents. Vehicle collisions have the highest number of deaths, and rollover injuries have the highest rate. Human factors accounted for 72.1% of the causes of accidents, among which improper measures and speeding accounted for the largest proportion. Finally, according to the results of data statistical analysis, the corresponding control measures should be put forward in order to provide reference and technical support for the current highway traffic safety situation and safety management policy.

AB Bionic underwater robots have many advantages such as high mobility, high efficiency, high affinity, etc. They are especially suitable for tasks such as collecting hydrographic information and for detailed surveys of the marine environment. These tasks are based on their high-precision attitude control. Therefore, this paper proposes a control scheme for a bionic underwater robot-a manta robot. To improve the depth retention capability of the manta robot, a S-plane controller based on asymmetric output was designed in combination with the longitudinal motion characteristics of the manta robot. In addition, to achieve good motion control for the manta robot under conditions of large changes in the heading angle, the fuzzy controller and the heading transition target value function were combined to design the heading controller of the manta robot. Finally, the feasibility and reliability of the control system of the manta robot were verified by pool experiments. The experimental results showed that the depth control error was within +/- 5 cm and the heading control error was within +/- 5 degrees. The control scheme proposed in this paper achieves high-precision attitude control of the manta robot, providing a basis for the practical application of the manta robot.

AB Lane-change decision models with enhanced human-likeness are increasingly important as they are integral in traffic simulations for training autonomous driving algorithms. This work proposes a computational model of driver lane-change decision-making by integrating relevant human features in perception, reasoning, emotion, and decision (PRED). The PRED model describes how drivers make lane-change decisions under collision risk. Here risk is represented by probabilities and outcomes of the possible consequences. The PRED model formulates drivers' risk perception and risk propensity in its modules: the perception module is modeled with Bayesian inference; the reasoning module is modeled with Newtonian simulation; the emotion and decision module is modeled with the extended regret theory. The PRED model was fitted and tested with an empirical dataset from a naturalistic driving database. The prediction performance of the PRED model ranks higher than the selected benchmarks and is close to the state-of-the-art machine learning models. Moreover, the explicit modeling of risk propensity sheds light on an important question in transportation: what causes human drivers' risk-taking behaviors? The results support the rationale that downplaying crash consequences is the main contributor.

TI Predicting Pedestrian Crossing Intention With Feature Fusion and

SO IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON INTELLIGENT VEHICLES

DT Article
DE Pedestrian intention; autonomous driving; spatial-temporal fusion
AB Predicting vulnerable road user behavior is an essential prerequisite for deploying Automated Driving Systems (ADS) in the real-world. Pedestrian crossing intention should be recognized in real-time, especially for urban driving. Recent works have shown the potential of using vision-based deep neural network models for this task. However, these models are not robust and certain issues still need to be resolved. First, the global spatio-temporal context that accounts for the interaction between the target pedestrian and the scene has not been properly utilized. Second, the optimal strategy for fusing different sensor data has not been thoroughly investigated. This work addresses the above limitations by introducing a novel neural network architecture to fuse inherently different spatio-temporal features for pedestrian crossing intention prediction. We fuse different phenomena such as sequences of RGB imagery, semantic segmentation masks, and ego-vehicle speed in an optimal way using attention mechanisms and a stack of recurrent neural networks. The optimal architecture was obtained through exhaustive ablation and comparison studies. Extensive comparative experiments on the JAAD and PIE pedestrian action prediction benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method, where state-of-the-art performance was achieved. Our code is open-source and publicly available: https://github.com/OSU-Haolin/Pedestrian_Crossing_Intention_Prediction.

AB Adaptive navigation is the core of micro aerial vehicles (MAVs) conducting autonomous flights in diverse environments. Different navigation techniques are adopted according to the availability of navigation signals in the environment. MAVs must navigate using scene recognition technology to ensure the continuity and reliability of the flight. Therefore, our work investigated the scene recognition method for MAV environment-adaptive navigation. First, we exploited the functional intelligence-adaptive navigation (FIAN) scheme by imitating the physiological decision-making process. Then, based on sufficient environment-sensitive measurements from the environment perception subsystem in FIAN, the two-level scene recognition method (TSRM) in the decision-making subsystem consisting of two deep learning frameworks, SceneNet and Mobile Net-V2 was proposed to extract scene features for accurate diverse scenes recognition. Furthermore, the four-rotor MAV-Smartphone combined (MSC) platform simulating the owl's omni-directional head-turning behavior was built. The proposed TSRM was evaluated for accuracy, delay, and robustness compared with PSO-SVM and GIST-SVM. The results of practical flight tests through MSC platform show that TSRM has higher classification accuracy than PSO-SVM and GIST-SVM, and performs smoothly with self-regulatory adaptations under diverse environments.

AB The design process and complexity of existing safety controls are heavily determined by the geometrical properties of the environment, which affects the proof of convergence, design scalability, performance robustness, and numerical efficiency of the control. Hence, this brief proposes a variable structure control to isolate the environment's geometrical complexity from the control structure. A super-twisting algorithm (STA) is used to achieve accurate trajectory tracking and robust safety control. Safety control is designed solely based on distance measurement. First, a nominal safety model for obstacle avoidance is derived, where realistic system constraints are considered. The nominal model is well-suited for safety control design for obstacle avoidance and border patrol with analytically proven stability results. The safety control uses distance measurement to maintain a safe distance by compensating the robot's angular velocity. Also, a supervisory logic is constructed to unify the stability and safety features, and operational safety and precision tracking are proven under parametric uncertainty. The proposed design is modular with minimal tuning parameters, which reduces the computational burden of the algorithm and improves control scalability. The effectiveness of the proposed method is verified against various case studies.

AB Emerging technologies such as 5G communication systems, autonomous vehicles and satellite Internet have led to a renewed interest in 2D antennas that are capable of generating fixed/scannable pencil beams. Although traditional active phased arrays are technologically suitable for these applications, there are cases where other alternatives are more attractive, especially if they are simpler and less costly to design and fabricate. Recently, the concept of the Peripherally-Excited (PEX) antenna array has been proposed, promising a sizable reduction in the active-element count, especially when compared with traditional phased arrays. Albeit at the price of exhibiting some constraints on the possible beam-pointing directions. Here, we demonstrate the first practical implementation of the PEX antenna concept, and the proposed design is capable of generating single or multiple independently scannable pencil beams at broadside and tilted radiation directions, from a shared radiating aperture. The proposed structure is also easily scalable to higher millimeter-wave frequencies, and can be particularly useful in MIMO and duplex antenna applications, commonly encountered in automotive radars, among others.
   Two-dimensional antennas that can create and steer narrow beams are of interest for modern communication systems. Here, the authors demonstrate a scalable antenna array design that performs these functions with fewer elements than standard approaches and excited only with peripheral sources.

AB Visual simultaneous localization and mapping (vSLAM), one of the most important applications in autonomous vehicles and robots to estimate the position and pose using inexpensive visual sensors, suffers from error accumulation for long-term navigation without loop closure detection. Recently, deep neural networks (DNNs) are leveraged to achieve high accuracy for loop closure detection, however the execution time is much slower than those employing handcrafted visual features. In this paper, a parallel loop searching and verifying method for loop closure detection with both high accuracy and high speed, which combines two parallel tasks using handcrafted and DNN features, respectively, is proposed. A fast loop searching is proposed to link the bag-of-words features and histogram for higher accuracy, and it splits the images into multiple grids for high parallelism; meanwhile, a DNN feature extractor is utilized for further verification. A loop state control method based on a finite state machine to control these tasks is designed, wherein the loop closure detection is described as a context-related procedure. The framework is implemented on a real machine, and the top-2 best accuracy and fastest execution time of 80-543 frames per second (min: 1.84ms, and max: 12.45ms) are achieved on several public benchmarks compared with some existing algorithms.

AB Object instance segmentation in traffic scenes is an important research topic. For training instance segmentation models, synthetic data can potentially complement real data, alleviating manual effort on annotating real images. However, the data distribution discrepancy between synthetic data and real data hampers the wide applications of synthetic data. In light of that, we propose a virtual-real interaction method for object instance segmentation. This method works over synthetic images with accurate annotations and real images without any labels. The virtual-real interaction guides the model to learn useful information from synthetic data while keeping consistent with real data. We first analyze the data distribution discrepancy from a probabilistic perspective, and divide it into image-level and instance-level discrepancies. Then, we design two components to align these discrepancies, i.e., global-level alignment and local-level alignment. Furthermore, a consistency alignment component is proposed to encourage the consistency between the global-level and the local-level alignment components. We evaluate the proposed approach on the real Cityscapes dataset by adapting from virtual SYNTHIA, Virtual KITTI, and VIPER datasets. The experimental results demonstrate that it achieves significantly better performance than state-of-the-art methods.

AB Extracting meaningful information on objects varying scale and shape is a challenging task while obtaining distinctive features on small to large size objects to enhance overall object segmentation accuracy from 3D point cloud. To handle this challenge, we propose an attention-based multi-scale atrous convolutional neural network (AMSASeg) for object segmentation from 3D point cloud. Specifically, a backbone network consists of three modules: distinctive atrous spatial pyramid pooling (DASPP), FireModule, and FireDeconv. The DASPP utilizes average pooling operations and atrous convolutions with different sizes to aggregate distinctive information on objects at multiple scales. The FireModule and FireDeconv are responsible to efficiently extract general features. Meanwhile, a spatial attention module (SAM) and channel attention module (CAM) aggregate spatial and semantic information on smaller objects from low-level and high-level layers, respectively. Our network enables to encode multi-scale information and extract distinct feature on overall objects to enhance segmentation performance. We evaluate our method on KITTI dataset. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed network is effective to improve segmentation performance on small to large objects at real-time speed.

AB In underwater navigation systems, Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) information cannot be used for navigation. The mainstream method of autonomous underwater vehicles (AUV) underwater navigation system is Doppler Velocity Log (DVL) aided strapdown inertial navigation system (SINS). However, because the DVL is an instrument based on Doppler frequency shift to measure velocity, it is easily affected by the external environment. In a complex underwater environment, DVL output is easily polluted by outliers or even interrupted. In this paper, A new integrated navigation algorithm based on deep learning model is proposed to deal with DVL malfunctions. First, use RKF based on Mahalanobis distance algorithm to eliminate outliers, and then train the Nonlinear AutoRegressive with eXogenous input (NARX) model when DVL is available. When DVL is interrupted, use the NARX model to predict the output of DVL and continue integrated navigation. The proposed NARX-RKF scheme's effectiveness verification was performed on the data set collected by the SINS/DVL ship-mounted experimental system. For comparison, different methods are also compared in the experiment. Experimental results show that NARX-RKF can effectively predict the output of DVL and is significantly better than other methods.

AB In this study, we address an exploration problem when constructing complete 3D models in an unknown environment using a Micro-Aerial Vehicle. Most previous exploration methods were based on the Next-Best-View (NBV) approaches, which iteratively determine the most informative view, that exposes the greatest unknown area from the current partial model. However, these approaches sometimes miss minor unreconstructed regions like holes or sparse surfaces (while these can be important features). Furthermore, because the NBV methods iterate the next-best path from a current partial view, they sometimes produce unnecessarily long trajectories by revisiting known regions. To address these problems, we propose a novel exploration algorithm that integrates coverage and inspection strategies. The suggested algorithm first computes a global plan to cover unexplored regions to complete the target model sequentially. It then plans local inspection paths that comprehensively scans local frontiers. This approach reduces the total exploration time and improves the completeness of the reconstructed models. We evaluate the proposed algorithm in comparison with other state-of-the-art approaches through simulated and real-world experiments. The results show that our algorithm outperforms the other approaches and in particular improves the completeness of surface coverage.

ID MODEL-PREDICTIVE CONTROL; SYSTEMS
AB A new hierarchical model predictive controller (HMPC) for autonomous vehicle steering control is presented. The controller generates a path of shortest distance by determining lateral coordinates on a longitudinal grid, while respecting road bounds. This path is then parameterized by arc length before being optimized to restrict the normal acceleration values along the trajectory's arc length. The optimized trajectory is then tracked using a nonlinear MPC scheme using a bicycle plant model to calculate an optimal steering angle for the tires. The proposed controller is evaluated in simulation during a double-lane-change maneuver, where it generates and tracks a reference trajectory while observing the road boundaries and acceleration limits. Its performance is compared to a controller without path optimization, along with another that uses a smooth, predetermined, reference path instead of creating its own initial reference. It is shown that the proposed controller improves the tracking compared to a controller without path optimization, with a four-times reduction in average lateral tracking error. The average lateral acceleration is also reduced by 6%. The controller also maintains the tracking performance of a controller that uses a smooth reference path, while showing a much greater flexibility due to its ability to create its own initial reference path rather than having to follow a predetermined trajectory.

AB With the advances in sonar imaging technology, sonar imagery has increasingly been used for oceanographic studies in civilian and military applications. High-resolution imaging sonars can be mounted on various survey platforms, typically autonomous underwater vehicles, which provide enhanced speed and improved data quality with long-range support. This paper addresses the automatic detection of mine-like objects using sonar images. The proposed Gabor-based detector is designed as a feature pyramid network with a small number of trainable weights. Our approach combines both semantically weak and strong features to handle mine-like objects at multiple scales effectively. For feature extraction, we introduce a parameterized Gabor layer which improves the generalization capability and computational efficiency. The steerable Gabor filtering modules are embedded within the cascaded layers to enhance the scale and orientation decomposition of images. The entire deep Gabor neural network is trained in an end-to-end manner from input sonar images with annotated mine-like objects. An extensive experimental evaluation on a real sonar dataset shows that the proposed method achieves competitive performance compared to the existing approaches.

AB We show that rotating particles at the liquid-gas interface can be efficiently manipulated using the surface-wave analogue of optical lattices. Two orthogonal standing waves generate surface flows of counter-rotating half-wavelength unit cells, the liquid interface metamaterial, whose geometry is controlled by the wave phase shift. Here we demonstrate that by placing active magnetic spinners inside such metamaterials, one makes a powerful tool which allows manipulation and self-assembly of spinners, turning them into vehicles capable of transporting matter and information between autonomous metamaterial unit cells. We discuss forces acting on a spinner carried by a nonuniform flow and show how the forces confine spinners to orbit inside the same-sign vortex cells of the wave-driven flow. Reversing the spin, we move the spinner into an adjacent cell. By changing the spinning frequency or the wave amplitude, one can precisely control the spinner orbit. Multiple spinners within a unit cell self-organize into stable patterns, e.g., triangles or squares, orbiting around the center of the cell. Spinners having different frequencies can also be confined, such that the higher-frequency spinner occupies the inner orbit and the lower-frequency one circles on the outer orbit, while the orbital motions of both spinners are synchronized.

AB We discuss and compare numerical methods to solve singular optimal control problems by the direct method. Our discussion is illustrated by an Autonomous Underwater Vehicle (AUV) problem with state constraints. For this problem, we test four different approaches to solve numerically our problem via the direct method. After discretizing the optimal control problem we solve the resulting optimization problem with (i) A Mathematical Programming Language (AMPL), (ii) the Imperial College London Optimal Control Software (ICLOCS), (iii) the Gauss Pseudospectral Optimization Software (GPOPS) as well as with (iv) a new algorithm based on mixed-binary non-linear programming reported in [7]. This algorithm consists on converting the optimal control problem to a Mixed Binary Optimal Control (MBOC) problem which is then transcribed to a mixed binary non-linear programming problem (MBNLP) problem using Legendre-Radau pseudospectral method. Our case study shows that, in contrast with the first three approaches we test (all relying on IPOPT or other numerical optimization software packages like KNITRO), the MBOC approach detects the structure of the AUV's problem without a priori information of optimal control and computes the switching times accurately.

AB We study a new multiple-lift compact automated parking system, which is a new technology with a circular structure using carousel equipped with the shuttles for the horizontal movement and multiple lifts equipped with the platforms for the vertical movement. This paper investigates dedicated and random shuttles operating policies. We divided the carousel into areas based on the number of lifts. We propose a dedicated shuttle operating policy under which each area shuttles can only serve one dedicated lift. A random shuttle operating policy under which shuttles can serve any lift. We get expected throughput time models for the two shuttle operating policies under the same system physical configurations based on queuing network models. We compare the analytical models with simulation models, and the results show that the proposed models provide accurate estimates. A numerical experiment is conducted to illustrate the trade-offs between dedicated shuttle and random shuttle operating policies. The results show that the retrieval time in random shuttle operating policy is larger than the retrieval time in dedicated shuttle operating policy. We also get the optimal system structure, including the number of the lifts.

ID CONNECTIVITY RESTORATION
AB Flying ad hoc network (FANET) is a communication network for data transmission among Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs). In ad hoc network, the UAVs movement is usually applied to improve network fault-tolerance, but it easily causes the disconnection of communication links, and the success rate is low. In this paper, we propose a local fault-tolerant control algorithm based on node movement freedom degree (LFTMF). Under the constraint of node movement freedom degree, the algorithm transforms the single-connected network into bi-connected network through the autonomous movement of UAVs to improve the fault-tolerant ability of the FANET network. Firstly, the consistency between k-hop cut-points and global cut-points in FANET network is analyzed. Then, based on the k-hop local topology of FANET network, the UAV node movement freedom degree model is established. Finally, according to the location distribution of k-hop cut-points in the FANET network, the bi-connected fault-tolerant network is realized by UAVs cascade movement. Compared with the existing algorithms, simulation results show that the proposed algorithm achieves better performance in success rate, deviation distance, cascade movement ratio and adjustment period.

DE Fuzzy logic; ground effect; quadcopter; safe landing; target detection
AB Target detection is crucial for many applications of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) such as search and rescue, object transportation, object detection, inspection, and mapping. One of the considerable applications of target detection is the safe landing of UAV to the drone station for battery charging and its maintenance. For this, vision-based target detection methods are utilized. Generally, high-cost cameras and expensive CPU's were used for target detection. With the recent development of Raspberry Pi (RPi), it is possible to use the embedded system with cheap price for such applications. In the current research, RPi based drone target detection and safe landing system are proposed with the integration of PID controller for target detection, and Fuzzy Logic controller for safe landing. The proposed system is equipped with a USB camera which is connected to RPi for detecting the target and a laser rangefinder (LIDAR) for measuring the distance for safe landing. To verify the performance of the developed system, a practical test bench based on a quadcopter and a target drone station is developed. Several experiments were conducted under different scenarios. The result shows that the proposed system works well for the target finding and safe landing of the quadcopter.

AB With the widespread use of GPS-enabled mobile devices, an unprecedented amount of trajectory data has become available from various sources such as Bikely, GPS-wayPoints, and Uber. The rise of smart transportation services and recent break-throughs in autonomous vehicles increase our reliance on trajectory data in a wide variety of applications. Supporting these services in emerging platforms requires more efficient query processing in trajectory databases. In this paper, we propose two new coverage queries for trajectory databases: (i) k Best Facility Trajectory Search (kBFT); and (ii) k Best Coverage Facility Trajectory Search (k BCovFT). We propose a novel index structure, the Trajectory Quadtree (TQ-tree) that utilizes a quadtree to hierarchically organize trajectories into different nodes, and then applies a z-ordering to further organize the trajectories by spatial locality inside each node. This structure is highly effective in pruning the trajectory search space, which is of independent interest. By exploiting the TQ-tree, we develop a divide-and-conquer approach to efficiently process a kBFT query. To solve the k BCovFT, which is a non-submodular NP-hard problem, we propose a greedy approximation. We evaluate our algorithms through an extensive experimental study on several real datasets, and demonstrate that our algorithms outperform baselines by two to three orders of magnitude.

AB Recent advancements in automotive technologies, most notably autonomous driving, demand electronic systems much more complex than those realized in the past. The automotive industry has been forced to adopt advanced consumer electronics to satisfy the demand, and thus it becomes more challenging to assess system reliability while adopting the new technologies. The system-level reliability can be enforced by implementing a process called condition monitoring. In this paper, a piezoresistive silicon-based stress sensor is implemented to recognize in situ failure in outer molded electronic control units subjected to reliability testing conditions. The test vehicle consists of six double decawatt package power packages and three stress sensors mounted on a printed circuit board. A unique algorithm is proposed and implemented to handle the data obtained from the piezoresistive stress-sensing cells. The accuracy of measured data is examined by finite-element method, and the physical changes are validated with scanning acoustic microscope. One-class support vector machines are used to autonomously classify data based on a training set of measurements from healthy state, and the reported results confirm that robust classification is possible based on data from the silicon stress sensor.

AB Monocular optical flow has been widely used to detect obstacles in Micro Air Vehicles (MAVs) during visual navigation. However, this approach requires significant movement, which reduces the efficiency of navigation and may even introduce risks in narrow spaces. In this paper, we introduce a novel setup of self-supervised learning (SSL), in which optical flow cues serve as a scaffold to learn the visual appearance of obstacles in the environment. We apply it to a landing task, in which initially 'surface roughness' is estimated from the optical flow field in order to detect obstacles. Subsequently, a linear regression function is learned that maps appearance features represented by texton distributions to the roughness estimate. After learning, the MAV can detect obstacles by just analyzing a still image. This allows the MAV to search for a landing spot without moving. We first demonstrate this principle to work with offline tests involving images captured from an on-board camera and then demonstrate the principle in flight. Although surface roughness is a property of the entire flow field in the global image, the appearance learning even allows for the pixel-wise segmentation of obstacles. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

AB We consider a class of multibody robotic systems inspired by dynamics of animal locomotion, such as swimming and crawling. Distinctive properties of such systems are that the stiffness matrix is asymmetric due to skewed restoring force from the environment, and the damping matrix is a scalar multiple of the inertia matrix when the body is flat like those of fish. Extending the standard notion to this class, we define the natural oscillation as a free response under the damping compensation to yield marginal stability. The natural oscillation of the body provides a basic gait for locomotion. We propose a class of simple nonlinear feedback controllers to achieve entrainment to the natural oscillation of the body, resulting in a prescribed average velocity. As an example, a link chain system with symmetric mechanical structure is considered, and its natural oscillation is shown to exhibit traveling waves appropriate for undulatory locomotion. Controllers are designed under various conditions to achieve prescribed locomotion speeds by natural oscillations. In particular, it is shown how design parameters can be chosen to increase the rate of convergence, and how the locomotion speed can be set by adjusting the natural frequency through body stiffness compensation.

AB Cellular automata (CAs), model the dynamics of complex systems as the state update of cells restricted from their own neighbors. This paper regards the tempo-spatial constraints as dummy neighborhoods of cells for train movement, such as scheduled movement authority and speed restriction, equivalent to the maximum displacements during the future certain time steps and each time step, respectively. Under the framework of CA modeling, this paper attempts to propose an improved CA model for moving-block railway network which incorporates the tempo-spatial constraints to capture the restrictive, synergistic and autonomous dynamics. We divide the one-dimensional cell lattice into several segments, called instantaneous movement authority, with individual speed restriction and target speed. The physical law controlling train movement is gradually implemented on the segmented lattice. The simulation based on the proposed CA model can reconstruct the phenomenon observed in realistic train movement, such as go-and-stop wave, its back propagation to the upstream, tracking and feedback adjustment. The applicability and rationality of the proposed model has been elucidated through various simulation tests. The model of train movement based on CAs can facilitate finding out the plans to improve the performance of railway network.

DE GPS accuracy; standards; vehicle guidance
AB The popularity of GPS-based guidance systems for agriculture is increasing. However no dynamic test standards are available to evaluate these receivers. In April 2002, GPS receivers were dynamically tested on a 0.8 km length of railroad track using a small rail cart. The track was surveyed with an RTK GPS receiver and referenced to a NGS benchmark. The GPS receivers were evaluated over a 24 h period. The tests were conducted in both directions and at two different speeds. Cross-track and pass-to-pass errors were determined for a John Deere StarFire receiver with dual-frequency correction and a Trimble AgGPS 132 in autonomous mode. Cross-track errors were sequentially correlated, creating problems for using typical statistical analysis methods. A Voronoi step interpolation method was used to generate evenly spaced data for Fourier analysis. Fourier analysis indicated that the cross-track errors contained significant periodic structure below 6 cycles per day. This implies that cross-track accuracy tests should be conducted for minimum durations of 12 h. Fourier analysis indicated that pass-to-pass errors were more random than cross-track errors, with no clear concentrations of frequency content, implying that pass-to-pass accuracy tests can yield meaningful results in less time than required for cross-track accuracy testing.

AB Model-based robot controllers require customized control-oriented models, involving expert knowledge and trial and error. Remarkably, the Koopman operator enables the control-oriented model identification through the input-output mapping set, breaking through the barriers of the customization services. However, in recent years, research on Koopman-based robot control has mostly focused on lifting function construction, deviating from the original intention of improving the controller performance. Thus, we propose a robot controller autogeneration framework using the Bayesian-based Koopman operator, significantly releasing labor and eliminating the design obstacle. First, we introduce the Koopman-based system identification method and offer the basic lifting function design criteria. Then, a Bayesian-based optimization strategy with resource allocation is designed, which allows for the simultaneous optimization of the lifting function and the controller. Next, taking model-predictive control (MPC) as an example, a mission-oriented controller autogeneration framework is developed. Simulation and experimental results indicate that, under various robots and data sources, the proposed framework can effectively generate the robot controllers and perform with a far greater level of mission accuracy than the unoptimized Koopman-based MPC. Meanwhile, the proposed technique exhibits an obvious compensation effect against disturbances, demonstrating its practicability in robot control.

AB Autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) mapping of the western Rio Grande Rise (RGR), South Atlantic, and subsequent exploration and photography of horizontal lava flows exposed in near vertical, faulted escarpments, showed occurrences of red clays/weathered volcanic tops trapped between successive alkaline lava flows. These red clays indicate a hiatus in successive volcanic eruptions. Here, we report detailed mineralogical, geochemical, and rock magnetic characteristics of one such distinct red clay dredged from similar to 650 m water depth in the western RGR. The mineral constituents of the red clay are kaolinite, magnetite, oxidized magnetite (/maghemite), hematite, and goethite, with biogenic calcite and halite occupying voids or precipitated on the surface of the red clay. The chemical index of alteration (CIA) has a value of 93, showing that red clay is a product of extreme chemical weathering of the lava flows. The alkaline volcanic rocks recovered from nearby show an age of similar to 44 Ma, indicating an Eocene age for the volcanism. We show that the red clays are a product of sub-aerial chemical weathering of these Eocene volcanic rocks, in a warm-wet climate, before the thermal subsidence of the RGR to its modern-day bathymetric depth.

ID TIME-VARYING FLOWS; PATH
AB This letter presents an uncertainty-aware motion planner for an autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) which navigates in a cluttered scenario under an uncertain flow field. Safe and efficient navigation in such environments requires a precise motion model of an AUV. However, the motion of an AUV is difficult to he accurately predicted due to its nonlinear dynamics significantly affected by its surrounding fluids. To resolve this difficulty, we propose to use a Bayes Adaptive Markov Decision Process (BA-MDP) for robust decision making, which is able to hedge against errors in the AUV's motion model through online learning. To construct the BA-MDP accurately, a Clustering Guided Explorative Tree (CGETree) is proposed to explore all the possible connectivities within the AUV's state space in an offline manner. The CGETree's nodes are clustered together to provide a discretization of the state space, and the tree edges, after being combined with a discrete noise model, provide a physics-based-prior for the transition model, which will he updated online along with the robot's movement. The simulation results demonstrate that our proposed method achieves good performance in a seabed environment with a flow field whose uncertainty may not he known beforehand.

ID TIME-REVERSAL; PERFORMANCE; SCATTERING; WAVES
AB The development of pre-deployed underwater infrastructures to aid in autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) navigation is of keen interest, with the increased use of AUVs for undersea operations. Previous literature has introduced a class of passive underwater acoustic markers, termed acoustic identification (AID) tags [Satish, Trivett, and Sabra, J. Acoust. Soc. Am. 147(6), EL517-EL522 (2020)], which are inexpensive to construct, simple to deploy, and reflect unique engineered acoustic signatures that can be detected by an AUV instrumented with high-frequency sonar systems. An AID tag is built of multi-layer shells with different acoustic properties and thicknesses to generate a unique acoustic signature, composed of the multiple reflections created by the layer interfaces, thus akin to an "acoustic barcode." AID tags can be used as geospatial markers to highlight checkpoints in AUV trajectories or mark areas of interest underwater. This article investigates the optimization of the AID tag's design using energy based metrics and evaluates the detectability of an AID tag in the presence of interfering signals, such as clutter using matched-filter based techniques. Furthermore, experimental results of AID tags interrogated by a standard high-frequency sonar are presented to provide proof of concept of AID tag detection in a reverberant water tank.

AB Oil spills due to accidental leakage from Container Ships in a Marine environment poses a major challenge to aquatic living organisms and affects human health by increasing the environmental pollution. Autonomous Underwater Vehicles (AUV's) are deployed for detection and cleaning of oil spills. As the coastal areas are vast and lengthy, effective path planning of deployed AUVs is necessary. Many path planning algorithms for AUVs have been proposed in literature using approaches which necessitate search through large distance. The AUVs have to travel through a large distance to detect the spills in the search area resulting in more energy consumption. In this article we propose an efficient approach for determination of optimal AUV paths for detection of oil spills resulting in reduced search distance for a given area. The proposed approach implements a hybrid evolutionary optimization algorithm named Whale Cuckoo Search Optimization Algorithm (WCSOA) that results in increase in the search space, global search ability and the convergence speed. With the proposed approach the overall search delay and energy consumption of AUVs are reduced. It is observed from the simulation results obtained that the proposed approach provides reduction in AUV energy consumption by 57% compared to the existing Boustrophedon and WOA approach.

AB An adaptive target tracking method based on extended Kalman filter (TT-EKF) is proposed to simultaneously estimate the state of an Autonomous Underwater Vehicle (AUV) and an mobile recovery system (MRS) with unknown non-Gaussian process noise in homing process. In the application scenario of this article, the process noise includes the measurement noise of AUV heading and forward speed and the estimation error of MRS heading and forward speed. The accuracy of process noise covariance matrix (PNCM) can affect the state estimation performance of the TT-EKF. The variational Bayesian based algorithm is applied to estimate the process noise statistics. We use a Gaussian mixture distribution to model the non-Gaussian noisy forward speed of AUV and MRS. We use a von-Mises distribution to model the noisy heading of AUV and MRS. The variational Bayesian algorithm is applied to estimate the parameters of these distributions, and then the PNCM can be calculated. The prediction error of TT-EKF is online compensated by using a multilayer neural network, and the neural network is online trained during the target tracking process.

AB Purpose - This paper aims to conduct a comprehensive fault tree analysis (FTA) on the critical components of industrial robots. This analysis is integrated with the reliability block diagram (RBD) approach to investigate the robot system reliability.
   Design/methodology/approach - For practical implementation, a particular autonomous guided vehicle (AGV) system was first modeled. Then, FTA was adopted to model the causes of failures, enabling the probability of success to be determined. In addition, RBD was used to simplify the complex system of the AGV for reliability evaluation purpose.
   Findings - Hazard decision tree (HDT) was configured to compute the hazards of each component and the whole AGV robot system. Through this research, a promising technical approach was established, allowing decision-makers to identify the critical components of AGVs along with their crucial hazard phases at the design stage.
   Originality/value - As complex systems have become global and essential in today's society, their reliable design and determination of their availability have turned into very important tasks for managers and engineers. Industrial robots are examples of these complex systems that are being increasingly used for intelligent transportation, production and distribution of materials in warehouses and automated production lines.

AB Most of the robotic systems are designed to move and perform tasks in a variety of environments. Some of these environments are controllable and well-defined, and the tasks to be performed are generally everyday ones. However, exploration missions also enclose hard constraints such as driving vehicles to many locations in a surface of several kilometres to collect and/or analyse interesting samples. Therefore, a critical aspect for the mission is to optimally (or sub-optimally) plan the path that a robot should follow while performing scientific tasks. In this paper, we present UP2TA, a new AI planner that interleaves path planning and task-planning for mobile robotics applications. The planner is the result of integrating a modified PDDL planner with a path-planning algorithm, combining domain-independent heuristics and a domain-specific heuristic for path-planning. Then, UP2TA can exploit capabilities of both planners to generate shorter paths while performing scientific tasks in an efficient ordered way. The planner has been tested in two domains: an exploration mission consisting of pictures acquisition, and a more challenging one that includes samples delivering. Also, UP2TA has been integrated and tested in a real robotic platform for both domains. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Multisensor navigation data synthesis (MNDS) is the process of fusing outputs from inertial sensors with information from other sensors and information processing blocks into one representational form. This technique is anticipated to accomplish enhanced accuracy and more specific inferences than could be achieved by the use of a single sensor alone. Therefore, this research work expounds innovative filtering methodology for the multisensor navigation data synthesis for a ballistic missile application that augments navigation system performance. The premise and characteristics of strapdown inertial navigation system (SINS) integrated with the astronavigation system (ANS) based on the unscented particle filter (UPF) are investigated in this paper. Configuration of the integrated navigation system is presented with its canonical model, and system dynamic and stochastic models required for the filtering algorithm are presented. To exemplify integrated navigation filter mechanization is the foremost aspiration of this research. To validate and corroborate the designed MNDS technique, simulations are carried out that demonstrate the validity of this method on enhancing the navigation system's accuracy with estimation and compensation for the gyro's drift. This integrated system results ill a significant reduction in impact-point dispersion of a re-entry vehicle. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The paper focuses on the problem of partitioning and mapping parallel programs onto heterogeneous embedded multiprocessor architectures for real-time applications. Such applications present unique constraints and challenges. In addition to heterogeneity, the proposed partitioning and mapping algorithms satisfy memory, task throughput, task placement, intertask communication bandwidth, and co-location constraints. They do so for architectures that utilize circuit-switched (rather than packet-switched) interprocessor communication and optimize latency and throughput in addition to load-balancing. Finally, these mapping algorithms make use of knowledge of the local scheduling discipline to accommodate real-time scheduling constraints. Our focus is on unstructured parallel programs that fall into one of two classes: (i) the class of computations characteristic of control applications in a real-time environment where tasks execute concurrently, periodically exchanging information, and (ii) pipelined computation graphs found in sensor data processing applications. The algorithms are implemented in a set of tools that operate with commercial CASE tools at one end, and present an interface to multiprocessor simulators at the other end. Collectively, the algorithms form a significant component of an interactive design environment for the development and mapping of real-time embedded parallel programs. The paper describes the algorithms, the encapsulating toolset, and presents an example of their application to an existing embedded application-an Autonomous Underwater Vehicle application.

AB Aiming at the autonomous decision-making problem in an Unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) pursuit-evasion game, this paper proposes a hierarchical maneuver decision method based on the PG-option. Firstly, considering various situations of the relationship of both sides comprehensively, this paper designs four maneuver decision options: advantage game, quick escape, situation change and quick pursuit, and the four options are trained by Soft Actor-Critic (SAC) to obtain the corresponding meta-policy. In addition, to avoid high dimensions in the state space in the hierarchical model, this paper combines the policy gradient (PG) algorithm with the traditional hierarchical reinforcement learning algorithm based on the option. The PG algorithm is used to train the policy selector as the top-level strategy. Finally, to solve the problem of frequent switching of meta-policies, this paper sets the delay selection of the policy selector and introduces the expert experience to design the termination function of the meta-policies, which improves the flexibility of switching policies. Simulation experiments show that the PG-option algorithm has a good effect on UAV pursuit-evasion game and adapts to various environments by switching corresponding meta-policies according to current situation.

AB The horseshoe vortex generated in the attached part of a submarine could aggravate the vibration and noise of the submarine. The control mechanism of a vortex control baffle for the horseshoe vortex around the sail of a DARPA SUBOFF model is explored by the large eddy simulation (LES) model in this work. The variations of the distributions for streamwise vorticity, Q criterion and pressures are analyzed deeply. It is found that the arrangement of the vortex control baffle can interfere with the development process of horseshoe vortex. Due to the presence of the baffle, a strong reverse pressure gradient around the baffle would take place. Then a series of vortices are generated to weaken the intensity of the horseshoe vortex in the process of propagation and achieve the purpose of controlling the horseshoe vortex. The development characteristics of these vortices are discussed in detail. It is noted that the new induced vortex and the horseshoe vortex have opposite propagation direction, which would lead to the gradually decreasing intensity of the horseshoe vortex in the development process.

AB To prepare gas bubble plumes as proxies for oil in autonomous underwater vehicle field experiments, experiments were conducted to compare three microbubble generators, including a dissolved air flotation system, a microbubble diffuser, and a Nikuni Karyu Turbo Mixer (KTM) pump, based on sizes of bubbles and their practicability to be used in field experiments. The sizes of bubbles were measured with a Laser in-situ Scattering and Transmissometry sensor. A Ping360 sonar with a frequency of 750 kHz was tested to assess its ability to capture the generated bubbles. Among the three systems, the KTM pump generated the most stable bubbles with average diameters smaller than 100 mu m. Detailed experiments were carried out in a towing tank to further test the size distribution of bubbles generated by the KTM pump. Smaller bubbles were found to remain at higher concentrations at the depth of bubble release, as larger bubbles having higher rise velocities surfaced quickly without staying in the water column. The bubble sizes were cross-validated with the measured residence time of bubbles. The bubble generating system based on the KTM pump is planned to be applied in future field experiments.

ID TRAVELING SALESMAN PROBLEM
AB An autonomous search for sources of gamma radiation in an outdoor environment is a domain suitable for the deployment of a heterogeneous robotic team, consisting of an Unmanned Aerial (UAV) and an Unmanned Ground (UGV) Vehicle. The UAV is convenient for fast mapping of the area and identifying regions of interest, whereas the UGV can perform highly accurate localization. It is assumed that the regions of interest are identified by the UAV during an initial reconnaissance, while performing a simple motion pattern. This paper proposes a path planning algorithm for the UGV, which guarantees accurate source localization in multiple preselected regions and minimizes the total path length. The problem is formulated as the Generalized Travelling Salesman Problem (GTSP) defined for discrete sets of suitable maneuvers (circular arcs), ensuring source localization in the given regions. The problem is successfully solved by a modified version of the state of the art GTSP solver, Generalized Large Neighborhood Search with Arcs (GLNS(arc)). Apart from adapting the GLNS, other aspects of the planning task are addressed: problem discretization and informed sampling of valid circular arcs, variants of weighting the nonrestricted trajectory segments between the arcs and postprocessing of the discretely planned trajectory in the continuous domain.

ID LEVEL
AB This paper mainly focuses on using deep reinforcement learning (RL) to deal with the cooperative decision-making problem of multiple Autonomous Underwater Vehicles (multi-AUVs) under limited perception and limited communication in attack-defense confrontation missions. Firstly, a novel Coding-Convolutional Net -work (CCN) is proposed, which can encode the raw sensor information of AUVs and extract representative features from limited perception. Secondly, utilizing the approximator of the state value function and policy function composed of CCN and fully connected network, we put forward a centralized decision-making architecture for multi-AUVs system based on actor-critic framework and give the corresponding algorithm combined with asynchronous training. Moreover, with respect to multi-AUVs attack-defense confrontation tasks, we develop a simulation platform to train and evaluate the proposed algorithms under different parameters. It can be directly observed from the visualization of the simulation that the algorithm enables multi-AUVs to complete the attack-defense confrontation missions excellently and generate some interesting collaborative behaviors. The average winning probability data of the simulation results also indicate that the designed method is feasible for multi-AUVs to achieve cooperative decision-making in attack-defense confrontation missions.

ID ARCHITECTURE; RADIO; SCHEME; TIME
AB Due to the constantly changing sea surface, there is a high risk of link fragility caused by sea waves when different marine users are intended to establish stable links for communication. To ensure stability with less delay, finding a stable route is one of the crucial aspects of maritime networks. In order to achieve this aim, we propose a routing protocol for cognitive maritime networks based on software-defined networking (SDN). This SDN-based cognitive routing protocol provides stable routes among different marine users. To provide the global view of the whole network, a main controller is placed close to the seashore, whereas the localized views are provided by the cluster heads. Autonomous surface vehicles are used as gateways under sparse network conditions to collect and transport data among clusters, and to and from the main controller. This is an SDN-based ship-to-ship communication scheme where two ships can only establish a link when they not only have consensus about a common idle channel but are also within the communication range of each other. We perform extensive simulations to test the proposed scheme with different parameters and find better performance in comparison with both SDN-based and non-SDN-based schemes in terms of end-to-end delay, packet delivery ratio, and routing overhead ratio.

AB Shuttle-based storage and retrieval systems (SBS/RSs), which are designed to increase throughput capacity and flexibility, are a type of automated storage and retrieval system used for lightweight loads. SBS/RSs can increase throughput capacity by using multiple shuttles and elevators as storage and retrieval machines (SRMs). They can also facilitate improvements in flexibility since they are able to adjust the number of SRMs according to transaction demands. Thus, determining the number of shuttles is an important issue in tier-to-tier SBS/RSs. In this paper, a decision model to determine the number of shuttles is proposed. The model is based on the travel time model, and it considers parameters such as the physical configuration, velocity profile and the probability that the shuttle operates a dual command. Finally, the throughput capacity from the travel time model is compared with that from a simulation-based approach in order to verify the effects of the model. In addition, a critical discussion regarding the characteristics of the tier-to-tier system is provided.

ID VEHICLE-ROUTING PROBLEM; APPROXIMATIONS
AB We consider the problem where a team of mobile robots is tasked with collecting information about a set of stationary targets. There is a temporal deadline to complete the task, and the objective is to determine a control policy maximizing the probability of successfully completing the task within the assigned deadline. In addition, robots use imprecise sensors, and are subject to noisy dynamics. Furthermore, there are more targets than robots, so load sharing between robots is necessary. We model this problem using the theory of constrained Markov decision processes and split the solution into two steps. First, policies to observe small subsets of targets are computed, and the proposed model and algorithm allow one to extract accurate information characterizing the performance of the computed control policies. In the second stage, a subset of the computed policies is assigned to the robots for execution with the objective of maximizing a collective team performance function. To this end, we introduce a submodular objective function and a greedy approximation algorithm to solve this nonlinear assignment problem. Simulations demonstrate how these models can be used in practice to appropriately tune the parameters characterizing this problem and show how the approach favorably scales with the complexity of the problem.

AB This paper investigates the task assignment and path planning problem for multiple AUVs in three dimensional (3D) underwater wireless sensor networks where nonholonomic motion constraints of underwater AUVs in 3D space are considered. The multi-target task assignment and path planning problem is modeled by the Multiple Traveling Sales Person (MTSP) problem and the Genetic Algorithm (GA) is used to solve the MTSP problem with Euclidean distance as the cost function and the Tour Hop Balance (THB) or Tour Length Balance (TLB) constraints as the stop criterion. The resulting tour sequences are mapped to 2D Dubins curves in the X - Y plane, and then interpolated linearly to obtain the Z coordinates. We demonstrate that the linear interpolation fails to achieve G(1) continuity in the 3D Dubins path for multiple targets. Therefore, the interpolated 3D Dubins curves are checked against the AUV dynamics constraint and the ones satisfying the constraint are accepted to finalize the 3D Dubins curve selection. Simulation results demonstrate that the integration of the 3D Dubins curve with the MTSP model is successful and effective for solving the 3D target assignment and path planning problem.

AB This paper presents an original technique for robust detection of line features from range data, which is also the core element of an algorithm conceived for mapping 2D environments. A new approach is also discussed to improve the accuracy of position and attitude estimates of the localization by feeding back angular information extracted from the detected edges in the updating map. The innovative aspects of the line detection algorithm regard the proposed hierarchical clusterization method for segmentation. Instead, line fitting is carried out by exploiting the Principal Component Analysis, unlike traditional techniques relying on least squares linear regression. Numerical simulations are purposely conceived to compare these approaches for line fitting. Results demonstrate the applicability of the proposed technique as it provides comparable performance in terms of computational load and accuracy compared to the least squares method. Also, performance of the overall line detection architecture, as well as of the solutions proposed for line-based mapping and localization-aiding, is evaluated exploiting real range data acquired in indoor environments using an UTM-30LX-EW 2D LIDAR. This paper lies in the framework of autonomous navigation of unmanned vehicles moving in complex 2D areas, for example, being unexplored, full of obstacles, GPS-challenging, or denied.

AB The systematic environmental monitoring of the land, atmosphere, oceans and their coupling zones, is assisted by the use of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) that can operate over rural and/or urban areas to provide enhanced spatial and temporal measurement resolutions compared against corresponding satellite products. The international UAV market includes a vast number of solutions that carry sensors for environmental monitoring varying in type, flight time, carrying weight, communication, and autonomous flight. The majority of these commercial UAVs (especially the low-cost ones) have been designed for specific applications and their main disadvantage is that they can only integrate the payload they have been initially designed to carry, thus presenting minimal modularity. This work presents a modular and affordable platform where the user can easily adapt almost any type of environmental monitoring sensor, which can transmit its measurements to the UAV flight controller without the need for any additional modification. A novel communication protocol has been developed that is also capable to incorporate proximity sensors for collision avoidance. In addition, a wireless mobile telecommunications module incorporation through the use of mobile devices on the UAV provides real-time animated map generation along with cooperative capabilities for fleet missions.

AB In all situations in which a wide area has to be monitored, a practice emerging in recent years consists in using Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs), and in particular multirotors. Even if many steps forward have been taken toward the fully autonomous control of UAVs, a human pilot is usually in charge of controlling the robots. However, teleoperating UAVs can become a hard task whenever it is necessary to deploy a swarm of robots instead of a single unit, to the end of increasing the area under observation. In this case, the organization of robots in a structured formation may reduce the effort of the operator to control the swarm.
   When controlling a team of robots, the typology of visual feedback is crucial. It is known that, while overall awareness and pattern recognition are optimized by exocentric views, i.e., with cameras from above the swarm, the immediate environment is often better viewed egocentrically, i.e., with cameras on board the robots.
   In this article we present the implementation of a human robot interface for the control of a swarm of UAVs, with a focus on the analysis of the effects of different visual feedbacks on the performance of human operators. (C) 2016 Elsevier E.V. All rights reserved.

ID FEEDBACK
AB A hierarchical approach for motion planning and control of nonlinear systems operating in obstacle environments is presented. To reduce the computation time during the motion planning process, dynamically feasible trajectories are generated in real-time through concatenation of pre-specified motion primitives. The motion planning task is posed as a search over a directed graph, and the applicability of informed graph search techniques is investigated. Specifically, we develop a locally greedy algorithm with effective backtracking ability and compare this algorithm to weighted A* search. The greedy algorithm shows an advantage with respect to solution cost and computation time when larger motion primitive libraries that do not operate on a regular state lattice are utilized. Linearization of the nonlinear system equations about the motion primitive library results in a hybrid linear time-varying model, and an optimal control algorithm using the l(2)-induced norm as the performance measure is provided to ensure that the system tracks the desired trajectory. The ability of the resulting controller to closely track the trajectory obtained from the motion planner, despite various disturbances and uncertainties, is demonstrated through simulation.

AB The demand for autonomous exploration and mapping of underground environments has significantly increased in recent years. However, accurately localizing and mapping robots in subterranean settings presents notable challenges. This paper presents a tightly coupled LiDAR-Inertial odometry system that combines the NanoGICP point cloud registration method with IMU pre-integration using incremental smoothing and mapping. Specifically, a point cloud affected by dust particles is first filtered out and separated into ground and non-ground point clouds (for ground vehicles). To maintain accuracy in environments with spatial variations, an adaptive voxel filter is employed, which reduces computation time while preserving accuracy. The estimated motion derived from IMU pre-integration is utilized to correct point cloud distortion and provide an initial estimation for LiDAR odometry. Subsequently, a scan-to-map point cloud registration is executed using NanoGICP to obtain a more refined pose estimation. The resulting LiDAR odometry is then employed to estimate the bias of the IMU. We comprehensively evaluated our system on established subterranean datasets. These datasets were collected by two separate teams using different platforms during the DARPA Subterranean (SubT) Challenge. The experimental results demonstrate that our system achieved performance enhancements as high as 50-60% in terms of root mean square error (RMSE).

AB Flying insects exhibit outperforming stability and control via continuous wing flapping even under severe disturbances in various conditions of wind gust and turbulence. While conventional linear proportional derivative (PD)-based controllers are widely employed in insect-inspired flight systems, they usually fail to deal with large perturbation conditions in terms of the 6-DoF nonlinear control strategy. Here we propose a novel wing kinematics-based controller, which is optimized based on deep reinforcement learning (DRL) to stabilize bumblebee hovering under large perturbations. A high-fidelity Open AI Gym environment is established through coupling a CFD data-driven aerodynamic model and a 6-DoF flight dynamic model. The control policy with an action space of 4 is optimized using the off-policy Soft Actor-Critic (SAC) algorithm with automating entropy adjustment, which is verified to be of feasibility and robustness to achieve fast stabilization of the bumblebee hovering flight under full 6-DoF large disturbances. The 6-DoF wing kinematics-based DRL control strategy may provide an efficient autonomous controller design for bioinspired flapping-wing micro air vehicles.

AB The ability of autonomous robots to model, communicate, and act on semantic "soft data" remains challenging. The human-assisted robotic planning and sensing (HARPS) framework is presented for active semantic sensing and planning in human-robot teams to address these gaps by formally combining the benefits of online sampling-based partially observable Markov decision process policies, multimodal human-robot interaction, and Bayesian data fusion. HARPS lets humans impose model structure and extend the range of soft data by sketching and labeling new semantic features in uncertain environments. Dynamic model updating lets robotic agents actively query humans for novel and relevant semantic data, thereby improving model and state beliefs for improved online planning. Simulations of a unmanned aerial vehicle-enabled target search in a large-scale partially structured environment show significant improvements in time and beliefs required for interception versus conventional planning with robot-only sensing. A human subject study in the same environment shows an average doubling in dynamic target capture rate compared to the lone robot case and highlights the robustness of HARPS over a range of user characteristics and interaction modalities.

AB We present a novel outdoor navigation algorithm to generate stable and efficient actions to navigate a robot to reach a goal. We use a multi-stage training pipeline and show that our approach produces policies that result in stable and reliable robot navigation on complex terrains. Based on the Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) algorithm, we developed a novel method to achieve multiple capabilities for outdoor local navigation tasks, namely alleviating the robot's drifting, keeping the robot stable on bumpy terrains, avoiding climbing on hills with steep elevation changes, and avoiding collisions. Our training process mitigates the reality (sim-to-real) gap by introducing generalized environmental and robotic parameters and training with rich features captured from light detection and ranging (Lidar) sensor in a high-fidelity Unity simulator. We evaluate our method in both simulation and real-world environments using Clearpath Husky and Jackal robots. Further, we compare our method against the state-of-the-art approaches and observe that, in the real world, our method improves stability by at least 30.7% on uneven terrains, reduces drifting by 8.08%, and decreases the elevation changes by 14.75%.

ID UNDERWATER; COMMUNICATION; MODULATION
AB In an autonomous underwater vehicles- (AUVs-) based optical-acoustic hybrid network, it is critical to achieve ultra high-speed reliable communications, in order to reap the benefits of the complementary systems and perform high-bandwidth and low-latency operations. However, as the mobile AUVs operate in harsh oceanic environments, it is essential to design an effective switching algorithm to execute flexible hybrid acoustic-optical communications and increase the network throughput. In this paper, we propose a Q-learning-based adaptive switching scheme to maximize the network throughput by capturing the dynamics of the varying channels as well as the mobility of AUVs. In order to address the challenge associated with partial observations of the optical channel and improve the switching efficiency in extreme conditions, a blind optical channel estimation method is designed and implemented with the Extended Kalman Filter (EKF), in which the relationship between the underwater acoustic and optical channels is utilized to improve the channel prediction accuracy. Based on this environmental status, a reinforcement learning approach is leveraged to build a near-optimal switching strategy for the hybrid network. We conduct numerical simulations to verify the performance of the scheme, and the simulation results demonstrate that the proposed switching scheme is effective and robust.

AB Education is an essential vehicle for valuing cultural legacy, and musical heritage is a part of that cultural legacy that we must protect as it is one of the main areas of intangible cultural heritage, a reflection of cultural diversity, and a conveyor of meaning, and social, cultural, and economic values contributing to sustainable development. The purpose of this study, therefore, is to evaluate the perception students studying for the Degree in Primary Education at the University of Zaragoza and the Autonomous University of Madrid have of the value, significance, and importance of the sustainability of musical cultural heritage. This non-experimental and descriptive research is based on the statistical descriptive method, with a sample of n = 202 preservice teachers. A questionnaire consisting of fifteen items was designed and validated as a data collection instrument. The data analysis shows differences in the analyzed categories and points to the need to take action to solve them. It also reveals the importance students attach to musical cultural heritage, to including it in the curricula of the various educational stages, and to the need to protect it as an essential requirement for sustainable development.

AB Self-driving cars promise solutions to some of the hazards of human driving but there are important questions about the safety of these new technologies. This paper takes a qualitative social science approach to the question 'how safe is safe enough?' Drawing on 50 interviews with people developing and researching self-driving cars, I describe two dominant narratives of safety. The first, safety-in-numbers, sees safety as a self-evident property of the technology and offers metrics in an attempt to reassure the public. The second approach, safety-by-design, starts with the challenge of safety assurance and sees the technology as intrinsically problematic. The first approach is concerned only with performance-what a self-driving system does. The second is also concerned with why systems do what they do and how they should be tested. Using insights from workshops with members of the public, I introduce a further concern that will define trustworthy self-driving cars: the intended and perceived purposes of a system. Engineers' safety assurances will have their credibility tested in public. 'How safe is safe enough?' prompts further questions: 'safe enough for what?' and 'safe enough for whom?'

AB The current navigation systems used in many autonomous mobile robotic applications, like unmanned vehicles, are always equipped with various sensors to get accurate navigation results. The key point is to fuse the information from different sensors efficiently. However, different sensors provide asynchronous measurements, some of which even appear to be nonlinear. Moreover, some sensors are vulnerable in specific environments, e.g., GPS signal is likely to work poorly in interior space, underground, and tall buildings. We propose a multi-sensor information fusion method based on a factor graph to fuse all available asynchronous sensor information and efficiently and accurately calculate a navigation solution. Assuming the sensor measurements and navigation states in a navigation system as factor nodes and variable nodes in a factor graph, respectively, the update of the states can be implemented in the framework of the factor graph. The proposed method is experimentally validated using two different datasets. A comparison with Federated Filter, which has been widely used in integrated navigation systems, demonstrates the proposed method's effectiveness. Additionally, analyzing the navigation results with data loss verifies that the proposed method could achieve sensor plug and play in software.

AB Aside from vast deployment cost reduction, Industrial Wireless Sensor and Actuator Networks (IWSAN) introduce a new level of industrial connectivity. Wireless connection of sensors and actuators in industrial environments not only enables wireless monitoring and actuation, it also enables coordination of production stages, connecting mobile robots and autonomous transport vehicles, as well as localization and tracking of assets. All these opportunities already inspired the development of many wireless technologies in an effort to fully enable Industry 4.0. However, different technologies significantly differ in performance and capabilities, none being capable of supporting all industrial use cases. When designing a network solution, one must be aware of the capabilities and the trade-offs that prospective technologies have. This paper evaluates the technologies potentially suitable for IWSAN solutions covering an entire industrial site with limited infrastructure cost and discusses their trade-offs in an effort to provide information for choosing the most suitable technology for the use case of interest. The comparative discussion presented in this paper aims to enable engineers to choose the most suitable wireless technology for their specific IWSAN deployment.

AB Internet of Underwater Things (IoUT) is primarily comprised of acoustic sensor nodes, which are mostly battery-powered. The battery life of sensors is limited and it is inconvenient to recharge. However, these sensor nodes form the Underwater Wireless Sensor Networks (UWSNs), which can be clustered to save a massive amount of energy. Nevertheless, the selection of cluster head (CH) is a key issue as CH has to spend additional energy for performing data collection and aggregation before transmitting the data towards the destination. On the other hand, autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) are recommended to bridge UWSN with surface devices or internet. Yet, finding a path AUV should follow is an open issue. In this work, we proposed a protocol that utilizes AUV to save energy wasted by sensor nodes during clustering. To be precise, AUV not only collects data, but it is also responsible for nominating the Cluster Head (CH) and creating a wakeup-sleep schedule for clusters. In addition, we present AUV traversal path that is aware of residual energy in the network. Finally, an extensive quantitative evaluation of the proposed scheme against state of the art solutions is given.

AB Existing belief space motion planning methods are not efficient for underwater robots that are subject to spatially varying motion and sensing uncertainties arising from the non-uniform current disturbances and landmark populations, respectively. Based on a closed-loop stochastic control framework, we propose a fast Gaussian belief space planning approach for coupled optimization of trajectory, localization and control, resulting in a non-linear programming problem (NLP). In particular, as opposed to advancing the covariance by a Kalman filter in the existing literature, we utilize an upper bound of the trace propagation of the covariance, thereby avoiding to solve Riccati equations and thus, reducing the computational complexity. The NLP is then efficiently solved by sequential quadratic programming based on the initial solutions obtained from RRT-connect. These initials lie in multiple homotopy classes guaranteed by H-signature discrimination, leading to global optimality with probability one as the number of samples in RRT-connect goes to infinity. Numerical simulations on holonomic and non-holonomic autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) and an Intervention-AUV with a manipulator in cluttered underwater environments demonstrate that optimal and collision-free trajectories with low localization uncertainty are obtained efficiently.

AB The discovery and development of novel materials in the field of energy are essential to accelerate the transition to a low-carbon economy. Bringing recent technological innovations in automation, robotics and computer science together with current approaches in chemistry, materials synthesis and characterization will act as a catalyst for revolutionizing traditional research and development in both industry and academia. This Perspective provides a vision for an integrated artificial intelligence approach towards autonomous materials discovery, which, in our opinion, will emerge within the next 5 to 10 years. The approach we discuss requires the integration of the following tools, which have already seen substantial development to date: high-throughput virtual screening, automated synthesis planning, automated laboratories and machine learning algorithms. In addition to reducing the time to deployment of new materials by an order of magnitude, this integrated approach is expected to lower the cost associated with the initial discovery. Thus, the price of the final products (for example, solar panels, batteries and electric vehicles) will also decrease. This in turn will enable industries and governments to meet more ambitious targets in terms of reducing greenhouse gas emissions at a faster pace.

AB The development of flat, compact beam-steering devices with no bulky moving parts is opening up a new route to a variety of exciting applications, such as LIDAR scanning systems for autonomous vehicles, robotics and sensing, free-space, and even surface wave optical signal coupling. In this paper, the design, fabrication and characterization of innovative, nonvolatile, and reconfigurable beam-steering metadevices enabled by a combination of optical metasurfaces and chalcogenide phase-change materials is reported. The metadevices reflect an incident optical beam in a mirror-like fashion when the phase-change layer is in the crystalline state, but reflect anomalously at predesigned angles when the phase-change layer is switched into its amorphous state. Experimental angle-resolved spectrometry measurements verify that fabricated devices perform as designed, with high efficiencies, up to 40%, when operating at 1550 nm. Laser-induced crystallization and reamorphization experiments confirm reversible switching of the device. It is believed that reconfigurable phase-change-based beam-steering and beam-shaping metadevices, such as those reported here, can offer real applications advantages, such as high efficiency, compactness, fast switching times and, due to the nonvolatile nature of chalcogenide phase-change materials, low power consumption.

AB IncP-9 plasmids are common in Pseudomonas species and can be transferred to other Gram-negative eubacteria but tend not to be stably maintained outside their natural host genus. A 1.3 kb oriV-rep fragment from IncP-9 plasmid pM3 was sufficient for autonomous replication in Pseudomonas putida but not in Escherichia coli. Replication of oriV-rep in E. coli was restored when additional rep was provided in trans, suggesting that the replication defect resulted from insufficient rep expression from its natural promoter. A promoter deficiency in E. coli was confirmed by reporter gene assays, transcriptional start point mapping and mutation of the promoter recognition elements. Dissection of the pM3 mini-replicon, pMT2, showed that this replication deficiency in E. coli is suppressed by additional determinants from its par operon: ParB, which can be supplied in trans, and its target, the par operon promoter, required in cis to oriV-rep. We propose that ParB binding to its target either changes plasmid DNA and thus promoter conformation or by spreading or looping contacts RNAP at the rep promoter so that rep expression is sufficient to activate oriV.

AB The flanks of the ultraslow-spreading Mid-Cayman Spreading Center (MCSC) are characterized by domal massifs or oceanic core complexes (OCCs). The most prominent of these, Mount Dent, comprises lower-crustal and upper-mantle lithologies and hosts the Von Damm vent field similar to 12km west of the axial deep. Here, presented autonomous underwater vehicle-derived swath sonar (multibeam) mapping and deep-towed side-scan sonar imagery lead to our interpretation that: (i) slip along the OCC-bounding detachment fault is ceasing, (ii) the termination zone, where detachment fault meets the hanging wall, is disintegrating, (iii) the domed surface of the OCC is cut by steep north-south extensional faulting, and (iv) the breakaway zone is cut by outward facing faults. The Von Damm vent field and dispersed pockmarks on the OCC's south flank further suggest that hydrothermal fluid flow is pervasive within the faulted OCC. On the axial floor of the MCSC, bright acoustic backscatter and multibeam bathymetry reveal: (v) a volcanic detachment hanging wall, (vi) a major fault rifting the southern flank of Mount Dent, and (vii) a young axial volcanic ridge intersecting its northern flank. These observations are described by a conceptual model wherein detachment faulting and OCC exhumation are ceasing during an increase in magmatic intrusion, brittle deformation, and hydrothermal circulation within the OCC. Together, this high-resolution view of the MCSC provides an instructive example of how OCCs, formed within an overall melt-starved ultraslow spreading center, can undergo magmatism, hydrothermal activity, and faulting in much the same way as expected in magmatically more robust slow-spreading centers elsewhere.
   Plain Language Summary Mid-ocean ridges create the seafloor of the ocean basins, and the processes involved range from the eruption of volcanoes to the generation of submarine hydrothermal vents. A small spreading center in the Caribbean Seathe Mid-Cayman Spreading Centerspreads at such a slow rate that instead of a steady eruption of volcanic material, tectonic faults pull the deeper parts of the Earth to the surface forming Mount Everest-scale mountains. In 2010 and 2013 we collected data from the most prominent massif in the Cayman Trough using cutting-edge mapping tools such as an autonomous underwater vehicle, or AUV. Our data show that the massif is complex internally, breaking up by tectonic forces, intruded by magma, and eroded at the surface. All of these processes are related to the flow of fluids through the crust that sustain the Von Damm vent field, a globally distinct vent field in terms of its biology and chemistry. Mount Dent is likely similar to many other such complexes around the world, including other deep, slow-spreading centers.

AB Pitch vibrations can be commonly observed in unmanned marine devices under wave excitation, but there is relatively little research on harvesting the energy from the pitch vibrations with ultra-low frequency. This work develops a novel built-in electromagnetic energy harvester using rope transmission to provide sustainable power supply for onboard electronics. It has the advantages of low friction and compact structure, which is suitable for installation inside an autonomous underwater vehicle with slender cylindrical shape. Dynamic modeling and linearization approach are employed to analyze its energy harvesting performance theoretically. A scalable prototype is fabricated and tested on a motion platform with six degrees of freedom by simulating periodic pitch vibration. The results show that the prototype can output electrical power with the peak value of 1663 mW and the average value of 315 mW at the excitation frequency of 0.6 Hz. It also has competitive energy extraction efficiency and the maximum value reaches 33.23%. The experimental data are in good agreement with the theoretical data, which verifies the effectiveness of the theoretical model. The developed energy harvester can serve as a potential candidate for powering the electronics on unmanned marine devices.

AB The auto industry is accelerating, and self-driving cars are becoming a reality. However, the acceptance of such cars will depend on their social and environmental integration into a road traffic ecosystem comprising vehicles, motorcycles, bicycles, and pedestrians. One of the most vulnerable groups within the road ecosystem is pedestrians. Assistive technology focuses on ensuring functional independence for people with disabilities. However, little effort has been devoted to exploring possible interaction mechanisms between pedestrians with disabilities and self-driving cars. This paper analyzes how self-driving cars and disabled pedestrians should interact in a traffic ecosystem supported by wearable devices for pedestrians to feel safer and more comfortable. We define the concept of an Assistive Self-driving Car (ASC). We describe a set of procedures to identify people with disabilities using an IEEE 802.11p-based device and a group of messages to express the intentions of disabled pedestrians to self-driving cars. This interaction provides disabled pedestrians with increased safety and confidence in performing tasks such as crossing the street. Finally, we discuss strategies for alerting disabled pedestrians to potential hazards within the road ecosystem.

AB High-definition (HD) maps can provide precise road information that enables an autonomous driving system to effectively navigate a vehicle. Recent research has focused on leveraging semantic segmentation to achieve automatic annotation of HD maps. However, the existing methods suffer from low recognition accuracy in automatic driving scenarios, leading to inefficient annotation processes. In this paper, we propose a novel semantic segmentation method for automatic HD map annotation. Our approach introduces a new encoder, known as the convolutional transformer hybrid encoder, to enhance the model's feature extraction capabilities. Additionally, we propose a multi-level fusion module that enables the model to aggregate different levels of detail and semantic information. Furthermore, we present a novel decoupled boundary joint decoder to improve the model's ability to handle the boundary between categories. To evaluate our method, we conducted experiments using the Bird's Eye View point cloud images dataset and Cityscapes dataset. Comparative analysis against state-of-the-art methods demonstrates that our model achieves the highest performance. Specifically, our model achieves an mIoU of 56.26%, surpassing the results of SegFormer with an mIoU of 1.47%. This innovative promises to significantly enhance the efficiency of HD map automatic annotation.

ID ALGORITHM
AB Due to the unavoidable movement of nodes within oceanic environments and the continual changing of underwater sound speed, it is difficult to synchronize clocks between nodes and locate them. Therefore, this paper proposes a joint time synchronization and localization mechanism (JTSL). Firstly, a time synchronization method is proposed based on three autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs). In this method, AUVs send synchronization request signals to the moving unknown node three times. The clock skew and offset of each AUV compared to the clock of the unknown node are obtained based on the information transfer delay between nodes as sound speed changes. After time synchronization, the unknown node receives location information from AUVs and obtains the sound speed change function. Based on this function and kinematic equations, a distance calculation method is developed to calculate the distance between the unknown node and AUVs. In addition, a multi-layer fast meshing localization method is designed to improve the accuracy and speed of node localization. The simulation experiments show that JTSL can overcome difficulties related to time synchronization and localization of mobile nodes, and it demonstrates excellent performance in terms of time synchronization accuracy, energy efficiency, localization accuracy, and localization time.

AB The critical supply of materials for lithium-ion batteries (LIBs) has become highly vulnerable to epidemics and geopolitical influences, highlighting the importance of independent and autonomous in situ recycling of LIBs. Many technologies have been developed rapidly for recycling spent LIBs in the last decade. However, their sustainability is seriously questioned, given the blind pursuit of recycling efficiency and profit maximization, even if the so-called innovative methods. Advanced recycling technologies should move forward in the direction of complying with the principles of green chemistry (PGC). This paper reviews global state-of-the-art recycling technologies developed for LIBs in recent decades within each of the principles of green chemistry. Furthermore, it critically assesses in reverse the extent to which each green chemistry principle has evolved. In particular, we have developed a unique indexing system for evaluating the performance of LIBs recycling technologies by integrating the PGC and the circular economy (CE) concept. Finally, future directions for improved research are highlighted. We hope to improve the greenness of technologies and guide the production and recycling processes of power LIBs.

AB A Lie system is a nonautonomous system of first-order ordinary differential equations whose general solution can be written via an autonomous function, the so-called (nonlinear) superposition rule of a finite number of particular solutions and some parameters to be related to initial conditions. This superposition rule can be obtained using the geometric features of the Lie system, its symmetries, and the symmetric properties of certain morphisms involved. Even if a superposition rule for a Lie system is known, the explicit analytic expression of its solutions frequently is not. This is why this article focuses on a novel geometric attempt to integrate Lie systems analytically and numerically. We focus on two families of methods based on Magnus expansions and on Runge-Kutta-Munthe-Kaas methods, which are here adapted, in a geometric manner, to Lie systems. To illustrate the accuracy of our techniques we analyze Lie systems related to Lie groups of the form SL(n,R), which play a very relevant role in mechanics. In particular, we depict an optimal control problem for a vehicle with quadratic cost function. Particular numerical solutions of the studied examples are given.

AB Emerging embedded systems, such as autonomous vehicles, demand highly efficient remote data transfer, whereas existing networking hardware and protocols cause high communication latency and CPU consumption. In this article, we propose embedded RDAC (eRDAC), an efficient and reliable remote direct access and control solution for embedded systems. The proposed remote access controller in eRDAC has a two-layer protocol offload engine that employs the command/response protocol on UDP to ensure the data reliability and security, and a multichannel DMA controller with configurable priority to improve the efficiency. Besides, a reusable hardware Ethernet MAC is implemented to support not only remote access commands but also standard Ethernet communication. We implement eRDAC on FPGA and the corresponding software in the Linux system. Experimental results show that eRDAC can reduce the latency of remote I/O reading/writing by 74.3%/74.9% (3.76x/3.98x performance improvement) and reduce the latency of remote memory reading and writing with 1024B by 54.2% compared to the socket-based communication. Meanwhile, eRDAC can cut off the consumption of the remote processor and achieve 0.250mJ/Mb energy consumption with only 25-mW power.

TI Supervised Reinforcement Learning for ULV Path Planning in Complex

SO WIRELESS COMMUNICATIONS & MOBILE COMPUTING

DT Article
AB The rapid development of the logistics industry leads to an urgent need for intelligent equipment to improve warehouse transportation efficiency. Recent advances in unmanned logistics vehicles (ULVs) make them particularly important in smart warehouses. However, the complex warehouse environment poses a significant challenge to ULV transportation path planning. Multiple ULVs need to transport cargoes with good coordination ability to overcome the low efficiency of a single ULV. The ULVs also need to interact with the environment to achieve optimal path planning with obstacle avoidance. In this paper, we propose a supervised deep reinforcement learning (SDRL) approach for logistics warehouses that enables autonomous ULVs path planning for cargo transportation in a complex environment. The proposed SDRL approach is featured by (1) designing the supervision module to imitate the behaviors of experts and thus improve the coordination ability of multiple ULVs, (2) optimizing the generator of the imitation learning based on the proximal policy optimization to boost the learning performance, and (3) developing the policy module via deep reinforcement learning to avoid obstacles when navigating the ULVs in warehouse environments. The experiments over dynamic and fixed-point warehouse environments show that the proposed SDRL approach outperforms its rivals regarding average reward, training speed, task completion rate, and collision times.

SO IET IMAGE PROCESSING

DT Article
ID BLUE CHANNEL; RESTORATION; PERFORMANCE; RETINEX
AB The increasingly frequent sand-dust weather in the inland areas seriously affects outdoor vision applications, especially autonomous vehicles and security monitoring. To moderate the image's colour cast and poor contrast caused by sand-dust weather, an effective approach is proposed in this study to enhance the sand-dust images. First, the original degraded image's colour cast is corrected by a new colour balance and compensation formula, which compensates the blue and green channel information through numerous yellow channel information caused by sand-dust scattering before white balance. Next, in order to avoid the new colour deviation, the corrected image is converted from the RGB colour space to the HSV colour space and use the CLAHE to enhance the V component to improve the contrast. Then, a nonlinear gain function is defined to further adaptively sharpen the V component to enhance image details. Finally, the S component is stretched to improve image saturation. The extensive qualitative and quantitative evaluation shows that this method can improve the image edge clarity and contrast, restore good colour fidelity for all sand-dust images tested. The verification also proves that this method is of much significance in improving the feature point extraction and the target detection results in the sand-dust weather.

AB Scholars have argued that trust acts as a decision-making heuristic, aiding people in assessing the risks of various technologies. This may be especially likely for social trust, or integrity (vs. calculative trust, or competence), and among people with limited experience with a given technology. The goal of this research is to provide an experimental test of the trust heuristic. In three experiments, which were identical except for the technology of focus (Study 1: autonomous vehicles, N = 1691; Study 2: nuclear power, N = 844; Study 3: airplane travel, N = 853), participants recruited from an online platform completed measures of trust, and then were randomly assigned to respond to measures of perceived risk in either a treatment (time pressure) or control condition. Competence and integrity were significantly negatively associated with risk perceptions. In Studies 1-2, the relationship between integrity (not competence) and risk was significantly stronger in the timed vs. untimed condition. However, Study 3, which focused on a context characterized by greater experience, did not find this effect. Results support the role of integrity, but not competence, as a decision-making heuristic, and suggest that greater levels of experience weaken the influence of integrity on risk.

AB Underwater data acquisition entities acquire big data that are processed aboard terrestrial data centres. However, processing the big data aboard terrestrial computing entities involves high latency data transfer. In addition, the processing of data in a terrestrial environment is challenging when there is inadequate edge node capacity. These challenges are addressed here. The paper proposes the heterogeneous edge computing paradigm to realize low latency transfer of increasing underwater big data. This is realized via the use of underwater computing entities instead of terrestrial computing entities for processing acquired big data. The proposed heterogeneous edge computing paradigm presents the multi-mode automated teller machine (ATM) as low cost terrestrial edge network entity. The multi-mode ATM is suitable when edge nodes have inadequate computing capacity. Performance evaluation shows that the use of underwater computing entities instead of terrestrial computing entities (existing work) enhances network performance and related capital costs. The number of hops, computing entity access latency and required autonomous underwater vehicle acquisition costs by an average of (5.3-88.4)%, 63.5% and (31.8-95.4)%, respectively. Evaluation shows that the use of the multi-mode ATM in the context of terrestrial cloud computing reduces the number of hops and latency by 44.4% and 37.3% on average, respectively.

AB In recent years, developments in data collection schemes based on multiple autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) are facilitating the realization of the so-called underwater acoustic sensor networks (UASNs). As yet, the lack of suitable collaboration mechanisms among multiple AUVs, which are based on functional or resource distributions, prevents effective information sharing and yields increased data collection delays, thus reducing the capacity of the networks. In this article, to address these shortcomings, we propose a state prediction-based data collection (SPDC) algorithm for UASNs. The principle of operation is as follows. First, some cluster pairs named observation clusters obtain and exchange the state information about AUVs between the adjacent subregions. Based on the shared information, the AUVs predict each other's status and adjust their data collection areas. Then, the AUVs use a heuristic strategy to complete the path planning based on the updated access area. Finally, a scheduling data forwarding mechanism reduces the diving number of the AUVs, by reasonably allocating the overlapped data unloading intervals between the AUVs and a mobile sink. Experimental results prove that the proposed algorithm shows satisfactory performance in reducing data collection delays and in improving the total network lifetime.

AB This work addressed the problem of miscalibration or decalibration of mobile stereo/bi-monocular camera setups. We especially focused on the context of autonomous vehicles. In real-world conditions, any optical system is subject to various mechanical stresses, caused by vibration, rough handling, collisions, or even thermal expansion. Such mechanical stresses change the stereo pair geometry, and as a consequence, the pre-calculated epipolar geometry or any geometric-based approach is no longer valid. The standard method, which consists of estimating the calibration online, fails in such harsh conditions. The proposed method was based on a robust linearly constrained state estimation technique able to mitigate the model mismatch without estimating the model parameters. Therefore, our solution was able to mitigate the errors with negligible use of additional computing resources. We propose to use a linearly constrained extended Kalman filter for a stereo-based visual odometry or simultaneous localization and mapping approach. Simulations confirmed that the method kept the system (and objects of the map) localized in real-time even with huge miscalibration errors and parameter variations. The results confirmed that the method was robust to a miscalibration of all the extrinsic calibration parameters even when the standard online calibration procedure failed.

AB The indoor autonomous navigation of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) is the current research hotspot. Unlike the outdoor broad environment, the indoor environment is unknown and complicated. Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) signals are easily blocked and reflected because of complex indoor spatial features, which make it impossible to achieve positioning and navigation indoors relying on GNSS. This article proposes a set of indoor corridor environment positioning methods based on the integration of WiFi and IMU. The zone partition-based Weighted K Nearest Neighbors (WKNN) algorithm is used to achieve higher WiFi-based positioning accuracy. On the basis of the Error-State Kalman Filter (ESKF) algorithm, WiFi-based and IMU-based methods are fused together and realize higher positioning accuracy. The probability-based optimization method is used for further accuracy improvement. After data fusion, the positioning accuracy increased by 51.09% compared to the IMU-based algorithm and by 66.16% compared to the WiFi-based algorithm. After optimization, the positioning accuracy increased by 20.9% compared to the ESKF-based data fusion algorithm. All of the above results prove that methods based on WiFi and IMU (low-cost sensors) are very capable of obtaining high indoor positioning accuracy.

AB In actual driving, the driver can estimate the traffic condition ahead at the next moment in terms of the current traffic information, which describes the driver's predictive effect. Due to this factor, a novel two-dimensional lattice hydrodynamic model considering a driver's predictive effect is proposed in this paper. The stability condition of the novel model is obtained by performing the linear stability analysis method, and the phase diagram between the driver's sensitivity coefficient and traffic density is drawn. The nonlinear analysis of the model is conducted and the kink-antikink of modified Korteweg-de Vries (mKdV) equation is derived, which describes the propagation characteristics of the traffic density flow waves near the critical point. The numerical simulation is executed to explore how the driver's predictive effect affects the traffic flow stability. Numerical results coincide well with theoretical analysis results, which indicates that the predictive effect of drivers can effectively avoid traffic congestion and the fraction of eastbound cars can also improve the stability of traffic flow to a certain extent.

AB The past decade has witnessed the widespread adoption of Cloud Computing (CC) across automotive industries for a myriad of vehicular applications. A vehicular network that solely relies on CC, however, is susceptible to end-to-end latency due to the round-trip between data sources and cloud servers. Alternatively, the computing capability has been considered at the edge of vehicular network to achieve real-time analytics. Despite that, such consideration poses new questions on how data is offloaded and cached among the edge nodes and Autonomous Vehicles (AVs) in the environment of Vehicular Edge Network (VEN). In this paper, we outlined the aspects of VEN, particularly Vehicular Edge Computing (VEC), together with its architecture, layers, communications, and applications that are involved in the computation offloading (ComOf) and content caching and delivery (CachDel) scenarios. We extensively reviewed the existing approaches in solving ComOf and CachDel problems for the respective VEC architecture. The security aspect in ComOf and CachDel were critically discussed as well in the paper. Finally, we highlighted some key challenges, open issues, and future works of ComOf and CachDel in VEC.

AB The present paper analyzes the performance of localization systems, based on dual-band Direction of Arrival (DoA) approach, in multi-path affected scenarios. The implemented DoA estimation, which belongs to the so-called Space and Frequency Division Multiple Access (SFDMA) technique, takes advantage of the use of two uncorrelated communication carrier frequencies, as already demonstrated by the authors. Starting from these results, this paper provides, first, the methodology followed to describe the localization system in the proposed simulation environment, and, as a second step, describes how multi-path effects may be taken into account through a set of full-wave simulations. The latter follows an approach based on the two-ray model. The validation of the proposed approach is demonstrated by simulations over a wide range of virtual scenarios. The analysis of the results highlights the ability of the proposed approach to describe multi-path effects and confirms enhancements in DoA estimation as experimentally evaluated by the same authors. To further assess the performance of the aforementioned simulation environment, a comparison between simulated and measured results was carried out, confirming the capability to predict DoA performance.

AB As cars become increasingly computerized and their safety functions evolve rapidly, the number of complex safety-critical components deployed in advanced driver assistance systems or autonomous vehicles is rising dramatically with high-end models containing hundreds of embedded microcontrollers. These integrated circuits must adhere to stringent requirements for high quality and long-term reliability driven by functional safety standards. This requires test solutions that address challenges posed by automotive systems. This article presents a scan-based test scheme optimizing test time and area overhead during manufacturing and in-system test of automotive electronics. The proposed scheme deploys observation test points that capture the faulty effects in every shift cycle into separate observation scan chains. To reduce area overhead, the scheme enables the sharing of flip-flops among control points. It is also shown how test points enhance test coverage (TC) in the presence of cascaded clock gaters. Finally, processing challenges when fault simulating every scan shift cycle to determine TC are addressed. Experimental results obtained for contemporary automotive designs and reported herein show significant improvements in test quality over traditional solutions.

DT Article
ID STATE
AB To solve the localization failure problem of terrain-aided navigation (TAN) system of the autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) caused by large area of underwater flat terrain in the Arctic, a navigation system with relocation part is constructed to enhance the robustness of localization. The system uses particle filter to estimate the AUV's position and reduce the nonlinear noise disturbance, and the prior motion information is added to avoid the mismatching caused by the similar altitude of low-resolution map. Based on the estimate data and the measured altitude data, the normalized innovation square (NIS) is used to evaluate the differentiation of terrain sequence, and the differentiation is used as a judgment of whether the AUV is in the switch location. A simulation experiment is carried out on the 500 m resolution underwater map of the Arctic. The results show that adding the prior motion information can restrain the divergence of the estimator; NIS can accurately reflect the sharp change of terrain sequence. After the relocation process, the AUV can still maintain the positioning accuracy within 2 km after running 50 km in the area including flat and rough terrain. This research solves the problem of localization errors in the Arctic flat terrain in the system level and provides a solution for the application of underwater navigation in the Arctic.

ID RISK ANALYSIS; MODEL; OPERATIONS; SAFETY
AB Autonomous marine systems may switch between various operational modes with different levels of autonomy (LoA), due to a rapidly changing environment and the complex nature of tasks. The dynamic autonomy brings an additional layer of complexity to ensuring safe marine operations, but this functionality is not sufficiently considered in current risk analysis methods. Hence, this paper proposes an approach to hazard identification based on the system theoretic process analysis (STPA) that includes unsafe transitions between different LoA in systems. A case study of a remotely operated vehicle (ROV) with four operational modes with different LoAs is used to illustrate the approach. The results show that the proposed approach contributes to: 1) communicating a shift of responsibilities among human operator and system controller in different operational modes by specifying how the allocation of the responsibility between human operators and the controller changes, and what updated process model of the operator and the controller are to ensure a successful transition; 2) refining safety constraints to be more concrete to improve system design, and operational procedures and 3) identifying triggering events for marine system modes' transitions to handle environmental interaction systematically and sufficiently.

AB Driverless cars, such as those currently operated by Uber and others as well as those being researched and developed by major and niche automobile manufacturers, are expected to dramatically reduce the number of highway fatalities in the coming years. While no one will fault any technology that safely and effectively protects and saves lives, many individuals with an array of medical conditions rely on organ donors to provide the liver, kidney, or other organs required to facilitate a life-saving organ transplant. Consequently, one collateral effect of the introduction of driverless car technology will be a reduction in the market supply of healthy organs for transplantation. In this paper, a venture capital lawyer, a medical researcher, and a bioengineer will establish the expected size of this reduction in supply, the associated harm resulting from this reduction, and discuss two promising technological solutions-bioprosthetics and 3D bioprinting of tissues and organs. In the case of both technologies, the authors will discuss the challenges and opportunities presented for institutional investors (private equity, venture capital, angel funds) and medical researchers in tackling the potential reduction in organ donations.

ID EYE-MOVEMENTS
AB The current intelligent driving system does not consider the selective attention mechanism of drivers, and it cannot completely replace the drivers to extract effective road information. A Driver Visual Attention Network (DVAN), which is based on deep learning attention model, is proposed in our paper, in order to solve this problem. The DVAN is aimed at extracting the key information affecting the driver's operation by predicting the driver's attention points. It completes the fast localization and extraction of road information that is most interesting to drivers by merging local apparent features and contextual visual information. Meanwhile, a Cross Convolutional Neural Network (C-CNN) is proposed in order to ensure the integrity of the extracted information. Here, we verify the network on the KITTI dataset, which is the largest computer vision algorithm evaluation data set in the world's largest autonomous driving scenario. Our results show that the DVAN can quickly locate and identify the target that the driver is most interested in a picture, and the average accuracy of prediction is 96.3%. This will provide useful theoretical basis and technical methods that are related to visual perception for intelligent driving vehicles, driving training and assisted driving systems in the future.

AB The purpose of this research is to improve the robustness of the autonomous system in order to improve the position and velocity estimation of an Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV). Therefore, new integrated SINS/GPS navigation scheme based on Interacting Multiple Nonlinear Fuzzy Adaptive H-infinity Models (IMM-NFAH(infinity)) filtering technique for UAV is presented. The proposed IMM-NFAH(infinity) strategy switches between two different Nonlinear Fuzzy Adaptive H-infinity (NFAH(infinity)) filters and each NFAH(infinity )filter is based on different fuzzy logic inference systems. The newly proposed technique takes into consideration the high order Taylor series terms and adapts the nonlinear H oc filter based on different fuzzy inference systems via adaptive filter bounds (delta(i)), along with disturbance attenuation parameter gamma. Simulation analysis validates the performance of the proposed algorithm, and the comparison with nonlinear H-infinity (NH infinity) filter and that with different NFAH(infinity) filters demonstrate the effectiveness of UAV localization utilizing IMM-NFAH(infinity) filter.

AB Selective weed treatment is a critical step in autonomous crop management as related to crop health and yield. However, a key challenge is reliable and accurate weed detection to minimize damage to surrounding plants. In this letter, we present an approach for dense semantic weed classification with multispectral images collected by a micro aerial vehicle (MAV). We use the recently developed encoder-decoder cascaded convolutional neural network, SegNet, that infers dense semantic classes while allowing any number of input image channels and class balancing with our sugar beet and weed datasets. To obtain training datasets, we established an experimental field with varying herbicide levels resulting in field plots containing only either crop or weed, enabling us to use the normalized difference vegetation index as a distinguishable feature for automatic ground truth generation. We train six models with different numbers of input channels and condition (fine tune) it to achieve similar to 0.8 F1-score and 0.78 area under the curve classification metrics. For the model deployment, an embedded Graphics Processing Unit (GPU) system (Jetson TX2) is tested for MAV integration. Dataset used in this letter is released to support the community and future work.

AB The suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN)-often referred to as the master circadian clock-is essential in generating physiologic rhythms and orchestrating synchrony among circadian clocks. This study tested the hypothesis that periodic motivation induced by rhythmically pairing 2 reinforcing stimuli [methamphetamine (Meth) and running wheel (RW)] restores autonomous circadian activity in arrhythmic SCN-lesioned (SCNX) C3H/HeN mice. Sham-surgery and SCNX mice were treated with either Meth (1.2 mg/kg, i.p.) or vehicle in association, dissociation, or absence of an RW. Only the association of Meth treatment and restricted RW access successfully reestablished entrained circadian rhythms in mice with SCNX. RW-likely acting as a link between the circadian and reward systems-promotes circadian entrainment of activity. We conclude that a conditioned drug response is a powerful tool to entrain, drive, and restore circadian physiology. Furthermore, an RW should be recognized as a potent input signal in addition to the conventional use as an output signal.-Rawashdeh, O., Clough, S. J., Hudson, R. L., Dubocovich, M. L. Learned motivation drives circadian physiology in the absence of the master circadian clock.

TI Research on obstacle avoidance path planning of UAV in complex

SO SCIENTIFIC REPORTS

AB Obstacle avoidance path planning is considered an essential requirement for unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) to reach its designated mission area and perform its tasks. This study established a motion model and obstacle threat model for UAVs, and defined the cost coefficients for evading and crossing threat areas. To solve the problem of obstacle avoidance path planning with full coverage of threats, the cost coefficients were incorporated into the objective optimization function and solved by a combination of Sequential Quadratic Programming and Nonlinear Programming Solver. The problem of path planning under threat full coverage with no solution was resolved by improving the Bezier curve algorithm. By introducing the dynamic threat velocity obstacle model and calculating the relative and absolute collision cones, a path planning algorithm under multiple dynamic threats was proposed to solve the difficulties of dynamic obstacle prediction and avoidance. Simulation results revealed that the proposed Through-out method was more effective in handling full threat coverage and dynamic threats than traditional path planning methods namely, Detour or Cross Gaps. Our study offers valuable insights into autonomous path planning for UAVs that operate under complex threat conditions. This work is anticipated to contribute to the future development of more advanced and intelligent UAV systems.

AB Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV) are a suitable solution for monitoring growing cultures due to the possibility of covering a large area and the necessity of periodic monitoring. In inspection and monitoring tasks, the UAV must find an optimal or near-optimal collision-free route given initial and target positions. In this sense, path-planning strategies are crucial, especially online path planning that can represent the robot's operational environment or for control purposes. Therefore, this paper proposes an online adaptive path-planning solution based on the fusion of rapidly exploring random trees (RRT) and deep reinforcement learning (DRL) algorithms applied to the generation and control of the UAV autonomous trajectory during an olive-growing fly traps inspection task. The main objective of this proposal is to provide a reliable route for the UAV to reach the inspection points in the tree space to capture an image of the trap autonomously, avoiding possible obstacles present in the environment. The proposed framework was tested in a simulated environment using Gazebo and ROS. The results showed that the proposed solution accomplished the trial for environments up to 300 m3 and with 10 dynamic objects.

AB This paper concerns the multi-UAV cooperative path planning problem, which is solved by multi-objective optimization and by an adaptive evolutionary multi-objective estimation of distribution algorithm (AEMO-EDA). Since the traditional multi-objective optimization algorithms tend to fall into local optimum solutions when dealing with optimization problems in three dimensions, we suggest an advanced estimation of distribution algorithm. The main idea of this algorithm is to integrate the adaptive deflation of the selection rate, adaptive evolution of the covariance matrix, comprehensive evaluation of individual convergence and diversity, and reference point-based non-dominated ranking. A multi-UAV path planning model involving multi-objective optimization is established, and the designed algorithm is simulated and compared with other three high-dimensional multi-objective optimization algorithms. The results show that the AEMO-EDA proposed in this paper has stronger convergence and wider population distribution diversity in applying to the multi-UAV cooperative path planning model, as well as better global convergence. The algorithm can provide an stable path for each UAV and promote the intelligent operation of the UAV system.

AB Ongoing scientific programs that monitor marine environmental and ecological systems and changes comprise an informal but collaborative, information -rich, and spatially extensive network for the Alaskan Arctic continental shelves. Such programs reflect contributions and priorities of regional, national, and international funding agencies, as well as private donors and communities. These science programs are operated by a variety of local, regional, state, and national agencies, and academic, Tribal, for-profit, and nongovernmental nonprofit entities. Efforts include research ship and autonomous vehicle surveys, year-long mooring deployments, and observations from coastal communities. Inter-program coordination allows cost-effective leveraging of field logistics and collected data into value-added information that fosters new insights unattainable by any single program operating alone. Coordination occurs at many levels, from discussions at marine mammal co-management meetings and inter-agency meetings to scientific symposia and data workshops. Together, the efforts rep-resented by this collection of loosely linked long-term monitoring programs enable a biologically focused scientific foundation for understanding ecosystem responses to warming water temperatures and declining Arctic sea ice. Here, we introduce a variety of currently active monitoring efforts in the Alaskan Arctic marine realm that exem-plify the above attributes.

ID DEPLOYMENT
AB Underwater communication is a diverse and complex environment and has many problems. There are many problems in modeling and operating underwater networks. Physical and data link layer specifications for underwater networking should be taken into account in terms of quality of service metrics. In this study, we construct an underwater simulation environment as a cross-layer design consisting of physical and data link layers for the Internet of Underwater Things (IoUT) Network. The IoUT network has sensors with various priorities, a central node as a hub and a gateway as a buoy. The underwater sensors communicate with CSMA/ CA-based IEEE 802.15.6 protocol on low frequencies. For a more realistic communication channel, all the features of the acoustic channel are designed and performance analyzes are discussed. In addition, the proposed IoUT is compared with terrestrial network results in terms of bit error rate, signal-to-noise ratio, packet loss ratio, end-to-end delay, radio receiver utilization, and throughput. We claim that we have made a realistic IoUT network, especially for divers, autonomous underwater vehicles with specific sensors, or for similar purposes.

AB Obstacle avoidance for small unmanned aircraft is vital for the safety of future urban air mobility (UAM) and Unmanned Aircraft System (UAS) Traffic Management (UTM). There are a variety of techniques for real-time robust drone guidance, but numerous of them solve in discretized airspace and control, which would require an additional path smoothing step to provide flexible commands for UAS. To deliver safe and computationally efficient guidance for UAS operations, we explore the use of a deep reinforcement learning algorithm based on Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) to lead autonomous UAS to their destinations while bypassing obstacles through continuous control. The proposed scenario state representation and reward function can map the continuous state space to continuous control for both heading angle and speed. To verify the effectiveness of the proposed learning framework, we conducted numerical experiments with static and moving obstacles. Uncertainties associated with the environments and safety operation bounds are investigated in detail. Results show that the proposed model is able to provide accurate and robust guidance and resolve conflict with a success rate of over 99%.

ID MODEL
AB The gravity navigation performance is challenged by gravity measurement accuracy and heading precision which is determined by navigation equipment and measurement environment. In this letter, a new gravity matching algorithm based on comprehensive features matching (CFM) is proposed to evaluate the similarity correlation between gravity measurement sequences and reference map. Different from classical matching algorithms based on the single gravity statistical values characteristics, this method could combine gravity roughness comparison correlation, gravity contrast comparison correlation, and regression fitting degree of two gravity sequences, respectively, which helps to incorporate the gravity numerical error sensitivity and structural similarity of gravity sequences in matching navigation process. Simulation and measured data experiments in the South China Sea were carried out, and a better than 1.5 n miles matching navigation accuracy was maintained by CFM method regardless of an increase in gravity measurement error and heading error. Experimental results demonstrated that the proposed method had less dependence on gravity measurement accuracy or vehicle heading precision for higher gravity matching navigation performance, which could provide a new option for future underwater passive autonomous navigation.

AB Wave driven robots (WDRs) are a new type of autonomous ocean observation platform driven by wave energy. This paper is concerned with the multi-body yawing filter problem of the WDR. The adaptive multi-body yawing filter (AMF) of WDR was presented by considering the driven principle of the yawing motions of the submerged glider (glider) and the float body (float). The linearized yawing response models of the glider and the float were derived. The adaptive amending method of the dynamic response coefficients (DRCs) of the glider and the float were proposed. On this basis, the AMF of WDR was developed within the extended Kalman filter (EKF) framework. The AMF method utilized input and output (I/O) data to extract model information and is independent of the accurate mechanism model of the system. Numerical simulations of step steering and continuous steering under nominal model and the model with parameter perturbation were performed. The sea trial was conducted and the filtering results of the actual sensor data by AMF, EKF and tracking differentiator (TD) were presented. The proposed AMF method was found to be with good performance in suppressing noise and tracking speed.

AB As large cities continue growing, the pressure on public transportation system increases. Water transit infrastructure has gained increased interest for coastal cities in the last years as it presents great potential for reducing congestion on urban road networks. Furthermore, the evolution of autonomous ferry systems enables more frequent departures, shorter detours, and on-demand services with many smaller ferry units operating without captain and crew on board. While most of current ferry passenger transportation systems operate on fixed scheduled routes non autonomously, in the last decades, there has been an increased interest in on-demand public transit services as these provide more flexibility and customized services. This paper investigates the potentials of combining fixed schedule and on-demand ferry services. For this, we present a request assignment procedure and a ferry routing methodology that are embedded in a simulation framework. Through this, we examine the impact of fleet composition (i.e., number of scheduled and on-demand ferries) on the fulfilled customer demand and the service times of requests. Our computational experiments evaluate the relation between fleet size and fleet composition under various demand scenarios for a case study of the coastal city Kiel, Germany.

These exchanges are controlled by molecular, turbulent, and wave- driven processes in the atmospheric and oceanic boundary layers. Improved understanding and representation of these processes in models are key for increasing Earth system prediction skill, particularly for subseasonal to decadal time scales. Our understanding and ability to model these processes within this coupled system is presently inadequate due in large part to a lack of data: contemporaneous long-term observations from the top of the marine atmospheric boundary layer (MABL) to the base of the oceanic mixing layer.
   We propose the concept of "Super Sites" to provide multi-year suites of measurements at specific locations to simultaneously characterize physical and biogeochemical processes within the coupled boundary layers at high spatial and temporal resolution. Measurements will be made from floating platforms, buoys, towers, and autonomous vehicles, utilizing both in-situ and remote sensors. The engineering challenges and level of coordination, integration, and interoperability required to develop these coupled ocean-atmosphere Super Sites place them in an "Ocean Shot" class.

ID FIDUCIAL MARKERS
AB The ArUco marker is one of the most popular squared fiducial markers using for precise location acquisition during autonomous unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) landings. This paper presents a novel method to detect, recognize, and extract the location points of single ArUco marker based on convolutional neural networks (CNN). YOLOv3 and YOLOv4 networks are applied for end-to-end detection and recognition of ArUco markers under occlusion. A custom lightweight network is employed to increase the processing speed. The bounding box regression mechanism of the YOLO algorithm is modified to locate four corners of each ArUco marker and classify markers irrespective of the orientation. The deep-learning method achieves a high mean average precision exceeding 0.9 in the coverless test set and over 0.4 under corner coverage, whereas traditional algorithm fails under the occlusion condition. The custom lightweight network notably speeds up the prediction process with acceptable decline in performance. The proposed bounding box regression mechanism can locate marker corners with less than 3% average distance error for each corner without coverage and less than 8% average distance error under corner occlusion.

AB The cross-aisles shuttle-based storage/retrieval system has not only storage function but also the sorting function and makes full use of warehouse space to achieve high-density storage. It uses "part-to-picker" order picking mode to respond quickly to orders and shorten sorting time. In this paper, through the analysis of the system, an effective evaluation method for the efficiency and time of system picking under a single instruction operation cycle is presented. The objective function of system minimum cost under the condition of satisfying customer's demand is constructed. The objective function is solved by an improved particle swarm algorithm based on the optimized initial particle swarm optimization. By optimizing, we can find the optimal configuration of the system (i.e., the number of tiers, number of aisles and number of bays, number of picking stations, and number of lifts with minimal system cost). Finally, the impact of different configurations on system performance is summarized. This method can guide the design planner to design a more reasonable system under minimum cost control.

ID REGRESSION
AB The continuous orientation estimation of a moving pedestrian is a crucial issue in autonomous driving that requires the detection of a pedestrian intending to cross a road. It is still a challenging task owing to several reasons, including the diversity of pedestrian appearances, the subtle pose difference between adjacent orientations, and similar poses with different orientations such as axisymmetric orientations. These problems render the task highly difficult. Recent studies involving convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have attempted to solve these problems. However, their performance is still far from satisfactory for application in intelligent vehicles. In this paper, we propose a CNN-based two-stream network for continuous orientation estimation. The network can learn representations based on the spatial co-occurrence of visual patterns among pedestrians. To boost estimation performance, we applied a coarse-to-fine learning approach that consists of two learning stages. We investigated continuous orientation performance on the TUD Multiview Pedestrian dataset and the KITTI dataset and compared them with the state-of-the-art methods. The results show that our method outperforms other existing methods.

AB The necessity of achieving high streaming quality requires to combine the benefits of cloud computing with the verticals of a content delivery network into a robust, reliable, flexible and fault-tolerant system. This paper presents a solution for data acquisition, processing and Internet-enabled distribution of multimedia content. The objective is to propose an elastic content gathering network which handles media files delivered, for instance, by unmanned aerial vehicles, being further served on-demand to end users scattered over the globe. We have implemented the framework architecture, the system components with their attached responsibilities and capabilities, evaluating the performance based on the extensive simulations. The designed framework has been validated in terms of ensured correctness. Experimental results have proven the proper behavior of the built system by handling both types of requests, as for the storage of massive incoming data sets and for distributing content through multiple employed servers strategically placed in the proximity of the initiated requests' locations. Furthermore, once an autonomous and scalable network has been successfully designed, the number of required surrogate servers dynamically adjusts to consume the multimedia services in a cost-efficient manner.

AB A traffic light recognition system is a very important building block in an advanced driving assistance system and an autonomous vehicle system. In this paper, we propose a two-staged deep-learning-based traffic light recognition method that consists of a pixel-wise semantic segmentation technique and a novel fully convolutional network. For candidate detection, we employ a binary-semantic segmentation network that is suitable for detecting small objects such as traffic lights. Connected components labeling with an eight-connected neighborhood is applied to obtain bounding boxes of candidate regions, instead of the computationally demanding region proposal and regression processes of conventional methods. A fully convolutional network including a convolution layer with three filters of (1 x 1) at the beginning is designed and implemented for traffic light classification, as traffic lights have only a set number of colors. The simulation results show that the proposed traffic light recognition method outperforms the conventional two-staged object detection method in terms of recognition performance, and remarkably reduces the computational complexity and hardware requirements. This framework can be a useful network design guideline for the detection and recognition of small objects, including traffic lights.

AB This paper presents cooperative control of autonomous mobile robots to monitor and track dynamic pollutant plume propagation in m-dimensional space. The dynamics of the pollutant plume is modeled by an advection-diffusion partial differential equation (PDE), and the plume front is described by a level set with a prespecified threshold value. We solve the problem of cooperative plume tracking using two cooperating robots under formation control, one is assigned as the sensing robot and the other is assigned as the tracking robot, where the sensing robot estimates the gradient and divergence information of the entire field based on its current concentration measurement, and the tracking robot tracks the plume front and patrols on it. Rigorous convergence analysis is provided using the set stability concept. Numerical simulations of pollutant plume tracking in both two- and three-dimensional spaces demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed control scheme. This paper extends existing literature from static-level curve tracking to dynamic plume front tracking and presents a PDE-observer-based plume front tracking control design. The results are applicable to emerging environmental monitoring tasks by cooperative robots.

AB Video scene understanding is leading to an increased research investment in developing artificial intelligence technologies, pattern recognition, and computer vision, especially with the advance in sensor technologies. Developing autonomous unmanned vehicles, able to recognize not just targets appearing in a scene but a complete scene the targets are involved in (describing events, actions, situations, etc.) is becoming crucial in the recent advanced intelligent surveillance systems. At the same time, besides these consolidated technologies, the Semantic Web Technologies are also emerging, yielding seamless support to the high-level understanding of the scenes. To this purpose, the paper proposes a systematic ontology modeling to support and improve video content analysis, by generating a comprehensive high-level scene description, achieved by semantic reasoning and querying. The ontology schema comes from as an integration of new and existing ontologies and provides some design pattern guideline to get a high-level description of a whole scenario. It starts from the description of basic targets in the video scenario, thanks to the support of video tracking algorithms and target classification; then provides a higher level interpretation, compounding event-driven target interactions (for local activity comprehension), to reach gradually an abstraction high level that enables a concise and complete scenario description.

AB Considering the sailing characteristics and difficult maneuverability of hovercraft, the three degree-of-freedom (DOF) mathematical model cannot describe effectively the motion of hovercraft. Therefore, a mathematical model of four-DOF motion of hovercraft is established. This paper addresses the trajectory tracking problem of the hovercraft with finite-time convergence to equilibrium point, model uncertainty, external disturbance and drift angle constraint based on the four-DOF model. A novel robust tracking controller is proposed by combining finite-time observer with adaptive sliding mode control to solve the problem of the finite-time convergence and handle approximation error. In order to ensure the safe navigation of the hovercraft, a safety constraint auxiliary system is designed to restrain the drift angle in real time. Furthermore, a finite-time observer is designed to estimate and compensate model uncertainties and external disturbances. We show that under the proposed control scheme, all tracking errors can converge to zero in finite time, the drift angle can be constrained in real time and all closed-loop signals are guaranteed to be bounded. Finally, the numerical simulation results show the effectiveness of the proposed method.

AB The Radio Aurora Explorer (RAX) is a triple CubeSat that launched on November 19, 2010. RAX was designed to study plasma irregularities in the polar lower ionosphere (80-300 km), and is the first CubeSat mission funded by the United States National Science Foundation. The scientific mission requires attitude knowledge within 5 degrees (1-sigma), and a custom attitude determination subsystem was developed for the mission. The subsystem utilizes rate gyros, magnetometers, coarse sun sensors, and an extended Kalman filter, and was designed to be a simple, low cost solution to meet the attitude determination requirements. In this paper, we describe the design, implementation, and testing of the RAX attitude determination subsystem, including derivation of the determination requirements, sensor selection, the integrated hardware design, preflight sensor calibration, and attitude estimation algorithms. The paper is meant to serve as a resource for others in the small satellite and nanosatellite communities, as well as a critical reference for those analyzing RAX data. Lessons learned from the design and performance of the RAX determination subsystem will be used in future designs of attitude determination systems for small satellites and similar platforms, such as high altitude balloons and autonomous aerial vehicles.

AB An approach is presented for estimating future travel times on a freeway using flow and occupancy data from single-loop detectors and historical travel-time information. Linear regression, with the stepwise-variable-selection method and more advanced tree-based methods, is used. The analysis considers forecasts ranging from a few minutes into the future up to an hour ahead. Leave-a-day-out cross-validation was used to evaluate the prediction errors without underestimation. The current traffic state proved to be a good predictor for the near future, up to 20 min, whereas historical data are more informative for longer-range predictions, Tree-based methods and linear regression both performed satisfactorily, showing slightly different qualitative behaviors for each condition examined in this analysis. Unlike preceding works that rely on simulation, real traffic data were used. Although the current implementation uses measured travel times from probe vehicles, the ultimate goal is an autonomous system that relies strictly on detector data. In the course of presenting the prediction system, the manner in which travel times change from day to day was examined, and several metrics to quantify these changes were developed. The metrics can be used as input for travel-time prediction, but they also should be beneficial for other applications, such as calibrating traffic models and planning models.

AB The exploration of oceans using autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) is necessary for activities, such as the sustainable management of fishery resources, extraction of seafloor minerals and energy resources, and inspection of underwater infrastructure. As the next step in ocean exploration, AUVs are expected to employ end-effectors to make physical contact with seafloor creatures and materials. We propose a scenario for realizing a sampling mission using an AUV that is equipped to sample marine life. In this scenario, the sampling AUV observes the seafloor while concurrently transmitting the observed images to a surface vessel for inspection by the AUV operators. If the received images show an object of interest, the object is selected as a candidate of sampling target by the operators, who send a sampling command to the AUV. After receiving the command, the AUV returns to the target area and attempts to sample it. In this paper, we propose a system for transmitting images of the seafloor as part of the sampling-mission scenario. The proposed image transmission system includes a process for enhancing images of the deep seafloor, a process for selecting interesting images, and processes for compressing and reconstructing images. The image enhancement process resolves imaging problems resulting from light attenuation, such as color attenuation and uneven illumination. The process for selecting interesting images selects those that contain interesting objects, such as marine life. The selection process prevents the transmission of meaningless images that contain only flat sand on the seafloor. The proposed image compression method, which is based on color depth compression, reduces the amount of data. The combined process of selecting an interesting image and compressing it reduces various problems in acoustic communication, such as low information density and data loss. Instead of an overall image, part of an overall image is transmitted by a set of data packet, and each received data packet is reconstructed onboard the vessel. Because of image compression, the colors of a reconstructed image differ from those of an enhanced image. However, the reconstructed image contains similar colors, and the structural similarity index was found to be 91.4% by evaluating images that were subjected to a 4-b color compression. The proposed image transmission system was tested in the Sea of Okhotsk, and these tests were performed four times in different sea areas (minimum depth 380 m, maximum depth 590 m). The results show that the size of the data for a single image was reduced by a factor of 18 using the proposed image compression process, with each image taking 3.7 s to be transmitted via an acoustic modem (20 kb/s). Of the automatically selected images, 63% contained marine life, and the total transmission success rate was 22%.

DE Semantics; Semantic scene understanding; deep learning methods
AB Scene understanding is crucial for autonomous systems to reliably navigate in the real world. Panoptic segmentation of 3D LiDAR scans allows us to semantically describe a vehicle's environment by predicting semantic classes for each 3D point and to identify individual instances through different instance IDs. To describe the dynamics of the surroundings, 4D panoptic segmentation further extends this information with temporarily consistent instance IDs to identify the different instances in the scans consistently over whole sequences. Previous approaches for 4D panoptic segmentation rely on post-processing steps and are often not end-to-end trainable. In this paper, we propose a novel approach that can be trained end-to-end and directly predicts a set of non-overlapping masks along with their semantic classes and instance IDs that are consistent over time without any post-processing like clustering or associations between predictions. We extend a mask-based 3D panoptic segmentation model to 4D by reusing queries that decoded instances in previous scans. This way, each query decodes the same instance over time, carries its ID and the tracking is performed implicitly. This enables us to jointly optimize segmentation and tracking and directly supervise for 4D panoptic segmentation.

AB For an autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) underwater localization system based on acoustic two-way travel time measurements, the motion of the AUV during the interrogation-reception time interval, unknown underwater sound velocity, and beacon calibration error affect the performance of the positioning solution. Ignoring these factors significantly deteriorates the performance of the localization system. This paper focuses on the localization problem of AUV in motion with an unknown sound velocity and beacon calibration error. The Cramer-Rao lower bound of the concerned localization problem is first derived as the performance bound of an unbiased estimator. Next, through multi-stage processing, we design a closed-form solution that can attain the corresponding performance bound under small measurement noise conditions. Furthermore, considering that the AUV motion velocity is typically much lower than the sound velocity in practical applications, a simpler and more efficient simplified closed-form solution is proposed, which can guarantee localization performance under the condition that the AUV motion speed is low, as well as small measurement noise. Finally, the theoretical performance and superiority of the proposed solutions were verified through numerical simulation.

AB Underwater target detection is the foundation and guarantee for the autonomous operation of underwater vehicles and is one of the key technologies in marine exploration. Due to the complex and special underwater environment, the detection effect is poor, and the detection precision is not high. In this paper, YOLOv5 (You Only Look Once v5) is used as the overall structural framework of the target detection algorithm, and improvement is made on the basis of its detection precision in the underwater environment. Specifically, an attention mechanism (Channel and Spatial Fusion Attention, CSFA) that fuses the channel attention and spatial attention is proposed and added to the YOLOv5 network framework, enabling the network to focus on both the prominent features of the detected object and the spatial information of the detected object. The proposed method was tested on the underwater target detection dataset provided by the China Underwater Robot Professional Competition. The experimental detection precision (P) reached 85%, the recall (R) reached 82.2%, and the mean average precision (mAP) reached 87.5%. The effectiveness of the proposed method was verified, and its underwater target detection performance was better than that of ordinary models.

AB Polarization can provide information largely uncorrelated with the spectrum and intensity. Therefore, polarimetric imaging (PI) techniques have significant advantages in many fields, e.g., ocean observation, remote sensing (RS), biomedical diagnosis, and autonomous vehicles. Recently, with the increasing amount of data and the rapid development of physical models, deep learning (DL) and its related technique have become an irreplaceable solution for solving various tasks and breaking the limitations of traditional methods. PI and DL have been combined successfully to provide brand-new solutions to many practical applications. This review briefly introduces PI and DL's most relevant concepts and models. It then shows how DL has been applied for PI tasks, including image restoration, object detection, image fusion, scene classification, and resolution improvement. The review covers the state-of-the-art works combining PI with DL algorithms and recommends some potential future research directions. We hope that the present work will be helpful for researchers in the fields of both optical imaging and RS, and that it will stimulate more ideas in this exciting research field.

ID DIPOLE
AB Autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) with towed magnetic anomaly detection (MAD) system is a reliable technique for detecting underwater magnetic targets. However, arranging too many magnetometers in the towed MAD system is not suitable, and the key lies in their reasonable arrangement. As a result, this letter proposes a new MAD system equipped with two scalar and one vector magnetometers, along with the corresponding multiparameter magnetic target localization method. By using two scalar magnetometers and the geometric relationship with vector magnetometer, the time when the vector magnetometer reaches the closest point approach (CPA) on the trajectory and the value range of the shortest distance are obtained. The value range of the shortest distance is cleverly set as the search boundary for the improved particle swarm optimization algorithm in this dimension, which greatly mitigates the randomness of the optimization algorithm and enhances the accuracy of the solution. Subsequently, the unique solution for the magnetic target parameters can be easily obtained by using the vector magnetometer. The combination of scalar and vector magnetometers proves to be both economical and effective. Numerical simulation and field experiments show that this method provides a new idea for static magnetic target detection.

AB In the work, the path tracking control methods are developed for autonomous agricultural tractors sub-ject to wheel slip constraints by using second-order sliding mode (SOSM) and finite-time disturbance observer (FDOB) techniques. First of all, the path tracking error dynamics derived from the kinematic model is given and applied to controller design. In order to deal with the inevitable chattering problem existing in the conventional first-order sliding mode (FOSM) controller, a SOSM controller is constructed by regarding the controller derivative as the new control law, which means that the practical control law can be seen as an integration of the SOSM controller. Through a combination of the FDOB and the designed SOSM controller, the composite path tracking controller is further constructed to avoid high control gains in the designed SOSM controller. The strict Lyapunov stability analysis is carried out to ensure that the sliding variable can be finite-time stabilized to the origin under the proposed control algorithms. Finally, the comparative simulation results confirm that the developed guidance laws can achieve good tracking performance and strong robustness even in the presence of slipping effects.(c) 2022 ISA.

AB Path planning is not only the premise of underwater navigation and obstacle avoidance, but also the core and key to improve the operation durability for the bionic robotic fish. In this paper, the path length, smoothness and safety factor are selected as the optimization performance indexes. In order to solve the path planning with ocean currents and moving obstacles, a two-level optimization algorithm is proposed for the bionic robotic fish. In the first level of optimization, it solves the global path planning problem with known environment. In the second level of optimization, based on the optimization results of the first level of optimization, the local optimal path is obtained by the dynamic optimization method in the environment with unknown static and moving obstacles, which can solve the problem of obstacle avoidance for irregular obstacles effectively. The two-level optimization algorithm improves the accuracy of the path planning. Fuzzy adaptive genetic algorithm (FAGA) is given to further improve the optimization performance. The proposed algorithm can improve the optimization perfor-mance of the path planning, whose effectiveness is demonstrated by the simulation and experiment results.

AB This paper highlights the extent to which a future mobility system dominated by Connected and Autonomous Vehicles (CAVs) poses profound challenges to the 'publicness' of the transport and mobility systems of many cities. This is evident at different policy levels: the regulatory posture of governments, changing notions of the contributions of mobility to wider 'public value', and the underpinning shared experiences of urban life and citizenship or civitas. There is relatively little discussion of how widespread automation might reduce the 'publicness' of transport systems in terms of the range of mobility opportunities they offer, how changing patterns of mobility across neighbourhoods and social groups will contribute to urban restructuring, and the implications of this for public value and the character or civitas of cities. In particular, we note how the huge expansion in mobility choices made possible by CAVs might lead to circumstances in which the outcome of individuals exercising that choice is to change the nature of urban mobility profoundly. We identify a number of key challenges that policy makers will need to address in managing the introduction of CAVs in their cities, and how using the lens of 'publicness' might help them do so.

DE multi-spectral images; cross-modal feature fusion network; semantic
   segmentation; salient object detection
AB Multi-spectral semantic segmentation has shown great advantages under poor illumination conditions, especially for remote scene understanding of autonomous vehicles, since the thermal image can provide complementary information for RGB image. However, methods to fuse the information from RGB image and thermal image are still under-explored. In this paper, we propose a simple but effective module, add-multiply fusion (AMFuse) for RGB and thermal information fusion, consisting of two simple math operations-addition and multiplication. The addition operation focuses on extracting cross-modal complementary features, while the multiplication operation concentrates on the cross-modal common features. Moreover, the attention module and atrous spatial pyramid pooling (ASPP) modules are also incorporated into our proposed AMFuse modules, to enhance the multi-scale context information. Finally, in the UNet-style encoder-decoder framework, the ResNet model is adopted as the encoder. As for the decoder part, the multi-scale information obtained from our proposed AMFuse modules is hierarchically merged layer-by-layer to restore the feature map resolution for semantic segmentation. The experiments of RGBT multi-spectral semantic segmentation and salient object detection demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed AMFuse module for fusing the RGB and thermal information.

AB Among all aquatic species, mantas and rays swim by flapping their pectoral fins; this motion is similar to other fishes in terms of efficiency, but it gives better maneuverability and agility in turning. The fin's motion is featured by a traveling wave going opposite to the forward motion, producing a force thanks to momentum conservation. This article aims at understanding the swimming dynamics of rays, focusing on energy efficiency. A computational fluid dynamics (CFD) model of the swimming motion of a cownose ray has been implemented in openfoam, simulating the acceleration of the fish from still to the steady-state velocity using an overset mesh. In this analysis, the one degree-of-freedom dynamics of forward swimming is solved together with the fluid velocity and pressure. The effect of frequency and wavelength of fin motion on thrust, power, and velocity has been investigated and an analysis of the vortices in the wake showed has been performed. The energy efficiency of a self-propelled body has been defined in a novel way and it has been calculated for different motion conditions.

ID PERFORMANCE
AB Modern solid-state disks achieve high data transfer rates due to their massive internal parallelism. However, out-of-place updates for flash memory incur garbage collection costs when valid data needs to be copied during space reclamation. The root cause of this extra cost is that solid-state disks are not always able to accurately determine data lifetime and group together data that expires before the space needs to be reclaimed. Real-time systems found in autonomous vehicles, industrial control systems, and assembly-line robots store data from hundreds of sensors and often have predictable data lifetimes. These systems require guaranteed high storage bandwidth for read and write operations by mission-critical real-time tasks. In this article, we depart from the traditional block device interface to guarantee the high throughput needed to process large volumes of data. Using data lifetime information from the application layer, our proposed real-time design, called Telomere, is able to intelligently lay out data in NAND flash memory and eliminate valid page copies during garbage collection. Telomere's real-time admission control is able to guarantee tasks their required read and write operations within their periods. Under randomly generated tasksets containing 500 tasks, Telomere achieves 30% higher throughput with a 5% storage cost compared to pre-existing techniques.

AB In recent years, for many offshore projects, including offshore oil and gas exploration and offshore wind farm construction, it is necessary to control the position of elevating of Jack-up Rig (JuR) in stable and balanced control. Designing the elevating control systems of JuR is an upcoming technology, which is extensively used in offshore drilling and other marine structures. To maintain the position of platforms from displacement, the jacking system is used automatically to control and stabilize the position of the JuR in sea state disturbances. In recent years, the theory of modern control has been studied and developed in terms of robustness and stability to achieve greater accuracy and reduce the movement of the platform caused by environmental disturbance and other affecting factors. This paper presents a state-of-the-art review of approaches for JuR control strategies and architectures. In addition, it recommends possible control principles and makes a matching between the advantages and disadvantages of existing literature. Some details for future research on control challenges are discussed in this paper.

AB Accurately detecting a potential collision and triggering a timely escape response is critical in the field of robotics and autonomous vehicle safety. The lobula giant movement detector (LGMD) neuron in locusts can detect an approaching object and prevent collisions within a swarm of millions of locusts. This single neuronal cell performs nonlinear mathematical operations on visual stimuli to elicit an escape response with minimal energy expenditure. Collision avoidance models based on image processing algorithms have been implemented using analogue very-large-scale-integration designs, but none is as efficient as this neuron in terms of energy consumption or size. Here we report a nanoscale collision detector that mimics the escape response of the LGMD neuron. The detector comprises a monolayer molybdenum disulfide photodetector stacked on top of a non-volatile and programmable floating-gate memory architecture. It consumes a small amount of energy (in the range of nanojoules) and has a small device footprint (similar to 1 mu m x 5 mu m).
   By integrating a MoS(2)photodetector with a floating-gate memory device, a nanoscale collision detector can be created that mimics the escape response of the lobula giant movement detector neuron.

DE AUV-based localization; Underwater Sensor Networks; Self-adaptation;

ID MAXIMIZED COVERAGE
AB In this paper, we propose a Self-adaptive AUV-based Localization (SEAL) scheme, which is specifically designed to provide network-wide localization service to sensor nodes in sparsely deployed Underwater Sensor Networks (UWSN) using a high-speed Autonomous Underwater Vehicle (AUV). Even though the sparse nature of node deployment in UWSN is cost-effective, it creates a new challenge for the existing UWSN localization schemes. Moreover, due to the effect of passive node mobility owing to oceanic waves and currents, the network topology experiences partitioning. In such a sparse deployment scenario, the existing static anchor-based schemes of node localization exhibit low localization coverage, high localization error, and high message overhead. On the contrary, mobile anchor-based schemes are able to maintain low message overhead. However, these schemes achieve low localization coverage only or result in higher average energy consumption. In SEAL, we excogitate a simple and self-adaptive scheme, which empowers the AUV to select deployment-aware transmission range and maintain energy-efficiency. Simulations in NS-3 indicate that SEAL achieves significantly improved localization coverage while maintaining the energy-efficiency of the AUV when compared to the schemes from the existing literature that were considered as benchmarks in this study.

AB The trend toward autonomous driving and the recent advances in vehicular networking led to a number of very successful proposals in cooperative driving. Maneuvers can be coordinated among participating vehicles and controlled by means of wireless communications. One of the most challenging scenarios or applications in this context is cooperative adaptive cruise control (CACC) or platooning. When it comes to realizing safety gaps between the cars of less than 5 m, very strong requirements on the communication system need to be satisfied. The underlying distributed control system needs regular updates of sensor information from the other cars in the order of about 10 Hz. This leads to message rates in the order of up to 10 kHz for large networks, which, given the possibly unreliable wireless communication and the critical network congestion, is beyond the capabilities of current vehicular networking concepts. In this paper, we summarize the concepts of networked control systems and revisit the capabilities of current vehicular networking approaches. We then present opportunities of Tactile Internet concepts that integrate interdisciplinary approaches from control theory, mechanical engineering, and communication protocol design. This way, it becomes possible to solve the high reliability and latency issues in this context.

AB This paper proposes a hierarchical decision-making and control algorithm for the shepherd game, the seventh mission in the International Aerial Robotics Competition (IARC). In this game, the agent (a multirotor aerial robot) is required to contact targets (ground vehicles) sequentially and drive them to a certain boundary to earn score. During the game of 10 min, the agent should be fully autonomous without any human interference. Regarding the lower-level controller and dynamics of the agent, each action takes a duration of time to accomplish. Denoted as an action delay, in this paper, this action duration is nonconstant and is related to the final reward. Therefore, the challenging point is making the agent " aware of time" when applying a certain action. We solve this problem by two approaches: deep Q-networks and lookup table. The action delay predictor in the decision-level is fitted by a lower-level controller. Through simulations by the example of the shepherd game, the effectiveness and efficiency of this approach are validated. This paper helps our team winning the first prize in IARC 2017, and keeps the best record of this mission since it was released in 2013.

ID STRATEGY
AB With the rapid developments in edge devices and wireless technologies, the underwater wireless sensor networks (UWSNs) are in the process of vigorous development. In UWSNs, the traditional multi-hop data collection methods have some disadvantages such as high power consumption, severe unbalance in power consumption, and so on. In recent years, mobile edge elements (such as an autonomous underwater vehicle, AUV) are widely used in underwater data collection to solve energy consumption imbalance problems. However, the existing methods do not fully consider the efficient mobile edge computing and the real mobility model of AUV in the underwater environment. In this paper, we propose a data collection scheme based on a mobility model of mobile edge elements under water. In this model, the mobility direction and velocity are fully considered, which are close to the mobility characteristic of AUVs in the stable 3D environment. By using computing, storage, and mobility abilities of AUVs, a target selection algorithm is designed to calculate the mobility path of data collection for AUV. The theoretical analysis and experimental results show that the proposed method improves the efficiency of data collection, reduces the power consumption of nodes, and extends the network lifetime.

   (CQGA); steady error
AB Aiming to improve the performance of motion for autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV), a fractional-order PID strategy is proposed. It is a more generalized form for the conventional integer-order PID controller, keeping its simplicity and utilizing the generalized derivative and integral control actions. The fractional-order PID controller has been successfully applied to heading control, diving control and path-following system of AUV on sea trial. In addition, the fractional-order closed-loop system has proven to be stable. By comparing simulations and experiments, the satisfactory performance, such as overshoot, settling time and steady-state error, has been achieved. The cloud-model-based quantum genetic algorithm (CQGA) is employed to tune coefficients of fractional-order PID controller. The quantum bits and quantum superposition states avoid the pressure of selection and maintain the diversity of population in chromosome coding. Due to the randomness and stability tendency of cloud droplets, the cloud crossover operator and the cloud mutation operator can effectively overcome the shortcomings of premature and slow searching speed. Numerical simulations show that the CQGA is more efficient to find the optimal coefficients of fractionalorder PID controller than GA.

AB LiDAR and cameras have been broadly utilized in computer vision and autonomous vehicle applications. However, in order to convert data between the local coordinate systems, we must estimate the rigid body transformation between the sensors. In this paper, we propose a robust extrinsic calibration algorithm that can be implemented easily and has small calibration error. The extrinsic calibration parameters are estimated by minimizing the distance between corresponding features projected onto the image plane. The features are edge and centerline features on a v-shaped calibration target. The proposed algorithm contributes two ways to improve the calibration accuracy. First, we use different weights to distance between a point and a line feature according to the correspondence accuracy of the features. Second, we apply a penalizing function to exclude the influence of outliers in the calibration datasets. Additionally, based on our robust calibration approach for a single LiDAR-camera pair, we introduce a joint calibration that estimates the extrinsic parameters of multiple sensors at once by minimizing one objective function with loop closing constraints. We conduct several experiments to evaluate the performance of our extrinsic calibration algorithm. The experimental results show that our calibration method has better performance than the other approaches.

AB Agricultural field operations, such as harvesting for fruits and scouting for disease, are labor intensive and time consuming. With the recent push toward autonomous farming, a method to rapidly generate trajectories for a group of cooperative agricultural robots becomes necessary. The challenging aspect of solving this problem is to satisfy realistic constraints such as changing environments, actuation limitations, nonlinear heterogeneous dynamics, conflict resolution, and formation reconfigurations. In this paper, a hierarchical decision making and trajectory planning method is studied for a group of agricultural robots cooperatively conducting certain farming task such as citrus harvesting. Within the algorithm framework, there are two main parts (cooperative level and individual level): (1) in the cooperative level, once a discrete reconfiguration event is confirmed and replanning is triggered, all the possible formation configurations and associated robot locations for specific farming tasks will be evaluated and ranked according to the feasibility condition and the cooperative level performance index; and (2) in the individual level, a local pursuit (LP) strategy based cooperative trajectory planning algorithm is designed to generate local optimal cooperative trajectories for agricultural robots to achieve and maintain their desired operation formation in a decentralized manner. The capabilities of the proposed method are demonstrated in a citrus harvesting problem.

ID SEQUENCES; SYSTEM; OBJECT
AB This paper describes the results of an effort on the analysis of the performance of specific 'pose estimation' algorithms within a Machine Vision-based approach for the problem of aerial refuelling for unmanned aerial vehicles. The approach assumes the availability of a camera on the unmanned aircraft for acquiring images of the refuelling tanker; also, it assumes that a number of active or passive light sources - the 'markers' - are installed at specific known locations on the tanker. A sequence of machine vision algorithms on the on-board cornputer of the unmanned aircraft is tasked with the processing of the images of the tanker. Specifically, detection and labeling algorithms are used to detect and identify the markers and a 'pose estimation' algorithm is used to estimate the relative position and orientation between the two aircraft.
   Detailed closed-loop simulation studies have been performed to compare the performance of two 'pose estimation' algorithms within a simulation environment that was specifically developed for the study of aerial refuelling problems. Special emphasis is placed on the analysis of the required computational effort as well as on the accuracy and the error propagation characteristics of the two methods. The general trade offs involved in the selection of the pose estimation algorithm are discussed. Finally, simulation results are presented and analysed.

AB The swarm of small UAVs is an emerging technology that will enable abundant cooperative tasks. To tackle the positioning problem for the UAV swarm, cooperative localization (CL) has been intensively studied since it uses relative measurement to improve the positioning availability and accuracy for the swarm in GPS-denied environments. Besides relying on inter-UAV range measurement, traditional CL algorithms need to place anchors as location references, which limits their applicability. To implement an infrastructure-less swarm navigation system, a consumer-grade camera together with an inertial device can provide rich environment information, which can be recognized as a kind of local location reference. This paper aims to analyze the fundamental performance of visual-inertial-range CL, which is also a popular metric for UAV planning and sensing optimizing, especially for resource-limited environments. Specifically, a closed-form Fisher information matrix (FIM) of visual-inertial-range CL is constructed in RnxSO(n) manifold. By introducing an equivalent FIM and utilizing of the sparsity of the FIM, the performance of pose estimation can be efficiently calculated. A series of numerical simulations validate its effectiveness for analyzing the CL performance.

AB An increasing number of special-use and high-rise buildings have presented challenges for efficient evacuations, particularly in fire emergencies. At the same time, however, the use of autonomous vehicles within indoor environments has received only limited attention for emergency scenarios. To address these issues, we developed a method that classifies emergency symbols and determines their location on emergency floor plans. The method incorporates color filtering, clustering and object detection techniques to extract walls, which were used in combination to generate clean, digitized plans. By integrating the geometric and semantic data digitized with our method, existing building information modeling (BIM) based evacuation tools can be enhanced, improving their capabilities for path planning and decision making. We collected a dataset of 403 German emergency floor plans and created a synthetic dataset comprising 5000 plans. Both datasets were used to train two distinct faster region-based convolutional neural networks (Faster R-CNNs). The models were evaluated and compared using 83 floor plan images. The results show that the synthetic model outperformed the standard model for rare symbols, correctly identifying symbol classes that were not detected by the standard model. The presented framework offers a valuable tool for digitizing emergency floor plans and enhancing digital evacuation applications.

AB Despite the media reports and governments promoting tourism as a fundamental right for everyone, traveling is still not accessible for disabled people. This study has highlighted the need to make tourists with disabilities accessable for inaccessible destinations. Cyborg products in the form of technological implants can make tourists with disabilities accessable for inaccessible destinations. Since tourists with a mobility disability (TMD) will be one of the primary beneficiaries of technological implants, little is known about their acceptance of technological implants during traveling.Therefore, this study assesses the willingness of TMD to use technological implants during traveling through a qualitative research approach. The results from thematic analysis identified two main themes: the use of assistive devices during traveling with four sub-themes (freedom of traveling, physical and attitudinal barriers, cost, and additional assistance and battery issues), and drivers of impaired cyborg tourists with seven sub-themes (independence, improved well-being, convenience/ease of use, social inclusion, positive emotions, motivation, and other issues). The study contributed to the literature by introducing drivers of impaired cyborg tourists along with previously identified concepts. The results also provided implications for the stakeholders of the tourism industry.

AB To address the ever-growing connectivity demand in communications, the adoption of ingenious solutions, such as utilization of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) as mobile base stations, is imperative. In general, the location of a UAV base station (UAV-BS) is determined by optimization algorithms, which have high computationally complexities and are hard to run on UAVs due to energy consumption and time constraints. In this article, we overview the UAV-BS trajectory optimization problem for next generation wireless networks and show that a convolutional neural network (CNN) model can be trained to infer the location of a UAV-BS in real time. To this end, we create a framework to determine the UAV-BS locations considering the deployment of mobile users (MUs) to generate labels by using the data obtained from an optimization algorithm. Performance evaluations reveal that once the CNN model is trained with the given labels and locations of MUs, the proposed approach is, indeed, capable of approximating the results given by the adopted optimization algorithm with high fidelity, outperforming reinforcement learning-based approaches in resource-constrained settings. We also explore future research challenges and highlight key issues.

AB We present SEAN 2.0, an open-source system designed to advance social navigation via the training and benchmarking of navigation policies in varied social contexts. A key limitation of current social navigation research is that policies are often trained and evaluated considering only a few social contexts, which are fragmented across prior work. Inspired by work in psychology, we describe navigation context based on social situations, which encompass the robot task and environmental factors, and propose logic-based classifiers for five common examples. SEAN 2.0 allows a robot to experience these social situations via different methods for specifying and generating pedestrian motion, including a novel Behavior Graph method. Our experiments show that when data collected using the Behavior Graph method is used to learn a robot navigation policy, that policy outperforms others trained using alternative methods for pedestrian control. Also, social situations were found to be useful for understanding performance across social contexts. Other components of SEAN 2.0 include vision and depth sensors, several physical environments, different means of specifying robot tasks, and a range of evaluation metrics for social robot navigation. User feedback for SEAN 2.0 indicated that the system was "easier to navigate and more user friendly" than SEAN 1.0.

AB The cell cycle is the process by which eukaryotic cells replicate. Yeast cells cycle asynchronously with each cell in the population budding at a different time. Although there are several experimental approaches to synchronise cells, these usually work only in the short-term. Here, we build a cyber-genetic system to achieve long-term synchronisation of the cell population, by interfacing genetically modified yeast cells with a computer by means of microfluidics to dynamically change medium, and a microscope to estimate cell cycle phases of individual cells. The computer implements a controller algorithm to decide when, and for how long, to change the growth medium to synchronise the cell-cycle across the population. Our work builds upon solid theoretical foundations provided by Control Engineering. In addition to providing an avenue for yeast cell cycle synchronisation, our work shows that control engineering can be used to automatically steer complex biological processes towards desired behaviours similarly to what is currently done with robots and autonomous vehicles. It is difficult to synchronize the cell cycle in a population of yeast cells for extended periods of time. Here the authors use a cybergenetic system with inbuilt feedback to synchronize a population of modified yeast.

DE SLAM; aerial systems; perception and autonomy; low-latency localization
AB Real-time 6D pose estimation is a key component for autonomous indoor navigation of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs). This letter presents a low-latency LiDAR SLAM framework based on LiDAR scan slicing and concurrent matching, called LoLa-SLAM. Our framework uses sliced point cloud data from a rotating LiDAR in a concurrent multi-threaded matching pipeline for 6D pose estimation with high update rate and low latency. The LiDAR is actuated using a 2D Lissajous spinning pattern to overcome the sensor's limited FoV. We propose a two-dimensional roughness model to extract the feature points for fine matching and registration of the point cloud. In addition, the pose estimator engages a temporal motion predictor that assists in finding the feature correspondences in the map for the fast convergence of the non-linear optimizer. Subsequently, an Extended Kalman Filter (EKF) is adopted for final pose fusion. The framework is evaluated in multiple experiments by comparing the accuracy, latency, and the update rate of the pose estimation for the trajectories flown in an indoor environment. We quantify the superior quality of the generated volumetric map in comparison to the state-of-the-art frameworks. We further examine the localization precision using ground truth pose information recorded by a total station unit.

AB As an advanced machine vision task, traffic sign recognition is of great significance to the safe driving of autonomous vehicles. Haze has seriously affected the performance of traffic sign recognition. This paper proposes a dehazing network, including multi-scale residual blocks, which significantly affects the recognition of traffic signs in hazy weather. First, we introduce the idea of residual learning, design the end-to-end multi-scale feature information fusion method. Secondly, the study used subjective visual effects and objective evaluation metrics such as Visibility Index (VI) and Realness Index (RI) based on the characteristics of the real-world environment to compare various traditional dehazing and deep learning dehazing method with good performance. Finally, this paper combines image dehazing and traffic sign recognition, using the algorithm of this paper to dehaze the traffic sign images under real-world hazy weather. The experiments show that the algorithm in this paper can improve the performance of traffic sign recognition in hazy weather and fulfil the requirements of real-time image processing. It also proves the effectiveness of the reformulated atmospheric scattering model for the dehazing of traffic sign images.

AB In this article, we propose a nonlinear model based on hidden-layer neural networks and local Gaussian process regression. The hidden-layer neural networks have short training time, whereas the local Gaussian process regression is more suitable for nonlinearity. According to the abovementioned advantages of hidden-layer neural network and local Gaussian process regression, we get the measurement learning model and global process learning model offline and local process learning model online. Then, the proposed learning-based models have been applied to extended Kalman filter-simultaneous localization and mapping (EKF-SLAM), Rao-Blackwellised particle filter formulation of simultaneous localisation and mapping (FastSLAM), and unscented Kalman filter--simultaneous localization and mapping (UKF-SLAM) for autonomous underwater vehicles position tracking with field experiments. Compared with the conventional process and measurement models, improved position tracking performance can be achieved without cumbersome system analysis nor identification, benefiting from the proposed model. Experiments in more than 3883-m run show that the root-mean-square error has been improved by 36.95%, 37.14%, and 27.65% in EKF-SLAM, FastSLAM, and UKF-SLAM frameworks, respectively.

AB This article presents an algorithm for the detection of pedestrians in urban driving environments during the day. The main contribution is in the design of a new classifier to discriminate between the person and the background, under partial occlusion. To construct the classifier, the HOG (Histogram of Oriented Gradients) descriptor was used together with the SVM (Support Vector Machine) and IL (Logic Inference) algorithms. The input image has been divided into twelve regions, and for each of them the feature vector has been extracted and a classifier based on SVM has been built. With this design it is possible to capture the specific detail of each part of the human body, such as head, legs, arms and body. Subsequently, they have been joined in a final classifier using IL, in order to obtain an efficient algorithm to discriminate between partially occluded pedestrians and the background, in urban environments during the day.
   The experiments related to the classifier were developed on several public databases, in various degrees of partial occlusion; and the experiments linked to the detection were generated on the visual information obtained by the experimental platform ViiA, to validate the proposal under real driving conditions.

TI Hypervisor for consolidating real-time automotive control units: Its

DT Article
AB The future of automotive industry has a major focus on computing innovations such as autonomous driving, connectivity and mobility. These complex innovations integrate hardware and software components of different automotive safety integrity levels. Although standards like AUTOSAR provides flexibility in integrating different software components, it compromises on isolation from software interference. Virtualization is a technique, used for several decades in server domains, ensuring integration of heterogeneous subsystems without interference. Until recent years, inheriting virtualization onto real-time systems has been avoided due to its overhead and impact in-terms of timing behavior. With the usage of multi- and many-cores in the automotive industry, virtualization is gaining more importance to handle the upcoming innovations with incredible increased complexity and the needed computation power. This paper describes the technique for bringing virtualization into an automotive state-of-the-art multicore controller, which does not support virtualization. We have used two automotive state-of-the-art heterogeneous applications: engine electronic control unit and vehicle control unit, and a prototype version of hypervisor from ETAS-GmbH. Important aspects in virtualization like system-startup, handling of interrupts and traps, facilitating input-output access are discussed. Finally, the performance of a virtualized system in terms of core loading, interrupt and task timing parameters are evaluated and compared.

ID VISION; DRIFT; SLAM
AB There are two main challenges, drift and scale ambiguity, restricting monocular visual odometry from an extensive application on real autonomous navigation. In this paper, an iterative localization framework is presented to globally localize a mobile vehicle equipped with a single camera and a freely available digital map. Inspired by the concept of cloud, a new Gaussian-Gaussian Cloud model is proposed to give a unified representation of the measurement randomness and scale ambiguity in monocular visual odometry. In this model, a collection of cloud drops is generated. Both the drift and scale ambiguity are considered and represented simultaneously in each cloud drop. To reduce the measurement uncertainties of any drop in Gaussian-Gaussian Cloud, road constraints from the open source map-OpenStreetMap-are utilized. The map is first converted to a template edge map and a shape matching step is then implemented to assign the probability of each cloud drop, indicating to what degree the drop accords with road constraints. A parameter estimation scheme is used to narrow down the scale ambiguity of monocular visual odometry while resampling cloud drops. Evaluations on the KITTI benchmark data set and our self-collected data set have demonstrated the stability and accuracy of the proposed approach.

AB The aim of this paper is to present a cooperative simultaneous localization and mapping (CSLAM) solution based on a laser telemeter. The proposed solution gives the opportunity to a group of unmanned ground vehicles (UGVs) to construct a large map and localize themselves without any human intervention. Many solutions proposed to solve this problem, most of them are based on the sequential probabilistic approach, based around Extended Kalman Filter (EKF) or the Rao-Blackwellized particle filter. In our work, we propose a new alternative to avoid these limitations, a novel alternative solution based on the smooth variable structure filter (SVSF) to solve the UGV SLAM problem is proposed. This version of SVSF-SLAM algorithm uses a boundary layer width vector and does not require covariance derivation. The new algorithm has been developed to implement the SVSF filter for CSLAM. Our contribution deals with adapting the SVSF to solve the CSLAM problem for multiple UGVs. The algorithms developed in this work were implemented using a swarm of mobile robots Pioneer 3-AT. Two mapping approaches, point-based and line-based, are implemented and validated experimentally using 2D laser telemeter sensors. Good results are obtained by the Cooperative SVSF-SLAM algorithm compared with the Cooperative EKF-SLAM.

AB This paper presents two families of motion primitives for enabling fast, agile flight through a dense obstacle field. The first family of primitives consists of a time-delay dependent 3D circular path between two points in space and the control inputs required to fly the path. In particular, the control inputs are calculated using algebraic equations which depend on the flight parameters and the location of the waypoint. Moreover, the transition between successive maneuver states, where each state is defined by a unique combination of constant control inputs, is modeled rigorously as an instantaneous switch between the two maneuver states following a time delay which is directly related to the agility of the robotic aircraft. The second family consists of aggressive turn-around (ATA) maneuvers which the robot uses to retreat from impenetrable pockets of obstacles. The ATA maneuver consists of an orchestrated sequence of three sets of constant control inputs. The duration of the first segment is used to optimize the ATA for the spatial constraints imposed by the turning volume. The motion primitives are validated experimentally and implemented in a simulated receding horizon control (RHC)-based motion planner. The paper concludes with inverse-design pointers derived from the primitives.

DT Article

ID SYSTEM; FUTURE; MODEL
AB The active hybridization technique provides an effective approach to combining the best properties of a heterogeneous set of power sources to achieve higher energy density, power density and fuel efficiency. Active hybrid power sources can be used to power hybrid electric vehicles with selected combinations of internal combustion engines, fuel cells, batteries, and/or supercapacitors. They can be deployed in all-electric ships to build a distributed electric power system. They can also be used in a bulk power system to construct an autonomous distributed energy system. An important aspect in designing an active hybrid power source is to find a suitable control strategy that can manage the active power sharing and take advantage of the inherent scalability and robustness benefits of the hybrid system. This paper presents an agent-based power sharing scheme for active hybrid power sources. To demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed agent-based power sharing scheme, simulation studies are performed for a hybrid power source that can be used in a solar car as the main propulsion power module. Simulation results clearly indicate that the agent-based control framework is effective to coordinate the various energy sources and manage the power/voltage profiles. (c) 2007 Elsevier B.V.

AB This paper describes an application of the empirical modeling of natural natural phenomena to the optimal self-control of an autonomous system in a chaotic environment. The system consists of a network of sensors, a modeler a controller, a plant, and a utility estimator. The modeler contains a self-organizing neural network and a conditional average estimator An empirical model, which incorporates the influences from the environment, the system response and the utility, is formed in the modeler during training, The sensors provide signals representing the joint state of the environment and the system, while the utility estimator transforms these signals into a utility signal. A vector comprising the joint state, the control, and the utility variable is then utilized in a self-organized adaptation of prototype vectors. During adaptation, samples of the control variable are generated either randomly or by a reinforcement procedure, while during application the optimal control variable is estimated by a conditional average taken over the prototype vectors. The control variable drives the plant, and improves its performance. The method is demonstrated, using as examples the optimal selection of cutting depth in a chaotic manufacturing process, the self-stabilization of a randomly influenced system, and reversing a vehicle.

AB Time-optimal trajectory planning aims to minimize the traversal time of arbitrary geometric paths. The demand for real-time planning widely exists in robotics, numerical control manufacturing, and autonomous vehicle applications. Existing trajectory planning methods either compromise on time optimality to improve computational efficiency or suffer from at least linear time complexity, preventing the planning of long trajectories in real time. Motivated by these challenges, this article proposes a novel set invariant trajectory planning (SITP) method to address the problem of real-time time-optimal planning for continuous multiaxis trajectories under complete second-order kinodynamic constraints. First, a backup control strategy is synthesized to construct an implicit control invariant set (CIS). This set is designed so that a feasible control input always exists to keep the system within the defined kinodynamic bounds. Then, utilizing the principles of bang-bang control theory, the optimal control is sought within the CIS. A local greedy linear programming method is proposed to calculate the time-optimal trajectory at each control cycle. The proposed method is computationally efficient for even 1-kHz real-time applications and the planned results maintain strict global time optimality, which makes it promising in real-time planning scenarios of various automatic applications.

AB This paper aims to study the Nash equilibrium (NE) seeking algorithm of noncooperative game with second-order system under strongly connected digraph. In the algorithm, velocity information is not directly accessible to players, in order to avoid the need for additional velocity observers. Meanwhile, for position information, the position estimation of all the other players under local communication is completed in fixed time. To address the aforementioned concern, a NE seeking algorithm with a two-time-scale structure is designed. (1) For reduced system, a second-order velocity estimation model based on state observer is introduced to avoid direct acquisition of velocity information; (2) For fast compensation mechanism, each player uses leader-following consensus protocol to estimate the position of all the other players. The fixed-time consensus protocol is utilized to ensure that the position is estimated in fixed time. Then, aiming to reduce the communication costs and communication burden among players, the event-triggered mechanism is introduced into the above algorithm, and Zeno behavior is excluded. Lastly, a self-organized network problem involving autonomous vehicles is presented to validate the efficacy of the proposed theoretical results.

AB The Underwater Internet of Things (UIoT) has emerged as one of the prominent technologies in the development of future ocean monitoring systems, where mobile edge elements (such as autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs)) provide a promising method for the data collection from sensor nodes. However, as an important part of the UIoT, underwater wireless sensor networks (UWSNs) are severely affected by the underwater dynamic environment. For instance, node locations change continuously, which significantly increases the difficulty of data collection. To solve this problem, the concept of an inevitable communication space (ICS) is proposed. The ICS is calculated by analyzing the variation in the position of nodes and the communication range. Furthermore, an ICS-based dynamic data collection algorithm (ICS-DDCA) for UIoT is proposed to collect underwater data. This method utilizes the ICS instead of the initial location of the node for data collection to further improve the performance of the algorithm and shorten the data collection time. The simulation results demonstrate that compared with the energy-efficient data collection over AUV-assisted (EEDA) and data collection algorithms based on probabilistic neighborhood (PNCS-GHA), ICS-DDCA can effectively reduce the collection time, while ensuring the full completion of data collection.

AB The wireless power transmission (WPT) of an autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) tends to have non-negligible eddy current loss with increasing frequency or coil current due to the conductivity of seawater. In this paper, the inductor-capacitor-capacitor and parallel (LCC-P) topology and the magnetic coupler with an H-shaped receiver structure are chosen to achieve a compact system on the receiving side. The conditions for constant current output of the LCC-P topology are analyzed based on the cascaded circuit analysis method. The traditional parameter design method does not consider the influence of eddy current loss on the system circuit model, by introducing the equivalent eddy current loss resistance at both the transmitting side and receiving side, a modified circuit model of the WPT system in the seawater condition was obtained. Afterward, a nonlinear programming model with the optimal efficiency of the constant current mode as the objective function is established, and the genetic algorithm is used to obtain the optimal system parameters. An underwater AUV-WPT prototype was built and the finite element simulation and experimental results verified the theoretical analysis.

AB To solve the problem of orchard environmental perception, a 2D LiDAR sensor was used to scan fruit trees on both sides of a test platform to obtain their position. Firstly, the two-dimensional iterative closest point (2D-ICP) algorithm was used to obtain the complete point cloud data of fruit trees on both sides. Then, combining the lightning connection algorithm (LAPO) and the density-based clustering algorithm (DBSCAN), a fruit tree detection method based on density-based lightning connection clustering (LAPO-DBSCAN) was proposed. After obtaining the point cloud data of fruit trees on both sides of the test platform using the 2D-ICP algorithm, the LAPO-DBSCAN algorithm was used to obtain the position of fruit trees. The experimental results show that the positive detection rate was 96.69%, the false detection rate was 3.31%, and the average processing time was 1.14 s, verifying the reliability of the algorithm. Therefore, this algorithm can be used to accurately find the position of fruit trees, meaning that it can be applied to orchard navigation in a later stage.

TI Crash test-based assessment of injury risks for adults and children when
   colliding with personal mobility devices and service robots
SO SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
LA English
DT Article
AB Autonomous mobility devices such as transport, cleaning, and delivery robots, hold a massive economic and social benefit. However, their deployment should not endanger bystanders, particularly vulnerable populations such as children and older adults who are inherently smaller and fragile. This study compared the risks faced by different pedestrian categories and determined risks through crash testing involving a service robot hitting an adult and a child dummy. Results of collisions at 3.1 m/s (11.1 km/h/6.9 mph) showed risks of serious head (14%), neck (20%), and chest (50%) injuries in children, and tibia fracture (33%) in adults. Furthermore, secondary impact analysis resulted in both populations at risk of severe head injuries, namely, from falling to the ground. Our data and simulations show mitigation strategies for reducing impact injury risks below 5% by either lowering the differential speed at impact below 1.5 m/s (5.4 km/h/3.3 mph) or through the usage of absorbent materials. The results presented herein may influence the design of controllers, sensing awareness, and assessment methods for robots and small vehicles standardization, as well as, policymaking and regulations for the speed, design, and usage of these devices in populated areas.

ID VISION
AB Optical flow is a crucial component of the feature space for early visual processing of dynamic scenes especially in new applications such as self-driving vehicles, drones and autonomous robots. The dynamic vision sensors are well suited for such applications because of their asynchronous, sparse and temporally precise representation of the visual dynamics. Many algorithms proposed for computing visual flow for these sensors suffer from the aperture problem as the direction of the estimated flow is governed by the curvature of the object rather than the true motion direction. Some methods that do overcome this problem by temporal windowing under-utilize the true precise temporal nature of the dynamic sensors. In this paper, we propose a novel multi-scale plane fitting based visual flow algorithm that is robust to the aperture problem and also computationally fast and efficient. Our algorithm performs well in many scenarios ranging from fixed camera recording simple geometric shapes to real world scenarios such as camera mounted on a moving car and can successfully perform event-by-event motion estimation of objects in the scene to allow for predictions of upto 500 ms i.e., equivalent to 10 to 25 frames with traditional cameras.

AB Modern Underwater Wireless Sensor Networks (UWSN) would provide big administrations with numerous underwater surveying and technical applications, working in the unstable submerged deep-water conditions. A huge obstacle in these networks is the lifetime limit. The submerged correspondence frameworks mostly employ acoustic communication today. Acoustic interchange communication offers longer ranges that are yet limited by three variables: restricted and subordinate data transmission, time-differing multi-way engendering and low speed of sound. In this paper, an AUV (Autonomous Underwater Vehicle)-assisted acoustic correspondence convention, specifically Energy Efficiency Maximization Algorithm (EEMA) has been proposed to minimize the energy consumption. Underwater sensor networks depend on the hub ceaseless operation, the restricted correspondence transmission capacity and the hub lifetime, which entails difficulties in the operation of USWN. The proposed system will enhance the lifetime by lessening the number of bounces amid sensor transmissions, which fundamentally lessens time utilization and lifetime. Dynamic AUV ways and dynamic gateway assignments will enhance lifetime - proficiency balance proportion in the submerged system. To decrease the system energy utilization with an acceptable conveyance proportion is recommended. The Experimental results show that the proposed methodology has improved the level of energy compared with related techniques.

AB Exotic pests can cause US$1.4 trillion financial damage per year and threaten food security. Biological control is a natural phenomenon that regulates the number of plants and animals by means of natural enemies. The use of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV) as a support platform for biological control is promising, since it can reduce operating costs and transposition of natural barriers, such as rivers and venomous animals. However, capsules with natural enemies are spread by a remotely piloted UAV and autonomous UAVs in a zigzag pattern, which incur low coverage efficiency and cannot cover areas of any shape. This article proposes an algorithm that calculates capsule deposition sites of areas of any shape. In the most complex situation, the algorithm showed 1.54% more of effectively covered area, 9.54% higher coverage efficiency, and 104.88% lower inefficiency, guaranteed 7.16% protection of the edge region, and required 13.56% of released capsules. Therefore, UAVs can be used for an efficient distribution of capsules for biological control in areas of any shape. Their main impacts are potential cost savings by the release of fewer capsules and better coverage of the border of the crop field.

AB On 30 September 2017, an Air France Airbus A380-800 suffered a failure of its fourth engine while over Greenland. This failure resulted in the loss of the engine fan hub, fan blades and surrounding structure. An initial search recovered 30 pieces of light debris, but the primary part of interest, a 220 kg titanium fan hub, was not recovered because it had a different fall trajectory than the light debris, impacted into the ice-sheet's snow surface, and was quickly covered by drifting snow. Here we describe the methods used for the detection of the fan hub and details of the field campaigns. The search area included two crevasse fields of at least 50 snow-covered crevasses 1 to 30 m wide with similar snow bridge thicknesses. After 21 months and six campaigns, using airborne synthetic aperture radar, ground-penetrating radar, transient electromagnetics and an autonomous vehicle to survey the crevasse fields, the fan hub was found within 1 m of a crevasse at a depth of 3.3 to 4 m and was excavated with shovels, chain saws, an electric winch, sleds and a gasoline heater, by workers using fall-arrest systems.

AB The underwate communication is of great interest of research for many researchers because of increased dealings of human beings with world exists underwater. Underwater Commucation Technology (UCT) is becoming an important part of communication technologies. These include communication between divers, ships, and network system for autonomous underwater vehicles. However, optical communication with underwater exchange of information is challenged with many issues. In this paper, the attenuation for optical transmission is obervsed for optical waves that are absorbing inside water, in result, suspending particles and planktons produces optical scattering indirectly. In connection, underwater needs to rectify high attenuation regions for analysing ocean composition affects in Deep Ocean. This produces chlorophyll profiles that identify the attenuation in underwater communication.with high attenuation. In past studies, the constant attenuation is observed irrespective of depth of occean. Furthemore, the paper address, optical attenuation for underwater communication via depth dependent. The system is tested for 400-700 nm and 0-250 m depth for chlorophyll concentration profile (S1-S9). The system is demonstrated via GUI developed in Matlab that shows the optical attenuation at different depths underwater and along with that regions with deep chlorophyll maximum (DCM) are also shown.

AB This paper presents a framework to build a joint 2-D-3-D traffic sign landmark data set for geo-localization using mobile laser scanning (MLS) data. The MLS data include 3-D point clouds and corresponding multi-view images. First, an integrated method, based on a deep learning network and the retro-reflective properties of traffic signs, is developed to accurately extract traffic signs from MLS point clouds. Next, the semantic and spatial properties of the traffic signs (type, location, position, and geometric characteristics) are obtained. Then, a joint 2-D-3-D traffic sign landmark data set is built, and a semantic-spatial organization graph is used to organize the traffic sign data set. Last, based on the traffic sign landmark data set, a geo-localization method for a driving car is proposed to estimate the driving trajectory. It can be used for auxiliary positioning of autonomous vehicles. Experimental results demonstrate the reliability of our proposed method for traffic sign detection and the potential of building 2-D-3-D traffic sign landmark data set for driving trajectory estimation from MLS data.

AB In this study, an efficient load frequency controller (LFC) for standalone two-area hybrid microgrid system (H mu GS) is addressed. Social-spider optimiser (SSO) is applied to fine tune the proposed proportional-integralderivative (PID) controllers by generating their optimal settings. The integral time multiplied summation of absolute deviations and the gains of PID controllers define the fitness function and control variables, respectively. The performance of the proposed SSO-based method is demonstrated on an isolated H mu S complete with variety of energy storage systems under number of scenarios. The scenarios include load fluctuations, variations in wind speed, and sun irradiance employing real site measurements. In this study, photovoltaic generating arrays and wind turbine generators are not participating in system frequency regulations due the proposal of their maximum power tracking operation strategy. The signatures of time-domain dynamic responses and cropped numerical results ascertain that the proposed SSO-based LFC scheme is promising in diminuting the signal deviations and in short time. Further validations for cropped results produced by SSO are made compared with powerful optimisation tool such as genetic algorithm which signify the tuned PID gains.

AB The classical control design based on linearised model is widely used in practice even to those inherently nonlinear systems. Although linear design techniques are relatively mature and enjoy the simple structure in implementations, they can be prone to misbehaviour and failure when the system state is far away from the operating point. To avoid the drawbacks and exploit the advantages of linear design methods while tackling the system nonlinearity, a hybrid control structure is developed in this paper. First, the model predictive control is used to impose states and inputs constraints on the linearised model, whichmakes the linearisation satisfy the small-perturbation requirement and reduces the bound of linearisation error. On the other hand, a combination of disturbance observer-based control and H-infinity control, called composite hierarchical anti-disturbance control, is constructed for the linear model to provide robustness against multiple disturbances. The constrained reference states and inputs generated by the outer-loop model predictive controller are asymptotically tracked by the inner-loop composite anti-disturbance controller. To demonstrate the performance of the proposed framework, a case study on quadrotor is conducted.

AB After more than a decade of research and investments, the first release of standards for cooperative Intelligent Transportation Systems (C-ITS) is going to be finalized. Preliminary field-trials have already demonstrated the high potentials of short-range wireless communication in vehicular environments for many basic day-one C-ITS applications (e.g., hazardous location and road works warnings). In the meanwhile, stakeholders are working on Release 2 of the standards to augment the portfolio of offered services with increased cooperative awareness and driving automation. The related higher C-ITS market penetration and the strict latency and robustness requirements of after day-one applications (e.g., platooning and autonomous driving) are going to question the capability of the current standard technology, mainly based on IEEE 802.11, to cope with scalability and congestion issues at the radio access level.
   In this paper, we analyze the topic of vehicular networks in the context of C-ITS from an evolutionary point of view, scanning early concepts and enabling technologies, current status and future opportunities, with a look on a future fully networked vehicular environment.

AB We study minimalism in sensing and control by considering a multi-agent system in which each agent moves like a Dubins car and has a limited sensor that reports only the presence of another agent within some sector of its windshield. Using a simple quantized control law with three values, each agent tracks another agent (its target) assigned to it by maintaining that agent within this windshield sector. We use Lyapunov analysis to show that by acting autonomously in this way, the agents will achieve rendezvous given a connected initial assignment graph and the assumption that an agent and its target will merge into a single agent when they are sufficiently close. We then proceed to show that, by making the quantized control law slightly stronger, a connected initial assignment graph is not required and the sensing model can be weakened further. A distinguishing feature of our approach is that it does not involve any estimation procedure aimed at reconstructing coordinate information. Our scenario thus provides an example in which an interesting task is performed with extremely coarse sensing and control, and without state estimation. The system was implemented in computer simulation, accessible through the Web, of which the results are presented in the paper.

ID ARCTIC SEA-ICE
AB The Norske Oer Ice Barrier (NOIB) is a region of fast ice located off the northeast coast of Greenland.. It is one of the most extensive areas of landfast ice on Earth. This paper looks at the NOIB formation during the freeze-up of late 2003 and the break-up in summer 2004. As the fast ice is immobile, it provides an ideal location for checking the consistency of classification schemes for satellite sensors. Active microwave (SAR) backscatter values from Envisat are compared with optical observations from the MODIS, multichannel passive microwave from the SSM/I and with ice-freeboard values from the Envisat RA-2. In August 2004 the underside of the NOIB was mapped by an upward-looking multibeam sonar mounted on the Autosub autonomous underwater vehicle. Statistics from sea-ice draft measurements by the multibeam are compared with neat-coincident satellite observations. Evaluating the evolution of the fast ice through multiple satellite sensors with ground truth measurements may allow future development of improved automatic classification algorithms which will be better able to track fast-ice extent. Loss of the fast ice for periods of the year has implications for the coastal environment of Greenland and may contribute to the retreat of the Nioghalvfjerdsfjorden glacier and enhanced coastal erosion.

AB For the first time the autonomous free-fall vehicle AUDOS was deployed at low latitudes in the northeast Atlantic Ocean. Observations of deep demersal fishes attracted to baited cameras were made at three stations near upwelling areas off West Africa: Canaries (27degrees20'N, 16degrees59'W), Cape Verde Terrace (17degrees45'N, 20degrees30'W), and Cape Verde Abyssal Plain (15degrees00'N, 20degrees30'W). The grenadier Coryphaenoides (Nematonurus) armatus was the main species attracted to the bait. Other fish species observed at bait were the eel Histiobranchus bathybius, a zoarcid, and the ophidiids Barathrites iris and Spectrunculus grandis. A comparison was made between this study area and the stations Porcupine Abyssal Plain (48degrees50'N, 16degrees30'W), which is eutrophic, and Madeira Abyssal Plain (31degrees00'N, 20degrees00'W), which is oligotrophic. These are situated on either side of a proposed faunal divide at 40degrees00'N with a high abundance of large species of rattails to the north and lower biomass of smaller fish species to the south. This study revealed a high abundance of large C. (N.) armatus at 17degrees00'N, which is a violation of this putative zoogeographic divide. It is suggested that high primary productivity and upwelling off West Africa sustain this assemblage of deep demersal fishes.

DE ITS; Runtime monitoring; Environmental modelling; Automata
AB Intelligent Transport System (ITS) is a typical class of Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS), and due to the special characteristics of such systems, higher requirements are placed on system security. Runtime verification is a lightweight verification technique which is used to improve the security of such systems. However, current runtime verification methods often ignore the effects of the physical environment (e.g., the effects of rain, snow, and other weather changes on road conditions), which results in the inability of the monitor to effectively monitor the system according to the changes in the environment. To address this problem, this paper proposes a method for constructing a runtime monitor with environmental context-awareness capability. First, the physical environment factors affecting the system are formally described and constructed into an environment model, then the system statute is transformed into a Buchi automaton, and then a synthesis algorithm combining the environment model and the Buchi automaton is designed based on the network of automatons, and the corresponding monitor is generated. Finally, the proposed method is applied and verified on simulation and real objects. The experimental results show that the monitors generated based on the method of this paper can effectively monitor unsafe events in different environments, thus improving the safety of intelligent driving systems.

AB This paper presents a novel composite obstacle avoidance control method to generate safe motion trajectories for autonomous systems in an adaptive manner. First, system safety is described using forward invariance, and the barrier function is encoded into the cost function such that the obstacle avoidance problem can be characterized by an infinite-horizon optimal control problem. Next, a safe reinforcement learning framework is proposed by combining model-based policy iteration and state-following-based approximation. Upon real-time data and extrapolated experience data, this learning design is implemented through the actor-critic structure, in which critic networks are tuned by gradient-descent adaption and actor networks produce adaptive control policies via gradient projection. Then, system stability and weight convergence are theoretically analyzed using Lyapunov method. Finally, the proposed learning-based controller is demonstrated on a two-dimensional single integrator system and a nonlinear unicycle kinematic system. Simulation results reveal that the system or agent can smoothly reach the target point while keeping a safe distance from each obstacle; at the same time, other three avoidance control methods are used to provide side-by-side comparisons and to verify some claimed advantages of the present method.

AB Safety is a fundamental prerequisite that must be addressed before any interaction of robots with humans. Safety has been generally understood and studied as the physical safety of robots in human-robot interaction, whereas how humans perceive these robots has received less attention. Physical safety is a necessary condition for safe human-robot interaction. However, it is not a sufficient condition. A robot that is safe by hardware and software design can still be perceived as unsafe. This article focuses on perceived safety in human-robot interaction. We identified six factors that are closely related to perceived safety based on the literature and the insights obtained from our user studies. The identified factors are the context of robot use, comfort, experience and familiarity with robots, trust, the sense of control over the interaction, and transparent and predictable robot actions. We then made a literature review to identify the robot-related factors that influence perceived safety. Based the literature, we propose a taxonomy which includes human-related and robot-related factors. These factors can help researchers to quantify perceived safety of humans during their interactions with robots. The quantification of perceived safety can yield computational models that would allow mitigating psychological harm.

AB We propose a deep reinforcement learning approach for solving a mapless navigation problem in warehouse scenarios. In our approach, an automatic guided vehicle is equipped with two LiDAR sensors and one frontal RGB camera and learns to perform a targeted navigation task. The challenges reside in the sparseness of positive samples for learning, multi-modal sensor perception with partial observability, the demand for accurate steering maneuvers together with long training cycles. To address these points, we propose NavACL-Q as an automatic curriculum learning method in combination with a distributed version of the soft actor-critic algorithm. The performance of the learning algorithm is evaluated exhaustively in a different warehouse environment to validate both robustness and generalizability of the learned policy. Results in NVIDIA Isaac Sim demonstrates that our trained agent significantly outperforms the map-based navigation pipeline provided by NVIDIA Isaac Sim with an increased agent-goal distance of 3 m and a wider initial relative agent-goal rotation of approximately 45 degrees. The ablation studies also suggest that NavACL-Q greatly facilitates the whole learning process with a performance gain of roughly 40% compared to training with random starts and a pre-trained feature extractor manifestly boosts the performance by approximately 60%.

AB Recently, deep learning (DL) based trackers have attracted tremendous interest for their high performance. Despite the remarkable success, most trackers utilizing deep convolution features commonly neglect tracking speed, which is crucial for aerial tracking on mobile devices. In this paper, we propose an efficient and effective transformer based aerial tracker in the framework of Siamese, which inherits the merits from both transformer and Siamese architectures. Specifically, the outputs from multiple convolution layers are fed into transformer to construct robust features of template patch and search patch, respectively. Consequently, the interdependencies between low-level information and semantic information are interactively fused to improve the ability of encoding target appearance. Finally, traditional depth-wise cross correlation is introduced to generate a similarity map for object location and bounding box regression. Extensive experimental results on three popular benchmarks (DTB70, UAV123@10fps, and UAV20L) have demonstrated that our proposed tracker outperforms other 12 state-of-the-art trackers and achieves a real-time tracking speed of 71.3 frames per second (FPS) on GPU, which can be applied in mobile platform.

ID PARADIGM
AB Relative pose estimation is a core task in robotic vision, and it is the basis of many high-level applications (e.g., visual odometry). In this letter, we focus on a quite common case in which the gravity direction is known in advance with the help of IMUs. Commonly, incorrect feature matches (a.k.a. outliers) are unavoidable, and they will impair the accuracy significantly. RANSAC is the de facto standard to suppress the outliers and obtain a robust solution. However, RANSAC is a non-deterministic algorithm, which means it produces a reasonable result only with a certain probability, and it cannot guarantee the global optimality to meet the safety demand in many life-critical applications. Therefore, we propose a globally optimal algorithm for relative pose estimation with known gravity direction. Specifically, the proposed method employs the branch-and-bound algorithm to solve a consensus maximization problem, and thus it is able to obtain the global solution with a provable guarantee. To verify the feasibility of our proposed method, both synthetic and real-data experiments are conducted. The experimental results support the global optimality of the proposed method and show that the method performs more robustly than existing methods.

AB An important use case of the Mobile Edge Computing (MEC) paradigm is task and data offloading. Computational offloading is beneficial for a wide variety of mobile applications on different platforms including autonomous vehicles and smartphones. With the envision deployment of MEC servers along the roads and while mobile nodes are moving and having certain tasks (or data) to be offloaded to edge servers, choosing an appropriate time and an ideally suited MEC server to guarantee the Quality of Service (QoS) is challenging. We tackle the data quality-aware offloading sequential decision making problem by adopting the principles of Optimal Stopping Theory (OST) to minimize the expected processing time. A variety of OST stochastic models and their applications to the offloading decision making problem are investigated and assessed. A performance evaluation is provided using simulation approach and real world data sets together with the assessment of baseline deterministic and stochastic offloading models. The results show that the proposed OST models can significantly minimize the expected processing time for analytics task execution and can be implemented in the mobile nodes efficiently.

AB This paper explores how the Capability Approach (CA) can enrich the concept of energy justice by assessing the impact of two cases of digitalisation in the energy sector. Digitalisation promises technical solutions to pressing challenges in the energy sector such as climate change and fossil fuel scarcity. Current academic and popular discussions of these solutions are dominated by a techno-utopian ideal, which sometimes obscures complex ethical and social challenges. Furthermore, technology assessment in the energy sector often focuses on environmental and economic aspects of sustainability, while issues of energy justice or broader ethical concerns are often a low priority. In this paper, we explore whether Nussbaum's version of the CA can be used as a systematic approach to the assessment of technological options that helps bring energy justice into the spotlight. Drawing on examples from two different areas of the energy system, namely, smart grids for the electricity sector and autonomous vehicles for the mobility sector, we demonstrate that the CA provides a normative framework that allows for aspects of individual deliberation and as such is well suited as a normative metric for the conception of energy justice in social science.

AB The development of mechatronic products is complex because it deals with the interaction between different domains. In a literature review, the absence of a method capable of integrating the functional view of a mechatronic product into a single model was observed. This article aims to develop a functional modeling method to aid the conceptual design of mechatronic products. The proposed procedure describes the phases and steps required to create functional models and use cases for the different mechatronics knowledge domains and to combine them into a single functional model. The use of the proposed method is demonstrated through its application in the development of an air compressor. The method is then evaluated by experts and tested in the development of an autonomous vehicle for railway inspection, demonstrating its feasibility and the presentation of functional information in a single diagram. Factors such as effectiveness, usability and repeatability were also verified, and an efficient presentation of the function model was observed, allowing to view the relations between the mechanics, electronics and software domains in a unified diagram. The great benefit of the proposed method lies is in the possibility of also using functional models in the context of mechatronic product design.

AB In this article, a novel robust Gaussian approximation smoother based on expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm is proposed for cooperative localization (CL) with faulty Doppler velocity log (DVL) and heavy-tailed measurement noise. In our model, the autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) velocity information that is not available due to DVL failure and the bias in the underwater acoustic modem are considered as unknown inputs. Then, the Student's t distribution is used to model the heavy-tailed measurement noise. An EM algorithm is also developed for the state-space model with heavy-tailed measurement noise. The state, noise covariance matrices, and auxiliary random variables are regarded as hidden variables to obtain the maximum likelihood estimation of unknown inputs. Gaussian smoother where modified process and measurement noise covariance are inferred by variational Bayesian (VB) approach is applied to estimate the state. The experimental results illustrate that given the heavy-tailed noise, the proposed method estimates the unknown input, and the state with a high level of accuracy. The proposed algorithm can he used as a backup algorithm for CL in cases where DVL is not available due to failure.

AB Real-time processing of high-resolution sonar images is of great significance for the autonomy and intelligence of autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) in complex marine environments. In this paper, we propose a real-time semantic segmentation network termed RT-Seg for Side-Scan Sonar (SSS) images. The proposed architecture is based on a novel encoder-decoder structure, in which the encoder blocks utilized Depth-Wise Separable Convolution and a 2-way branch for improving performance, and a corresponding decoder network is implemented to restore the details of the targets, followed by a pixel-wise classification layer. Moreover, we use patch-wise strategy for splitting the high-resolution image into local patches and applying them to network training. The well-trained model is used for testing high-resolution SSS images produced by sonar sensor in an onboard Graphic Processing Unit (GPU). The experimental results show that RT-Seg can greatly reduce the number of parameters and floating point operations compared to other networks. It runs at 25.67 frames per second on an NVIDIA Jetson AGX Xavier on 500*500 inputs with excellent segmentation result. Further insights on the speed and accuracy trade-off are discussed in this paper.

ID MULTIPATH MITIGATION
AB Global Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSSs) have become a ubiquitous tool for our modern society to carry out vital tasks such as transportation, civil engineering or precision agriculture. This breath has reached the realm of safety-critical applications such as time management of critical infrastructures or autonomous vehicles, in which GNSS is an essential tool nowadays. Unfortunately, current GNSS performance is not enough to fulfill the requirements of these professional and critical applications. For this reason, the FANTASTIC project was launched to boost the adoption of these applications. The project was funded by the European GNSS agency (GSA) in order to enhance the robustness and accuracy of GNSS in harsh environments. This paper presents the part related to the development of a weighting and exclusion function with a dual circularly polarized antenna. The idea is to reduce the effects of multipath by weighting and/or excluding those measurements affected by multipath. The observables and other metrics obtained from a dual polarized antenna will be exploited to define an exclusion threshold and to provide the weights. Real-world experiments will show the improvement in the positioning solution, using all available constellations, obtained with the developed technique.

AB Nowadays, data is being generated, collected, and analyzed at an unprecedented scale, data integration is the problem of combining data from heterogeneous, autonomous data sources, and providing users with a unified view of integrated data. To design a data integration framework, we need to address challenges, such as schema mapping, data cleaning, record linkage, and data fusion. In this paper, we briefly introduce the traditional data integration approaches, and then, a novel graph-based data integration framework based on unified concept model (UCM) is proposed to address real-world refueling data integration problems. Within this framework, schema mapping was carried out and metadata from heterogeneous sources is integrated in a UCM. UCM has the benefits of being easy to update. It is also important for effective schema mapping and data transformation. By following the structure of UCM, data from different sources is automatically transformed into instance data and linked together by using semantic similarity computation metrics, finally the data is stored in graph database. Experiments are carried out based on heterogeneous data from refueling records, social networks of astroturfers, and vehicle trajectories. Experimental results and reference implementation demonstrations show good precision and recall of the proposed framework.

AB We introduce embedded data representations, the use of visual and physical representations of data that are deeply integrated with the physical spaces, objects, and entities to which the data refers. Technologies like lightweight wireless displays, mixed reality hardware, and autonomous vehicles are making it increasingly easier to display data in-context. While researchers and artists have already begun to create embedded data representations, the benefits, trade-offs, and even the language necessary to describe and compare these approaches remain unexplored. In this paper, we formalize the notion of physical data referents the real-world entities and spaces to which data corresponds - and examine the relationship between referents and the visual and physical representations of their data. We differentiate situated representations, which display data in proximity to data referents, and embedded representations, which display data so that it spatially coincides with data referents. Drawing on examples from visualization, ubiquitous computing, and art, we explore the role of spatial indirection, scale, and interaction for embedded representations. We also examine the tradeoffs between non-situated, situated, and embedded data displays, including both visualizations and physicalizations. Based on our observations, we identify a variety of design challenges for embedded data representation, and suggest opportunities for future research and applications.

AB Drones are useful in climate science, space research, energy and environmental research, surveillance to protect sensitive areas. Drones, including land autonomous vehicles (AV), are being recognized as being very useful in the 21st century, and their beneficial peaceful functions is one focus of this article. The technology of drones depends mainly on many branches of engineering, including but not limited to robotics, computer technology, avionics, air and space research, mechanics, fluid mechanics, thermodynamics, heat transfer, energy and the environment. This work is also focused on the research and development of drones including AVs. In the area of mass transport systems (which needs to be encouraged and optimized with respect to energy consumed in this age of energy awareness), automation has been achieved but much still needs to be done. Sensors and computers needs to be developed to a high enough level where they can duplicate the senses of an experienced pilot or operator, backed up by a huge database storage of scenarios and follow-up actions that would avert accidents and damage. Some futuristic beneficial uses for drones have also been identified, indicating some directions for research and development. The other hugely important subfield for further work is energy supply for the drones. High power and high energy supply for a long duration is required.

DE AUV; hydrothermal vent field; path-planning; recursive observation; 3D
   imaging
AB Autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) can operate without the need for human control or tether cables as long as there is sufficient energy. AUVs have recently been used for seafloor imaging. Visual observation by AUVs provides high-resolution color information of the seafloor. However, conventional observation techniques that follow a prespecified path offer limited coverage because it is impossible for operators to build a suitable path in unknown rough terrain. A flawed prespecified path will produce incomplete observation. If unobserved areas are found during postprocessing, another dive is necessary, which increases the total cost. To overcome this problem, the authors have proposed a path replanning method to realize high-coverage observation in one dive. With this method, the AUV evaluates unobserved areas after the first prespecified observation; if unobserved areas are found, the AUV recreates an appropriate path to cover what was missed. The validity of the proposed method was previously evaluated using an artificial target in a tank and in shallow seas at a depth of approximately 35 m. In this study, the feasibility of the method was validated in a more challenging setting: experimental data were taken from a hydrothermal vent field in Kagoshima Bay, Japan.

AB A reduced-order nonlinear observer is developed to estimate the distance from a moving camera to a feature point on a static object (i.e., range identification), where full velocity and linear acceleration feedback of the calibrated camera is provided. The contribution of this work is to develop a global exponential range observer which can be used for a larger set of camera motions than existing observers. The observer is shown to be robust against external disturbances in the sense that the observer is (sic)(p)for all p is an element of [1, infinity] stable even if the target object is moving or the camera motion is perturbed. The presented observer identifies the range provided an observability condition commonly used in literature is satisfied and is shown to be exponentially stable even if camera motion satisfies a less restrictive observability condition.

ID STRATEGY
AB This paper presents the development of a cooperation strategy for multiple UAVs to pursue a target moving in an adversarial environment where threat exposure should be minimized, and obstacles and restricted areas should be avoided. A probabilistic approach is used to model the adversarial environment. A cost function is defined to quantify placement of UAVs around the target in formation in terms of threat exposure level and distance to the target. The cost function is used to develop a cooperation strategy for a team of UAVs to follow the target such that the total threat exposure of the team and the average distance to the target throughout the pursuit are minimized according to the weighting coefficients specified. The cooperation strategy has the feature of collision avoidance as well as data-fusion-based estimation of the target trajectory based on noisy measurements. Simulation results have demonstrated that the cooperation reduces the risk of losing the target during the pursuit while avoiding obstacles and restricted areas. Further, the UAVs guided by the cooperation strategy can follow the target closer without increasing the total threat exposure level as compared to cases where the UAVs pursue the target without cooperation.

ID PURSUIT-EVASION GAMES; DIFFERENTIAL-GAMES
AB Techniques based on pursuit-evasion (PE) games are often applied in military operations of autonomous vehicles (AV) in the presence of mobile targets. Recently with increasing use of AVs, new scenarios emerge such as surveillance and persistent area denial. Compared with PE games, the actual roles of the pursuer and the evader have changed. In these emerging scenarios the evader acts as an intruder striking at some asset; at the same time the pursuer tries to destroy the intruder to protect the asset. Due to the presence of an asset, the PE game model with two sets of players (pursuers and evaders) is no longer adequate. We call this new problem a game of defending an asset(s) (DA). In this paper we study DA games under the framework of a linear quadratic (LQ) formulation. Three different DA games are addressed: 1) defending a stationary asset, 2) defending a moving asset with an arbitrary trajectory, and 3) defending an escaping asset. Equilibrium game strategies of the players are derived for each case. A repetitive scheme is proposed for implementation of the LQ strategies, and we demonstrate with simulations that the LQ strategies based on the repetitive implementation can provide good control guidance laws for DA games.

DT Article
AB The advent of the computer and camera vision has given a valuable research tool for the development of automation systems to increase mechanization technology in the agriculture sector. Application of the computer for the real-time weedicide sprayer has been one of the outstanding developments in Malaysian agriculture especially in overcoming labor shortages in oil palm plantations. A commercial sprayer was modified with a guided automation system with the web camera to detect the presence of weeds. The sprayer was installed with a web camera, portable computer, ICPCON I-7042 and SST-2400 radio modem. Module ICPCON I-7042 and a radio modem SST-2400 were selected as the data acquisition and control. The radio modem, that was set as receiver, received the signals and transferred them to the ICP module I-7042 via RS-485 bus. The ICPCON I-7042 and SST-2400 were later replaced with a locally made 'parallel port controller board'. The purpose of this study was to develop an automated sprayer that used camera vision for the application of chemicals on an autonomous all terrain vehicle (ATV). The objective for this project was to detect the presence of weeds in real-time and spray the chemicals precisely to eradicate the weeds. The real-time weedicide sprayer was designed to reduce wastage, labor and cost and to control environmental hazards.

AB Loop Closure Detection is of great significance in the field of intelligent driving systems, as it reduces the cumulative error of the estimated position of the system and assists in generating a consistent global map. Existing methods differ in frame representation methods and the corresponding frame-matching strategy. Traditionally, local feature points and descriptors are studied extensively while recently global descriptors and semantic information extracted from deep learning methods are considered superior in terms of promoting a high-level understanding of the surrounding environments of robots. However, one of the most challenging problems of using semantic information for loop detection is how to deal with inconsistent visual contents from different viewpoints in the same place. In this article, a semantic loop closure detection method using panoramas is proposed to address this issue. We design a pipeline for efficiently extracting and matching semantic information between frames to identify loops. Most importantly we propose a novel polar coordinate-based panorama representation to address the inconsistent visual appearance problem caused by viewpoint differences. Experiment results show that our proposed method can significantly increase the accuracy of loop closure detection tasks in challenging scenarios where traditional methods may fail.

AB This article develops an impact-resilient aerial robot (s-ARQ) equipped with a compliant arm to sense contacts and reduce collision impact and featuring a real-time contact force estimator and a nonlinear motion controller to handle collisions while performing aggressive maneuvers and stabilize from high-speed wall collisions. Further, a new collision-inclusive planning method that aims to prioritize contacts to facilitate aerial robot navigation in cluttered environments is proposed. A range of simulated and physical experiments demonstrate key benefits of the robot and the contact-prioritized (CP) planner. Experimental results show that the compliant robot has only a 4% weight increase but around 40% impact reduction in drop tests and wall collision tests. s-ARQ can handle collisions while performing aggressive maneuvers and stabilize from high-speed wall collisions at 3.0 m/s with a success rate of 100%. Our proposed compliant robot and CP planning method can accelerate computation time while having shorter trajectory time and larger clearances compared to A* and RRT* planners with velocity constraints. Online planning tests in partially known environments further demonstrate the preliminary feasibility of our method to apply in practical use cases.

   SVASeg
AB 3D LiDAR has become an indispensable sensor in autonomous driving vehicles. In LiDAR-based 3D point cloud semantic segmentation, most voxel-based 3D segmentors cannot efficiently capture large amounts of context information, resulting in limited receptive fields and limiting their performance. To address this problem, a sparse voxel-based attention network is introduced for 3D LiDAR point cloud semantic segmentation, termed SVASeg, which captures large amounts of context information between voxels through sparse voxel-based multi-head attention (SMHA). The traditional multi-head attention cannot directly be applied to the non-empty sparse voxels. To this end, a hash table is built according to the incrementation of voxel coordinates to lookup the non-empty neighboring voxels of each sparse voxel. Then, the sparse voxels are grouped into different groups, and each group corresponds to a local region. Afterwards, position embedding, multi-head attention and feature fusion are performed for each group to capture and aggregate the context information. Based on the SMHA module, the SVASeg can directly operate on the non-empty voxels, maintaining a comparable computational overhead to the convolutional method. Extensive experimental results on the SemanticKITTI and nuScenes datasets show the superiority of SVASeg.

AB Robots are usually equipped with 3D range sensors such as laser line scanners (LLSs) or lidars. These sensors acquire a full 3D scan in a line by line manner while the robot is in motion. All the lines can be referred to a common coordinate frame using data from inertial sensors. However, errors from noisy inertial measurements and inaccuracies in the extrinsic parameters between the scanner and the robot frame are also projected onto the shared frame. This causes a deformation in the final scan containing all the lines, which is known as motion distortion. Rigid point cloud registration with methods like ICP is therefore not well suited for such distorted scans. In this paper we present a non-rigid registration method that finds the rigid transformation to be applied to each line in the scan in order to match an existing model. We fully leverage the continuous and relatively smooth robot motion with respect to the scanning time to formulate our method reducing the computational complexity while improving accuracy. We use synthetic and real data to benchmark our method against a state-of-the-art non-rigid registration method. Finally, the source code for the algorithm is made publicly available.(1)

AB Cache-enabled UAVs are widely used as edge servers to provide on-demand content services for ground users. Most of prior works deploy UAVs based on user locations and explore the benefits of UAV caching under static content library. Motivated by this observation, we further consider heterogeneous user activity level and dynamic content library. We formulate a joint optimization problem of UAV deployment and content placement to minimize the average request delay, which is proved to be NP-hard. To tackle this problem efficiently, we decompose this optimization problem into two sub-problems, UAV deployment problem and content placement problem. Specifically, we first jointly consider user activity level and user locations for UAV deployment using weighted K-means method. After the UAV deployment, we propose a Q-learning algorithm to learn the content placement directly, rather than estimating the content popularity first, which is not effective when content library is dynamically changing. The simulation results show that the proposed algorithm outperforms the benchmark algorithms when dynamic content library and heterogeneous user activity level are considered.

AB Visual sensing of the environment is crucial for flying an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) and is a centerpiece of many related applications. The ability to run computer vision and machine learning algorithms onboard an unmanned aerial system (UAS) is becoming more of a necessity in an effort to alleviate the communication burden of high-resolution video streaming, to provide flying aids, such as obstacle avoidance and automated landing, and to create autonomous machines. Thus, there is a growing interest on the part of many researchers in developing and validating solutions that are suitable for deployment on a UAV system by following the general trend of edge processing and airborne computing, which transforms UAVs from moving sensors into intelligent nodes that are capable of local processing. In this paper, we present, in a rigorous way, the design and implementation of a 12.85 kg UAV system equipped with the necessary computational power and sensors to serve as a testbed for image processing and machine learning applications, explain the rationale behind our decisions, highlight selected implementation details, and showcase the usefulness of our system by providing an example of how a sample computer vision application can be deployed on our platform.

AB Global Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSSs) can provide high-precision positioning services, which can be applied to fields including navigation and positioning, autonomous driving, unmanned aerial vehicles and so on. However, GNSS signals are easily disrupted in complex environments, which results in a positioning performance with a significantly inferior accuracy and lengthier convergence time, particularly for the single GNSS system. In this paper, multi-GNSS precise point positioning (PPP) with tightly integrating ultra-wide band (UWB) technology is presented to implement fast and precise navigation and positioning. The validity of the algorithm is evaluated by a set of GNSS and UWB data. The statistics indicate that multi-GNSS/UWB integration can significantly improve positioning performance in terms of the positioning accuracy and convergence time. The improvement of the positioning performance for the GNSS/UWB tightly coupled integration mainly concerns the north and east directions, and to a lesser extent, the vertical direction. Furthermore, the convergence performance of GNSS/UWB solution is analyzed by simulating GNSS signal interruption. The reliability and robustness of GNSS/UWB solution during GNSS signal interruption is verified. The results show that multi-GNSS/UWB solution can significantly improve the accuracy and convergence speed of PPP.

AB This article presents a method for herding a swarm of adversarial agents toward a safe area in a 2-D obstacle environment. The team of defending agents (defenders) aims to block the path of a swarm of risk-averse, adversarial agents (attackers) and guide it to a safe area while navigating in an obstacle-populated environment. To achieve this, a closed formation (StringNet) of defenders is formed around the adversarial swarm. A combination of open-loop, near time-optimal controllers (that result in forming the defenders' formation), and state-feedback controllers with finite-time convergence guarantees under bounded inputs (that guide the formation around attackers and toward the safe area) synthesize the herding strategy. For demonstration purpose, we consider that the attacking swarm moves under a flocking model, which however is unknown to the defenders. Collision-free trajectory generation for the defenders, as well as their convergence to the desired formations, is proved formally, and simulations are provided to demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed approach. An implementation of the proposed approach on quadrotor vehicles simulated in the Gazebo simulator is also provided.

AB With the rapid growth of time-critical applications in smart grid, robotics, autonomous vehicles, and industrial automation, demand for high reliability, low latency and strictly bounded jitter is sharply increasing. High-precision time synchronization communications, such as Time Triggered Ethernet (TTE), have been successfully developed for wired networks. However, the high cost of deploying additional equipment and extra wiring limits the scalability of these networks. Therefore, in this article, a hybrid wired/wireless high-precision time synchronization network based on a combination of high-speed TTE and 5G Ultra-Reliable and Low-Latency Communications (URLLC) is proposed. The main motivation is to comply with the low latency, low jitter, and high reliability requirements of time critical applications, such as smart grid synchrophasor communications. Therefore, in the proposed hybrid network architecture, a high-speed TTE is considered as the main bus (i.e., backbone network), whereas a Precision Time Protocol (PTP) aided 5G-URLLC-based wireless access is used as a sub-network. The main challenge is to achieve interoperability between the PTP aided URLLC and the TTE, while ensuring high precision timing and synchronization. The simulation results demonstrate the impact of the PTP-aided URLLC in maintaining network reliability, latency, and jitter in full coordination with the TTE-network.

AB Underwater image processing has been shown to exhibit significant potential for exploring underwater environments. It has been applied to a wide variety of fields, such as underwater terrain scanning and autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs)-driven applications, such as image-based underwater object detection. However, underwater images often suffer from degeneration due to attenuation, color distortion, and noise from artificial lighting sources as well as the effects of possibly low-end optical imaging devices. Thus, object detection performance would be degraded accordingly. To tackle this problem, in this article, a lightweight deep underwater object detection network is proposed. The key is to present a deep model for jointly learning color conversion and object detection for underwater images. The image color conversion module aims at transforming color images to the corresponding grayscale images to solve the problem of underwater color absorption to enhance the object detection performance with lower computational complexity. The presented experimental results with our implementation on the Raspberry pi platform have justified the effectiveness of the proposed lightweight jointly learning model for underwater object detection compared with the state-of-the-art approaches.

AB Set invariance in the presence of uncertainty and disturbance is of central importance for the safety of control systems. This article proposes a data-driven method to compute an approximation of a minimal robust control invariant set (mRCI) from experimental data. For a given dynamical model with additive and multiplicative uncertainty, the proposed method is able to compute a polytopic mRCI with fixed complexity via linear programming (LP). Moreover, the method can be combined with model selection to enable mRCI computation directly from experiment data when the system dynamics are unknown. Specifically, given a model structure, our algorithm begins by identifying the set of admissible models with constraints extracted from the experimental data. Each model in the set of admissible models contains information about the nominal model and the characterization of the model uncertainties. Then, two iterative algorithms based on robust optimization are proposed to compute an mRCI while simultaneously searching for a model ``optimal'' with regard to the mRCI computation and the corresponding invariance-inducing controller. Finally, the method is demonstrated in an experiment with an autonomous vehicle lane-keeping control example.

AB The wide range use of marine equipment has greatly increased the underwater radiated noise (URN) level, creating more threat to marine life. Autonomous underwater vehicle is one of the solutions to reduce the use of large marine equipment and then decrease the noise. Aiming at the noise control of AUV, this study conducted a far field noise measurement experiment on an AUV working on 10 different conditions, which is rarely measured. The hybrid method, predicting the noise with Lighthill equation based on unsteady flow field data from CFD calculation, is adopted. The results from experiment and simulation indicates that the simulative results are in good agreements with experimental results and the propeller will still generate noise due to the irregular vibration of the propeller, which is about 3-5 dB. With the occurrence of cavitation, the sound pressure level (SPL) increases sharply, and there will be a wide gap between experimental and simulative noise data, owing to the single phase considered in the Lighthill equation. The analysis of the experimental and simulative results highlights the existence of structure excitation noise, ranging from 300 to 500 Hz and the shortcoming of noise prediction of the hybrid method under cavitation stage.

AB This article presents a lane-level localization system adaptive to different driving conditions, such as occlusions, complicated road structures, and lane-changing maneuvers. The system uses surround-view cameras, other low-cost sensors, and a lane-level road map which suits for mass deployment. A map-matching localizer is proposed to estimate the probabilistic lateral position. It consists of a sub-map extraction module, a perceptual model, and a matching model. A probabilistic lateral road feature is devised as a sub-map without limitations of road structures. The perceptual model is a deep learning network that processes raw images from surround-view cameras to extract a local probabilistic lateral road feature. Unlike conventional deep-learning-based methods, the perceptual model is trained by auto-generated labels from the lane-level map to reduce manual effort. The matching model computes the correlation between the sub-map and the local probabilistic lateral road feature to output the probabilistic lateral estimation. A particle-filter-based framework is developed to fuse the output of map-matching localizer with the measurements from wheel speed sensors and an inertial measurement unit. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed system provides the localization results with submeter accuracy in different driving conditions.

AB A near-field wireless power transfer (WPT) technology is applied to recharge the battery of a small size drone. The WPT technology is an extremely attractive solution to build an autonomous base station where the drone can land to wirelessly charge the battery without any human intervention. The innovative WPT design is based on the use of a mechanical part of the drone, i.e., landing gear, as a portion of the electrical circuit, i.e., onboard secondary coil. To this aim, the landing gear is made with an adequately shaped aluminum pipe that, after suitable modifications, performs both structural and electrical functions. The proposed innovative solution has a very small impact on the drone aerodynamics and the additional weight onboard the drone is very limited. Once the design of the secondary coil has been defined, the configuration of the WPT primary coil mounted in a ground base station is optimized to get a good electrical performance, i.e., high values of transferred power and efficiency. The WPT design guidelines of primary and secondary coils are given. Finally, a demonstrator of the WPT system for a lightweight drone is designed, built, and tested.

AB We report a different mechanism for rotation sensing by analyzing the polarization of light exiting from a Sagnac loop. Unlike in an interferometric fiber optic gyroscope (I-FOG), here the counter-propagating waves in the Sagnac loop are orthogonally polarized at the loop exit and, consequently, cannot directly interfere with each other when recombined at the exit. We show that the Stokes parameters s(2) and s(3) of the combined waves are simply the cosine and sine functions of the phase difference between the counter propagation waves, which is linearly proportional to the rotation rate, allowing precise determination of the rotation rate by polarization analysis. We build such a proof-of-concept polarimetry FOG and achieved key performance parameters comparable to those of a high-end tactical-grade gyroscope. In particular, the device shows a bias instability of 0.09 degrees/h and an angular random walk of 0.0015 degrees/root h, with an unlimited dynamic range, demonstrating its potential use for rotation sensing. This new approach eliminates the need for phase modulation required in I-FOGs, and promotes easy photonics integration, enabling the development of low-cost FOGs for price-sensitive applications, such as autonomous and robotic vehicles.

DE Underwater glider; combined propulsion; simulation; buoyancy engine;
   East Sea
AB An underwater glider is an autonomous underwater vehicle that is propelled by changes in volume. Due to this propulsion method, it is possible to make observations with these devices continuously for 30-60 days. Of the gliders' physical properties, the volume change has the greatest influence on the cruising speed. The speed can be increased by increasing the volume change, but this also increases the energy consumption. Therefore, the change in buoyancy is very important for the operation of underwater gliders. Hence, it is necessary to optimize the change in buoyancy. In this study, we describe a technique for optimizing the design of underwater gliders intended to operate in the East Sea of Korea using a combined buoyancy engine and thruster propulsion system. First, we carried out a simulation study to optimize the volume change of the buoyancy engine based on the average flow velocity distribution, water temperature, and vertical salinity distribution in the East Sea. Then, we used our simulations to predict the optimal change in volume of the underwater glider. Finally, we discuss the advantages of operating with thrusters in special environments under specific water temperature, salinity distribution, and ocean current conditions.

AB This paper introduces an analytical framework to investigate optimal design choices for the placement of virtual controllers along the cloud-to-things continuum. The main application scenarios include low-latency cyber-physical systems in which real-time control actions are required in response to the changes in states of an Internet of Things (IoT) node. In such cases, deploying controller software on a cloud server is often not tolerable due to delay from the network edge to the cloud. Hence, it is desirable to trade reliability with latency by moving controller logic closer to the network edge. Modeling the IoT node as a dynamical system that evolves linearly in time with quadratic penalty for state deviations, recursive expressions for the optimum control policy and the resulting minimum cost value are obtained by taking virtual fog controller reliability and response time latency into account. Our results indicate that latency is more critical than reliability in provisioning virtualized control services over fog endpoints, as it determines the swiftness of the fog control system as well as the timeliness of state measurements. Based on a drone trajectory tracking model, an extensive simulation study is also performed to illustrate the influence of reliability and latency on the control of autonomous vehicles over fog.

AB Because of the expected shift from ordinary to autonomous vehicles, the role of public transport (PT) will have to be enhanced, and thus there is a need to pay more attention to its design procedures and evaluation processes. This study compares previous models and methodologies by creating a quality-evaluation platform that enables a comparison of their solution qualities. The evaluation framework developed consists of an integration component between the criteria and objectives of the passengers, the agencies, and the authorities. A set of performance indicators is selected from the literature to build an evaluation rating system. Existing benchmark networks are adopted in the numerical experiments, and interesting findings are obtained. The evaluation results reveal that the quality of the solutions declines with an increase in the network size, and for large networks, the consideration of an unlimited capacity of transport modes is too simplified; this points to the need for a layer-by-layer analysis. In addition, this study shows the level of importance in making transfers. The methodology developed can help planners to improve and design better PT networks.

ID MULTIPLE LIDARS
AB In the fields of autonomous vehicles, virtual reality and three-dimensional (3D) reconstruction, 2D laser rangefinders have been widely employed for different purposes, such as localization, mapping, and simultaneous location and mapping. However, the extrinsic calibration of multiple 2D laser rangefinders is a fundamental prerequisite for guaranteeing their performance. In contrast to existing calibration methods that rely on manual procedures or suffer from low accuracy, an automatic and high-accuracy solution is proposed in this paper for the extrinsic calibration of 2D laser rangefinders. In the proposed method, a mobile sphere is used as a calibration target, thereby allowing the automatic extrapolation of a spherical center and the automatic matching of corresponding points. Based on the error analysis, a matching machine of corresponding points with a low error is established with the restriction constraint of the scan circle radius, thereby achieving the goal of high-accuracy calibration. Experiments using the Hokuyo UTM-30LX sensor show that the method can increase the extrinsic orientation accuracy to a sensor intrinsic accuracy of 10 mm without requiring manual measurements or manual correspondence among sensor data. Therefore, the calibration method in this paper is automatic, highly accurate, and highly effective, and it meets the requirements of practical applications.

AB The article presents a vision system for the autonomous grasping of objects with Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) in real time. Giving UAVs the capability to manipulate objects vastly extends their applications, as they are capable of accessing places that are difficult to reach or even unreachable for human beings. This work is focused on the grasping of known objects based on feature models. The system runs in an on-board computer on a UAV equipped with a stereo camera and a robotic arm. The algorithm learns a feature-based model in an offline stage, then it is used online for detection of the targeted object and estimation of its position. This feature-based model was proved to be robust to both occlusions and the presence of outliers. The use of stereo cameras improves the learning stage, providing 3D information and helping to filter features in the online stage. An experimental system was derived using a rotary-wing UAV and a small manipulator for final proof of concept. The robotic arm is designed with three degrees of freedom and is lightweight due to payload limitations of the UAV. The system has been validated with different objects, both indoors and outdoors.

AB Accurate modeling of acoustic propagation in the ocean waveguide is important to SONAR-performance prediction. Particularly in shallow waters, a crucial contribution to the total transmission loss is the bottom refection loss, which can be estimated passively by beamforming the natural surface-noise acoustic field recorded by a vertical line array of hydrophones. However, the performance in this task of arrays below 2m of length is problematic for frequencies below 10 kHz It is shown in this paper that, when the data are free of interference from sources other than wind and wave surface noise, data from a shorter array can be used to approximate the coherence function of a longer array. This improves the angular resolution of the estimated bottom loss, often making use of data at frequencies above the array design frequency. Application to simulated and experimental data shows that the technique, rigorously justified for a halfspace bottom, is effective also on more complex bottom types. Dispensing with active sources, small autonomous underwater vehicles equipped with short arrays can be envisioned as compact, efficient seabed-characterization systems. The proposed technique is shown to improve significantly the reflection-loss estimate of an array that would be a candidate for such application. (C) 2016 Acoustical Society of America.

AB The contact mechanics for a wheel and deformable terrain are complicated owing to the rigid-flexible coupling characteristics. This paper presents explicit-form analytical equations to estimate the wheel sinkage and compaction resistance of autonomous robots that require high-accuracy terramechanics models. The limitations of Bekker's equations were analyzed both theoretically and through experiments on slip/skid sinkages. The normal and shear stress distribution equations of the Wong-Reece model were improved through the use of a variable sinkage exponent to reflect the dynamic sinkage of robot wheels moving on deformable terrain. The improved integral-form equations were simplified to derive closed-form analytical equations for estimating the normal force, drawbar pull, and driving resistance moment; these were then used to derive explicit analytical equations to estimate the wheel sinkage and compaction resistance as functions of the vertical load, terrain parameters, wheel parameters, and sinkage exponent varying with the slip ratio. The experimental results for the contact mechanics of six different types of wheels and deformable terrain were used to verify the accuracy of the model. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Driving a car involves simultaneous consideration of events at different spatio-temporal scales, Proper interpretation and planning then leads to behavior such as the parallel parking maneuver, the three-point turn, free Euclidean driving in a desert, following a road, and translationally passing other vehicles at high speed. In the study of autonomous systems, it is desirable to find a representation in which such different behaviors of a single system can be related to each other, and to find precisely how and under what conditions a change of representation and corresponding choice of motions occurs.
   In this paper, we formulate an abstraction mechanism based on approximations of flows of commutators of vector fields (the paper also contains an explanation of these relatively unknown concepts). We apply it to the goal-directed motion of a car and show how the environmental constraints induce, through this abstraction mechanism, a recognizable hierarchy of descriptions of the car's motion. This suggests that this method of analyzing the behavior to derive a suitable level of description is conceptually correct, and that its implementation would give the right level of computational representation on which to apply one of the standard path planning algorithms.

AB Automatic hitching is a challenging task in agricultural automation that could potentially improve safety and reduce drudgery for farmers during coupling of farm implements with tractors. In this study, we attempt the automatic hitching of an implement and tractor using discriminated and localized landmarks and a laser range finder (LRF). Reflectors were used as landmarks, and field experiments were carried out to discriminate among and localize three different shapes of reflector: rectangular, cylindrical, and trapezoidal. The rectangular reflectors were easy to attach to the implement, and accuracy was satisfactory at longer distances. In contrast, the cylindrical and trapezoidal reflectors had the respective drawbacks of fitting data into the regular shape of a circle and template matching of multiple lines from a longer distance. The average errors of rectangular reflectors at the target position were less than 2 cm in x-y coordinates from a distance of 10 in from the LRF In the second experiment, navigation of the tractor and automatic hitching were done based oil localization of reflectors by the LRF, which was investigated using an actual-size autonomous tractor The results of the experiments confirmed that the autonomous tractor could navigate to the implement's position within an average final lateral error of 3 cm and a directional error of 2 degrees for single reflector and double reflector positioning methods on a concrete surface and on a soft, undulating grass field. We found that the number of successful automatic hitching trials was higher with the double-reflector positioning method as compared to the single-reflector positioning method on the concrete surface. For the undulating grass field surface, we attached a guide rail to increase the tolerance of lateral deviation on this surface and noted a higher number of successful trials of automatic hitching with the double reflectors. It can be concluded that automatic hitching is possible using reflectors as an artificial landmark attached to the implement to ensure safe coupling of heavy farm implements with a tractor.

AB Submesoscale flows in the ocean are energetic motions, O(1-10 km), that influence stratification and the distributions of properties, such as heat and carbon. They are believed to play an important role in sea-ice-impacted oceans by modulating air-sea-ice fluxes and sea-ice extent. The intensity of these flows and their response to wind forcing are unobserved in the sea-ice regions of the Southern Ocean. We present the first submesoscale-resolving observations in the Antarctic marginal ice zone (MIZ) collected by surface and underwater autonomous vehicles, for >3 months in austral summer. We observe salinity-dominated lateral density fronts occurring at sub-kilometer scales. Surface winds are shown to modify the magnitude of the mixed-layer density fronts, revealing strongly coupled atmosphere-ocean processes. We posture that these wind-front interactions occur as a continuous interplay between front slumping and vertical mixing, which leads to the dispersion of submesoscale fronts. Such processes are expected to be ubiquitous in the Southern Ocean MIZ.
   Plain Language Summary Satellite radar imagery shows evidence of 1-10 km eddies and jets in the ocean adjacent to the sea-ice edge around Antarctica. We use field observations of temperature, salinity, and wind speed from autonomous robotic platforms deployed in the sea-ice zone for >3 months. These measurements provide estimates of the surface ocean density fronts which are controlled primarily by lateral variations in salinity. We show that, during high wind speeds, these surface fronts temporarily dissipate, indicating an atmosphere-ocean coupling occurring at the submesoscale. The fronts strengthen again during low wind speed, which is thought to be because the stirring of the fresher surface layer by mesoscale eddies leads to the generation of the submesoscale fronts. Providing in situ observations of such features improves our understanding of the small-scale ocean and climate processes at play, such as how heat and carbon may exchange between the atmosphere and the ocean.

AB Despite the widespread availability of artificial intelligence (AI) products and services, consumer evaluations and adoption intentions have not met expectations. Existing research mainly focuses on AI's instrumental attributes from the consumer perspective, along with negative impacts of AI failures on evaluations and willingness to use. However, research is lacking on AI as a collaborative agent, investigating the impact of human-AI collaboration on AI acceptance under different outcome expectations. This study examines the interactive effects of human-AI collaboration types (AI-dominant vs. AI-assisted) and outcome expectations (positive vs. negative) on AI product evaluations and usage willingness, along with the underlying mechanisms, from a human-AI relationship perspective. It also investigates the moderating role of algorithm transparency in these effects. Using three online experiments with analysis of variance and bootstrap methods, the study validates these interactive mechanisms, revealing the mediating role of attribution and moderating role of algorithm transparency. Experiment 1 confirms the interactive effects of human-AI collaboration types and outcome expectations on consumer evaluations and usage willingness. Under positive outcome expectations, consumers evaluate and express willingness to use AI-dominant intelligent vehicles with autonomous driving capabilities higher than those with emergency evasion capabilities (AI-assisted). However, under negative outcome expectations, consumers rate autonomous driving capabilities lower compared to emergency evasion capabilities. Experiment 2 examines the mediating role of attribution through ChatGPT's dominant or assisting role under different outcome expectations. Experiment 3 uses a clinical decision-making system to study algorithm transparency's moderating role, showing higher transparency improves evaluations and willingness to use AI products and services under negative outcome expectations. Theoretically, this study advances consumer behavior research by exploring the human-AI relationship within artificial intelligence, enhancing understanding of consumer acceptance variations. Practically, it offers insights for better integrating AI products and services into the market.

AB Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs), also known as drones, have advanced greatly in recent years. There are many ways in which drones can be used, including transportation, photography, climate monitoring, and disaster relief. The reason for this is their high level of efficiency and safety in all operations. While the design of drones strives for perfection, it is not yet flawless. When it comes to detecting and preventing collisions, drones still face many challenges. In this context, this paper describes a methodology for developing a drone system that operates autonomously without the need for human intervention. This study applies reinforcement learning algorithms to train a drone to avoid obstacles autonomously in discrete and continuous action spaces based solely on image data. The novelty of this study lies in its comprehensive assessment of the advantages, limitations, and future research directions of obstacle detection and avoidance for drones, using different reinforcement learning techniques. This study compares three different reinforcement learning strategies-namely, Deep Q-Networks (DQN), Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO), and Soft Actor-Critic (SAC)-that can assist in avoiding obstacles, both stationary and moving; however, these strategies have been more successful in drones. The experiment has been carried out in a virtual environment made available by AirSim. Using Unreal Engine 4, the various training and testing scenarios were created for understanding and analyzing the behavior of RL algorithms for drones. According to the training results, SAC outperformed the other two algorithms. PPO was the least successful among the algorithms, indicating that on-policy algorithms are ineffective in extensive 3D environments with dynamic actors. DQN and SAC, two off-policy algorithms, produced encouraging outcomes. However, due to its constrained discrete action space, DQN may not be as advantageous as SAC in narrow pathways and twists. Concerning further findings, when it comes to autonomous drones, off-policy algorithms, such as DQN and SAC, perform more effectively than on-policy algorithms, such as PPO. The findings could have practical implications for the development of safer and more efficient drones in the future.

TI Blockchain and artificial intelligence for 5G-enabled Internet of
   Things: Challenges, opportunities, and solutions
SO TRANSACTIONS ON EMERGING TELECOMMUNICATIONS TECHNOLOGIES
LA English
DT Article; Early Access
ID IOT
AB Internet of Things (IoT) has revolutionized the digital world by connecting billions of electronic devices over the internet. IoT devices play an essential role in the modern era when conventional devices become more autonomous and smart. On the one hand, high-speed data transfer is a major issue where the 5G-enabled environment plays an important role. On the other hand, these IoT devices transfer the data by using protocols based on centralized architecture and may cause several security issues for the data. Merging artificial intelligence to 5G wireless systems solves several issues such as autonomous robots, self-driving vehicles, virtual reality, and engender security problems. Building trust among the network users without trusting third party authorities is the system's primary concern. Blockchain emerged as a key technology based on a distributed ledger to maintain the network's event logs. Blockchain provides a secure, decentralized, and trustless environment for IoT devices. However, integrating IoT and blockchain also has several challenges; for example, major challenge is low throughput. Currently, the ethereum blockchain network can process approximately 12 to 15 transactions per second, while IoT devices require relatively higher throughput. Therefore, blockchains are incapable of providing functionality for a 5G-enabled IoT based network. The limiting factor of throughput in the blockchain is their network. The slow propagation of transactions and blocks in the P2P network does not allow miners and verifiers to fastly mine and verify new blocks, respectively. Therefore, network scalability is the major issue of IoT based blockchains. In this work, we solved the network scalability issue using blockchain distributed network while to increase the throughput of blockchain, this article uses the Raft consensus algorithm. Another most important issue with IoT networks is privacy. Unfortunately, the blockchain distributed ledgers are public and sensitive information is available on the network for everyone are private, but in such cases, third party editing is not possible without revealing the original contents. To solve privacy issues, we used zkLedger as a solution that is based on zero knowledge-based cryptography.

ID ATLANTIC RIGHT WHALES; MARINE MAMMALS; CALL DETECTION; MANAGEMENT
AB Mitigating the effects of human activities on marine mammals often depends on monitoring animal occurrence over long time scales, large spatial scales, and in real time. Passive acoustics, particularly from autonomous vehicles, is a promising approach to meeting this need. We have previously developed the capability to record, detect, classify, and transmit to shore information about the tonal sounds of baleen whales in near real time from long-endurance ocean gliders. We have recently developed a protocol by which a human analyst reviews this information to determine the presence of marine mammals, and the results of this review are automatically posted to a publicly accessible website, sent directly to interested parties via email or text, and made available to stakeholders via a number of public and private digital applications. We evaluated the performance of this system during two 3.75-month Slocum glider deployments in the southwestern Gulf of Maine during the spring seasons of 2015 and 2016. Near real-time detections of humpback, fin, sei, and North Atlantic right whales were compared to detections of these species from simultaneously recorded audio. Data from another 2016 glider deployment in the same area were also used to compare results between three different analysts to determine repeatability of results both among and within analysts. False detection (occurrence) rates on daily time scales were 0% for all species. Daily missed detection rates ranged from 17 to 24%. Agreement between two trained novice analysts and an experienced analyst was greater than 95% for fin, sei, and right whales, while agreement was 83-89% for humpback whales owing to the more subjective process for detecting this species. Our results indicate that the presence of baleen whales can be accurately determined using information about tonal sounds transmitted in near real-time from Slocum gliders. The system is being used operationally to monitor baleen whales in United States, Canadian, and Chilean waters, and has been particularly useful for monitoring the critically endangered North Atlantic right whale throughout the northwestern Atlantic Ocean.

ID INTERPOLATION TECHNIQUES
AB Digital bottom models are commonly used in many fields of human activity, such as navigation, harbor and offshore technologies, or environmental studies. In many cases, they are the basis for further analysis. They are prepared based on bathymetric measurements, which in many cases have the form of large datasets. Therefore, various interpolation methods are used for calculating these models. In this paper, we present the analysis in which we compared selected methods for bottom surface modeling with a particular focus on geostatistical methods. The aim was to compare five variants of Kriging and three deterministic methods. The research was performed with real data acquired with the use of an autonomous surface vehicle. The collected bathymetric data were reduced (from about 5 million points to about 500 points) and analyzed. A ranking approach was proposed to perform a complex and comprehensive analysis integrating typically used error statistics-mean absolute error, standard deviation and root mean square error. This approach allowed the inclusion of various views on methods of assessment while integrating various metrics and factors. The results show that geostatistical methods perform very well. The best results were achieved with the modifications of classical Kriging methods, which are disjunctive Kriging and empirical Bayesian Kriging. For these two methods, good statistics were calculated compared to other methods (for example, the mean absolute error for disjunctive Kriging was 0.23 m, while for universal Kriging and simple Kriging, it was 0.26 m and 0.25 m, respectively). However, it is worth mentioning that interpolation based on radial basis function in some cases is comparable to Kriging in its performance. The proposed ranking approach was proven to be useful and can be utilized in the future for choosing and comparing DBMs, mostly in mapping and analyzing seabed changes, for example in dredging operations. The research will be used during the implementation of the new multidimensional and multitemporal coastal zone monitoring system using autonomous, unmanned floating platforms. The prototype of this system is at the design stage and is expected to be implemented.

AB Electric two-wheeler (ETW) accidents are one of the most important types of traffic accidents in China. Currently, the China New Car Assessment Program (C-NCAP) has proposed test scenarios to evaluate the effectiveness of autonomous emergency braking (AEB) for ETWs, including several common typical crash scenarios, but other atypical scenarios have not been considered. To determine the performance of AEB in real accidents, 16 in-depth accident cases with typical scenarios and 11 cases with atypical scenarios were selected based on a proposed C-NCAP typical scenario set and reconstructed using the virtual simulation tools MADYMO and PC-Crash. The crashes were re-simulated with a car equipped with an AEB system while varying the sensor field of view (FOV), time-to-collision (TTC), sensor delay time (SDT), and lateral trigger width (W). The results show that for almost all combinations of AEB parameters, the crash avoidance rate was much higher in the typical scenario than that in the atypical scenario. When using an AEB with a FOV of 90 degrees (+/- 45 degrees), all ETW accidents were avoided in typical scenarios, while even with the most efficient AEB system (FOV = +/- 60 degrees, TTC trigger value = 1.5 s, SDT = 0.1 s), only 82% of crashes were avoided in atypical scenarios. Further considering the effect of lateral width, increasing the width from 2 to 5 m, the maximum avoidance rate of the AEB system increased by 43% in the typical scenarios and 18% in the atypical scenarios. The findings suggest that the typical AEB test scenarios proposed for C-NCAP were useful for other crash scenarios, but that including additional test scenarios may better reflect real world crash scenarios. It is recommended that atypical scenarios should be considered in C-NCAP, particularly perpendicular crash scenarios with the car or ETW turning, to better describe real accidents and improve vehicle safety.

AB This article presents the problem of autonomous control of an unmanned aerial manipulator (UAM) developed for operation with unknown disturbances, wherein the disturbances from the coupling effect between the UAM and the external environment need to be considered. Regarding the coupling force as a disturbance to the entire UAM system, an adaptive prescribed performance control (APPC) scheme utilizing the knowledge of prescribed performance is proposed to guarantee the transient and steady-state performance responses. Also, an adaptive law is designed to estimate the upper boundary parameters of the UAM system uncertainties and disturbances, wherein the restrictive constant boundary assumptions and the prior information of the upper bound are not required in the controller design. Furthermore, to enable safe manipulation in a realistic situation, an end-effector trajectory generation method is presented satisfying the joint angle limitation. For the validation of the proposed method, the simulation results of numerical simulation comparisons are shown. Moreover, experimental scenarios including stable flight and simulated co-work with humans in complex environments are designed to verify the proposed method. Note to Practitioners-This article is motivated by the problem of aerial manipulation under unknown disturbances, which may be caused by the wide movement of the manipulator and the sudden loading or unloading of an object. Existing approaches for aerial manipulation often require the assumption of a constant or slowly varying external disturbance. However, a priori bounded disturbance might impose a priori bound on the system state before obtaining closed-loop stability. In this article, the proposed controller with an adaptive law is designed to estimate the upper boundary parameters of the overall disturbances and ensure the predefined performance, so that the prior information of the upper bound of disturbances is not required. The performance of the proposed control strategy is demonstrated via numerical simulation comparisons and experiments, including stale flight and simulated co-work with humans in a complex environment.

AB Some agricultural robots differ in design from traditional tractors which can affect load distribution among the wheels and the resulting soil stresses, especially when moving and carrying implements. Accurate measurements of soil stresses from these machines are needed to estimate their potential to reduce risk of compaction. The aim of this experiment was to study the vertical and horizontal stresses during repeated wheeling from a lightweight autonomous robot and to compare the measurements with calculations using the model Terranimo. We installed stress transducers at 10 cm depth in a loamy sand soil with water content close to field capacity. As an example of an agricultural field robot, we used a 55 kW 4WD robot (model ROBOTTI 150 D equipped with 320/65 R16 tyres) in two configurations: unloaded (33.6 kN) and loaded with a sprayer (37.2 kN). We conducted ten passes with the robot on the same wheel tracks over the transducers and measured the contact area, dynamic wheel load, mean ground pressure and maximum vertical and horizontal stresses during each wheel pass. We observed a significant increase in mean ground pressure with repeated wheeling. Measured values of maximum vertical stresses were 32% larger than the ones predicted by the model. On the same wheel and for different numbers of passes, we found differences between maximum and minimum dynamic wheel loads of up to 9.3 kN. Our results suggest that using static loads from this machine as inputs in models can result in inaccurate predictions of soiltyre interface parameters due to the high variability and unknown redistribution of the load under dynamic conditions. The differences between static and dynamic loads also impede the correct on-field adjustment of tyre inflation pressures. These issues can result in an underestimation of the risk of soil compaction of this type of vehicle, especially in the topsoil. This work can help design new robots that aim to minimize soil compaction.

AB Featured Application
   SC-M* generalizes the M* algorithm to address real-world multi-agent path planning problems in the soft-collision context, which considers the allocation of common resources requested by agents. Application examples include but are not limited to city-scale passenger routing in mass transit systems, network traffic engineering and planning for large-scale autonomous vehicles.
   Abstract Multi-agent path planning (MAPP) is increasingly being used to address resource allocation problems in highly dynamic, distributed environments that involve autonomous agents. Example domains include surveillance automation, traffic control and others. Most MAPP approaches assume hard collisions, e.g., agents cannot share resources, or co-exist at the same node or edge. This assumption unnecessarily restricts the solution space and does not apply to many real-world scenarios. To mitigate this limitation, this paper introduces a more general class of MAPP problems-MAPP in a soft-collision context. In soft-collision MAPP problems, agents can share resources or co-exist in the same location at the expense of reducing the quality of the solution. Hard constraints can still be modeled by imposing a very high cost for sharing. This paper motivates and defines the soft-collision MAPP problem, and generalizes the widely-used M* MAPP algorithm to support the concept of soft-collisions. Soft-collision M* (SC-M*) extends M* by changing the definition of a collision, so paths with collisions that have a quality penalty below a given threshold are acceptable. For each candidate path, SC-M* keeps track of the reduction in satisfaction level of each agent using a collision score, and it places agents whose collision scores exceed its threshold into a soft-collision set for reducing the score. Our evaluation shows that SC-M* is more flexible and more scalable than M*. It can also handle complex environments that include agents requesting different types of resources. Furthermore, we show the benefits of SC-M* compared with several baseline algorithms in terms of path cost, success rate and run time.

ID EMPIRICAL MODE DECOMPOSITION
AB In recent years, the polarization compass (PC) has been extensively applied in the field of autonomous navigation due to its strong autonomy and anti-interference characteristics. Nevertheless, the existing research shows that the PC with high extinction ratio polarization sensor still offers poor orientation accuracy since there is a great quantity of noise in the heading data output from the compass. Here, we present a novel and promising scheme to denoise heading data to improve deficiency in heading data denoising of existing research. The purpose of this study aims to solve the problem that the orientation accuracy of PC caused by noise needs to be improved. Concretely, the major points of this research include an effective separation strategy of noise and useful signal based on the optimized variational mode decomposition (OVMD) and an effective heading data denoising method based on an adaptive singular spectrum analysis (AD-SSA). OVMD based on the center frequency is employed to decompose the original noisy heading data into a finite number of band-limited data intrinsic mode functions (DIMFs) so that the best number of decomposed layers for the noising data can be obtained. Subsequently, the above decomposed DIMFs are divided into low-frequency signal components, mixed components, and high-frequency noise components exploiting the maximum similar eigenvalue of the autocorrelation matrix corresponding to each DIMF as a classification method. An AD-SSA uses the correlation coefficient to further suppress the noise in classified DIMFs. These approaches are combined effectively to improve the orientation accuracy of the PC significantly and very contribute to the navigation application of unmanned mobile platforms such as unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs). Compared to existing prior arts, the effectiveness of the proposed heading denoising scheme for the PC is demonstrated through the results obtained from the heading data sets on two representative sunny and dust days.

DT Article
DE SDN; Underwater communications; Virtualization
AB Underwater communication systems have drawn the attention of the research community in the last 15 years. This growing interest can largely be attributed to new civil and military applications enabled by large-scale networks of underwater devices (e.g., underwater static sensors, unmanned autonomous vehicles (AUVs), and autonomous robots), which can retrieve information from the aquatic and marine environment, perform in-network processing on the extracted data, and transmit the collected information to remote locations. Currently underwater communication systems are inherently hardware-based and rely on closed and inflexible architectural design. This imposes significant challenges into adopting new underwater communication and networking technologies, prevent the provision of truly-differentiated services to highly diverse underwater applications, and induce great barriers to integrate heterogeneous underwater devices. Software-defined networking (SDN), recognized as the next-generation networking paradigm, relies on the highly flexible, programmable, and virtualizable network architecture to dramatically improve network resource utilization, simplify network management, reduce operating cost, and promote innovation and evolution. In this paper, a software-defined architecture, namely SoftWater, is first introduced to facilitate the development of the next-generation underwater communication systems. More specifically, by exploiting the network function virtualization (NFV) and network virtualization concepts, SoftWater architecture can easily incorporate new underwater communication solutions, accordingly maximize the network capacity, can achieve the network robustness and energy efficiency, as well as can provide truly differentiated and scalable networking services. Consequently, the SoftWater architecture can simultaneously support a variety of different underwater applications, and can enable the interoperability of underwater devices from different manufacturers that operate on different underwater communication technologies based on acoustic, optical, or radio waves. Moreover, the essential network management tools of SoftWater are discussed, including reconfigurable multi-controller placement, hybrid in-band and out-of band control traffic balancing, and utility-optimal network virtualization. Furthermore, the major benefits of SoftWater architecture are demonstrated by introducing software-defined underwater networking solutions, including the throughput-optimal underwater routing, SDN-enhanced fault recovery, and software-defined underwater mobility management. The research challenges to realize the SoftWater are also discussed in detail. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Micro/nanomotors (MNMs) that accomplish autonomous movement by transforming external energy into mechanical work are attractive cargo delivery vehicles. Among various propulsion mechanisms of MNMs, photothermal propulsion has gained considerable attention because of their unique advantages, such as remote, flexible, accurate, biocompatible, short response time, etc. Moreover, besides as a propulsion source, the light has been extensively investigated as an excitation source in bioimaging, photothermal therapy (PTT), photodynamic therapy (PDT) and so on. Furthermore, the geometric topology and morphology of MNMs have a tremendous impact on improving their performance in motion behavior under NIR light propulsion, environmental suitability and functional versatility. Hence, this review article provides a comprehensive overview of structural design principles and construction strategies of photothermaldriven MNMs, and their emerging nanobiomedical applications. Finally, we further provide an outlook towards prospects and challenges during the development of photothermal-driven MNMs in the future. Statement of Significance Photothermal-driven micro/nanomotors (MNMs) that are regarded as functional cargo delivery tools have gained considerable attention because of unique advantages in propulsion mechanisms, such as remote, flexible, accurate and fully biocompatible light manipulation and extremely short light response time. The geometric topology and morphology of MNMs have a tremendous impact on improving their performance in motion behavior under NIR light propulsion, environmental suitability and functional versatility of MNMs.There are no reports about the review focusing on photothermal-driven MNMs up to now. Herein, we systematically review the latest progress of photothermal-driven MNMs including design principle, fabrication strategy of various MNMs with different structures and nanobiomedical applications. Moreover, the summary and outlook on the development prospects and challenges of photothermal-driven MNMs are proposed, hoping to provide new ideas for the future design of photothermal-driven MNMs with efficient propulsion, multiple functions and high biocompatibility.(c) 2023 Acta Materialia Inc.

AB Over the last few decades, the robotics community has shown increasing interest in developing bioinspired swimming robots, driven by the need for more economical, more efficient, autonomous, highly flexible and maneuverable robotic systems for underwater operations. In this paper, we present a bioinspired underwater snake robot (USR) equipped with a passive caudal (tail) fin. In particular, a highly flexible USR configuration is presented that is capable of locomotion both on the ground and underwater due to its robust mechanical and modular design, which allows additional effectors to be attached to different modules of the robot depending on the requirements of the application. This provides flexibility to the operator, who can thus choose the proper configuration depending on the task to be performed in various uncertain environments on the ground and underwater. Experimental results on locomotion efficiency and path-following control are obtained for a physical USR to enable a comparison of the USR motion with and without the passive caudal fin, for both lateral undulation and eel-like motion patterns. Results comparing the locomotion efficiency in both simulations and experiments are presented in order to validate the proposed models for USRs. By means of fluid parameter identification, both a qualitative and a quantitative comparison between the simulated and experimental results are performed regarding the achieved forward velocity. Furthermore, the experimental results show that a path-following control approach that has previously been proposed for USRs without a caudal fin can be directly applied to solve the path-following control problem for this bioinspired USR with a passive caudal fin. In particular, it is shown that this path-following control approach successfully steers the robot toward and along the desired path, and furthermore, the results show that it is possible to almost double the forward velocity of the robot by using a passive caudal fin.

AB The federated learning technique (FL) supports the collaborative training of machine learning and deep learning models for edge network optimization. Although a complex edge network with heterogeneous devices having different constraints can affect its performance, this leads to a problem in this area. Therefore, some research can be seen to design new frameworks and approaches to improve federated learning processes. The purpose of this study is to provide an overview of the FL technique and its applicability in different domains. The key focus of the paper is to produce a systematic literature review of recent research studies that clearly describes the adoption of FL in edge networks. The search procedure was performed from April 2020 to May 2021 with a total initial number of papers being 7546 published in the duration of 2016 to 2020. The systematic literature synthesizes and compares the algorithms, models, and frameworks of federated learning. Additionally, we have presented the scope of FL applications in different industries and domains. It has been revealed after careful investigation of studies that 25% of the studies used FL in IoT and edge-based applications and 30% of studies implement the FL concept in the health industry, 10% for NLP, 10% for autonomous vehicles, 10% for mobile services, 10% for recommender systems, and 5% for FinTech. A taxonomy is also proposed on implementing FL for edge networks in different domains. Moreover, another novelty of this paper is that datasets used for the implementation of FL are discussed in detail to provide the researchers an overview of the distributed datasets, which can be used for employing FL techniques. Lastly, this study discusses the current challenges of implementing the FL technique. We have found that the areas of medical AI, IoT, edge systems, and the autonomous industry can adapt the FL in many of its sub-domains; however, the challenges these domains can encounter are statistical heterogeneity, system heterogeneity, data imbalance, resource allocation, and privacy.

ID OBSTACLE AVOIDANCE; ROBOTS
AB We present algorithms for environment exploration in the context of a habitat monitoring task, where the goal is to track radio-tagged invasive fish with autonomous surface or ground robots. The first task is navigation around an unknown obstacle using an input from a front-facing sonar. This capability is important for navigation on inland lakes, because plants and shallow shorelines are hard to map in advance. The second task involves energy harvesting for long-term operation. We address the problem of exploring the solar map of the environment which is used for energy-efficient navigation. For both problems, we present online algorithms and examine their performance using competitive analysis. In competitive analysis, the performance of an online algorithm is compared against the optimal offline algorithm. For obstacle avoidance, the offline algorithm knows the shape of the obstacle. For solar exploration, the offline algorithm knows the geometry of the shadow-casting objects. We obtain an O(1) competitive ratio for obstacle avoidance and an O(log n) competitive ratio for solar exploration, where n is the number of critical points to observe. The strategies for obstacle avoidance are validated through extensive field experiments, and the strategies for exploration are validated with simulations.
   Note to Practitioners-Most classical automation tasks take place in structured environments, such as factories and warehouses. Such environments can be mapped in advance. The maps in turn allow for the offline planning of trajectories. Mapping the environment in advance for automation tasks that take place in large outdoor environments can be challenging. Online exploration based on sensor feedback becomes necessary. In this paper, we study exploration problems for two subtasks of a habitat monitoring application. The first task is navigation around unknown obstacles. The second task is the exploration of shadow-casting obstacles for solar harvesting. For both problems, we present motion strategies with provable performance guarantees. Combined, these algorithms advance the state-of-the-art toward the goal of monitoring tracking wildlife and other dynamic phenomena with autonomous surface vehicles.

AB Recent work highlights the potential usefulness of MVM-based vectors as selective vehicles for cancer gene therapy (Dupont et al, Gene Therapy, 2000; 7: 790-796). To implement this strategy however, it is necessary to develop optimized methods for producing high-titer, helper-free parvovirus stocks. Recombinants of MVMp (rMVMp) are currently generated by transiently co-transfecting permissive cell lines with a plasmid carrying the vector genome and a helper plasmid expressing the capsid genes (replaced with a foreign gene in the vector genome). The resulting stocks, however, are always heavily contaminated with replication-competent viruses (RCV), which precludes their use in vivo and particularly in gene therapy. In the present work we have developed a second-generation MVMp-based vector system specifically designed to reduce the probability of RCV generation by homologous recombination. We have constructed a new MVMp-based vector and a new helper genome with minimal sequence overlap and have used the degeneracy of the genetic code to further decrease vector-helper homology. In this system, the left homologous region was almost completely eliminated and the right sequence overlap was reduced to 74 nt with only 61% homology. We were thus able to substantially reduce (similar to 200 x), but not completely eliminate, generation of contaminating viruses in medium-scale rMVMp preparations. Since the remaining sequence homology between the new vector and helper genomes is weak, our results suggest that contaminating viruses in this system are generated by nonhomologous recombination. It is important to note, unlike the autonomously replicating helper viruses produced from the first-generation vector/helper genomes, the contaminating viruses arising from the new packaging system cannot initiate secondary infection rounds (so they are not 'replication-competent viruses'). Our findings have important implications for the design of new MVMp-based vectors and for the construction of trans-complementing packaging cell lines.

AB Autonomous air combat technology of unmanned combat air vehicles (UCAVs) is a hot issue that is currently being studied by various countries, and maneuvering trajectory prediction is an important part of autonomous air combat research. To address the difficulty of maintaining high prediction accuracy and short prediction time simultaneously in maneuvering trajectory prediction, this paper proposes a maneuvering trajectory prediction method that is based on a layered strategy, which combines long-term maneuvering unit prediction and short-term maneuvering trajectory prediction. In long-term maneuvering unit prediction, the complex trajectory is divided into 21 types of maneuvering units using the four characteristics of maneuvering trajectories, and a maneuvering unit library is established. On the basis of the deep echo state network(DeepESN), to capture multiscale prediction input parameters, autoencoder (AE) technology is incorporated. In addition, to increase the prediction accuracy, adaptive boosting (Ada) learning technology is utilized to build a strong predictor, and seven prediction networks are compared. The results demonstrate that the proposed method realizes the highest prediction accuracy. The single-step prediction time is about 0.002 s, which meets the time requirement. In short-term maneuvering trajectory prediction, the long and short-term memory (LSTM) network is analyzed, and the gaussian random walk strategy particle swarm optimization (GWSPSO) algorithm is used to update the internal weights and biases of the network to overcome the problems of "gradient disappearance" and "gradient explosion", and a data sharing method is proposed for overcoming the no directionality of optimization algorithms. Compared with four traditional networks, the results demonstrate the method that is proposed in this paper performs better. Compared with the sampling time of 0.3 s, the short-term prediction time of 0.05 s can also meet the requirements. Finally, a long- and short-term layered prediction method is used on a group of complex maneuvering trajectories. The results demonstrate that the prediction accuracy is significantly increased and the real-time requirements are satisfied.

AB Rapidly random-exploring tree (RRT) and its variants are very popular due to their ability to quickly and efficiently explore the state space. However, they suffer sensitivity to the initial solution and slow convergence to the optimal solution, which means that they consume a lot of memory and time to find the optimal path. It is critical to quickly find a short path in many applications such as the autonomous vehicle with limited power/fuel. To overcome these limitations, we propose a novel optimal path planning algorithm based on the convolutional neural network (CNN), namely the neural RRT* (NRRT*). The NRRT* utilizes a nonuniform sampling distribution generated from a CNN model. The model is trained using quantities of successful path planning cases. In this article, we use the A* algorithm to generate the training data set consisting of the map information and the optimal path. For a given task, the proposed CNN model can predict the probability distribution of the optimal path on the map, which is used to guide the sampling process. The time cost and memory usage of the planned path are selected as the metric to demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of the NRRT*. The simulation results reveal that the NRRT* can achieve convincing performance compared with the state-of-the-art path planning algorithms. Note to Practitioners-The motivation of this article stems from the need to develop a fast and efficient path planning algorithm for practical applications such as autonomous driving, warehouse robot, and countless others. Sampling-based algorithms are widely used in these areas due to their good scalability and high efficiency. However, the quality of the initial path is not guaranteed and it takes much time to converge to the optimal path. To quickly obtain a high-quality initial path and accelerate the convergence speed, we propose the NRRT*. It utilizes a nonuniform sampling distribution and achieves better performance. The NRRT* can be also applied to other sampling-based algorithms for improved results in different applications.

TI Prioritized Planning Algorithms for Trajectory Coordination of Multiple

SO IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON AUTOMATION SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING

DE Collision avoidance; decentralized algorithms; multirobot systems;
   trajectory planning
AB In autonomous multirobot systems one of the concerns is how to prevent collisions between the individual robots. One approach to this problem involves finding coordinated trajectories from start to destination for all the robots and then letting the robots follow the preplanned coordinated trajectories. A widely used practical method for finding such coordinated trajectories is "classical" prioritized planning, where robots plan sequentially one after another. This method has been shown to be effective in practice, but it is incomplete (i.e., there are solvable problem instances that the algorithm fails to solve) and it has not yet been formally analyzed under what circumstances is the method guaranteed to succeed. Further, prioritized planning is a centralized algorithm, which makes the method unsuitable for decentralized multirobot systems.
   The contributions of this paper are: a) an adapted version of classical prioritized planning called revised prioritized planning with a formal characterization of a class of instances that are provably solvable by this algorithm and b) an asynchronous decentralized variant of both classical and revised prioritized planning together with a formal analysis showing that the algorithm terminates and inherits completeness properties from its centralized counterpart.
   The experimental evaluation performed in simulation on real-world indoor maps shows that: a) the revised version of prioritized planning reliably solves a wide class of instances on which both classical prioritized planning and popular reactive technique ORCA fail and b) the asynchronous decentralized implementation of classical and revised prioritized planning finds solution in large multirobot teams up to 2x-faster than the previously proposed synchronized decentralized approach.
   Note to Practitioners-Consider a large warehouse in which the goods are stored and retrieved by autonomous mobile robots. One way to deal with possible collisions between the robots is to ignore interactions between the vehicles during the route planning for each robot and handle the conflicts only during the route execution. However, such an approach is prone to deadlocks, i.e., to situations during which some of the robots mutually block each other, cannot proceed and fail to complete their transportation task. An alternative approach would involve planning collision-free routes for each robot before the robots start executing them. However, the current methods that guarantee ability to find a solution to any such coordination problem are not applicable in practice due to their high computational complexity. Instead, a simple and computationally efficient approach in which robots plan their routes sequentially one after another (classical prioritized planning) is often used for finding coordinated trajectories even though the algorithm is known to fail on many dense problem instances. In this paper, we show that a simple adaptation of this classical algorithm called revised prioritized planning is guaranteed to find collision-free trajectories for a well-defined class of practical problems. In particular, if the system resembles human-made transport infrastructures by requiring that the start and destination position of each vehicle must never obstruct other vehicles from moving, then the proposed approach is guaranteed to provide a solution. For instance, in our warehouse multirobot system example, the collision-free routes can be efficiently computed by the revised prioritized planning approach. This paper formally characterizes the problem instances for which the method is guaranteed to succeed.
   Further, we propose a new asynchronous decentralized adaptation of both classical and revised prioritized algorithm that can be used in multirobot systems without a central solver. This technique can be used to find coordinated trajectories just by running a simple asynchronous negotiation protocol between the individual robots. This paper provides an analysis showing that the asynchronous decentralized implementations of classical and revised prioritized planning exhibit desirable theoretical properties and an experimental comparison of performance of different variations of centralized and decentralized prioritized planning algorithms.

AB In this work, we propose a route planning strategy for heterogeneous mobile robots in Precision Agriculture (PA) settings. Given a set of agricultural tasks to be performed at specific locations, we formulate a multi-Steiner Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP) to define the optimal assignment of these tasks to the robots as well as the respective optimal paths to be followed. The optimality criterion aims to minimize the total time required to execute all the tasks, as well as the cumulative execution times of the robots. Costs for travelling from one location to another, for maneuvering and for executing the task as well as limited energy capacity of the robots are considered. In addition, we propose a sub-optimal formulation to mitigate the computational complexity by leveraging the fact that generally in PA settings only a few locations require agricultural tasks in a certain period of interest compared to all possible locations in the field. A formal analysis of the optimality gap between the optimal and the sub-optimal formulations is provided. The effectiveness of the approach is validated in a simulated orchard where three heterogeneous aerial vehicles perform inspection tasks. Note to Practitioners-This paper aims at providing an efficient solution to PA needs by deploying a team of robots able to perform agricultural tasks at given locations in large-scale orchards. In particular, a novel general optimization problem is proposed that, given a set of mobile and possibly heterogeneous robots and a set of agricultural tasks to carry out, defines the assignment of these tasks to the robots as well as the routes to follow, while minimizing the total and the cumulative execution times of the robots. Existing approaches for route optimization in PA generally involves complete coverage of the field by one or multiple robots and do not account for maneuvering costs with general layouts of the field. We consider costs for travelling from one location to another, for executing the task and for maneuvering without any restriction on the layout of the plants as well as we take into account the limited energy capacity of the robots. We also provide a sub-optimal formulation which reduces the computational burden by relaxing the optimization of the maneuvering costs at the locations where agricultural tasks are carried out and formally derive the optimality gap. The proposed approach is flexible and can be easily adapted to any PA setting involving multiple mobile robots that are required to accomplish given tasks in an area of interest. We validate its effectiveness in a realistic simulated setup composed of three heterogeneous aerial vehicles performing inspection tasks. In future research, we aim to design algorithms to solve the proposed optimization problems in an efficient manner as well as to validate the formulations on real-world robotic platforms.

AB Objective: Autonomous emergency braking (AEB) is a safety system that detects imminent forward collisions and reacts by slowing down the host vehicle without any action from the driver. AEB effectiveness in avoiding and mitigating real-world crashes has recently been demonstrated. Research suggests that a translation of AEB to powered 2-wheelers could also be beneficial. Previous studies have estimated the effects of a motorcycle AEB system (MAEB) via computer simulations. Though effects of MAEB were computed for motorcycle crashes derived from in-depth crash investigation, there may be some inaccuracies due to limitations of postcrash investigation (e.g., inaccuracies in preimpact velocity of the motorcycle). Furthermore, ideal MAEB technology was assumed, which may lead to overestimation of the benefits. This study sought to evaluate the sensitivity of the simulations to variations in reconstructed crash cases and the capacity of the MAEB system in order to provide a more robust estimation of MAEB effects.Methods: First, a comprehensive classification of accidents was used to identify scenarios in which MAEB was likely to apply, and representative crash cases from those available for this study were populated for each crash scenario. Second, 100 variant cases were generated by randomly varying a set of simulation parameters with given normal distributions around the baseline values. Variants reflected uncertainties in the original data. Third, the effects of MAEB were estimated in terms of the difference in the impact speed of the host motorcycle with and without the system via computer simulations of each variant case. Simulations were repeated assuming both an idealized and a realistic MAEB system. For each crash case, the results in the baseline case and in the variants were compared.A total of 36 crash cases representing 11 common crash scenarios were selected from 3 Australian in-depth data sets: 12 cases from New South Wales, 13 cases from Victoria, and 11 cases from South Australia.Results: The reduction in impact speed elicited by MAEB in the baseline cases ranged from 2.8 to 10.0km/h. The baseline cases over- or underestimated the mean impact speed reduction of the variant cases by up to 20%. Constraints imposed by simulating more realistic capabilities for an MAEB system produced a decrease in the estimated impact speed reduction of up to 14% (mean 5%) compared to an idealized system.Conclusions: The small difference between the baseline and variant case results demonstrates that the potential effects of MAEB computed from the cases described in in-depth crash reports are typically a good approximation, despite limitations of postcrash investigation. Furthermore, given that MAEB intervenes very close to the point of impact, limitations of the currently available technologies were not found to have a dramatic influence on the effects of the system.

TI Aerobraking at Venus: A science and technology enabler

ID IMPACT CRATERS; MARS
AB Venus remains one of the great unexplored planets in our solar system, with key questions remaining on the evolution of its atmosphere and climate, its volatile cycles, and the thermal and magmatic evolution of its surface. One potential approach toward answering these questions is to fly a reconnaissance mission that uses a multi-mode radar in a near-circular, low-altitude orbit of similar to 400 km and 60-70 degrees inclination. This type of mission profile results in a total mission delta-V of similar to 4.4 km/s. Aerobraking could provide a significant portion, potentially up to half, of this energy transfer, thereby permitting more mass to be allocated to the spacecraft and science payload or facilitating the use of smaller, cheaper launch vehicles.
   Aerobraking at Venus also provides additional science benefits through the measurement of upper atmospheric density (recovered from accelerometer data) and temperature values, especially near the terminator where temperature changes are abrupt and constant pressure levels drop dramatically in altitude from day to night.
   Scientifically rich, Venus is also an ideal location for implementing aerobraking techniques. Its thick lower atmosphere and slow planet rotation result in relatively more predictable atmospheric densities than Mars. The upper atmosphere (aerobraking altitudes) of Venus has a density variation of 8% compared to Mars' 30% variability. In general, most aerobraking missions try to minimize the duration of the aerobraking phase to keep costs down. These short phases have limited margin to account for contingencies. It is the stable and predictive nature of Venus' atmosphere that provides safer aerobraking opportunities.
   The nature of aerobraking at Venus provides ideal opportunities to demonstrate aerobraking enhancements and techniques yet to be used at Mars, such as flying a temperature corridor (versus a heat-rate corridor) and using a thermal-response surface algorithm and autonomous aerobraking, shifting many daily ground activities to onboard the spacecraft. A defined aerobraking temperature corridor, based on spacecraft component maximum temperatures, can be employed on a spacecraft specifically designed for aerobraking, and will predict subsequent aerobraking orbits and prescribe apoapsis propulsive maneuvers to maintain the spacecraft within its specified temperature limits. A spacecraft specifically designed for aerobraking in the Venus environment can provide a cost-effective platform for achieving these expanded science and technology goals.
   This paper discusses the scientific merits of a low-altitude, near-circular orbit at Venus, highlights the differences in aerobraking at Venus versus Mars, and presents design data using a flight system specifically designed for an aerobraking mission at Venus. Using aerobraking to achieve a low altitude orbit at Venus may pave the way for various technology demonstrations, such as autonomous aerobraking techniques and/or new science measurements like a multi-mode, synthetic aperture radar capable of altimetry and radiometry with performance that is significantly more capable than Magellan.

AB Accurate localization is crucial in the navigation of mobile robots. However, in other circumstances, single-sensor localization faces different challenges, including software and hardware problems or data outages. Sensor fusion is used in most autonomous vehicles (including aerial and ground vehicles) to overcome such challenges. In this paper, the localization of a mobile robot is studied in the presence of sensor faults. The mobile robot has two sensors: two Inertial Measurement Units (IMU) and wheel encoders. Regarding the fault-tolerant scheme, measurements of both sets of sensors are fused using an Interacting Multiple Model (IMM) Kalman filter based on both unscented and extended Kalman filters (UKF and EKF). UKF and EKF-based IMM are chosen for this study since the dynamic model of the localization is highly nonlinear. Regarding contributions, it should be noted that this scheme eliminates the need to model every single fault scenario and use an additional sensor to oversee the performance of the sensing system. Also, comparing this method with similar approaches adopted by other studies shows better performance regarding the cost of computations and RMSE. To evaluate performance, the outputs of the proposed filters are simulated and compared for different trajectories where the data of each sensor is intentionally corrupted to observe the fault detection capability. Simulations are performed for different trajectories and noises to demonstrate this method's efficiency in different situations. In addition, the results of unscented and extended Kalman filter-based IMM are compared in terms of error and computational costs to evaluate their performance. Overall, simulation and experiments indicate accurate 3D estimations in all cases. Moreover, designated weights vividly show that sensor fault detection is achieved by both unscented and extended IMM Kalman filters, which enable complete fault isolation consequently. This approach provides mobile robots with a reliable and straightforward sensor fault detection and localization solution.(c) 2022 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB A two-dimensional computational study is performed in the present work to simulate two NACA 0012 (National Advisory Committee for Aeronautics) airfoils pitching in a side-by-side configuration at Reynolds Number (Re) 12,000. An auxiliary airfoil with a smaller size is used to enhance the efficiency of the main airfoil. The thrust and lift coefficients of the main airfoil are quantified and compared with an isolated pitching airfoil for a range of reduced frequencies (k = 1 to 8) and phase differences (Phi = 0 degrees to 180 degrees) between the airfoils. The thrust force increases gradually with a maximum enhancement at an intermediate phase difference (Phi) between the airfoils and decreases further. The simulations cover three main flow regimes depending upon the vortex structure shed by the airfoils, i.e. (i) when both airfoil shed von Karman (KV) vortex street (ii) auxiliary airfoil sheds von Karman whereas main airfoil sheds reverse von Karman (RKV) vortex street (iii) both airfoil sheds reverse von Karman vortex street. The numerical results reveal that an auxiliary airfoil significantly changes the main airfoil's hydrodynamic characteristics compared to an isolated airfoil. Maximum thrust enhancement of 23% and maximum efficiency enhancement of 49.2% are obtained compared to an isolated airfoil. The phase difference significantly impacts the propulsive efficiency of auxiliary foil, whereas its influence is marginal on the main foil. The interaction of different wake structures shed by the auxiliary, and the main airfoil leads to the formation of the deflected jet. The jet deflection and wake width are quantified to understand the influence of an auxiliary airfoil in a side-by-side configuration with the main airfoil. The finding of this study is expected to provide new insight for developing and enhancing the performance of hydrodynamic propulsive systems by adding an auxiliary airfoil. (C) 2022 Elsevier Ltd.

AB The present article outlines the core technologies needed to realize the Hyperloop transportation system (HTS). Currently, the HTS vacuum tube train concept is viewed as the fastest way to cross the earth's surface. However, the concept has not yet been demonstrated for subsonic or near-sonic speeds in large-scale implementations. Among the challenging technical areas are the tube's depressurization, the capsule's air resistance, and choked flows occurring around the capsule. There is also a need for effective levitation and propulsion solutions compatible with the velocities being proposed. Moreover, several conflicting objectives have been identified in the HTS design. It is highlighted that the tubes should be wide enough to lower the capsule's drag forces but that a large-sized tube comes at the expense of higher operational energy costs and infrastructure investments. Another struggle is aiming at a low-cost passive track design and, and at the same time, a lightweight vehicle. One technical path is to turn the whole guideway into an electric propulsor, arriving at a 'lightweight capsule solution' (LCS). Alternatively, the vehicle could be transformed into a 'modified airplane' that stores massive amounts of onboard energy, yielding an energy-autonomous 'low infrastructure solution' (LIS). In a case study, it is shown that even LIS technology is compatible with short-haul flights (1500 km) but that it requires an energy reservoir of about 30% of the capsule's overall mass. Results and discussions presented in this paper are supported by analytical predictions with parameters or input data either supported by referred simulations or experiments. In general, the paper aims to open up the discussion, provide a sufficient understanding of the Hyperloop field's multidisciplinary aspects, and establish a foundation for further investigations. In the end, new research tasks have been defined, which have the potential to go beyond the state of current knowledge.

AB Soccer is the most popular group game; it has a large number of fans all over the world. Although each complete soccer match lasts around one hour and a half, only have very few scenes attracting audiences been perfectly filmed. This filming has usually been done using static (fixed) cameras, and they cannot provide the same level of accuracy or entertainment given by mobile devices. Taking into our consideration that there are no schemes using mobile devices have been proposed to solve this problem till now. As periodic communication generates a huge amount of data; typical storage, computation, and communication resources are required. Hence, this paper aims at introducing a Fog computing mechanism that takes into consideration the requitrements of special mobility, low latency and location awareness. Our solution based on controlling the movement of mobile cameras mounted on a fleet of mobile bees. A bee is an autonomous camera-drone, which gives the audience the feeling of being a part of such sports competition. It is a special type of Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) equipped with a built-in processing unit, memory, high-speed camera and transceiver. The bee has the ability to film the movement of the ball, which has to be followed and filmed via object tracking principle. In fact, detecting and tracking the ball from the broadcast soccer video constitute a major challenge. In soccer matches, the ball moves most of the time and it is frequently occluded while its size and shape appearance vary over the time and between cameras. Moreover, the feature-based tracking methods are used to judge whether or not a sole object is the target as the features of the ball might be changed fast over frames and then we cannot manage to distinguish the ball from other objects by using these methods. Thus, the current study demonstrates an innovative technique for tracking a soccer ball from mobile cameras fixed on multiple ball bees.

AB Humans are considered as a system in the design of any deep space exploration mission. The addition of many potential near asteroid (NEA) destinations to the existing multiple mission architecture for Lunar and Mars missions increases the complexity of human health and performance issues that are anticipated for exploration of space. We suggest that risks to human health and performance be analyzed in terms of the 4 major parameters related to multiple mission architecture: destination, duration, distance and vehicle design. Geological properties of the NEA will influence design of exploration tasks related to sample handling and containment, and extravehicular activity (EVA) capabilities including suit ports and tools. A robotic precursor mission that collects basic information on NEA surface properties would reduce uncertainty about these aspects of the mission as well as aid in mission architecture and exploration task design. Key mission parameters are strongly impacted by duration and distance. The most critical of these is deep-space radiation exposure without even the temporary shielding of a nearby large planetary body. The current space radiation permissible exposure limits (PEL) limits mission duration to 3-10 months depending on age, gender and stage of the solar cycle. Duration also impacts mission architectures including countermeasures for bone, muscle, and cardiovascular atrophy during continuous weightlessness; and behavioral and psychological issues resulting from isolation and confinement. Distance affects communications and limits abort and return options for a NEA mission. These factors are anticipated to have important effects on crew function and autonomous operations, as well as influence medical capability, supplies and training requirements of the crew. The design of a habitat volume that can maintain the physical and psychological health of the crew and support mission operations with limited intervention from earth will require an integrated research and development effort between NASA's Human Research Program (HRP), engineering and human factors groups. Packaging food to extend shelf life and waste management will be important components of vehicle subsystem design. (C) 2012 IAA. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Smart cities have emerged as a specialized domain encompassing various technologies, transitioning from civil engineering to technology-driven solutions. The accelerated development of technologies, such as the Internet of Things (IoT), software-defined networks (SDN), 5G, artificial intelligence, cognitive science, and analytics, has played a crucial role in providing solutions for smart cities. Smart cities heavily rely on devices, ad hoc networks, and cloud computing to integrate and streamline various activities towards common goals. However, the complexity arising from multiple cloud service providers offering myriad services necessitates a stable and coherent platform for sustainable operations. The Smart City Operational Platform Ecology (SCOPE) model has been developed to address the growing demands, and incorporates machine learning, cognitive correlates, ecosystem management, and security. SCOPE provides an ecosystem that establishes a balance for achieving sustainability and progress. In the context of smart cities, Internet of Things (IoT) devices play a significant role in enabling automation and data capture. This research paper focuses on a specific module of SCOPE, which deals with data processing and learning mechanisms for object identification in smart cities. Specifically, it presents a car parking system that utilizes smart identification techniques to identify vacant slots. The learning controller in SCOPE employs a two-tier approach, and utilizes two different models, namely Alex Net and YOLO, to ensure procedural stability and improvement.

TI BOHA: A High Performance VSLAM Backend Optimization Hardware Accelerator

ID VERSATILE
AB Visual simultaneous localization and mapping (VSLAM) technology has been used in many intelligent applications such autonomous car, unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) and augmented reality (AR) for localization and trajectory generation. The VSLAM usually contains the frontend computation and the backend optimization. The backend optimization is an essential part of VSLAM which helps improve the precision and dominates the computation time (similar to 80%) of VSLAM. However, it includes large inner data dependency which is difficult to be accelerated using GPU. To address this issue, in this brief, we propose a high performance VSLAM backend optimization hardware accelerator (named BOHA). Diverse design techniques have been proposed to reduce computation latency by avoiding the data redundancy in the backend optimization, including 1) a recursive fine-grain H-matrix decomposition computing architecture to improve the hardware utilization and reduce the data movement. 2) an early-computing technique with approximate linear solver to reduce the computation latency while maintaining high precision. 3) a two-stage deep Schur elimination technique to reduce the computation latency. The proposed design has been implemented and evaluated on a Xilinx FPGA ZCU104 and achieves low computation latency (5.1 ms) with low trajectory error (0.27%), outperforming the state-of-the-art designs.

AB We study a shuttle-based storage and retrieval system with two independent lifts shared in a single mast. In such a system, two lifts move simultaneously but cannot pass each other, and each retrieval request is finished with the cooperation of a lift and a shuttle. Therefore, given a set of retrieval requests, the retrieval request scheduling problem consists of determining the sequence in which the requests are retrieved and assigning each request to a lift with the objective of minimizing the makespan, considering both the lift-lift interaction and lift shuttle interaction. The problem is formulated as a mixed-integer programming model and proved to be NP-hard. We propose a decomposition-based adaptive large neighborhood search heuristic to quickly compute near-optimal solutions, using the property that the assignment of requests to lifts for a given retrieval sequence can be exactly solved in polynomial time by a dynamic programming approach. Numerical results indicate that our algorithm achieves a lower makespan than the methods proposed in the literature and used in practice. We also apply the proposed algorithm using real data to a realistic setting that considers multiple planning horizons, showing that it significantly outperforms the policy the company currently uses.

AB Autonomous underwater vehicles perceive environmental information relying on vision. However, the variety of the underwater environment always leads to image distortion. To effectively obtain color-corrected images that guarantee high sharpness and good content recovery, this paper proposes an algorithm based on deep learning networks. Our method is a modified version of generative adversarial networks for underwater image enhancement. Due to the complexity of the underwater environment, the green hue in the image is uneven, and the existing methods cannot recover the uneven green hue image well. Using our model, we generate corresponding depth estimation maps, along with the real underwater images, as inputs to the generator for color correction of monocular underwater images. The depth estimation maps, which are considered as image noise in the input, helps to distinguish the region of interest from the background. Furthermore, we formulate an objective function through several different loss functions, which can evaluate image quality globally. In addition, we performed training on the EUVP dataset, the comparison results show that our method is superior to other methods. Finally, we conduct extensive experiments on EUVP, UIEB and UFO-120 datasets, where our model not only significantly improves the quality of the underwater images, but also performs well over the state-of-the-art methods.

AB Emerging autonomous vehicles equip multiple high-throughput sensors to enable automatic driving, such as multiline lidars and high-definition cameras. Existing automotive embedded systems usually employ software stacks to receive and preprocess high-throughput sensor data, which brings high latency and CPU consumption. Most research is devoted to accelerators for data processing but ignores the latency overhead caused by sensor data access. Therefore, this article proposes SENTunnel to build fast path from sensors to the corresponding processing units by offloading redundant software stacks into hardware. Specifically, SENTunnel builds fast path for sensor data access to processors/accelerators through two hardware modules. First, the unified access module is used to receive, parse, and transmit raw sensor data. Second, SENTunnel performs necessary preprocessing of different sensor data with the preprocessors module. Based on the design of SENTunnel, we implement a prototype for accessing the data of multiline lidars to the processor and a dedicated accelerator on FPGA. Experimental results indicate that SENTunnel reduces the latency by 55.5% for the data path to processors and reduces the CPU usage caused by the preprocessing driver by 45.9% on average. Compared to the original and partially offloaded data path to accelerators, SENTunnel reduces the latency by 93.8% and 93%, respectively, and eliminates the CPU costs.

AB Inertial navigation systems (INSs) are widely used for autonomous underwater vehicle navigation, with excellent short-term precision. However, the positioning error of an INS accumulates with time. It is imperative to adopt other approaches to mitigate drift errors, especially for long-term sailing tasks. To that end, underwater terrain-based navigation (TBN) is effective in bounding the drift errors. In particular, the particle filtering (PF) method is extensively employed in TBN to tackle the highly nonlinear measurement equation. In our previous work, the statistical properties of the digital terrain model gradient were exploited and we proposed the use of three probability density functions to characterize the normalized data, i.e. Gaussian, gamma and Weibull distributions. In this paper, the likelihood was modified according to the gradient fitting results, i.e. an optimal distribution selection. Moreover, to prevent the measurement data with large gradients from generating particles with lower weights, a pre-screen procedure was proposed to stabilize particle filter sampling. As shown and demonstrated in simulations, our proposed improved PF method outperforms the comparative ones in terms of root mean square error and standard deviation, as well as accuracy, especially for long-term sailing tasks. In terms of computational cost, a smaller number of measurement data are employed and the proposed method is faster than the standard PF method.

AB Objective: Poor seat belt fit can result in submarining behavior and injuries to the lower extremity and abdomen. While previous studies have explored seat belt fit relative to skeletal landmarks using palpation, medical imaging remains the gold standard for visualizing and locating skeletal landmarks and soft tissues. The goal of this study was to create a method to image automotive postures and seat belt fit from the pelvis to the clavicle using an Upright Open MRI.
   Methods: The posture and belt fit of 10 volunteers (5M, 5F) were measured in an Acura TLX in each subject's preferred driving posture and a standard reclined posture, and then reproduced in a custom non-ferromagnetic seat replica in the MR scanner with an MRI-visible seat belt. The MRI sequence and coil placement were designed to yield clear visualization of bone, soft tissue borders, and the seat belt markers in separate scans of the pelvis, lumbar, thoracolumbar, and thoracic regions. A process was developed to precisely register the scans, and methods for digitizing spinal and pelvic landmarks were established to quantify belt fit.
   Conclusions: This method creates opportunities to study variation in seat belt fit in different automotive postures, for occupants of different sexes, ages, BMIs, anthropometries, and for pregnant occupants.

AB An airship is lighter than an air vehicle with enormous potential in applications such as communication, aerial inspection, border surveillance, and precision agriculture. An airship model is made up of dynamic, aerodynamic, aerostatic, and propulsive forces. However, the computation of aerodynamic forces remained a challenge. In addition to aerodynamic model deficiencies, airship mass matrix suffers from parameter variations. Moreover, due to the lighter-than-air nature, it is also susceptible to wind disturbances. These modeling issues are the key challenges in developing an efficient autonomous flight controller for an airship. This article proposes a unified estimation method for airship states, model uncertainties, and wind disturbance estimation using Unscented Kalman Filter (UKF). The proposed method is based on a lumped model uncertainty vector that unifies model uncertainties and wind disturbances in a single vector. The airship model is extended by incorporating six auxiliary state variables into the lumped model uncertainty vector. The performance of the proposed methodology is evaluated using a nonlinear simulation model of a custom-developed UETT airship and is validated by conducting a kind of error analysis. For comparative studies, EKF estimator is also developed. The results show the performance superiority of the proposed estimator over EKF; however, the proposed estimator is a bit expensive on computational grounds. However, as per the requirements of the current application, the proposed estimator can be a preferred choice.

AB Efficient and reliable underwater sonar image transmission is increasingly desired for underwater investigation by autonomous underwater vehicles (AUV). However, it is extremely challenging due to the severe interference nature of underwater acoustic channels and the large data size of sonar images. In this paper, we first combine multicarrier modulation techniques with characteristics of compressed sonar image data to improve the transmission performance, where in previous research, image compression and multicarrier modulation were investigated separately. The compressed bitstream of sonar images is regarded as a new type of image with unique frequency characteristic. A non-uniform non-orthogonal multicarrier modulation scheme based on frequency characteristics of compressed sonar image data (F-NNMC) is proposed to meet the requirements of efficient and reliable sonar image transmission. The non-orthogonality between subcarriers improves the spectrum efficiency, and the non-uniform subcarrier structure can carry more effective information of the transmitted compressed data to improve the reliability. The simulation and experiment show that the proposed F-NNMC needs less frequency resource and has better peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR), structural similarity (SSIM), as well as lower bit error rate (BER) compared to orthogonal and non-orthogonal modulations.

TI Collaborative driving style classification method enabled by majority
   voting ensemble learning for enhancing classification performance
SO PLOS ONE
LA English
DT Article
AB The classification of driving styles plays a fundamental role in evaluating drivers' driving behaviors, which is of great significance to traffic safety. However, it still suffers from various challenges, including the insufficient accuracy of the model, the large amount of training parameters, the instability of classification results, and some others. To evaluate the driving behaviors accurately and efficiently, and to study the differences of driving behaviors among various vehicle drivers, a collaborative driving style classification method, which is enabled by ensemble learning and divided into pre-classification and classification, is proposed in this paper. In the pre-classification process, various clustering algorithms are utilized compositely to label some typical initial data with specific labels as aggressive, stable and conservative. Then, in the classification process, other unlabeled data can be classified accurately and efficiently by the majority voting ensemble learning method incorporating three different conventional classifiers. The availability and efficiency of the proposed method are demonstrated through some simulation experiments, in which the proposed collaborative classification method achieves quite good and stable performance on driving style classification. Particularly, compared with some other similar classification methods, the evaluation indicators of the proposed method, including accuracy, precision, recall and F-measure, are improved by 1.49%, 2.90%, 5.32% and 4.49% respectively, making it the best overall performance. Therefore, the proposed method is much preferred for the autonomous driving and usage-based insurance.

AB This paper presents a human-robot interaction (HRI) study of a dedicated Mission Specialist interface for performing telemanipulation tasks using a small unoccupied aerial vehicle (UAV). Current literature suggests that the successful completion of aerial manipulation tasks in real-world environments requires human input due to challenges in autonomous perception and control. Visual information of the remote environment in a telemanipulation interface can significantly affect performance under direct control; however, the effects of interface visualizations on task performance have not been studied for UAV telemanipulation. This work evaluated the effects of interface viewpoint on aerial manipulation task performance. The interfaces evaluated in this study included video streams from cameras located onboard the UAV, including: (i) a manipulator egocentric view, (ii) a manipulator exocentric view, and (iii) a combination of egocentric and exocentric views. A total of 36 participants completed three different manipulation tasks using all three interface conditions. The observations and results showed that both the exocentric and mixed view configurations contributed to improved task performance over an egocentric-only interface. Further, this study resulted in data regarding view use, view effectiveness, and task type that can be used for further developing interfacing for aerial manipulators that change and adapt to the environment and task.

AB This paper investigates the control of a massive population of UAVs such as drones. The straightforward method of control of UAVs by considering the interactions among them to make a flock requires a huge inter-UAV communication which is impossible to implement in real-time applications. One method of control is to apply the mean field game (MFG) framework which substantially reduces communications among the UAVs. However, to realize this framework, powerful processors are required to obtain the control laws at different UAVs. This requirement limits the usage of the MFG framework for real-time applications such as massive UAV control. Thus, a function approximator based on neural networks (NN) is utilized to approximate the solutions of Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman (HJB) and Fokker-Planck-Kolmogorov (FPK) equations. Nevertheless, using an approximate solution can violate the conditions for convergence of the MFG framework. Therefore, the federated learning (FL) approach which can share the model parameters of NNs at drones, is proposed with NN based MFG to satisfy the required conditions. The stability analysis of the NN based MFG approach is presented and the performance of the proposed FL-MFG is elaborated by the simulations.

AB Building a human-like car-following model that can accurately simulate drivers' car-following behaviors is helpful to the development of driving assistance systems and autonomous driving. Recent studies have shown the advantages of applying reinforcement learning methods in car-following modeling. However, a problem has remained where it is difficult to manually determine the reward function. This paper proposes a novel car-following model based on generative adversarial imitation learning. The proposed model can learn the strategy from drivers' demonstrations without specifying the reward. Gated recurrent units was incorporated in the actor-critic network to enable the model to use historical information. Drivers' car-following data collected by a test vehicle equipped with a millimeter-wave radar and controller area network acquisition card was used. The participants were divided into two driving styles by K-means with time-headway and time-headway when braking used as input features. Adopting five-fold cross-validation for model evaluation, the results show that the proposed model can reproduce drivers' car-following trajectories and driving styles more accurately than the intelligent driver model and the recurrent neural network-based model, with the lowest average spacing error (19.40%) and speed validation error (5.57%), as well as the lowest Kullback-Leibler divergences of the two indicators used for driving style clustering.

AB Emerging Vehicle-to-Everything (V2X) applications such as Advanced Driver Assistance Systems (ADAS) and Connected and Autonomous Driving (CAD) requires an excessive amount of data by vehicular sensors, collected, processed, and exchanged in real-time. A heterogeneous wireless network is envisioned where multiple Radio Access Technologies (RATs) can coexist to cater for these and other future applications. The primary challenge in such systems is the Radio Resource Management (RRM) strategy and the RAT selection algorithm. In this article, a Hybrid Vehicular Network (HVN) architecture and protocol stack is proposed, which combines Dedicated Short-Range Communication (DSRC) technology-enabled ad hoc network and infrastructure-based Cellular V2X (C-V2X) technologies. To this end, we address the design and performance evaluation of a distributed RRM entity that manages and coordinates Radio Resources (RR) in both RATs. Central to distributed RRM are adaptive RAT selection and Vertical Handover (VHO) algorithms supported by two procedures. (1) Measurement of Quality of Service (QoS) parameters and associated criteria to select the suitable RAT according to the network conditions. (2) Dynamic communication management (DCM) via implementing RR-QoS negotiation. The simulation results show the effectiveness of the proposed architecture and protocol suite under various parameter settings and performance metrics such as the number of VHOs, packet delivery ratio, and throughput, and latency.

AB Transport innovations and technological improvements have increased attention to specific techniques of communications, such as millimeter-wave radars used in autonomous vehicles (AVs). In order to improve the performance of antijamming capability of a millimeter-wave radar, the suppression of interference using random functions is widely used in current applications. However, the main limitation of this method is that it lack a mechanism to withstand message replaying attack, forgery attack, Masquerade attack, and guessing and stolen verifier attack. In this paper, we propose an antijamming method based on a hash function to provide a secure antijamming solution with a stronger ability to suppress the interference echoes and flexible controls. The associated techniques include digital radio frequency memory (DRFM), millimeter-wave radar, and hash value processing. Three types of experiments are performed to achieve 32.87%similar to 38.34% improvement in terms of the peak difference between the true and false targets, and the results are reported and analyzed in this paper. In each of the experiments, different variables are tested by the controlled variable method, and the experimental results are compared. On this occasion, it is concluded that the modulation signal based on the hash function has a stronger ability to suppress the interference echoes than that based on the pseudorandom function.

ID AUTOMATIC TARGET RECOGNITION
AB Underwater automatic target recognition (ATR) is a challenging task for marine robots due to the complex environment. The existing recognition methods basically use hand-crafted features and classifiers to recognize targets, which are difficult to achieve ideal recognition accuracy. In this paper, we proposed a novel method to realize accurate multiclass underwater ATR by using forward-looking sonar-Echoscope and deep convolutional neural networks (DCNNs). A complete recognition process from data preprocessing to network training and image recognition was realized. Firstly, we established a real, measured Echoscope sonar image dataset. Inspired by the human visual attention mechanism, the suspected target region was extracted via the graph-based manifold ranking method in image preprocessing. Secondly, an end-to-end DCNNs model, named EchoNet, was designed for Echoscope sonar image feature extraction and recognition. Finally, a network training method based on transfer learning was developed to solve the problem of insufficient training data, and mini-batch gradient descent was used for network optimization. Experimental results demonstrated that our method can implement efficiently, and the recognition accuracy on a nine-class underwater ATR task reached 97.3%, outperforming traditional feature-based methods. The proposed method is expected to be a potential novel technology for the intelligent perception of autonomous underwater vehicles.

AB In this letter, we build on recent advances in deep learning to improve SE(3) transformations, enabling more accurate motion estimation in mobile robots. We propose using denoising autoencoders (DAEs) to address the challenges presented by modern LIDARs. Our proposed approach is comprised of two stages: a novel pre-processing stage for robust feature identification and a scan matching stage for motion estimation. In the pre-processing stage, LIDAR data are projected into a two-dimensional (2-D) image format and a DAE is used to extract salient features. These features are used as a mask for the original data, which is then re-projected into full 3-D space. Scan matching is performed on the re-projected data to estimate motion in SE(3). We analyze the performance of our approach using the real-world data from the University of Michigan North Campus long-term vision and LIDAR dataset and test generalization on LIDAR data from the KITTI dataset. We show that our approach generalizes across domains, is capable of reducing the per-estimate error of standard iterative closest point (ICP) methods on average by 25.5% for the translational component and 57.53% for the rotational component, and is capable of reducing the computation time of state-of-the-art ICP methods by a factor of 7.94 on average while achieving competitive performance.

AB This paper focuses on the application of low-cost sensors for autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV). We propose an intelligent assistance positioning methodology by combining the modified incremental smoothing and mapping (iSAM) and constrained optimally pruned extreme learning machine (OP-ELM) for low-cost sensors, which makes full use of GPS data and produce a variety of correction models. Compared to relinearizing and variable reordering by period batch step in the original iSAM, modified iSAM is implemented variable reordering alone and conducted adaptive relinearization when the value of local Chi-square exceeded a certain threshold. Meanwhile, a novel constrained OP-ELM is presented by mapping the output to the constraint space, which provides full guarantee for generating reliable correction model. When GPS is valid, the constrained OP-ELM is applied to the low-cost sensors to generate correction model. Simultaneous, the correction model of measurement for modified iSAM is also given by this way. Once GPS becomes invalid, the correction models are used to amend the low-cost sensors data and measurement model for getting more accurate location information. Experimental results and analysis show that the proposed method outperforms the traditional algorithm, which RMSE can improve by at most 83.8% than Extended Kalman Filter's (EKF).

AB A low-power, low-frequency, ad hoc networking paradigm is considered for robust communications among mobile agents in complex non-line-of-sight (NLOS) indoor and urban-type scenarios. Compared with higher frequency, the lower portion of the very high frequency (VHF) band offers improved penetration and reduced multipath in such scenarios. Low VHF is underutilized for mobile ad hoc networking due to the lack of compact low-power systems and efficient miniature antennas. We investigate the proposed approach through experiments in realistic scenarios. In order to carry out the experiments, we leverage a compact, low-power ZigBee radio operating seamlessly in the low-VHF band by introducing a bi-directional frequency converter, which translates ZigBee signals into low-VHF carriers, along with a recently developed highly miniaturized efficient antenna. The experimental low-VHF radio system and a conventional ZigBee operating at 2.4 GHz are both integrated on a compact ground robotic platform for autonomous experimentation and comparison in NLOS indoor and outdoor settings. Measurements quantify the significant advantages of the low-VHF radio system in terms of packet error rate, fading, radio signal strength, and extended spatial coverage, in a number of complex communication environments.

AB It is estimated that 10-30 % of road fatalities are related to drowsy driving. Driver's drowsiness detection based on biological and vehicle signals is being studied in preventive car safety. Autonomous nervous system activity, which can be measured noninvasively from the heart rate variability (HRV) signal obtained from surface electrocardiogram, presents alterations during stress, extreme fatigue and drowsiness episodes. We hypothesized that these alterations manifest on HRV and thus could be used to detect driver's drowsiness. We analyzed three driving databases in which drivers presented different sleep-deprivation levels, and in which each driving minute was annotated as drowsy or awake. We developed two different drowsiness detectors based on HRV. While the drowsiness episodes detector assessed each minute of driving as "awake" or "drowsy" with seven HRV derived features (positive predictive value 0.96, sensitivity 0.59, specificity 0.98 on 3475 min of driving), the sleep-deprivation detector discerned if a driver was suitable for driving or not, at driving onset, as function of his sleep-deprivation state. Sleep-deprivation state was estimated from the first three minutes of driving using only one HRV feature (positive predictive value 0.80, sensitivity 0.62, specificity 0.88 on 30 drivers). Incorporating drowsiness assessment based on HRV signal may add significant improvements to existing car safety systems.

ID LOCALIZATION
AB In this paper, a localisation method for determining the position of fixed sensor nodes in an underwater wireless sensor network (UWSN) is introduced. In this simple and range-free scheme, the node localisation is achieved by utilising an autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) that transverses through the network deployment area, and that periodically emits a message block via four directional acoustic beams. A message block contains the actual known AUV position as well as a directional dependent marker that allows a node to identify the respective transmit beam. The beams form a fixed angle with the AUV body. If a node passively receives message blocks, it could calculate the arithmetic mean of the coordinates existing in each messages sequence, to find coordinates at two different time instants via two different successive beams. The node position can be derived from the two computed positions of the AUV. The major advantage of the proposed localisation algorithm is that it is silent, which leads to energy efficiency for sensor nodes. The proposed method does not require any synchronisation among the nodes owing to being silent. Simulation results, using MATLAB, demonstrated that the proposed method had better performance than other similar AUV-based localisation methods in terms of the rates of well-localised sensor nodes and positional root mean square error.

AB The paper presents a model merging Voronoi tessellation with an underlying support vector machine (SVM) in order to develop path planning for guiding an autonomous vehicle safely and smoothly through a space with obstacles. Being a roadmap method for path generation, the Voronoi tessellation is employed as a preprocessor to roughly fit a connection between the initial and goal configurations. Though the Voronoi path is safe for obstacle avoidance, its disjoint linear edges are unsatisfactory when smoothness is requested. Hence, an S V M postprocessor is proposed to make the segmented path smoother. By analogue to the Gaussian potential field, a zero-potential curve in the configuration space is thus obtained by the SVM postprocessor and forms a safe and smooth path. Due to advantages of the SVM with RBF kernel, the post-processed path has the merits of both smoothness from the Gaussian kernel basis, and wide clearance from the large-margin decision boundary. This paper adopts point configurations to represent obstacles in the working space. With additional artificial points for auxiliary constraints, the two-stage path planner is then developed. Detailed property investigations and simulated applications are also included to characterize the path planner. The results of a practical demonstration show a promising future for further applications.

Nonetheless, developing such ability is essential to support emerging UAV (Unmanned Aerial Vehicle) requirements in the civil and military domains. Accordingly, this study commences by constructing a mechatronic system featuring a manipulator arm actuated by a DC-motor-driven constant-pitch propeller and then develops suitable control schemes to regulate the power supplied to the DC motor such that the manipulator arm is driven through a specified rotational displacement. Three different control schemes are implemented to regulate the displacement of the manipulator arm, namely a fixed gain PID controller, a function-based variable gain PID controller and a fuzzy gain-mixing PID controller. The feasibility of the three control systems is evaluated both numerically and experimentally. It is shown that the fixed gain PID controller results in a significant overshoot of the manipulator arm and leads to a loss of control. However, the function-based variable gain PID controller and the fuzzy gain-mixing PID controller both ensure an accurate tracking performance, even when the manipulator arm is manually perturbed during rotation.

AB The application of intelligent equipment and technologies such as robots and unmanned vehicles is an important part of the construction of intelligent mines, and has become China's national coal energy development strategy and the consensus of the coal industry. Environment perception and instant positioning is one of the key technologies destined to realize unmanned and autonomous navigation in underground coal mines, and simultaneous location and mapping (SLAM) is an effective method of deploying this key technology. The underground space of a coal mine is long and narrow, the environment is complex and changeable, the structure is complex and irregular, and the lighting is poor. This is a typical unstructured environment, which poses a great challenge to SLAM. This paper summarizes the current research status of underground coal mine map construction based on visual SLAM and Lidar SLAM, and analyzes the defects of the LeGO-LOAM algorithm, such as loopback detection errors or omissions. We use SegMatch to improve the loopback detection module of LeGO-LOAM, use the iterative closest point (ICP) algorithm to optimize the global map, then propose an improved SLAM algorithm, namely LeGO-LOAM-SM, and describe its principle and implementation. The performance of the LeGO-LOAM-SM was also tested using the KITTI dataset 00 sequence and SLAM experimental data collected in two coal mine underground simulation scenarios, and the performance indexes such as the map construction effect, trajectory overlap and length deviation, absolute trajectory error (ATE), and relative pose error (RPE) were analyzed. The results show that the map constructed by LeGO-LOAM-SM is clearer, has a better loopback effect, the estimated trajectory is smoother and more accurate, and the translation and rotation accuracy is improved by approximately 5%. This can construct more accurate point cloud map and low drift position estimation, which verifies the effectiveness and accuracy of the improved algorithm. Finally, to satisfy the navigation requirements, the construction method of a two-dimensional occupancy grid map was studied, and the underground coal mine simulation environment test was carried out. The results show that the constructed raster map can effectively filter out outlier noise such as dynamic obstacles, has a mapping accuracy of 0.01 m, and the required storage space compared with the point cloud map is reduced by three orders of magnitude. The research results enrich the SLAM algorithm and implementation in unstructured environments such as underground coal mines, and help to solve the problems of environment perception, real-time positioning, and the navigation of coal mine robots and unmanned vehicles.

AB Traditional visual navigation methods of micro aerial vehicle (MAV) usually calculate a passable path that satisfies the constraints depending on a prior map. However, these methods have issues such as high demand for computing resources and poor robustness in face of unfamiliar environments. Aiming to solve the above problems, we propose a neuromorphic reinforcement learning-method (Neuro-Planner) that combines spiking neural network (SNN) and deep reinforcement learning (DRL) to realize MAV 3D visual navigation with depth camera. Specifically, we design a spiking actor network based on two-state LIF (TS-LIF) neurons and its encoding-decoding schemes for efficient inference. Then our improved hybrid deep deterministic policy gradient (HDDPG) and TS-LIF-based spatio-temporal back propagation (STBP) algorithms are used as the training framework for actor-critic network architecture. To verify the effectiveness of the proposed Neuro-Planner, we carry out detailed comparison experiments with various SNN training algorithm (STBP, BPTT and SLAYER) in the software-in-the-loop (SITL) simulation framework. The navigation success rate of our HDDPG-STBP is 4.3% and 5.3% higher than that of the original DDPG in the two evaluation environments. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work combining neuromorphic computing and deep reinforcement learning for MAV 3D visual navigation task.

AB Real time planning and collision avoidance is an important part of the motion planning for USVs, its core is to design effective planning and collision avoidance methods. This paper proposes a real-time planning and colli-sion avoidance method based on deep reinforcement learning for USVs in complex environments. Firstly, a novel reward function is designed, which transforms the collision avoidance problem into a deep reinforcement learning strategy solution problem that includes distance, direction, speed, and GOLREGs constraints, it ensures the smooth and safe operation of the USV. Secondly, inefficient exploration and exploitation methods make it difficult for intelligent agents to discover key information in the environment, high value experience is obtained through the designed layered sampling exploration mechanism in this article, the intelligent agent learns effective control strategies through this mechanism, which accelerates the convergence of the strategies and reduces the waste of computing resources. Finally, a real-time collision avoidance simulation platform for the USV is established, and experimental results of different exploration mechanisms are compared, the efficiency of the layered sampling exploration mechanism has been verified. The simulation scenarios from easy to difficult are designed, and the results indicate that the USV can complete real-time planning and collision avoidance tasks in complex environments.

AB To make autonomous vehicles consider driver's personalized characteristics, this paper proposes an integrated model and learning combined (IMLC) algorithm to realize human-like driving. It includes the integrated driving behavior modeling to ensure basic safety and the characteristic learning to further imitate human driver's style. Firstly, an integrated behavior model is built according to driver's operation logics, including lane advantage assessment, target lane selection and acceleration determination. The lane advantage is assessed by five lane features, like safety, efficiency, cooperativity, etc. Then, parameters of the built model are learned from human's demonstrations. For the lane selection parameter, a novel lane feature extraction method is presented and the maximum entropy inverse reinforcement learning (IRL) is adopted to solve. For the acceleration parameter, since it's hard to extract human's acceleration features accurately, the particle filtering is used to estimate. Finally, the IMLC algorithm is validated in highD dataset compared to existing algorithms. The results show that the RMSE of position and velocity in 9s are within 4.2 m and 0.9 m/s, which has great advantage. Moreover, we test the human-like performance in driver simulator. The safety and efficiency in this process are fairly approximate.

AB Human fault detection plays an important role in the industrial assembly process. In the current unstructured industrial workspace, the definition of human faults may vary over a long sequence, and this vagueness introduces multiple issues when using traditional detection methods. A method which could learn the correct action sequence from humans, as well as detect the fault actions based on prior knowledge, would be more appropriate and effective. To this end, we propose an end-to-end learning model to predict future human actions and extend it to detect human faults. We combined the auto-encoder framework and recurrent neural network (RNN) method to predict and generate intuitive future human motions. The convolutional long short-term memory (ConvLSTM) layer was applied to extract spatio-temporal features from video sequences. A score function was implemented to indicate the difference between the correct human action sequence and the fault actions. The proposed model was evaluated on a model vehicle seat assembly task. The experimental results showed that the model could effectively capture the necessary historical details to predict future human actions. The results of several fault scenarios demonstrated that the model could detect the faults in human actions based on corresponding future behaviors through prediction features.

AB Due to the considerable fading arising from the long-distance transmission between satellites and terrestrial terminals as well as the complex geographic environments on the earth, aerial relays have been designed to facilitate the information delivery between the satellites and terrestrial terminals when reliable direct data transmissions cannot be achieved. In this paper, a cooperative satellite-aerial-terrestrial network (CSATN) system including a satellite (S), an aerial relay (R), and a terrestrial receiver (D) is considered, while decode-and-forward relay scheme is adopted. Specifically, inspired by the beam shape of the transmission signal from S, we model the operation space of R as a circular truncated cone to accurately reflect the practical large-scale transmission scenarios, the height of which is decided by the upper and lower limitations of the operation height of R. Thus, considering the randomness of R and D and employing geometric probability theory, the exact and asymptotic outage probability (OP) of S-R, S-D, and R-D links is studied, and then the end-to-end outage performance of CSATN is investigated accordingly by using approximation method. Finally, numerical results are presented to validate our proposed analysis.

AB High-definition (HD) maps determine the location of the vehicle under limited visibility based on the location information of safety signs detected by sensors. If a safety sign disappears or changes, incorrect information may be obtained. Thus, map data must be updated daily to prevent accidents. This study proposes a map update system (MUS) framework that maps objects detected by a road map detection system and the object present in the HD map. Based on traffic safety signs notified by the Korean National Police Agency, 151 types of objects, including traffic signs, traffic lights, and road markings, were annotated manually and semi-automatically. Approximately 3,000,000 annotations were trained based on the you only look once (YOLO) model, suitable for real-time detection by grouping safety signs with similar properties. The object coordinates were then extracted from the mobile mapping system point cloud, and the detection location accuracy was verified by comparing and evaluating the center point of the object detected in the MUS. The performance of the groups with and without specified properties was compared and their effectiveness was verified based on the dataset configuration. A model trained with a Korean road traffic dataset on our testbed achieved a group model of 95% mAP and no group model of 70.9% mAP.

AB Recently, a concept of virtual emotion barrier by wireless signal gained a lot of interests because it supports human emotion recognition within given IoT environment. If detection of human emotion can be made with possibly high detection accuracy by virtual emotion barrier, it can be utilized to an extensive scope of emotion-based applications and communication software services. But, some IoT devices failures in the barrier may cause emotion-based system performance degradation critically. Also, thanks to recent advent of technology, intelligent smart UAVs with rapid speed are considered as promising devices when existing infrastructures are recovered. In this study, fault-tolerant mutual assisted virtual emotion barrier system is introduced with intelligent autonomous UAVs in convergent smart cities. Moreover, we present a formal definition of the problem whose goal is maximizing entire total accuracy of emotion detection where the failed locations are recovered by UAVs' movement from initial locations without any potential conflicts among UAVs. A greedy UAV movement scheme that constructs resilient virtual emotion barriers is proposed by handling those failed parts in the barriers continuously. Moreover, the proposed schemes are executed by comprehensive simulations with useful scenarios and we evaluate the earned outcome.

AB This paper studies the strength and stability of the carbon fiber composite cylindrical hull with strengthening ribs for an autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) based on finite element analysis (FEA) and response surface method (RSM). According to empirical formulas and test results, the value ranges of critical design parameters are preliminarily determined. In ANSYS Workbench, finite element modeling and numerical calculation of composite hulls under different design parameters are made using a tetrahedral mesh Patch Independent Algorithm (PIA). Parameter's sensitivity analysis is finished, and the response surface optimization is carried out using the Screening and Multi-objective genetic algorithm (MOGA). In Design-Expert, the Box-Behnken method is used to design a four-factor three-level experiment, and response surface analysis and parameter optimization are carried out. The sample data is obtained from numerical calculation. Finally, a response surface quadratic model between input parameters and output parameters is established. The response surface established by the above two methods and the optimization results is compared. The accuracy of the response surface quadratic model is evaluated, and the error is within 4%. The final parameters of the hull are determined, and the strength and stability are detected. Tests and engineering applications verify the reliability of this method.

ID SINGLE-PHOTON LIDAR; SIGNAL
AB The number of applications that use depth imaging is increasing rapidly, e.g. selfdriving autonomous vehicles and auto-focus assist on smartphone cameras. Light detection and ranging (LIDAR) via single-photon sensitive detector (SPAD) arrays is an emerging technology that enables the acquisition of depth images at high frame rates. However, the spatial resolution of this technology is typically low in comparison to the intensity images recorded by conventional cameras. To increase the native resolution of depth images from a SPAD camera, we develop a deep network built to take advantage of the multiple features that can be extracted from a camera's histogram data. The network is designed for a SPAD camera operating in a dual-mode such that it captures alternate low resolution depth and high resolution intensity images at high frame rates, thus the system does not require any additional sensor to provide intensity images. The network then uses the intensity images and multiple features extracted from down-sampled histograms to guide the up-sampling of the depth. Our network provides significant image resolution enhancement and image denoising across a wide range of signal-to-noise ratios and photon levels. Additionally, we show that the network can be applied to other data types of SPAD data, demonstrating the generality of the algorithm.

ID SEGMENTATION
AB In this paper, a low-cost embedded autonomous system is presented. Its main device is a Raspberry Pi 2, which allows real-time analysis of traffic videos. However, the previously developed computer vision algorithms do not work at the pixel-level, meaning that they do not analyze each pixel on every frame of the video because this would entail working with such a large amount of information that it would not be possible to obtain real-time processing. Therefore, as an alternative, our system works on compressed video. In particular, our system takes as an input the H.264/AVC motion vector data produced in the encoder of the GPU embedded in Broadcom's BCM2836 SoC. Furthermore, apart from working with very little information, the algorithms that are employed for video analysis must be efficient on their own. Thus, we propose algorithms that are capable of obtaining results directly from the analysis of a group of statistic measures, which are calculated based on a combination of input vectors. Experimentally, our system applies on the identification of overtakes, particularly those exceeding the maximum permitted speed, generating at the same time a report that is sent to a complaints e-mail account.

AB Advances in Artificial Intelligence (AI) have influenced almost every field including computer science, robotics, social engineering, psychology, criminology and so on. Although AI has solved various challenges, potential security threats of AI algorithms and training data have been stressed by AI researchers. As AI system inherits security threats of traditional computer system, the concern about novel cyberattack enhanced by AI is also growing. In addition, AI is deeply connected to physical space (e.g. autonomous vehicle, intelligent virtual assistant), so AI-related crime can harm people physically, beyond the cyberspace. In this context, we represent a literature review of security threats and AI-related crime. Based on the literature review, this article defines the term AI crime and classifies AI crime into 2 categories: AI as tool crime and AI as target crime, inspired by a taxonomy of cybercrime: Computer as tool crime and Computer as tool crime. Through the proposed taxonomy, foreseeable AI crimes are systematically studied and related forensic techniques are also addressed. We also analyze the characteristics of the AI crimes and present challenges that are difficult to be solved with the traditional forensic techniques. Finally, open issues are presented, with emphasis on the need to establish novel strategies for AI forensics.

AB In this article, we focus on the assessment of the optimal design of the propulsion system (PS) of an energy-autonomous Hyperloop capsule supplied by batteries. The novelty in this article is to propose a sizing method for this specific transportation system and answer the question whether the energy and power requirements of the Hyperloop propulsion are compatible with available power-electronics and battery technologies. By knowing the weight of a predetermined payload to be transported along predetermined trajectories, the proposed sizing method minimizes the total number of battery cells that supply the capsule's propulsion and maximizes its performance. The constraints embed numerically tractable and discrete-time models of the main components of the electrical PS and the battery, along with a kinematic model of the capsule. Although the optimization problem is nonconvex due to the adopted discrete-time formulation, its constraints exhibit a good numerical tractability. After having determined multiple solutions, we identify the dominant ones by using specific metrics. These solutions identify PSs characterized by energy reservoirs with an energy capacity in the order of 0.5 MWh and a power rating below 6.25 MW and enable an energy consumption of 10-50 Wh/km/passenger depending on the length of the trajectory.

AB The obstacle avoidance controller is a key autonomous component which involves the control of tractor system dynamics, such as the yaw lateral dynamics, the longitudinal dynamics, and nonlinear constraints including the speed and steering angles limits during the path-tracking process. To achieve the obstacle avoidance ability of control accuracy, an independent path re-planning controller is proposed based on ROS (Robot Operating System) nonlinear model prediction in this paper. In the design process, the obstacle avoidance function and an objective function are introduced. Based on these functions, the obstacle avoidance maneuvering performance is transformed into a nonlinear quadratic optimization problem with vehicle dynamic constraints. Moreover, the tractor dynamics maneuvering performance can be effectively adjusted through the proposed objective function. To validate the proposed algorithm, a ROS based tractor dynamics model and the SLAM (Simultaneous Localization and Mapping) are established for numerical simulations under different speed. The maximum obstacle avoidance deviation in the simulation is 0.242 m at 10 m/s, and 0.416 m at 30 m/s. The front-wheel rotation angle and lateral velocity are within the constraint range during the whole tracking process. The numerical results show that the designed controller can achieve the tractor obstacle avoidance ability with good accuracy under different conditions.

AB This article presents a high-precision multi-modal approach for localizing moving cameras with monocular videos, which has wide potentials in many intelligent applications, including robotics, autonomous vehicles, and so on. Existing visual odometry methods often suffer from symmetric or repetitive scene patterns, e.g., windows on buildings or parking stalls. To address this issue, we introduce a robust camera localization method that contributes in two aspects. First, we formulate feature tracking, the critical step of visual odometry, as a hierarchical min-cost network flow optimization task, and we regularize the formula with flow constraints, cross-scale consistencies, and motion heuristics. The proposed regularized formula is capable of adaptively selecting distinctive features or feature combinations, which is more effective than traditional methods that detect and group repetitive patterns in a separate step. Second, we develop a joint formula for integrating dense visual odometry and sparse GPS readings in a common reference coordinate. The fusion process is guided with high-order statistics knowledge to suppress the impacts of noises, clusters, and model drifting. We evaluate the proposed camera localization method on both public video datasets and a newly created dataset that includes scenes full of repetitive patterns. Results with comparisons show that our method can achieve comparable performance to state-of-the-art methods and is particularly effective for addressing repetitive pattern issues.

ID OPTICAL NAVIGATION; SENSOR
AB This study introduces novel algorithms and the underlying mathematics to process photographs of planetary illuminated bodies and use them for navigation purposes. The goal is to accurately estimate the observer-to-body relative position in inertial coordinates. The main motivation is to provide autonomous navigation capabilities to spacecrafts by observing a planet or a moon. This is needed, for example, in human-rated vehicles in order to provide navigation capabilities in a loss-of-communications scenario. The algorithm is derived for the general case of a triaxial ellipsoid that is observed bounded by an elliptical cone. The orientation of the elliptical cone reference frame is obtained by eigenanalysis, and the offset between the elliptical cone axis and the body center direction as well as the equation of the terminator are quantified. The main contribution of this paper is in the image-processing approach adopted to derive centroid and distance to the body. This is done by selecting a set of pixels around the body limb and modeling the smooth limb transition using two-dimensional circular and elliptical sigmoid functions. More accurate estimates of the centroid and distance are then obtained by iterative nonlinear least-squares using these models. A sensitivity analysis is performed, and numerical examples using a real moon photograph taken from Earth are provided to clarify the image-processing steps and to validate the proposed theory.

ID MULTIROBOT SIMULTANEOUS LOCALIZATION
AB In this paper we present an approach to the Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) problem using a team of autonomous vehicles equipped with vision sensors. The SLAM problem considers the case in which a mobile robot is equipped with a particular sensor, moves along the environment, obtains measurements with its sensors and uses them to construct a model of the space where it evolves. In this paper we focus on the case where several robots, each equipped with its own sensor, are distributed in a network and view the space from different vantage points. In particular, each robot is equipped with a stereo camera that allow the robots to extract visual landmarks and obtain relative measurements to them. We propose an algorithm that uses the measurements obtained by the robots to build a single accurate map of the environment. The map is represented by the three-dimensional position of the visual landmarks. In addition, we consider that each landmark is accompanied by a visual descriptor that encodes its visual appearance. The solution is based on a Rao-Blackwellized particle filter that estimates the paths of the robots and the position of the visual landmarks. The validity of our proposal is demonstrated by means of experiments with a team of real robots in a office-like indoor environment.

AB A new generation of aircraft, namely, unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), and, in particular, autonomous UAVs, are expected to carry out very critical maneuvers, well in excess of what pilots are able to tolerate. A newly developed theory for the dynamics and control of maneuvering flexible aircraft is ideally suited for the analysis and design of such aircraft. The state equations for maneuvering flexible aircraft are nonlinear and of high dimension. With due consideration to the way aircraft are flown, the problem can be separated into one for the generally large aircraft motions on a given flight path and another one for small perturbations from the flight path and elastic vibration, where the second problem receives inputs from the first. The case in which the flight path represents a time-dependent maneuver, so that the system of perturbation equations is time varying is studied. Several developments designed to facilitate the treatment of time-varying systems are provided. In particular, included are 1) an explicit derivation of the matrices defining the state equations, 2) a new approach to the control of the perturbations from the flight path and the elastic vibration, and 3) expressions for the implementation of the controls in discrete time. Computer solutions for the system response can be carried out conveniently by the use of MATLAB (R) and MATHEMATICA. A numerical example illustrates the approach for the case of a flexible aircraft executing a pitch maneuver.

   Notifications in Automated Driving
SO IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON INTELLIGENT VEHICLES
LA English
DT Article
DE Autonomous driving; driver alerts; warning calibration; positive
   predictive value; cry-wolf effect
AB An exploratory study in amoving-base simulator with 34 volunteers examined the effects of automated driving system reduced-confidence notifications on driver response. Reduced confidence in this context is defined as a system performance level that is lower than optimal, yet not so low as to disable the system. The threshold for such a level is essentially a policy decision based on perceived costs and benefits of keeping the automation engaged versus disengaging it. So, a reduced-confidence notification was designed to simply indicate that the driver should be especially vigilant to the increased potential to have to take manual control of the vehicle. An actual manual takeover request from the automated system would require the driver to take manual control of the vehicle. To investigate this, a 32-min highway driving scenario was constructed for this exploratory investigation that included 16 potential loss-of-lane tracking segments within this time frame. Three factors at two levels (low/high) each were crossed and presented in a between-subjects experimental design. One factor was system confidence/competence match, which refers to the ratio of the number of actual automation system failures over the number of reduced-confidence notifications. A second factor was the consequence of automation failure, i.e., drifting toward a busy traffic lane or drifting toward a wide shoulder. The third factor was detectability, or being able to see versus not see why the automated driving system began to drift out-of-lane. Data analyses indicated that automated driving with reduced-confidence notifications was judged to be both useful and acceptable regardless of the manipulated factors. However, the lowest incidence of preemption (i.e., manual takeovers prior to the start of a lane drift) was associated with low automation competence/confidence match and low detectability, regardless of consequences. It was also associated with responding later by some drivers. On the other hand, when the reduced-confidence notifications were perfectly matched with the need to manually takeover, there were fewer instances of delayed driver responses. Results are discussed in terms of "cry wolf" effects.

AB Due to the severe underwater environment, research into Underwater Wireless Sensor Networks is at its most undeveloped stage. Due to the restricted sensor batteries and significant variations in water parameters, like temperature, turbulence, flooding, pH, salinity, and others, this research is not as simple as it would seem. To increase node battery life and provide load balancing, several routing protocols are implemented. In this article, we propose the Effective Load Balancing with Sensor Injection routing method, which uses hop distance calculations to enable sensors to connect with sinks through other intermediary sensors. In order to communicate among sensors, localization-based routing protocol is employed. With the use of weight factor calculations, each node determines the minimal distance needed for connection to another node and calculates distance from the lowest hop node. This algorithm balances the load using the sensor injection approach. When weight factor of any node becomes high, it sends request to Network Management System (NMS) for load balancing. NMS directs Autonomous Underwater Vehicle for new sensor injection as neighbour of high factor node. Thus, by using this sensor injection method network lifetime gets increased. Simulation is carried out on NS 2.30 and improved results are obtained in comparison to existing schemes w.r.t., number of dead nodes and alive nodes at every round.

AB The paper focuses on the generation of a circular formation centred at a target point using a homogeneous group of autonomous agents in a cyclic pursuit framework. The agents are assumed to have a severely under-actuated form of the unicycle kinematics, with the linear speeds being constant and the angular speeds being their only control inputs. The target is assumed to be stationary and can represent a landmark, beacon, etc. In order to achieve the desired formation, the controller design is carried out in two stages. In the first stage, a bearing based attractive control law is proposed for every agent. Under the proposed law, the analysis of the relative motions reveals interesting behaviours like gathering and scattering of the agents. Building upon the attractive control law, in the second stage, the appropriate values of the controller parameters are determined which lead to a target centric circular formation. These parameters can also be suitably adjusted to achieve a pre-specified value of the radius of the circle and a desired distribution of the agents along the circle. The highlight of the work is that the convergence to the desired formation is guaranteed from almost all initial conditions of the agents by controlling only their angular speeds. Simulation results are also presented to illustrate the proposed theoretical results.(c) 2023 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Why does the fuel efficiency of gasoline cars increase over time? Do persistent spikes in gasoline prices induce such innovation? Does the increasing stringency of regulatory standards, such as CAFE, accelerate this technical change? How much of the observed progress would have occurred without these two factors? This paper examines the evolution of fuel efficiency using data on gasoline cars entering the US market from 1984 to 2020. Our analysis controls for gasoline price and tax shocks that occurred in OECD countries during this period. The study also accounts for the increasing stringency of fuel efficiency regulations, such the US CAFE standards. In contrast to previous contributions that downplay the role of fuel prices and taxes in shaping fuel efficiency, the study shows that their effect may be significant and robust. Doubling the user cost of gasoline with a stringent carbon tax is associated with an irreversible increase in fuel efficiency, by 5%. Increasing the stringency of the US CAFE standards by 10% raises average fuel efficiency by up to 1.2%. The progress stemming from other factors has an annual rate of 0.3-0.4% and accounts for 60% of the recorded change in fuel efficiency.

Furthermore, the paper provides importance rankings for legal and technical critical success factors from the point of view of logistics and supply chain experts. A conceptual model was developed capturing main legal and technical critical success factors from literature finding and then providing basis to a survey-based study that have been captured online. Results from the survey were evaluated and compared against each other using the Analytical Hierarchy Process. The results are based on business-to-business relationships between logistics service and mobility providers, as well as technical developers. The results of this research can help managers of large providers, transport companies in general and governments as well as political decision-makers in the innovation field to understand the legal situation of the EU and Germany as well as the technical problems that have to be overcome to profit from future technology in the last-mile-delivery.

AB As one of the core applications of computer vision, object detection has become more important in scenarios requiring high accuracy but with limited computational resources such as robotics and autonomous vehicles. Object detection using machine learning running on embedded device such as Raspberry Pi provides the high possibility to detect any custom objects without the recalibration of camera. In this work, we developed a smart and lean object detection model for shipping containers by using the state-of-the-art deep learning TensorFlow model and deployed it to a Raspberry Pi. Using EfficientDet-Lite2, we explored the different cross-validation strategies (Hold-out and K-Fold). The experimental results show that compared with the baseline EfficientDet-Lite2 algorithm, our model improved the mean average precision (mAP) by 44.73% for the Hold-out dataset and 6.26% for K-Fold cross-validation. We achieved Average Precision (AP) of more than 80% and best detection scores of more than 93% for the Hold-out dataset. For the 5-Fold lean dataset, the results show the Average Precision across the three lightweight models are generally high as the models achieved more than 50% average precision, with YOLOv4 Tiny performing better than EfficientDet-Lite2 and Single Shot Detector (SSD) MobileNet V2 Feature Pyramid Network (FPN) 320 as a lightweight model.

AB The term Mobility as a Service (MaaS) refers to a seamless, single interface, fully integrated and customised transport service. Whilst the technological barriers to implementing MaaS are steadily being overcome, less is known about how the MaaS eco-system might evolve. This paper unpicks the MaaS concept in light of broader societal trends to suggest how it could evolve and offers insights for practitioners and policy makers. The paper draws on relevant literature, together with discussions with stakeholders, to better understand how MaaS has emerged. It then constructs four future MaaS market scenarios and identifies implications. It is concluded that current expectations of how the MaaS concept may evolve are limited in their understanding of how the transport system could change should MaaS be adopted on a wide scale. The major challenges for policy makers will likely relate to balancing the promised benefits offered with issues such as safety (including bio-safety in our post Covid-19 world), data security and privacy, equity and the threat of dominant suppliers distorting the market-place. Together, these insights suggest that the MaaS reality may be messy and difficult to manage, and that future transport systems might look very different to now.

AB Metaverses have caused significant changes in the industry and their academic foundation can be traced back to the term cyber-physical-social systems (CPSS), which was proposed in 2010. Radar is an important sensor in sensing systems that are widely applied in many fields, especially, in autonomous driving. To deal with the complex environment, smart radars with real-time information processing capabilities are required. Human factors play a critical role in the operation and management of radar systems, thus, digital twins' radars in cyber-physical systems (CPS) are unable to achieve intelligence in CPSS due to an incomplete consideration of human involvement. For this consideration, we propose a novel framework of RadarVerses for smart radars in metaverses based on ACP-based parallel intelligence, which is also known as cyber-physical-social intelligence (CPSI). RadarVerses consist of five main parts which are physical radars, descriptive radars, predictive radars, prescriptive radars, and deep radars. To construct RadarVerses at the technical level, we introduce four main technical foundations: 1) communication technology; 2) scenarios engineering; 3) foundation models; and 4) digital workers. In addition, we also provide a case study about LiDARs' predictive maintenance of accumulated snow in RadarVerses.

AB The ever-increasing demand for high resolution and real-time recognition in radar applications has fuelled the development of electronic radars with increased bandwidth, high operation frequency, and fast processing capability. However, the generation and processing of wideband radar signals increase the hardware burden on complex and high-speed electronics, limiting its capability for applications that demand high spatial resolutions. Progress is being made, photonics-assisted radars offer higher frequencies but still heavily rely on costly and sophisticated high-frequency electronic devices such as benchtop digital microwave waveform generators that fundamentally constrain the bandwidth and the practical utility. Here, for the first time, a photonics-based radar with >11 GHz bandwidth (exceeding 20 GHz without RF antenna bandwidth limitation) driven and processed by simple MHz-level-electronics-based acoustic-optic modulation is demonstrated, which radically eliminates the requirement for ultra-fast GHz-speed electronics for wideband radar signal generation and processing. This wideband radar achieves centimeter-level spatial resolution and a real-time imaging rate of 200 frames s(-1), allowing for high-resolution detection of rapidly moving blades of an unmanned aerial vehicle. This radar provides an important technological basis for next-generation broadband radars with greatly reduced system complexity essential to ubiquitous sensing applications such as autonomous driving, environmental surveillance, and vital sign detection.

AB Modern deep neural networks are known to generate over-confident class predictions even for unseen samples. However, safety-critical applications are required to understand examples that differ from the training distribution. For example, an autonomous vehicle must return a instant refusal feedback when encountering an unexpected situation. The voice secretary should re-ask the user for a command that was not understood to prevent malfunction. In this paper, we propose an out-of-distribution sample detection algorithm using Uncertainty-based Additive Fast Gradient Sign Method (UA-FGSM), which uses Monte Carlo (MC) dropout during backpropagation. The proposed uncertainty-based method forces in-distribution sample predictions to be more over-confident and out-of-distribution sample predictions to be less over-confident in the pre-trained model. This boosts the discrimination between the in-distribution and out-of-distribution samples. In addition, we further boost this difference by continuously accumulating uncertainty-based gradients. Our method uses the inherent epistemic uncertainty of the pre-trained model. Therefore, the proposed algorithm does not require knowledge of the domain of the in-distribution dataset and works by simple pre-processing of the already trained model without any re-training. We demonstrate its effectiveness using diverse network architectures on various popular image datasets and noisy settings.

The Industry 4.0 era has brought a breakthrough in advanced technologies in fields such as nanotechnology, quantum computing, biotechnology, artificial intelligence, robotics, the Internet of Things, fifth-generation wireless technology, fully autonomous vehicles, 3D printing and so on. In this study, we attempted to identify the socioenvironmental and technological factors that influence the adoption of artificial intelligence embedded technology by digital manufacturing and production organizations. In doing so, the extended technology-organization-environment (TOE) framework is used to explore the applicability of Industry 4.0. A conceptual model was proposed that used an integrated technology acceptance model (TAM)-TOE model and was tested using survey-based data collected from 340 employees of small, medium and large organizations. The results highlight that all the relationships, except organizational readiness, organizational compatibility and partner support on perceived ease of use, were found to be significant in the context of digital manufacturing and production organizations. The results further indicated that leadership support acts as a countable factor to moderate such an adoption.

AB This study aims to obtain performance parameters of an Autonomous Underwater Vehicle (AUV) following a predetermined trajectory on the basis of varying hydrodynamic characteristics depending on angular positions. Performing sharp manoeuvres on the trajectory is handled by the optimum configuration of rotation angles along vertical, longitudinal and transverse axes. In the meantime, it is necessary to keep the thrust, drag and lift effects at proper values. With this approach, a mission scenario was set for AUV to circumnavigate a marine vessel along its waterline within a particular margin. The trajectory coordinates generated according to the determined scenario were converted to the ideal trajectory by cubic spline curve fitting method. Based on the determined trajectory, a navigation plan consisting of linear distances and rotation angles was created for energy calculation. In the following phase of the study, in compliance with angular position information received from the navigation plan, hydrodynamic impacts on the AUV were obtained by Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) analysis based on Finite Volume Method (FVM). CFD analysis was run for calculating the hydrodynamic coefficients, total resistance and moments acting on AUV based on roll and yaw angle variations. The resulting hydrodynamic data was used to evaluate the energy requirement which provides performance parameters of AUV navigating along its trajectory.

AB This paper proposes a hierarchical architecture using the biased min-consensus (BMC) method, to solve the path planning problem of unmanned surface vessel (USV). We take the fixed-point monitoring mission as an example, where a series of intermediate monitoring points should be visited once by USV. The whole framework incorporates the low-level layer planning the standard path between any two intermediate points, and the high-level fashion determining their visiting sequence. First, the optimal standard path in terms of voyage time and risk measure is planned by the BMC protocol, given that the corresponding graph is constructed with node state and edge weight. The USV will avoid obstacles or keep a certain distance safely, and arrive at the target point quickly. It is proven theoretically that the state of the graph will converge to be stable after finite iterations, i.e., the optimal solution can be found by BMC with low calculation complexity. Second, by incorporating the constraint of intermediate points, their visiting sequence is optimized by BMC again with the reconstruction of a new virtual graph based on the former planned results. The extensive simulation results in various scenarios also validate the feasibility and effectiveness of our method for autonomous navigation.

ID NOVELTY SEARCH; ALGORITHM
AB Path planning is present in many areas, such as robotics, video games, and unmanned autonomous vehicles. In the case of robots, it is a primary low-level prerequisite for the successful execution of high-level tasks. It is a known and difficult problem to solve, especially in terms of finding optimal paths for robots working in complex environments. Recently, population-based methods for multi-objective optimization, i.e., swarm and evolutionary algorithms successfully perform on different path planning problems. Knowing the nature of the problem is hard for optimization algorithms, it is expected that population-based algorithms might benefit from some kind of diversity maintenance implementation. However, advantages and potential traps of implementing specific diversity maintenance methods into the evolutionary path planner have not been clearly spelled out and experimentally demonstrated. In this paper, we fill this gap and compare three diversity maintenance methods and their impact on the evolutionary planner for problems of different complexity. Crowding, fitness sharing, and novelty search are tailored to fit specific problems, implemented, and tested for two scenarios: mobile robot operating in a 2D maze, and 3 degrees of freedom (DOF) robot operating in a 3D environment including obstacles. Results indicate that the novelty search outperforms the other two methods for problem domains of higher complexity.

AB Multiple Object Tracking (MOT) meets great challenges in videos captured by Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs). Different from traditional videos, due to high altitude and abrupt motion changes of UAVs, the sizes of target objects in UAVs videos are usually very small and the appearance information of target objects is unreliable. The motion analysis is meaningful to associate multiple objects in UAV videos. However, the traditional motion analysis models inevitably suffer from the autonomous motion of UAVs. In this paper, we proposed a Conditional Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN) based model to predict complex motions in UAV videos. We regard the objects motions and the UAV movement as the individual motions and global motions respectively. They are complementary with each other and are employed jointly to facilitate accurate motion prediction. Specifically, a social Long Short Term Memory network is exploited to estimate the individual motion of objects, and a Siamese network is constructed to generate the global motion to reflect the view changes from UAVs, and a conditional GAN is developed to generate the final motion affinity. Extensive experimental results are conducted on public UAV datasets contained various types of objects and 4 different kinds of object detection inputs. Robust motion prediction and improved MOT performance are achieved compared with state-of-the-art methods. (c) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB The robotic mobile fulfillment system (MFS) is widely used for automating storage pick and pack activities in e-commerce distribution centers. In this system, the items are stored on movable storage shelves, also known as inventory pods, and brought to the order pick stations by robotic drive units. We develop stylized performance evaluation models to analyze both order picking and replenishment processes in a mobile fulfillment system storage zone, based on multi-class closed queueing network models. To analyze robot assignment strategies for multiple storage zones, we develop a two-stage stochastic model. For a single storage zone, we compare dedicated and pooled robot systems for pod retrieval and replenishment. For multiple storage zones, we also analyze the effect of assigning robots to least congested zones on system throughput in comparison to random zone assignment. The models are validated using detailed simulations. For single zones, the expected throughput time for order picking reduces to one-third of its initial value by using pooled robots instead of dedicated robots; however, the expected replenishment time estimate increases up to three times. For multiple zones, we find that robots that are assigned to storage zones with dedicated and shortest queues provide a greater throughput than robots assigned at random to the zones.

TI On the Performance of AoA-Based Localization in 5G Ultra-Dense Networks

AB Cellular systems are undergoing a transformation toward the fifth generation (5G). Envisioned applications in 5G include intelligent transport system (ITS), autonomous vehicles, and robots as a part of future roads, factories, and society. These applications rely to a great extent on accurate and timely location information of connected devices. This paper proposes a practical scheme for acquiring precise and timely position information by means of a user-centric ultra-dense network (UDN) architecture based on an edge cloud. The considered solution consists of estimating and tracking the azimuth angle-of-arrival (AoA) of the line-of-sight (LoS)-path between a device and multiple transmission-reception points (TRPs), each having a uniform linear antenna array (ULA). AoA estimates from multiple TRPs are fused into position estimates at the edge cloud to obtain timely position information. The extensive measurements have been carried out using a proof-of-concept software-defined-radio (SDR) testbed in order to experimentally assess the achievable positioning accuracy of the proposed architecture. A realistic UDN deployment scenario has been considered in which TRPs consist of antenna arrays mounted on lamp posts. Our results show that practical UDNs can provide sub-meter positioning accuracy of mobile users by employing ULAs with at least four antennas per TRP and by taking into account the non-idealities of the ULAs' phase and magnitude response.

AB Reliability and safety of engineered systems often extends to a system composed of autonomous and heterogeneous systems. Systems integration enables formation of larger system of systems with greater, encompassing scope and goals. Nuclear power station reliability and safety involves an extensive system of systems. Failures at Chernobyl and Fukushima underscore the rare but catastrophic ripple-effect of a failed system within a system of systems conceptual model. Modeling and simulation of systems with various scenarios increases confidence in conceptual models, particularly scenarios that are too costly or risky to assess by other means. This research implements a system of systems conceptual model of a notional Fukishima-like disaster using a Live-Virtual-Constructive simulation framework. Focusing, on a conceptual model involving an unmanned aerial system intervention, the research illustrates the framework's utility and effectiveness for assessing system reliability and safety within the conceptual model. Novel use of a screening experiment demonstrates the framework's capability to rapidly identify critical factors and their significance. A framework encompassing live, virtual, and constructive simulations provides a generalized capability to compose, simulate, and evaluate from multiple perspectives the suitability of various systems and conceptual models to accomplish a broad range of emergency response missions including the one investigated here.

TI Low complexity lossless compression of underwater sound recordings
SO JOURNAL OF THE ACOUSTICAL SOCIETY OF AMERICA
LA English
DT Article
ID OCEAN; TAG
AB Autonomous listening devices are increasingly used to study vocal aquatic animals, and there is a constant need to record longer or with greater bandwidth, requiring efficient use of memory and battery power. Real-time compression of sound has the potential to extend recording durations and bandwidths at the expense of increased processing operations and therefore power consumption. Whereas lossy methods such as MP3 introduce undesirable artifacts, lossless compression algorithms (e. g., FLAC) guarantee exact data recovery. But these algorithms are relatively complex due to the wide variety of signals they are designed to compress. A simpler lossless algorithm is shown here to provide compression factors of three or more for underwater sound recordings over a range of noise environments. The compressor was evaluated using samples from drifting and animal-borne sound recorders with sampling rates of 16-240 kHz. It achieves >87% of the compression of more-complex methods but requires about 1/10 of the processing operations resulting in less than 1 mW power consumption at a sampling rate of 192 kHz on a low-power microprocessor. The potential to triple recording duration with a minor increase in power consumption and no loss in sound quality may be especially valuable for battery-limited tags and robotic vehicles.

ID SIMULTANEOUS LOCALIZATION; KALMAN FILTER
AB We are concerned with improving the range resolution of stereo vision for entry, descent, and landing (EDL) missions to Mars and other planetary bodies. The goal is to create accurate and precise three-dimensional planetary surface-structure estimates by filtering sequences of stereo images taken from an autonomous landing vehicle. We describe a sliding window filter (SWF) approach based on delayed state marginalization. The SWF can run in constant time, yet still achieve experimental results close to those of the bundle adjustment solution. This technique can scale from the offline batch least-squares solution to fast online incremental solutions. For instance, if the window encompasses all time, the solution is equivalent to full bundle adjustment; if only one time step is maintained, the solution matches the extended Kalman filter; if poses and landmarks are slowly marginalized out over time such that the state vector ceases to grow, then the filter becomes constant time, like visual odometry. Within the constant time regime, the sliding window approach demonstrates convergence properties that are close to those of the full batch solution and strictly superior to visual odometry. Experiments with real data show that ground structure estimates follow the expected convergence pattern that is predicted by theory. These experiments indicate the effectiveness of filtering long-range stereo for EDL. (C) 2010 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

AB This paper presents the design and integration of ROBHAZ-DT3, a newly developed mobile robot system with a chained double-track mechanism. It is designed to carry out military and civilian missions in various hazardous environments. A passive adaptation mechanism equipped between the front and rear body enables ROBHAZ-DT3 to have good adaptability to uneven terrains, including stairs. The passive adaptation mechanism reduces energy consumption when moving on uneven terrain. It has a simple design and remote control, since no actuators are equipped for adaptation. Based on this new design concept, dynamic analysis and simulations were conducted to verify the mobility of the double-track mechanism, and to obtain significant design parameters such as the optimal track size and allowable attack angle. Also, dynamic effects in vehicle turning were investigated to assess the proper driving torque. Based on this novel mobile mechanism, a rescue version of ROBHAZ-DT3 with appropriate sensors and a semi-autonomous mapping and localization algorithm was developed to participate in the RoboCup 2004 US Open (Urban Search and Rescue Competition). From the various experiments in the realistic arena, we verified that ROBHAZ-DT3 is reliable when traveling over rugged terrain, and that the proposed mapping and localization algorithm are effective in unstructured environments with uneven ground like the rescue area.

AB This paper explores the use of hydrodynamic eigenmode decomposition as a means of generating optimal swimming kinematics of slender three-dimensional bodies. The eigenvectors of the unsteady hydrodynamic system are used as basis functions for the response to external forcing, such as perturbations generated by the deformation of the body. Exploiting the orthogonality of the modes, we show that swimming according to a single appropriately selected hydrodynamic eigenmode results in high-efficiency swimming. To demonstrate this result, we use an inviscid three-dimensional vortex lattice model to investigate the hydrodynamic eigenmodes of a selection of geometries. We find that for all of the body geometries tested, hydrodynamic efficiency far exceeding that of pure heaving or pitching can be achieved. All eigenmodes tested produce high-efficiency motion, as long as the beat frequency is higher than the mode's "cut-in" frequency for thrust generation. The eigenmodes show qualitative similarity to swimming patterns observed in nature and also correspond well to the existing classifications of undulatory and oscillatory swimming. This study demonstrates that the hydrodynamic eigenmode analysis can generate high-efficiency swimming kinematics based only on information about the body and wake geometry, and as such, this method has significant potential for further development and application to autonomous underwater vehicle design.

AB In this paper, we aim to answer two main questions in the context of multimodal travel and new modes of transportation, such as autonomous vehicles: firstly, as travelers gain the ability to readily compare modes side by side for each trip, will they become more willing to select the option that best meets their needs in the moment, or will they continue to prefer using a single mode for a whole tour? Secondly, we compare two approaches to estimating mode choice models in the context of a typical workday tour: one in which we enumerate each possible sequence of modes, and one in which we calculate the expected utility given all modes available for each trip separately, and sum over all trips in the tour. We find that the latter approach returns similar estimation results to the former, but is much faster and easier to compute, an advantage that would only grow with more mode alternatives or more trips in the tour. In addition, we discovered a substantial "mode inertia" in our sample: the utility of the mode used for the previous trip is significantly higher for the present trip. This finding indicates that respondents in our sample are more likely to stick with unimodal tours than multimodal ones.

AB Robust localization is an essential requirement for autonomous land vehicles. In similar scenes such as corridors and tunnels or open scenes such as airports and mines, the performance of the traditional algorithm of laser odometry will be seriously deteriorated or even become completely invalid due to the similarity of observation data. Based on the LIO-SAM algorithm, LTI-SAM is proposed in this article, that is to use the downward-facing camera and inertial measurement unit (IMU) to perform dead reckoning through template matching algorithm and use template matching visual odometry (VO) to judge themotion state and decidewhether to save the keyframe if the laser odometer fails and the keyframe is not saved. If the keyframe is kept, theVOis added between two keyframes instead of the laser odometry to optimize through the factor graph, which improves the accuracy of localization and mapping. The proposed algorithm with loose coupling between template matching VO and laser inertial navigation is implemented under the robot operating system (ROS) platform, and the algorithm is verified by indoor and outdoor experiments. Experimental results show that the proposed algorithm can bring significant performance improvement in both similar indoor scenes and outdoor degraded scenes.

AB Service provisioning systems assign users to service providers according to allocation criteria that strike an optimal trade-off between users' Quality of Experience (QoE) and the operation cost endured by providers. These systems have been leveraging Smart Contracts (SCs) to add trust and transparency to their criteria. However, deploying fixed allocation criteria in SCs does not necessarily lead to the best performance over time since the blockchain participants join and leave flexibly, and their load varies with time, making the original allocation sub-optimal. Furthermore, updating the criteria manually at every variation in the blockchain jeopardizes the autonomous and independent execution promised by SCs. Thus, we propose a set of light-weight agents for SCs that are capable of optimizing the performance. We also propose using online learning SCs, empowered by Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) agent, that leverage the chained data to continuously self-tune its allocation criteria. We show that the proposed learning-assisted method achieves superior performance on the combinatorial multi-stage allocation problem while still being executable in real-time. We also compare the proposed approach with standard heuristics as well as planning methods. Results show a significant performance advantage over heuristics and better adaptability to the dynamic nature of blockchain networks.

AB The suppression of optical reflection from a surface is essential in many applications, ranging from displays with reduced disturbance from ambient light to high-efficiency photovoltaic cells and stable light detection and ranging (LIDAR) systems. Traditionally, antireflection (AR) surfaces are made of multilayer (ML) coatings that produce destructive interference of light beams reflected from each interface. More advanced AR surfaces are based on biomimetic nanostructures (NS) that rely on a gradation of refractive index to suppress reflection. While AR-ML coatings tend to work for restricted light wavelengths and angles of incidence, AR-NS can be broadband and omnidirectional. In addition, AR-NS can provide superhydrophobicity and self-cleaning effects. Unfortunately, AR-NS often suffer from mechanical failure, this being more critical for taller structures required for operation at longer wavelengths. Here we propose to combine ML and shorter NS to achieve an AR surface with several crucial advantages, including greater spectral and angular bandwidth and water repellency compared to only AR-ML, easier fabrication, lower scattering, and higher mechanical durability compared to only AR-NS, which requires taller structures. We present theoretical and experimental studies for combined AR-ML-NS glass surfaces operating in the visible (VIS) between 380 and 780 nm and especially at longer wavelengths in the near-infrared (NIR) at around 900 nm, where applications such as LIDAR for autonomous vehicles are of high interest.

AB In this article, we derive a maximum principle for a special class of free end time optimal control of multiprocesses involving a family of control systems acting in different regions defined by state constraints. We are mainly interested in problems with contiguous time intervals. The main feature of our maximum principle is that it covers the case where some of the regions considered may not be visited. This means that the intervals where the corresponding control systems are active may be reduced to a single point. The derivation of our maximum principle is done by reformulating the optimal multiprocess problem as an equivalent fixed time state constrained optimal control problem. This reformulated problem is also of interest since it provides the means to solve optimal multiprocess problems numerically via the direct method. We illustrate our findings with an example concerning the path planning of an autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) using a simple kinematic model derived for simulations. We use simplified point-mass model for the motion of an AUV in a horizontal plane and we assume that the ocean currents are known. We recast this problem as the multiprocess optimal control problem of interest and we study it via simulations presenting computational results partially validated by the maximum principle.

AB Networked operation of unmanned air vehicles (UAVs) demands fusion of information from disparate sources for accurate flight control. In this investigation, a novel sensor fusion architecture for detecting aircraft runway and horizons as well as enhancing the awareness of surrounding terrain is introduced based on fusion of enhanced vision system (EVS) and synthetic vision system (SVS) images. EVS and SVS image fusion has yet to be implemented in real-world situations due to signal misalignment. We address this through a registration step to align EVS and SVS images. Four fusion rules combining discrete wavelet transform (DWT) sub-bands are formulated, implemented, and evaluated. The resulting procedure is tested on real EVS-SVS image pairs and pairs containing simulated turbulence. Evaluations reveal that runways and horizons can be detected accurately even in poor visibility. Furthermore, it is demonstrated that different aspects of EVS and SVS images can be emphasized by using different DWT fusion rules. The procedure is autonomous throughout landing, irrespective of weather. The fusion architecture developed in this study holds promise for incorporation into manned heads-up displays (HUDs) and UAV remote displays to assist pilots landing aircraft in poor lighting and varying weather. The algorithm also provides a basis for rule selection in other signal fusion applications.

AB Due to the long-range data communication and complex Mars environment, the Mars lander needs to promote the ability to autonomously adapt uncertain situations ensuring high precision landing in future Mars missions. Based on the analysis of multiple disturbances, this study demonstrates an enhanced predictor-corrector guidance method to deal with the effect of atmospheric uncertainties during the entry phase of the Mars landing. In the proposed method, the predictor-corrector guidance algorithm is designed to autonomously drive the Mars lander to the parachute deployment. Meanwhile, the disturbance observer is designed to onboard estimate the effect of fiercely varying atmospheric uncertainties resulting from rapidly height decreasing. Then, with the estimation of atmospheric uncertainties compensated in the feed-forward channel, the composite guidance method is put forward such that both anti-disturbance and autonomous performance of the Mars lander guidance system are improved. Convergence of the proposed composite method is analysed. Simulations for a Mars lander entry guidance system demonstrates that the proposed method outperforms the baseline method in consideration of the atmospheric uncertainties.

AB As an important part of the fifth generation (5G) mobile networks, unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) have been applied in various communication scenarios due to their high operability and low cost. In this paper, we investigate a multi-UAV communication system with moving users and consider the co-channel interference caused by the transmissions of all other UAVs. To ensure the fairness, we maximize the minimum average user rate during the observed time by jointly optimizing UAVs' trajectories, transmission power, and user association. Considering that UAVs can cover a large area for communications, UAVs do not need to move as soon as the users move. Therefore, a two-timescale structure is proposed for the considered scenario, where the UAVs' trajectories are optimized based on the channel state information (CSI) in a long timescale, while the transmission power and the user association are optimized based on the instantaneous CSI in a short timescale. To effectively tackle this challenging non-convex problem with both discrete and continuous variables, we propose a joint neural network (NN) design, where a deep reinforcement learning based Pointer Network named advantage pointer-critic (APC) is applied to optimize discrete variables and a deep-unfolding NN is used to optimize the continuous variables. Specifically, we first formulate a Markov decision process to model the user association, and then employ the APC network trained by the advantage actor-critic algorithm to address it. The APC network consists of a Pointer Network and a Multilayer Perceptron. As for the deep-unfolding NN, we first develop a block coordinate descent based algorithm to optimize the UAVs' trajectories and transmission power, and then unfold the algorithm into a layer-wise NN with introduced trainable parameters. These two networks are jointly trained in an unsupervised fashion. Simulation results validate that the proposed joint NN significantly outperforms the optimization algorithm with much lower complexity, and achieves good performances on scalability and generalization ability.

TI Hybrid Pipeline Hardware Architecture Based on Error Detection and

ID IMPLEMENTATIONS
AB Currently, cryptographic algorithms are widely applied to communications systems to guarantee data security. For instance, in an emerging automotive environment where connectivity is a core part of autonomous and connected cars, it is essential to guarantee secure communications both inside and outside the vehicle. The AES algorithm has been widely applied to protect communications in onboard networks and outside the vehicle. Hardware implementations use techniques such as iterative, parallel, unrolled, and pipeline architectures. Nevertheless, the use of AES does not guarantee secure communication, because previous works have proved that implementations of secret key cryptosystems, such as AES, in hardware are sensitive to differential fault analysis. Moreover, it has been demonstrated that even a single fault during encryption or decryption could cause a large number of errors in encrypted or decrypted data. Although techniques such as iterative and parallel architectures have been explored for fault detection to protect AES encryption and decryption, it is necessary to explore other techniques such as pipelining. Furthermore, balancing a high throughput, reducing low power consumption, and using fewer hardware resources in the pipeline design are great challenges, and they are more difficult when considering fault detection and correction. In this research, we propose a novel hybrid pipeline hardware architecture focusing on error and fault detection for the AES cryptographic algorithm. The architecture is hybrid because it combines hardware and time redundancy through a pipeline structure, analyzing and balancing the critical path and distributing the processing elements within each stage. The main contribution is to present a pipeline structure for ciphering five times on the same data blocks, implementing a voting module to verify when an error occurs or when output has correct cipher data, optimizing the process, and using a decision tree to reduce the complexity of all combinations required for evaluating. The architecture is analyzed and implemented on several FPGA technologies, and it reports a throughput of 0.479 Gbps and an efficiency of 0.336 Mbps/LUT when a Virtex-7 is used.

AB Hyperspectral imaging has emerged as an important tool for analysing vegetation data in agricultural applications. Recently, low altitude and ground based hyperspectral imaging solutions have come to the fore, providing very high resolution data for mapping and studying large areas of crops in detail. However, these platforms introduce a unique set of challenges that need to be overcome to ensure consistent, accurate and timely acquisition of data. One particular problem is dealing with changes in environmental illumination while operating with natural light under cloud cover, which can have considerable effects on spectral shape. In the past this has been commonly achieved by imaging known reference targets at the time of data acquisition, direct measurement of irradiance, or atmospheric modelling. While capturing a reference panel continuously or very frequently allows accurate compensation for illumination changes, this is often not practical with ground based platforms, and impossible in aerial applications. This paper examines the use of an autonomous unmanned ground vehicle (UGV) to gather high resolution hyperspectral imaging data of crops under natural illumination. A process of illumination compensation is performed to extract the inherent reflectance properties of the crops, despite variable illumination. This work adapts a previously developed subspace model approach to reflectance and illumination recovery. Though tested on a ground vehicle in this paper, it is applicable to low altitude unmanned aerial hyperspectral imagery also. The method uses occasional observations of reference panel training data from within the same or other datasets, which enables a practical field protocol that minimises in-field manual labour. This paper tests the new approach, comparing it against traditional methods. Several illumination compensation protocols for high volume ground based data collection are presented based on the results. The findings in this paper are applicable not only to robotics or agricultural applications, but most very low altitude or ground based hyperspectral sensors operating with natural light.

AB Underwater bionic robotics and vehicles that use flexible structures as power sources have attracted considerable attention. Thus, the underwater dynamic behaviors of the flexible structure of a variable cross-section actuated by smart actuators must be further investigated. In this study, underwater dynamic hysteresis modeling and feedforward compensation of a flexible caudal fin driven by macro fiber composites (MFC) at different frequencies were investigated. The MFC-actuated flexible caudal fin is considered a Euler-Bernoulli beam. A revised hydrodynamic function governed by the thickness of the viscous layer and the gap -to-width ratio of the cross-section was developed. Then, a characteristic-frequency-dependent extended transform function model is proposed for the hydrodynamic response of a non-uniform beam. An asymmetric hysteresis model is presented to characterize the rate-independent hysteresis behavior of the MFC actuators. Further, the underwater dynamic equation of the MFC-actuated caudal fin with hysteresis is obtained by connecting the two established models in series. Experiments demonstrate the dynamic behavior between the underwater responses of the caudal fin and the input voltages have an ellipse-like shape and vary in shape and size with oscillating frequency. The ellipse-like dynamic hysteresis loop first grows, reaching its maximum at the resonant frequency, and then decreases, because of the frequency -dependent dynamic behavior. Meanwhile, a phase shift of approximately 90 degrees between the input voltage and underwater dynamic response was observed at the resonant state. Furthermore, the experimental results demonstrate that the proposed model can describe the nonlinear underwater dynamic hysteresis behavior of the proposed caudal fin at different frequencies. The trajectory tracking performances are remarkably improved over a broad frequency range with the proposed compensator. Consequently, the effectiveness of the proposed dynamic model and compensation method was demonstrated. These results are helpful for robotic fish or autonomous underwater vehicles propelled by oscillating foils actuated by smart actuators, including MFC.

AB Until three or four decades ago, humanity was no longer constrained by the depletion of certain natural resources (especially energy) and the intensified degradation of the natural environment. The consequences of these major crises-such as the economic, financial, and social upheaval of the world, dramatic climate change, and the entry of politics into a Brownian sarabande-necessitate the transition of civilization to another viable formula. Adequate, timely, and sustainable solutions are being sought, from the subsistence ones to those of economic efficiency. Thus, the mobility revolution is credited as one of the most important levers of change. Starting from the reality that most cars in traffic are not occupied at their maximum capacity, some ideas have already been advanced and even put into practice-"inspired"-which would improve the efficiency in this regard. For example, the reduction in the number of seats in cars and, correspondingly, the considerable reduction in the dimensions of cars are already found in the design of mini-cars and the correlation of identical interests of the self-movement of several people and the integration of this coincidence in a single concurrent mobility formula is already functional through the ride sharing system. Along with intelligent mobility management and the transition to electric and autonomous mobility, streamlining the occupancy of moving cars is seen as a great potential of the mobility revolution. Within the limits of the methodology of data collection in economic statistics, this study proposes a complex technique associated with a convincing tactic of empirical measurement of specific indices of urban traffic issues. The special method is characterized by the simultaneity and plurality of observation points followed by the correlation of the values obtained from the measurement thus performed, with the results from the video recordings taken at the same time. This method will increase the methodological accuracy of data collection in economic statistics. By advancing this method, this study aims to capture the occupancy rates of people in urban vehicle traffic, in different cities, using a combined method.

AB Digital elevation models (DEMs) are crucial in natural hazard assessments, as they often present the only comprehensive information. While satellites deliver remote sensing information of the land surface of up to 2m resolution, only 25% of the seafloor is mapped with a minimum resolution of 400m. The acquisition of high-resolution bathymetry requires hydroacoustic surveys by research vessels or autonomous vehicles, which is time-consuming and expensive. Predicted bathymetry from satellite altimetry, on the other hand, is widely available but has a significantly lower spatial resolution and high uncertainties in elevation, especially in shallow waters. The research on volcanic islands as a source of both volcanic as well as marine hazards such as tsunamis, is greatly limited by the lack of high-resolution bathymetry. Here we compare 24 geomorphometric parameters of 47 volcanic islands derived from a) the comprehensive bathymetric data of the General Bathymetric Chart of the Ocean (GEBCO) and b) high-resolution (< 250m), ship-based bathymetry. Out of 24 parameters tested, 20 show < +/- 2.5% median deviation, and quartiles < +/- 10%. Parameters describing the size of a volcanic island are the most robust and slope parameters show the greatest deviations. With this benchmark, we will be able to increase geomorphometric investigations to volcanic islands where little or no high-resolution bathymetry data is available.

AB The flexoelectric phenomenon, which occurs when materials undergo mechanical deformation and cause strain gradients and a related spontaneous electric polarization field, can result in wide variety of energy- and cost-saving mechano-opto-electronics, such as night vision, communication, and security. However, accurate sensing of weak intensities under self-powered conditions with stable photocurrent and rapid temporal response remains essential despite the challenges related to having suitable band alignment and high junction quality. Taking use of the flexoelectric phenomena, it is shown that a centrosymmetric VO2-based heterojunction exhibits a self-powered (i.e., 0 V), infrared (& lambda; = 940 nm) photoresponse. Specifically, the device shows giant current modulation (10(3)%), good responsivity of >2.4 mA W-1, reasonable specific detectivity of & AP;10(10) Jones, and a fast response speed of 0.5 ms, even at the nanoscale modulation. Through manipulation of the applied inhomogeneous force, the sensitivity of the infrared response is enhanced (> 640%). Ultrafast night optical communication like Morse code distress (SOS) signal sensing and high-performing obstacle sensors with potential impact alarms are created as proof-of-concept applications. These findings validate the potential of emerging mechanoelectrical coupling for a wide variety of novel applications, including mechanoptical switches, photovoltaics, sensors, and autonomous vehicles, which require tunable optoelectronic performance.

AB The ultra-short baseline(USBL) is fixed upside down on the seafloor to position an autonomous underwater vehicle, which is the inverted ultra-short baseline (i-USBL). Three attitude angles between the i-USBL coordinate system and the navigation coordinate system will be produced when the USBL is installed on the seabed. Sig-nificant positioning error will occur if the USBL attitude is undefined. Besides, it also affects the accuracy of attitude angles estimation that the outliers produced when using USBL. In this paper, we propose a robust sin-gular value decomposition (RSVD) method for estimating the attitude angles. Specifically, we develop an attitude calibration model based on the i-USBL positioning mode. The USBL attitude angles is solved using singular value decomposition (SVD) according to the least squares method. The new attitude angles are used to calculate the residuals of the coordinates at each measurement point. The residuals are used to calculate the weights of each point by the IGG III weighting function. The recalculation of attitude angles is performed by using up-to-date weights and SVD. The performance of SVD, the conventional Gaussian Newton iterative method (GN), and RSVD are compared in the simulations. The simulations show that the RSVD has high calibration accuracy and robustness.

AB This article proposed an underwater simultaneous wireless power transfer and data transfer system for the autonomous underwater vehicle. The double-sided LLCC compensation topology is proposed to effectively suppress the interference to the data channel at switching instant. With the increase of the size and turns of the coupling coils, the self-resonance frequency gradually decreases. However, the frequency of data carriers is usually much lower than the self-resonant frequency, which will reduce the data rate or improve the bit error rate at a high data rate. Moreover, the high voltage generated by coupling coils causes high voltage stress on the data channel. To deal with these two issues, the last turn of each coupling coil is used to transfer data in the proposed system. The two transceivers are, respectively, connected with the last turn of the two coupling coils, which excites the entire coils to self-resonate and generates two resonant frequencies. The two resonant frequencies are utilized to realize high-speed full-duplex communication. And the voltage stress of the data channel is effectively reduced. A 518-W full-duplex prototype is built, and the maximum data rate is 700 kb/s, which verifies the feasibility of the proposed system.

AB Smart agriculture techniques have recently seen widespread interest by farmers. This is driven by several factors, which include the widespread availability of economically-priced, low-powered Internet of Things (IoT) based wireless sensors to remotely monitor and report conditions of the field, climate, and crops. This enables efficient management of resources like minimizing water requirements for irrigation and minimizing the use of toxic pesticides. Furthermore, the recent boom in Artificial Intelligence can enable farmers to deploy autonomous farming machinery and make better predictions of the future based on present and past conditions to minimize crop diseases and pest infestation. Together these two enabling technologies have revolutionized conventional agriculture practices. This survey paper provides: (a) A detailed tutorial on the available advancements in the field of smart agriculture systems through IoT technologies and AI techniques; (b) A critical review of these two available technologies and challenges in their widespread deployment; and (c) An in-depth discussion about the future trends including both technological and social, when smart agriculture systems will be widely adopted by the farmers globally.

AB The purposes are to investigate how blockchain can solve the security problems in Intelligent Autonomous Transport System (IATS) and intelligentize the logistics transportation development. Regarding the scarcity of trust and concentration of rights caused by the centralized structure of traditional logistics information systems, a blockchain-based IATS is proposed. The system employs Ethereum as the underlying blockchain to record sensitive information, such as system orders, cargos, and personnel information on the blockchain, ensuring the non-tampering and credibility of data. Simultaneously, an order management module, a warehouse management module, a transportation management module, a transaction management module, and a system management module are established. In the meantime, the Light Gradient Boosting Machine (LightGBM) algorithm is utilized to recommend vehicle and cargo matching during transportation. Finally, the constructed algorithm model is simulated to analyze its performance. Results demonstrate that the security prediction accuracy of the proposed algorithm reaches 88.72%; moreover, the security prediction precision, recall, and F1 of the proposed algorithm are considerably better than those of other algorithms. Furthermore, the actual effect of each algorithm is analyzed. The LightGBM algorithm outperforms other algorithms and unused algorithms in click rate, conversion rate, turnover rate, and average response time. Therefore, the constructed blockchain-based IATS has excellent security performance and prediction accuracy, which provides an experimental basis for the later intelligent logistics transportation development.

AB Fuel cell-powered Autonomous Underwater Vehicles (AUVs) represent a growing area of research as fuel cells can increase their endurance. Fuel cells consume hydrogen and oxygen to generate electricity. Typically, the fuel cell generates as much heat as electrical energy, and heat management becomes a crucial parameter when designing AUVs. For underwater applications, there is a need to store both gases and several types of storage units with different characteristics exist which have impacts on the energy density and heat behavior. This study aims at including the heat properties of the storage units in the design process of fuel cell-powered AUVs. A heat balance over the energy system of an AUV is calculated for each combination of hydrogen and oxygen storage units. In addition, a multi-criteria decision-making analysis is conducted, considering the calculated total heat, the specific energy, the energy density and the volumetric mass of each combination of storage units as criteria, enabling a comparison and ranking them using two objective criteria weighting methods. Results show that the fuel cell is the major contributor to the heat balance, and that the combinations of liquid oxygen with liquid or compressed hydrogen can be relevant and suitable for underwater applications.

AB Real-time crowd management systems play an important role in urban planning, disaster warning, and emergency evacuation. For example, through closed-circuit television (CCTV) cameras and artificial intelligence (AI) algorithms, crowd counting and abnormal event recognition can be realized. However, most of these applications are limited within the 2D coordinate system of each single camera, lacking a unified understanding of the 3D world as a whole. In addition, overly simple functionalities, such as framing certain areas or displaying text, limit the system intelligence and user experience. This article proposes a solution of realtime 3D visualization of outdoor scenes enabled by AI and the Visual Internet of Things (V-IoT). First, fixed and airborne cameras, infrared cameras, LiDAR, gas sensors, and so on are deployed to collect multi-modal data and send them to the clouds. Then AI algorithms are executed in the clouds to calculate the location of people, vehicles, and other moving objects, and to detect fights, stampedes, fire, or other abnormal events. Finally, the clouds send the AI algorithm results to the visualization system in terminal devices. The system displays the scene in real time through 3D animation and charts, and provides user interaction interfaces and simulation functionalities in a gamification environment. Experiments show that the proposed solution realistically visualizes the real world to sup-nort the user's decision.

AB Isobutylene elastomers are of great commercial importance in tire applications because of their notable low gas permeability properties, owing to their efficient molecular packing. Brominated isobutylene-co-para-methylstyrene (BIMSM) elastomers are a special class of isobutylene elastomers synthesized by random cationic polymerization of isobutylene and para-methylstyrene (pMS), followed by a selective bromination of the methyl group of the pMS units. BIMSM elastomer, commercially known as Exxproe specialty elastomer, exhibits superior heat resistance and aging properties and is much more resistant to chemicals and ozone than butyl-or halobutyl polymers because of its fully saturated backbone structure. The permeability properties of BIMSM elastomers can be tuned by the level of pMS comonomer present in the polymer chain. The pMS comonomer increases the glass transition temperature of the copolymer, and polymers with very low gas permeability needed for demanding tire air retention applications can be produced by suitably selecting the pMS content. A single type of benzylic bromide, but with a versatile functional group, allows for precise control of vulcanization chemistry, potential for other chemical transformations to achieve other reactive groups, and grafting reactions. We present the new material developments to meet the growing market demands and requirements for low maintenance, low inflation pressure loss rate tires and tires for connected autonomous shared electric vehicles.

AB Making morally sensitive decisions and evaluations pervade many human everyday activities. Philosophers, economists, psychologists and behavioural scientists researching such decision-making typically explore the principles, processes and predictors that constitute human moral decision-making. Crucially, very little research has explored the theoretical and methodological development (supported by empirical evidence) of utilitarian theories of moral decision-making. Accordingly, in this critical review article, we invite the reader on a moral journey from Jeremy Bentham's utilitarianism to the veil of ignorance reasoning, via a recent theoretical proposal emphasising utilitarian moral behaviour-perspective-taking accessibility (PT accessibility). PT accessibility research revealed that providing participants with access to all situational perspectives in moral scenarios, eliminates (previously reported in the literature) inconsistency between their moral judgements and choices. Moreover, in contrast to any previous theoretical and methodological accounts, moral scenarios/tasks with full PT accessibility provide the participants with unbiased even odds (neither risk averse nor risk seeking) and impartiality. We conclude that the proposed by Martin et al. PT Accessibility (a new type of veil of ignorance with even odds that do not trigger self-interest, risk related preferences or decision biases) is necessary in order to measure humans' prosocial utilitarian behaviour and promote its societal benefits.

AB This paper deals with an experimental study for shuttle-based storage and retrieval system (SBS/RS) design to identify significant factors affecting the performance metrics in the system. SBS/RS is an automated warehouse technology developed to overcome recent order profile resulting from increased e-commerce. Recent order profile has been shaped towards more product variety with less volume and short response time. In SBS/RS technology, each tier of an aisle typically has a dedicated shuttle processing orders hence, it has a very high transaction rate compared to its opponents. Neverthless, there can be several design options that can improve the performance of these systems. In this study first, the significant design factors affecting the pre-defined SBS/RS performance measures (e.g., average cycle time and energy consumption for a transaction; amount of energy regeneration for a transaction, etc.) are identified. Secondly, the best levels of these critical design factors improving the performance measures are identified. For this purpose, a statistical test, namely Tukey's test, is utilized. For the modelling purpose, simulation modelling using ARENA 14.0, is utilized. The statistical analyses from the simulation results are performed using Minitab 17 statistical software.

AB Asemantic map, which can provide important data to facilitate a drone's understanding to the environment, is critical for a fully autonomous drone. However, recent methods for producing such a map implemented on small drones that use low-/middle-grade processors and graphics processing units can hardly achieve real-time performance. In addition, few existing methods can reconstruct semantic planes based on a sparse depth map, which can greatly reduce computational load while encountering challenges in semantic reconstruction. To address this problem, this paper presents a novel on-board approach, called sparse fusion, which demonstrates real-time reconstruction of a semantic plane on a self-designed small drone. The approach combines the sparse depth map derived from a visual-inertial simultaneous localization and mapping with the semantic labels derived from a convolutional neural network for each frame using sparse fusion. Our proposed local plane optimization function greatly improves the accuracy of the semantic plane. Experimental results on various scenarios demonstrate that our sparse fusion module running on the drone platform can update the semantic plane within 1 ms, which is faster and achieves greater accuracy than the state-of-the-art real-time semantic reconstruction method. We also conducted experiments in real environments to demonstrate the performance of our method.

AB Vision-based pedestrian detection that can last all day is crucial in advanced driver-assistance systems (ADAS), autonomous vehicles and video surveillance. Based on the fact that the wavelength of human body radiation falls around 9.3 mu m, thermal images have distinctive advantages for pedestrian detection in the nighttime. With the recent success of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) in the vision community, how to properly explore information in color and thermal images using CNNs-based methods attracts the attention of researchers. Previous CNN-based multispectral pedestrian detectors focus on the design of network architectures. The main contributions of this paper are as follows. First, pixel-level image fusion are also extensively evaluated based on a state-of-the-art CNNs-based framework in the daytime and nighttime for pedestrian detection. Second, the effective strategies to combine pixel-level fusion methods and CNN-fusion architectures are studied based on extensive experimental results. Two combination strategies are designed and an exhaustive experimental analysis is performed to evaluate different combinations for all-day pedestrian detection. Extensive results based on a multispectral pedestrian benchmark show that some pixel-level image fusion methods can achieve similar or even better performance than CNN-fusion architectures, which emphasizes the importance of pixel-level fusion in CNN-based pedestrian detectors. The combination of both can usually more properly exploit multispectral information and further boost detection performance.

AB A robust obstacle detection and avoidance system is essential for long term autonomy of autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs). Forward looking sonars are usually used to detect and localize obstacles. However, high amounts of background noise and clutter present in underwater environments makes it difficult to detect obstacles reliably. Moreover, lack of GPS signals in underwater environments leads to poor localization of the AUV. This translates to uncertainty in the position of the obstacle relative to a global frame of reference. We propose an obstacle detection and avoidance algorithm for AUVs which differs from existing techniques in two aspects. First, we use a local occupancy grid that is attached to the body frame of the AUV, and not to the global frame in order to localize the obstacle accurately with respect to the AUV alone. Second, our technique adopts a probabilistic framework which makes use of probabilities of detection and false alarm to deal with the high amounts of noise and clutter present in the sonar data. This local probabilistic occupancy grid is used to extract potential obstacles which are then sent to the command and control (C2) system of the AUV. The C2 system checks for possible collision and carries out an evasive maneuver accordingly. Experiments are carried out to show the viability of the proposed algorithm.

AB A shuttle-based storage and retrieval system (SBS/RS) is a relatively new material-handling facility. A multi-elevator tier-captive SBS/RS is a newly designed subset of such a facility. This new system consists of tier-captive shuttle carriers, multiple elevators with a lifting table, and racks. The storage rack of the system is defined in terms of tiers, columns, and the number and position of the elevators. The aim of this study is to develop an efficient simulation model that can be auto-remodeled for different rack configurations. With this model, it will be easy for warehouse designers to test a large number of rack alternatives and to determine the optimal solution efficiently. Furthermore, the designers can illustrate the solution to shareholders through animation identical to the real system. A simulation case study is presented for a multi-elevator tier-captive SBS/RS containing 81 different rack alternatives. These alternatives are simulated under 15 different retrieval rates within 48 h, and finally, the optimal rack design is found out. We believe that our work will assist warehouse designers in efficiently designing racks of multi-elevator tier-captive SBS/RSs during early technology selection. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

AB A set of data assimilation experiments, known as Observing System Experiments (OSEs) are performed to assess the relative impacts of different types of observations acquired during the 2009 Prince William Sound Field Experiment. The observations assimilated consist primarily of two types: High Frequency (HF) radar surface velocities and vertical profiles of temperature/salinity (T/S) measured by ships, moorings, an Autonomous Underwater Vehicle and a glider. The impact of all the observations, HF radar surface velocities, and T/S profiles is assessed. Without data assimilation, a frequently occurring cyclonic eddy in the central Sound is overly persistent and intense. The assimilation of the HF radar velocities effectively reduces these biases and improves the representation of the velocities as well as the T/S fields in the Sound. The assimilation of the T/S profiles improves the large scale representation of the temperature/salinity and also the velocity field in the central Sound. The combination of the HF radar surface velocities and sparse T/S profiles results in an observing system capable of representing the circulation in the Sound reliably and thus producing analyses and forecasts with useful skill.

AB A thruster reconfiguration control approach of manned submarine with 7000m operation depth based on quantum-behaved particle swarm optimisation (QPSO) is presented in this article. The manned submarine has eight thrusters. When thruster faults happen, the corresponding weight matrix is updated to restrict the usage of the faulty thruster. But the solution with this method may become unfeasible (exceed the rated valve of the thruster) and cannot be directly applied to the thrusters. In order to complete an appropriate control law reconfiguration, a novel control reallocation method based on QPSO is proposed. Not only is the solution obtained by the approach of QPSO limited in the whole feasible space, but also the control error of the fault-tolerant control is very small. Eight dimensions of the particles are used in this article, and each particle represents the components of the control vector, it searches in the range of the restricted factor value to make sure that all the reconfiguration control solutions are feasible. Compared to the weighted pseudo-inverse method, the error of the obtained control vector with the QPSO is very small. Finally, simulation examples of multi-uncertain faults are given to illustrate the advantages of the proposed method.

AB High-precision positioning is essential for emerging mass-market applications such as autonomous driving, unmanned aerial vehicles and intelligent transportation in complex urban canyons. Without global navigation satellite system (GNSS) reference stations, the real-time kinematic precise point positioning (PPP-RTK) technique is widely used in these fields because of its fast and accurate absolute positioning capability. However, in complex urban canyons, the performance of PPP-RTK deteriorates dramatically due to the satellite signal obstruction and interference. In contrast, inertial navigation system (INS) and visual navigation can provide precise relative pose estimation, but they suffer from serious error accumulation. Therefore, there is a strong complementary advantage between GNSS and INS/Vision navigation and positioning. In this study, a tightly coupled PPP-RTK/INS/Vision integration model is developed, aiming at improving the performance of PPP-RTK in terms of precision and availability to achieve robust positioning in complex urban canyons. Vehicle-borne experiments with different typical urban scenarios were carried out. We found that the positioning precision, availability and the ambiguity fixing rate of PPP-RTK can be significantly improved by tightly coupling with INS and Vision. The positioning precision of tightly coupled micro-electro-mechanical system (MEMS)-based PPP-RTK/INS/Vision is 6 cm, 5 cm and 10 cm in the east, north and up components, respectively, with an ambiguity fixing rate of 83.6% in typical urban environments, which are comparable to the statistics of a tactical-based PPP-RTK/INS tight integration. Even in complex urban canyons, the positioning precision of tightly coupled MEMS-based PPP-RTK/INS/Vision solution can still reach 11 cm, 7 cm and 13 cm in the east, north and up components, respectively, exhibiting improvements of over 90% compared to GNSS-only PPP-RTK. These results indicate that PPP-RTK tightly coupled with low-cost MEMS-IMU and monocular vision can provide high-precision and high-reliability navigation and positioning solutions even in complex urban environments.

AB With advanced policy and technology support, driverless cars are expected to be a reality on Australian roads in next 5-10 years. The pace at which driverless cars emerge as a mainstream travel mode greatly depends on public adoption and acceptance; this is likely to be based on multiple factors. The impact these factors may have on various adoption time horizons, however, is rarely discussed in contemporary research. Therefore, this study focuses on illustrating the impact of factors associated with the adoption of driverless cars in Australia. A survey was conducted on 2608 participants living in metropolitan Brisbane, Melbourne, and Sydney. A total of 1108 participants expressed their preference towards driverless car adoption over three different time intervals, ranging from now to 10 years following deployment. Four random parameters ordered probit models were developed using the survey data-three separate models for Brisbane, Melbourne, and Sydney, and one for the combined dataset. Significance differences among models were evaluated using the likelihood ratio test. The results showed a significant difference among cities in terms of contributing factors towards driverless car adoption timeline. Additionally, different groups, considering the following factors-gender, age, household members, level of education, employment status, income, driving licence duration, travel distance to school, travel distance for social outings, car ownership, familiarity with driving aids and driverless car rid-ing-exhibited a mixed interest regarding the adoption timeline for driverless cars. Other groups, considering the following factors exhibited a unidirectional interest-age, level of education, workplace type, income, employment status, travel distance to work, travel distance to school, travel distance for social outings, number of employed in a household, occupation, driver's licence age, number of smart tech use, driverless car trip purpose, feature preference in a driverless car, and use of driving aids. The study offers insights for future planning and policy direction related to driverless car adoption.

AB The 25 year time-series collected at Station M, similar to 4000 m on the Monterey Deep-sea Fan, has substantially improved understanding of the role of the deep-ocean benthic environment in the global carbon cycle. However, the role of deep-ocean benthic megafauna in carbon bioturbation, remineralization and sequestration is relatively unknown. It is important to gather both accurate and precise measurements of megafaunal community abundance, size distribution and biomass to further define their role in deep-sea carbon cycling and possible sequestration. This study describes initial results from a stereo camera system attached to a remotely operated vehicle and analyzed using the EventMeasure photogrammetric measurement software to estimate the density, length and biomass of 10 species of mobile epibenthic megafauna. Stereo length estimates were compared to those from a single video camera system equipped with sizing lasers and analyzed using the Monterey Bay Aquarium Research Institute's Video Annotation and Reference System. Both camera systems and software were capable of high measurement accuracy and precision ( < +/- 1 mm measurement error and precision). However, the oblique angle of the single video camera caused the spatial scale of the image perspective to change with distance from the camera, resulting in error when measurements were not parallel or vertical to two horizontal-oriented scaling lasers. Analysis showed that the stereo system recorded longer lengths and higher biomass estimates than the single video camera system for the majority of the 10 megafauna species studied. The stereo image analysis process took substantially longer than the video analysis and the value of the EventMeasure software tool would be improved with developments in analysis automation. The stereo system is less influenced by object orientation and height, and is potentially a useful tool to be mounted on an autonomous underwater vehicle and for measuring deep-sea pelagic animals where the use of lasers is not feasible.

ID SYSTEMS
AB Real-time machine learning detection algorithms are often found within autonomous vehicle technology and depend on quality datasets. It is essential that these algorithms work correctly in everyday conditions as well as under strong sun glare. Reports indicate glare is one of the two most prominent environment-related reasons for crashes. However, existing datasets, such as LISA and the German Traffic Sign Recognition Benchmark, do not reflect the existence of sun glare at all. This paper presents the GLARE traffic sign dataset: a collection of images with U.S based traffic signs under heavy visual interference by sunlight. GLARE contains 2,157 images of traffic signs with sun glare, pulled from 33 videos of dashcam footage of roads in the United States. It provides an essential enrichment to the widely used LISA Traffic Sign dataset. Our experimental study shows that although several state-of-the-art baseline methods demonstrate superior performance when trained and tested against traffic sign datasets without sun glare, they greatly suffer when tested against GLARE (e.g., ranging from 9% to 21% mean mAP, which is significantly lower than the performances on LISA dataset). We also notice that current architectures have better detection accuracy (e.g., on average 42% mean mAP gain for mainstream algorithms) when trained on images of traffic signs in sun glare.

AB Machine learning (ML) allows the Internet of Things (IoT) to gain hidden insights from the treasure trove of sensed data and be truly ubiquitous without explicitly looking for knowledge and data patterns. Without ML, IoT cannot withstand the future requirements of businesses, governments, and individual users. The primary goal of IoT is to perceive what is happening in our surroundings and allow automation of decision-making through intelligent methods, which will mimic the decisions made by humans. In this paper, we classify and discuss the literature on ML-enabled IoT from three perspectives: data, application, and industry. We elaborate with dozens of cutting-edge methods and applications through a review of around 300 published sources on how ML and IoT work together to play a crucial role in making our environments smarter. We also discuss emerging IoT trends, including the Internet of Behavior (IoB), pandemic management, connected autonomous vehicles, edge and fog computing, and lightweight deep learning. Further, we classify challenges to IoT in four classes: technological, individual, business, and society. This paper will help exploit IoT opportunities and challenges to make our societies more prosperous and sustainable.

AB This article presents a novel spatiotemporal optimization approach for vertical path planning (i.e., waypoint optimization) to maximize the net output power of an ocean current turbine (OCT) under uncertain ocean velocities. To determine the net power, OCT power generation from hydrokinetic energy and the power consumption for controlling the depth are modeled. The stochastic behavior of ocean velocities is a function of spatial and temporal parameters, which is modeled through a Gaussian process (CP) approach. Two different algorithms, including model predictive control (MPC) as a model-based method and reinforcement learning (RL) as a learning-based method, are applied to solve the formulated spatiotemporal optimization problem with constraints. Comparative studies show that the MPC- and RL-based methods are computationally feasible to address vertical path planning, which are evaluated with a baseline A* approach. Analysis of the robustness is further carried out under the inaccurate ocean velocity predictions. Results verify the efficiency of the presented methods in finding the optimal path to maximize the total power of an OCT system, where the total harnessed energy after 200 h shows over an 18% increase compared to the case without optimization.

TI Obstacle Avoidance Path Planning for UAV Based on Improved RRT Algorithm
SO DISCRETE DYNAMICS IN NATURE AND SOCIETY
LA English
DT Article
AB Obstacle avoidance path planning capability, as one of the key capabilities of UAV (Unmanned Aerial Vehicle) to achieve safe autonomous flight, has always been a hot research topic in UAV research filed. As a commonly used obstacle avoidance path planning algorithm, RRT (Rapid-exploration Random Tree) algorithm can carry out obstacle avoidance path planning in real time and online. In addition, it can obtain the asymptotically optimal obstacle avoidance path on the premise of ensuring the completeness of probability. However, it has some problems, such as high randomness, slow convergence speed, long transit time, and curved flight trajectory, so that it cannot meet the flight conditions of the actual UAV. To solve these problems, the paper proposes an improved RRT algorithm. In the process of extending the random tree, ACO (ant colony optimization) is introduced to make the planning path asymptotically optimal. The optimized algorithm can set pheromones on the path obtained by RRT and select the next extension point according to the pheromone concentration. And then through a certain number of iterations, it converges to an ideal path scheme. In addition, this paper also uses MATLAB to verify the effectiveness and superiority of the algorithm: Although RRT is easy to fall into local optimization, since the optimization method in this paper can almost certainly converge to the optimal solution, when it is necessary to preplan the path before UAV takeoff, it can be used.

AB Recent progress in parallel computing machines, deep neural networks, and training techniques have contributed to the significant advances in artificial intelligence (AI) with respect to tasks such as object classification, speech recognition, and natural language processing. The development of such deep learning-based techniques has enabled AI-based networks to outperform humans in the recognition of objects in images. The graphics processing unit (GPU) has been the primary component used for parallel computing during the inference and training phases of deep neural networks. In this study, we perform training using a desktop or a server with one or more GPUs and inference using hardware accelerators on embedded devices. Performance, power consumption, and requirements of embedded system present major hindrances to the application of deep neural network-based systems using embedded controllers such as drones, AI speakers, and autonomous vehicles. In particular, power consumption of a commercial GPU commonly surpasses the power budget of a stand-alone embedded system.
   To reduce the power consumption of hardware accelerators, reductions in the precision of input data and hardware weight have become popular topics of research in this field. However, precision and accuracy share a trade-off relationship. Therefore, it is essential to optimize precision in a manner that does not degrade the accuracy of the inference process. In this context, the primary issues faced by hardware accelerators are loss of accuracy and high power consumption.

AB Real-time centimetre-level precise positioning from Global Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSS) is critical for activities including landslide, glacier and coastal erosion monitoring, flood modelling, precision agriculture, intelligent transport systems, autonomous vehicles and the Internet of Things. This may be achieved via the real-time kinematic (RTK) GNSS approach, which uses a single receiver and a network of continuously operating GNSS reference stations (CORS). However, existing CORS networks have often been established simply by attempting regular spacing or in clusters around cities, with little consideration of weather, climate and topography effects, which influence the GNSS tropospheric delay, a substantial GNSS positional error and which prevents homogeneous RTK accuracy attainment. Here, we develop a framework towards optimizing the design of CORS ground infrastructure, such that tropospheric delay errors reduce to 1.5mm worth of precipitable water vapour (PWV) globally. We obtain average optimal station spacings of 52km in local summer and 70km in local winter, inversely related to the atmospheric PWV variation, with denser networks typically required in the tropics and in mountainous areas. We also consider local CORS network infrastructure case studies, showing how after network modification interpolated PWV errors can be reduced from around 2.7 to 1.4mm.

AB Nuclear infrastructure systems play an important role in national security. The functions and missions of nuclear infrastructure systems are vital to government, businesses, society and citizen's lives. It is crucial to design nuclear infrastructure for scalability, reliability and robustness. To do this, we can use machine learning, which is a state of the art technology used in various fields ranging from voice recognition, Internet of Things (IoT) device management and autonomous vehicles. In this paper, we propose to design and develop a machine learning algorithm to perform predictive maintenance of nuclear infrastructure. Support vector machine and logistic regression algorithms will be used to perform the prediction. These machine learning techniques have been used to explore and compare rare events that could occur in nuclear infrastructure. As per our literature review, support vector machines provide better performance metrics. In this paper, we have performed parameter optimization for both algorithms mentioned. Existing research has been done in conditions with a great volume of data, but this paper presents a novel approach to correlate nuclear infrastructure data samples where the density of probability is very low. This paper also identifies the respective motivations and distinguishes between benefits and drawbacks of the selected machine learning algorithms.

AB The Ocean Observatories Initiative (OOI) of the National Science Foundation in the USA includes a coastal observatory called the OOI Pioneer Array, which is focused on understanding shelf/slope exchange processes. The OOI Pioneer Array has been designed and constructed and is currently in operation. In order to fully understand the design principles and constraints, we first describe the basic exchange processes and review prior experiments in the region. Emphasis is placed on the space and time scales of important exchange processes such as frontal meandering and warm core ring interactions with the Shelfbreak Front, the dominant sources of variability in the region. The three major components of the Pioneer Array are then described, including preliminary data from the underwater gliders and Autonomous Underwater Vehicle (AUV) deployments. The relevance of the Pioneer Array to important recent scientific issues in the area, including enhanced warming of the continental shelf and increasing frequency and spatial extent of Gulf Stream interactions with the continental shelf is discussed. Finally, similar observatories in Asia are briefly described, and general conclusions regarding principles that should guide the design of shelfbreak observatories in other geographic regions are presented.

AB Developing complex robotic systems requires expensive and time-consuming verification and testing which, especially in a case of multi-robot unmanned aerial systems (UASs), aggregates risk of hardware failures and may pose legal issues in experiments where operating more than one unmanned aircraft simultaneously is required. Thus, it is highly favorable to find and resolve most of the eventual design flaws and system bugs in a simulation, where their impacts are significantly lower. On the other hand, as the system development process approaches the final stages, the fidelity of the simulation needs to rise. However, since some phenomena that can significantly influence the system behavior are difficult to be modeled precisely, a partial embodiment of the simulation in the physical world is necessary. In this paper, we present a method for incremental development of complex unmanned aerial systems with the help of mixed reality simulations. The presented methodology is accompanied with a cost analysis to further show its benefits. The generality and versatility of the method is demonstrated in three practical use cases of various aviation systems development: (i) an unmanned system consisting of heterogeneous team of autonomous unmanned aircraft; (ii) a system for verification of collision avoidance methods among fixed wing unmanned aerial vehicles; and (iii) a system for planning collision-free paths for light-sport aircraft.

AB Automated driving (AD) is one of the most significant technical advances in the transportation industry. Its safety, economic, and environmental benefits cannot be realized if it is not used. To explain, predict, and increase its acceptance, we need to understand how people perceive and why they accept or reject AD technology. Drawing upon the trust heuristic, we tested a psychological model to explain three acceptance measures of fully AD (FAD): general acceptance, willingness to pay (WTP), and behavioral intention (BI). This heuristic suggests that social trust can directly affect acceptance or indirectly affect acceptance through perceived benefits and risks. Using a survey (N = 441), we found that social trust retained a direct effect as well as an indirect effect on all FAD acceptance measures. The indirect effect of social trust was more prominent in forming general acceptance; the direct effect of social trust was more prominent in explaining WTP and BI. Compared to perceived risk, perceived benefit was a stronger predictor of all FAD acceptance measures and also a stronger mediator of the trust-acceptance relationship. Predictive ability of the proposed model for the three acceptance measures was confirmed. We discuss the implications of our results for theory and practice.

AB Closeup exploration of underwater life requires new forms of interaction, using biomimetic creatures that are capable of agile swimming maneuvers, equipped with cameras, and supported by remote human operation. Current robotic prototypes do not provide adequate platforms for studying marine life in their natural habitats. This work presents the design, fabrication, control, and oceanic testing of a soft robotic fish that can swim in three dimensions to continuously record the aquatic life it is following or engaging. Using a miniaturized acoustic communication module, a diver can direct the fish by sending commands such as speed, turning angle, and dynamic vertical diving. This work builds on previous generations of robotic fish that were restricted to one plane in shallow water and lacked remote control. Experimental results gathered from tests along coral reefs in the Pacific Ocean show that the robotic fish can successfully navigate around aquatic life at depths ranging from 0 to 18 meters. Furthermore, our robotic fish exhibits a lifelike undulating tail motion enabled by a soft robotic actuator design that can potentially facilitate a more natural integration into the ocean environment. We believe that our study advances beyond what is currently achievable using traditional thruster-based and tethered autonomous underwater vehicles, demonstrating methods that can be used in the future for studying the interactions of aquatic life and ocean dynamics.

AB Modern autonomous mobile robots require a strong understanding of their surroundings in order to safely operate in cluttered and dynamic environments. Monocular depth estimation offers a geometry-independent paradigm to detect free, navigable space with minimum space, and power consumption. These represent highly desirable features, especially for microaerial vehicles. In order to guarantee robust operation in real-world scenarios, the estimator is required to generalize well in diverse environments. Most of the existent depth estimators do not consider generalization, and only benchmark their performance on publicly available datasets after specific fine tuning. Generalization can be achieved by training on several heterogeneous datasets, but their collection and labeling is costly. In this letter, we propose a deep neural network for scene depth estimation that is trained on synthetic datasets, which allow inexpensive generation of ground truth data. We show how this approach is able to generalize well across different scenarios. In addition, we show how the addition of long short-term memory layers in the network helps to alleviate, in sequential image streams, some of the intrinsic limitations of monocular vision, such as global scale estimation, with low computational overhead. We demonstrate that the network is able to generalize well with respect to different real-world environments without any fine tuning, achieving comparable performance to state-of-the-art methods on the KITTI dataset.

AB We study robotic mobile fulfilment systems for online retailers, where products are stored in movable shelves and robots transport shelves. While previous studies assume random assignment rule of workstations to robots, we propose an assignment rule based on handling speeds of workstations and design a neighbourhood search algorithm to find a near optimal assignment rule. We build semi-open queueing networks and use a two-phase approximate approach for performance estimation. We first replace workstation service processes by a composite service node and then solve the model by the matrix-geometric method. Simulations are used to validate the analytical models. Numerical experiments are conducted to compare random, handling-speeds-based, near optimal and optimal assignment rules, in terms of retrieval throughput time. The results show that the random assignment rule is not a good choice, the handling-speeds-based assignment rule significantly outperforms the random assignment rule when the workers have large handling time difference, and the neighbourhood search approach can provide an assignment rule that is very close to the optimal one, using a much shorter time. Moreover, we design the shelf blocks under the examined assignment rules, and find that the optimal width of shelf block decreases with the width to length ratio.

DE Magnetic signature; AUVs; AUV collaboration
ID AUTONOMOUS UNDERWATER VEHICLES; VARIABILITY
AB Measurement of the magnetic signature of naval vessels allows one to determine their vulnerability to mines, and thus whether the signatures must be reduced. Hypothetically, a formation of magnetometer-equipped AUVs could be used to perform a magnetic signature measurement. In this work, a formation of three magnetometer-equipped AUVs was used to assess the feasibility of performing a magnetic signature measurement on a moving surface vessel. The AUVs used localization from acoustic transponders fixed to the bottom, data contained in acoustic communications, an inertial measurement unit, and other onboard sensors to navigate during the experiments. A surface vessel with a fiberglass hull was outfitted with a permanent magnet at the bow, and directed to travel on a straight course. The AUVs navigated in the opposite direction, passing underneath the surface vessel. Position estimates for individual magnetic field measurements using AUV-acquired navigation data were found to be accurate to within an average of 1.2 m. Magnetic fields of 100-300 nT were clearly measured, consistent with the 5-10 nT noise floor of the AUV/magnetometer unit. In the measurements that were performed, total uncertainty in signature measurement was estimated to be 250 nT in the presence of a magnetic field gradient of similar to 200 nT/m.

AB This paper illustrates a single antenna structure that simultaneously satisfies the antenna requirement for 5G cellular and global navigation satellite systems (GNSS). The antenna has a linearly polarised omnidirectional radiation for the newly defined 5G sub-6 GHz cellular bands in the 617-5000 MHz frequency range. In contrast, a right-hand circular polarisation (RHCP) with a hemispherical radiation pattern at the GNSS L1 has a frequency range of 1559-1606 MHz. This multi-function antenna would provide a simplified product design and better space utilisation, particularly suitable for flat antenna modules and automotive. The primary concept involves employing a planar inverted F antenna structure to generate radiation modes for cellular bands and incorporate U-slot on the top plate to generate the GNSS radiation modes. The design methodology utilises the characteristic mode analysis tool to tune the desired radiation characteristic mode at the intended frequency range for each function. The antenna was fabricated, and the performance was evaluated on a 1-m ground plane. The GNSS RHCP gain measures 5 dBc at boresight, with an axial ratio below 2 dB across the L1 bands, while the cellular gain maintains an excellent return loss and omnidirectional radiation pattern performance across the cellular bands.

AB Recent advancements in 3D deep learning have led to significant progress in improving accuracy and reducing processing time, with applications spanning various domains such as medical imaging, robotics, and autonomous vehicle navigation for identifying and segmenting different structures. In this study, we employ the latest developments in 3D semi-supervised learning to create cutting-edge models for the 3D object detection and segmentation of buried structures in high-resolution X-ray semiconductors scans. We illustrate our approach to locating the region of interest of the structures, their individual components, and their void defects. We showcase how semi-supervised learning is utilized to capitalize on the vast amounts of available unlabeled data to enhance both detection and segmentation performance. Additionally, we explore the benefit of contrastive learning in the data pre-selection step for our detection model and multi-scale Mean Teacher training paradigm in 3D semantic segmentation to achieve better performance compared with the state of the art. Our extensive experiments have shown that our method achieves competitive performance and is able to outperform by up to 16% on object detection and 7.8% on semantic segmentation. Additionally, our automated metrology package shows a mean error of less than 2 mu m for key features such as Bond Line Thickness and pad misalignment.

ID WATER-SURFACE; PERFORMANCE; FLOW
AB Fish-like robot is a special autonomous underwater vehicle with broad application prospects. Some previous studies concentrated on the hydrodynamics of free-swimming fish-like robots. But the hydrodynamic performance of fish-like robot swimming with a tilt angle in constrained space has not been well studied, and the influence of environmental wave and current on its is also still unclear. In this paper, the experiment devices, including a physical fish-like robot, a hydrodynamics measurement platform, and a six-axis force sensor, are used to study the effect of attack angle and environmental condition on the hydrodynamics of near-surface swimming fish-like robot. Nine attack angles, five oscillating amplitudes, and three environmental conditions are analyzed in the experiments. It shows that thrust force decreases when caudal fin passes above water surface, but the increased difference between gravity force and buoyancy force will compensate the decreased force generated by caudal fin when fish-like robot swims with certain dive angle. The extra reaction force generated by solid bottom boundary will promote the thrust force and vertical force. The surface water wave condition or surface water current condition also has obvious effects on hydrodynamic performance. This paper provides a new perspective to the research on the hydrodynamic performance of fish-like robot and will do favor in the development of fish-like robot.

ID LOCALIZATION
AB Loop closure detection is the crucial issue of simultaneous localization and mapping in the field of autonomous driving and robotics. In outdoor large-scale and complex environments, the existing LiDAR-based methods still inevitably suffer from viewpoint, condition changes, and perceptual aliasing. To effectively fill the aforementioned drawbacks, in this article, a novel LiDAR-based multimodule cascaded Siamese convolutional neural networks is developed, named MMCS-Net, which simulates the human-eye mechanism to extract more discriminative and generic feature descriptors. The MMCS-Net is mainly composed of three complementary modules: Siamese full convolutional (CA_SFC) module with cascaded attention, rotation-invariant and topological feature enhancement (RT_E) module, and feature uniqueness enhancement and aggregation compression (UE_AC) module. In particular, the graph structure employed in RT_E can explicitly encode the local topological correlations of point clouds in terms of intensity and geometric clues in parallel. Extensive comparative experiments on KITTI, NCLT, LGSVL, and real vehicle datasets prove that our proposed method outperforms the state-of-the-art methods, and shows high robustness while ensuring the real-time requirements of resource-constrained robots.

AB The use of flying robots (drones) is increasing rapidly, but their utility is limited by high power demand, low specific energy storage and poor gust tolerance. By contrast, birds demonstrate long endurance, harvesting atmospheric energy in environments ranging from cluttered cityscapes to open landscapes, coasts and oceans. Here, we identify new opportunities for flying robots, drawing upon the soaring flight of birds. We evaluate mechanical energy transfer in soaring from first principles and review soaring strategies encompassing the use of updrafts (thermal or orographic) and wind gradients (spatial or temporal). We examine the extent to which state-of-the-art flying robots currently use each strategy and identify several untapped opportunities including slope soaring over built environments, thermal soaring over oceans and opportunistic gust soaring. In principle, the energetic benefits of soaring are accessible to flying robots of all kinds, given atmospherically aware sensor systems, guidance strategies and gust tolerance. Hence, while there is clear scope for specialist robots that soar like albatrosses, or which use persistent thermals like vultures, the greatest untapped potential may lie in non-specialist vehicles that make flexible use of atmospheric energy through path planning and flight control, as demonstrated by generalist flyers such as gulls, kites and crows.

AB Light Detection And Ranging (LiDAR) is an important technology integrated into self-driving cars to enhance the reliability of these systems. Even with some advantages over cameras, it is still limited under extreme weather conditions such as heavy rain, fog, or snow. Traditional methods such as Radius Outlier Removal (ROR) and Statistical Outlier Removal (SOR) are limited in their ability to detect snow points in LiDAR point clouds. This paper proposes an Adaptive Group of Density Outlier Removal (AGDOR) filter that can remove snow particles more effectively in raw LiDAR point clouds, with verification on the Winter Adverse Driving Dataset (WADS). In our proposed method, an intensity threshold combined with a proposed outlier removal filter was employed. Outstanding performance was obtained, with higher accuracy up to 96% and processing speed of 0.51 s per frame in our result. In particular, our filter outperforms the state-of-the-art filter by achieving a 16.32% higher Precision at the same accuracy. However, our method archive is lower in recall than the state-of-the-art method. This clearly indicates that AGDOR retains a significant amount of object points from LiDAR. The results suggest that our filter would be useful for snow removal under harsh weathers for autonomous driving systems.

AB Cyber-physical systems (CPS) are applicable in emerging industries such as health, energy, autonomous vehicles, and Industrial Internet of Things (IIOT). In CPS the physical assets, that is, actuators and sensors, etc. communicate with each other over a messaging protocol. This communication process of CPS makes them vulnerable to cyber-attacks which challenge the system safety, making security and safety two major concerns for CPS. Both safety and security risks are considered separately in literature. However, the International Society of Automation (ISA) focuses on the alignment of security and safety risks of CPS. Weak or no alignment in safety and security of a system may result in an inefficient or partially protected system which could end up in disasters. This pressed the need for an integrated safety-security risk management process. For this purpose, we used a tetra packaging case study to (i) examine the vulnerabilities of CPS by running the risk management process, (ii) identify safety-security requirements, and (iii) align retrieved safety-security requirements with the relevant standards. The results show (i) safety hazards and security risks along with their severity and priority, (ii) mitigation guidelines are provided by consulting IEC 61508, and (iii) 15 safety-security requirements are identified and are aligned with ISO9001 Packaging and labeling machine standard.

AB In this letter, we present a novel markerless 3D human motion capture (MoCap) system for unstructured, outdoor environments that uses a team of autonomous unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) with on-hoard RGB cameras and computation. Existing methods are limited by calibrated cameras and off-line processing. Thus, we present the first method (AirPose) to estimate human pose and shape using images captured by multiple extrinsically uncalibrated flying cameras. AirPose itself calibrates the cameras relative to the person instead of relying on any pre-calibration. It uses distributed neural networks running on each UAV that communicate viewpoint-independent information with each other about the person (i.e., their 3D shape and articulated pose). The person's shape and pose are parameterized using the SMPL-X body model, resulting in a compact representation, that minimizes communication between the UAVs. The network is trained using synthetic images of realistic virtual environments, and fine-tuned on a small set of real images. We also introduce an optimization-based post-processing method (AirPose+) for offline applications that require higher MoCap quality. We make our method's code and data available for research at https://github.com/robot-perception-group/AirPose. A video describing the approach and results is available at https://youtu.be/xLYelTNHsfs.

DT Review
DE Mobile Robots; Path planning; Reactive path planning; Potential field;
   Dynamical Motion Planning; UAV
AB Unmanned Aerial Vehicle applications have highly increased in the last years, from surveillance, exploration, rescue to transport applications. UAVs are more and more autonomous, therefore real-time trajectory planning is necessary and can be achieved thanks to artificial potential fields. The classic Ge & Cui repulsive force solely allows taking into account the velocity of the obstacles without any distinction. The Weyl potential force associates a degree of danger with an obstacle and has enabled to distinguish between the obstacles but the obstacle velocity is no more considered. Therefore, a new dynamical fractional repulsive force has been proposed by combining both advantages. The new dynamical fractional repulsive potential field is usable in a 3D environment and takes into account both the obstacle dynamics (position and speed) and their degree of dangerousness. Obstacle avoidance robustness is guaranteed, both from a safety point of view and from a trajectory optimization point of view. The proposed repulsive potential fields are first of all dynamical as they are based on the relative position and speed of the UAV in relation to the obstacle positions and speeds. Moreover, the dangerousness of the obstacles is also considered by introducing a fractional degree in their definition. Simulations results are provided to compare different repulsive potential field method (Ge & Cui, Weyl methods) to the proposed dynamical fractional potential field both in static and dynamical environments.

ID SEA-CHANGE; VEHICLES
AB Underwater glider (UG) is one of the most promising low-power and long-voyage autonomous ocean observation platforms. During the gliding, the roll regulation unit (RRU) frequently works to regulate the disturbed heading due to the influence of time-varying current, biofouling, and cumulative error of RRU. In this paper, an accurate energy consumption model of RRU (E-RRU) is established to quantify the impact of RRU on the overall energy consumption, and the trial data collected by the Petrel-L glider, China, in the South China Sea are used to verify the accuracy of E-RRU. To minimize the working frequency of RRU, a new roll center compensation method (RCCM) is proposed based on variational mode decomposition and long short-term memory (VMD-LSTM). This study analyzes six classical prediction methods based on deep learning, and the VMD-LSTM at k = 5 method is the optimal one to predict the deviation of roll center for UGs. The results indicate that the proposed RCCM can obtain accurate and reliable compensation value for the roll center and effectively restrain the working frequency of RRU. Compared with the data before compensation, the Eggu of the Petrel-L glider is reduced by approximately 22%. Furthermore, the RCCM can apply to other similar UGs.

AB The collaborative mission capability of multi-UAV has received more and more attention in recent years as the research on multi-UAV theories and applications has intensified. The artificial intelligence technology integrated into the multi-UAV collaborative decision-making system can effectively improve the collaborative mission capability of multi-UAV. We propose a multi-agent reinforcement learning algorithm for multi-UAV collaborative decision-making. Our approach is based on the actor-critic algorithm, where each UAV is treated as an actor that collects data decentralized in the environment. A centralized critic provides evaluation information for each training step during the centralized training of these actors. We introduce a gate recurrent unit in the actor to enable the UAV to make reasonable decisions concerning historical decision information. Moreover, we use an attention mechanism to design the centralized critic, which can achieve better learning in a complex environment. Finally, the algorithm is trained and experimented in a multi-UAV air combat scenario developed in the collaborative decision-making environment. The experimental results show that our approach can learn collaborative decision-making strategies with excellent performance, while convergence performance is better compared to other algorithms.

AB While recording fish habitat use by electronic sensors, biologgers can also be viewed as autonomous environmental monitoring systems with the organism as a vehicle. This dual perspective has provided novel results from marine ecosystems, but has not been applied to freshwater ecosystems. To understand limitations in fresh water, we evaluated miniature depth and temperature recorders as aquatic monitoring systems in a Laurentian Great Lake: Erie. As part of an acoustic telemetry study, biologgers were opportunistically implanted in a subsample of walleye Sander vitreus. Biologgers recorded temperature and depth at half-hour intervals for up to 1 year. Recaptures provided six biologgers for analysis of seasonal temperature patterns and lake stratification, key variables for understanding dimictic lakes. Depth-resolved temperature patterns showed close correspondence with independent weather buoy measurements. Because the buoy was deployed late in the season, biologger data provided improved estimates of the start of stratification, which had important implications for understanding development of hypoxia in the hypolimnion. Drawbacks to biologger data included imprecise knowledge of fish location and reliance on tag recoveries from the fishery. Optimistically, our results show how biologgers could be part of a monitoring approach that integrates limnological surveys with fisheries science.

AB Currently, integrated trends play a key role in every aspect of automation applications. In particular, if the mechanization of agriculture becomes a competitive factor among farmers or nations, then the multi-functional transportation of agricultural products is inevitable in global trade. In sustainable transportation, the challenge of overcoming stable control in harsh environments, such as through imprecise parameters or varying loads, should be addressed. In this paper, a novel controller for a nonholonomic mechanical system able to adapt to uncertainties is proposed. Based on the multi-functional autonomous carrier (MAC), the system configuration of the kinematic and dynamic model is launched in order to identify the unstable problems that arise when tracking the trajectory. To solve these troubles, the decoupled formation of a MAC system has been investigated by considering two second-order components, namely a linear speed-based sub-system and angular speed-based sub-system. To stabilize the whole system using the Lyapunov theory, the advanced control techniques are studied. To validate the proposed approach, a series of test scenarios have been carried out. From the superior performance of numerous trials, it is clear that our approach is effective, feasible, and reasonable for the advanced control of agricultural applications.

AB The last two decades have shown an increasing need for GaN-based laser diodes (LDs), which are currently only grown on bulk GaN substrates, which remain to date very expensive and/or only available in small sizes. The ever growing laser market will expand in the coming years, thanks to the development of automotive laser lighting, high-speed Li-Fi optical data transmission, LiDAR sensing for autonomous vehicles and smart cities, head-up displays, and AR/VR systems, in addition to biomedical and further industrial applications. These emerging technologies demand for mass-production of GaN-based lasers to be produced on large-size, low-cost, and industrially compatible substrates. To address this issue, we demonstrate the first electrically injected semipolar 440 nm LD on high-quality and low-defect-density (11-22) GaN templates grown on scalable and low-cost sapphire substrates. The LDs exhibit a threshold current density of 17 kA/cm(2), a single facet output power of more than 200 mW at 2 A with a slope efficiency of 0.85 W/A, and a TE polarization having a ratio of 97.6%. These results enable the advancement of ultra-low-cost LDs while benefiting from the inherent advantages of semipolar GaN properties.

TI Fair cost allocation for ridesharing services - modeling, mathematical
   programming and an algorithm to find the nucleolus
SO TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH PART B-METHODOLOGICAL
LA English
DT Article
AB This paper addresses one of the most challenging issues in designing an efficient and sustainable ridesharing service: ridesharing market design. We formulate it as a fair cost allocation problem through the lens of the cooperative game theory. A special property of the cooperative ridesharing game is that its characteristic function values are calculated by solving an optimization problem. Several concepts of fairness are investigated and special attention is paid to a solution concept named nucleolus, which aims to minimize the maximum dissatisfaction in the system. Due to its computational intractability, we break the problem into a master-subproblem structure and two subproblems are developed to generate constraints for the master problem. We propose a coalition generation procedure to find the nucleolus and approximate nucleolus of the game. Experimental results showed that when the game has a non-empty core, in the approximate nucleolus scheme the coalitions are computed only when it is necessary and the approximate procedure produces the actual nucleolus. And when the game has an empty core, the approximate nucleolus is close to the actual one. Regardless of the emptiness of the game, our algorithm needs to generate only a small fraction (1.6%) of the total coalition constraints to compute the approximate nucleolus. The proposed model and results nicely fit systems operated by autonomous vehicles. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

ID DESIGN
AB The concept of reconfigurable magnetic coupling thrusters (RMCT) applied to the vectorial thrust of autonomous underwater vehicles (AUV) has been recently developed and presented. This technology ensures greater robot watertightness with enhanced maneuvering capabilities, which are desired features in agile AUVs for marine renewable energy (MRE) system maintenance. It is possible since in RMCTs the driving torque is magnetically transmitted to the propeller, which has its orientation changed. This work is focused on the coupling and control torque calculation and further analysis of the latest prototype version (Flat-RMCT), in the static condition for the full thrust vector range. For this purpose, a numerical model is implemented and validated with experimental results. The numerical model is based on the finite volume integral method. The results indicate that the minimum magnetic reluctance propensity creates not only the expected magnetic spring effect but also an auto-driving torque due to the non-axial symmetry of coupling rotors, which exists only for reconfigurable couplings. Mathematical functions are proposed to model these effects and they are used to extend the understanding of the coupling. These models can be used to compose a full and accurate dynamic model for a better RMCT simulation, identification, and control.

AB Mobile wireless sensor networks have been extensively deployed for enhancing environmental monitoring and surveillance. The availability of low-cost mobile robots equipped with a variety of sensors makes them promising in target coverage tasks. They are particularly suitable where quick, inexpensive, or nonlasting visual sensing solutions are required. In this paper, we consider the problem of low complexity target tracking to cover and follow moving targets using flying robots. We tackle this problem by clustering targets while estimating the camera location and orientation for each cluster separately through a cover-set coverage method. We also leverage partial knowledge of target mobility to enhance the efficiency of our proposed algorithms. Three computationally efficient approaches are developed: predictive fuzzy, predictive incremental fuzzy, and local incremental fuzzy. The objective is to find a compromise among coverage efficiency, traveled distance, number of drones required, and complexity. The targets move according to one of the following three possible mobility patterns: random waypoint, Manhattan grid, and reference point group mobility patterns. The feasibility of our algorithms and their performance are also tested on a real-world indoor testbed called drone-be-gone, using Parrot AR.Drone quadcopters. The deployment confirms the results obtained with simulations and highlights the suitability of the proposed solutions for real-time applications.

AB The location of a vessel's center of flotation during operation at sea plays an important role in the vessel's longitudinal stability. The ability to accurately estimate the location of the center of flotation improves safety monitoring as it indicates how changes in the distribution of weight affect the vessel. In this paper, we propose a novel method for estimating the longitudinal location of a vessel's center of flotation in waves using acceleration readings taken simultaneously at different locations along the length of the vessel. Specifically, we recorded accelerations of an autonomous surface vehicle (ASV) in a towing tank. The ASV was operated in head and following regular waves, which were kept at a constant wave height of 0.12 m while the wave frequency was increased from 0.5 to 0.8 Hz at increments of 0.1 Hz. The results show that multiple acceleration measurements can be used to correctly determine the center of flotation of a vessel in waves. In this experiment, the estimated location of the center of flotation varied as expected based on the longitudinal asymmetry of the ASV and the difference between head and following waves, demonstrating the effectiveness of the proposed method. In addition, the results were validated using the vessel's recorded pitch motion.

To gather high-precision information about the UGV's surroundings, Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) is frequently used to collect large-scale point clouds. However, the complex spatial features of these clouds, such as being unstructured, diffuse, and disordered, make it difficult to segment and recognize individual objects. This paper therefore develops an object feature extraction and classification system that uses LiDAR point clouds to classify 3D objects in urban environments. After eliminating the ground points via a height threshold method, this describes the 3D objects in terms of their geometrical features, namely their volume, density, and eigenvalues. A back-propagation neural network (BPNN) model is trained (over the course of many iterations) to use these extracted features to classify objects into five types. During the training period, the parameters in each layer of the BPNN model are continually changed and modified via back-propagation using a non-linear sigmoid function. In the system, the object segmentation process supports obstacle detection for autonomous driving, and the object recognition method provides an environment perception function for terrain modeling. Our experimental results indicate that the object recognition accuracy achieve 91.5% in outdoor environment.

AB We present acoustic records of methane bubble streams recorded similar to 10 km southwest of Heceta Bank on the Oregon continental margin using an autonomous hydrophone. The hydrophone was deployed at 1228 m water depth via a Remotely Operated Vehicle (ROV) during the E/V Nautilus expedition (NA072) in June 2016. Bubble sound is produced by detachment of the gas bubble from the end of a tube or conduit which causes the bubble to oscillate, producing a sound signal. Despite persistent ship propeller and ROV noise, the acoustic signature of the overall bubble seep site can be seen in the hydrophone record as a broadband (1.0 - 45 kHz) series of short duration (similar to 10-20 ms) oscillatory signals that occur in clusters lasting 2-3 s. The frequency of an individual bubble's oscillation is proportional to the bubble's radius; estimates here of bubble radii are consistent with bubble sizes observed in ROV still images. Acoustic signal loss models imply bubble sounds might be recorded over an area of seafloor from similar to 300 - 3.2 x 10(4) m(2). This study represents a first-step in attempting to identify and quantify deep-ocean bubble stream sounds using passive acoustic techniques.

TI Simulation Analysis for UAV Search Algorithm Design Using Approximate
   Dynamic Programming
SO MILITARY OPERATIONS RESEARCH
LA English
DT Article
AB Many decision-and-control algorithms have been proposed for autonomous unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs). The nature of this problem, with large decision spaces and the desire for optimal performance criteria, indicates that closed-form analysis of any approach is nearly impossible, suggesting a simulation-based performance evaluation of relevant scenarios. However, while effective simulation practices have been developed in the operations-research community, awareness of them in the decision-and-control community may be lower than desired for routine application. If applied correctly, these simulation techniques could have a major impact on the quality and effectiveness of UAV algorithms. This paper provides a concrete example that demonstrates that the marriage of UAV decision-and-control algorithms with proper simulation techniques can be done effectively and with great benefits for the UAV algorithm researcher, both in terms of the validity and quality of simulation results. The example used in this case is a study conducted for a stochastic UAV algorithm design. In particular, the study is to find the "optimal" sensitivity of a "future-gain" factor that attempts to balance future and present gains in a stochastic-approximate dynamic-programming solution to the problem faced by a team of UAVs searching in an uncertain environment for targets. This work can serve as a template for similar simulation experiments in this area. Experimental motivation and demonstration of the results are given.

AB Maneuvers may be defined as a series of changes in direction and position for a specified purpose (as in changing course, switching tracks, or docking). Although the definition excludes hovering, this is considered to be a maneuver by biologists. Maneuvers are typically complex, combining more than one translational and rotational component. They are usually driven by hydrodynamic forces, which may be classified as trimming (steering), driven by the kinetic energy of a moving animal, or powered forces, driven by force generation by the control surfaces themselves. Force production by effectors are affected by molecular structure, material properties, degrees of freedom for movement, the number of propulsors working together, and interactions with other organisms/objects, as well as time through a maneuver and/or a powered fm beat. The result is a large repertoire of maneuvering behaviors and high redundancy in control systems. There is no unanimity on quantifying maneuvering performance, but maximum capabilities appear to be most appropriate. Performance metrics will vary from maneuver to maneuver and the scaling product group seems unlikely even for specified maneuvers. An exception is relative volume swept out. Seeking inspiration from biology for the design of autonomous underwater vehicles requires explicit a priori statements of mission goals.

AB This study presents a systematic analysis and interpretation of autonomous underwater vehicle-based microbathymetry combined with remotely operated vehicle (ROV) video recordings, rock analyses and temperature measurements within the PACManus hydrothermal area located on Pual Ridge in the Bismarck Sea of eastern Manus Basin. The data obtained during research cruise Magellan-06 and So-216 provides a framework for understanding the relationship between the volcanism, tectonism and hydrothermal activity. PACManus is a submarine felsic vocanically-hosted hydrothermal area that hosts multiple vent fields located within several hundred meters of one another but with different fluid chemistries, vent temperatures and morphologies. The total area of hydrothermal activity is estimated to be 20,279 m(2). The microbathymetry maps combined with the ROV video observations allow for precise high-resolution mapping estimates of the areal extents of hydrothermal activity. We find the distribution of hydrothermal fields in the PACManus area is primarily controlled by volcanic features that include lava domes, thick and massive blocky lava flows, breccias and feeder dykes. Spatial variation in the permeability of local volcanic facies appears to control the distribution of venting within a field. We define a three-stage chronological sequence for the volcanic evolution of the PACManus based on lava flow morphology, sediment cover and lava SiO2 concentration. In Stage-1, sparsely to moderately porphyritic dacite lavas (68-69.8 wt.% SiO2) erupted to form domes or cryptodomes. In Stage-2, aphyric lava with slightly lower SiO2 concentrations (67.2-67.9 wt.% SiO2) formed jumbled and pillowed lava flows. In the most recent phase Stage-3, massive blocky lavas with 69 to 72.5 wt% SiO2 were erupted through multiple vents constructing a volcanic ridge identified as the PACManus neovolcanic zone. The transition between these stages may be gradual and related to progressive heating of a silicic magma following a recharge event of hot, mantle-derived melts. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

ID NATURAL ANALOG; ACOUSTIC TOMOGRAPHY; OCEAN
AB Carbon dioxide capture and storage (CCS) in sub-seabed geological formations is currently being studied as a potential option to mitigate the accumulation of anthropogenic CO2 in the atmosphere. To investigate the validity of CO2 storage in the sub-seafloor, development of techniques to detect and monitor CO2 leaked from the seafloor is vital. Seafloor-based acoustic tomography is a technique that can be used to observe emissions of liquid CO2 or CO2 gas bubbles from the seafloor. By deploying a number of acoustic tomography units in a seabed area used for CCS, CO2 leakage from the seafloor can be monitored. In addition, an in situ pH/pCO(2) sensor can take rapid and high-precision measurements in seawater, and is, therefore, able to detect pH and pCO(2) changes due to the leaked CO2. The pH sensor uses a solid-state pH electrode and reference electrode instead of a glass electrode, and is sealed within a gas permeable membrane filled with an inner solution. Thus, by installing a pH/pCO(2) sensor onto an autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV), an automated observation technology is realized that can detect and monitor CO2 leakage from the seafloor. Furthermore, by towing a multi-layer monitoring system (a number of pH/pCO(2) sensors and transponders) behind the AUV, the dispersion of leaked CO2 in a CCS area can also be observed. Finally, an automatic elevator can observe the time-series dispersion of leaked CO2. The seafloor-mounted automatic elevator consists of a buoy equipped with pH/pCO(2) and depth sensors, and uses an Eulerian method to collect spatially continuous data as it ascends and descends.
   Hence, CO2 leakage from the seafloor is detected and monitored as follows. Step 1: monitor CO2 leakage by seafloor-based acoustic tomography. Step 2: conduct mapping survey of the leakage point by using the pH/pCO(2) sensor installed in the AUV. Step 3: observe the impacted area by using a remotely operated underwater vehicle or the automatic elevator, or by towing the multi-layer monitoring system. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

AB Autonomous unmanned aircraft need a good semantic understanding of their surroundings to plan safe routes or to find safe landing sites, for example, by means of a semantic segmentation of an image stream. Currently, Neural Networks often give state-of-the-art results on semantic segmentation tasks but need a huge amount of diverse training data to achieve these results. In aviation, this amount of data is hard to acquire but the usage of synthetic data from game engines could solve this problem. However, related work, e.g., in the automotive sector, shows a performance drop when applying these models to real images. In this work, the usage of synthetic training data for semantic segmentation of the environment from a UAV perspective is investigated. A real image dataset from a UAV perspective is stylistically replicated in a game engine and images are extracted to train a Neural Network. The evaluation is carried out on real images and shows that training on synthetic images alone is not sufficient but that when fine-tuning the model, they can reduce the amount of real data needed for training significantly. This research shows that synthetic images may be a promising direction to bring Neural Networks for environment perception into aerospace applications.

AB With the prevalence of big-data-driven applications, such as face recognition on smartphones and tailored recommendations from Google Ads, we are on the road to a lifestyle with significantly more intelligence than ever before. Various neural network powered models are running at the back end of their intelligence to enable quick responses to users. Supporting those models requires lots of cloud-based computational resources, e.g., CPUs and GPUs. The cloud providers charge their clients by the amount of resources that they occupy. Clients have to balance the budget and quality of experiences (e.g., response time). The budget leans on individual business owners, and the required Quality of Experience (QoE) depends on usage scenarios of different applications. For instance, an autonomous vehicle requires an real-time response, but unlocking your smartphone can tolerate delays. However, cloud providers fail to offer a QoE-based option to their clients. In this paper, we propose DQoES, differentiated quality of experience scheduler for deep learning inferences. DQoES accepts clients' specifications on targeted QoEs, and dynamically adjusts resources to approach their targets. Through the extensive cloud-based experiments, DQoES demonstrates that it can schedule multiple concurrent jobs with respect to various QoEs and achieve up to 8x times more satisfied models when compared to the existing system.

AB Accurate trajectory-tracking control for quadrotors is essential for safe navigation in cluttered environments. However, this is challenging in agile flights due to nonlinear dynamics, complex aerodynamic effects, and actuation constraints. In this article, we empirically compare two state-of-the-art control frameworks: the nonlinear-model-predictive controller (NMPC) and the differential-flatness-based controller (DFBC), by tracking a wide variety of agile trajectories at speeds up to 20 m/s (i.e., 72 km/h). The comparisons are performed in both simulation and real-world environments to systematically evaluate both methods from the aspect of tracking accuracy, robustness, and computational efficiency. We show the superiority of the NMPC in tracking dynamically infeasible trajectories, at the cost of higher computation time and risk of numerical convergence issues. For both methods, we also quantitatively study the effect of adding an inner loop controller using the incremental nonlinear dynamic inversion method, and the effect of adding an aerodynamic drag model. Our real-world experiments, performed in one of the world's largest motion capture systems, demonstrate more than 78% tracking error reduction of both NMPC and DFBC, indicating the necessity of using an inner loop controller and aerodynamic drag model for agile trajectory tracking.

AB Due to the accuracy limitation of the underwater positioning system and the interference of the external envi-ronment, the actual trajectory of the autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) will deviate from the predetermined path during the underwater mission, which cannot guarantee the mission completion and safety. To reduce navigation errors, this paper introduces forward-looking sonar (FLS) and proposes a path correction scheme based on error estimation of underwater sensor networks: Derive the position and attitude of the AUV by pro-cessing FLS images to obtain the relative orientation between the robot and the target; combine the node in-formation in the time-varying navigation map to calculate the error with the planned path; then fused with the a priori error of the underwater sensor network to build the error system model; completion of path re-planning based on the improved Bionic Neural Wave Network (BNWN) algorithm and time-varying navigation map; adjust the weight parameters during the iteration to make the drift error converge and finally complete the correction of the path. Simulation experiments prove that the path planned in this scheme can neutralize the drift errors from the algorithm level, and the AUV can complete the capture of dynamic and static targets with a small error when tracking this path.

AB This paper investigates the finite-time extended state observer-based Dynamic Positioning (DP) control of turret-moored vessels with unavailable velocities and uncertainties. The control objective is to assist the mooring system of vessel in achieving area keeping and heading control. Firstly, unavailable velocities and uncertainties are estimated simultaneously by the designed finite-time Extended State Observer (ESO), where finite-time convergence and high accuracy of estimated values are guaranteed. Then, a reliability index is introduced to quantify the breakage probability of mooring lines. Based on estimated values and reliability index, a finite-time DP controller is proposed for area keeping and heading control of turret-moored vessels. The proposed controller can improve utilization efficiency of mooring system and guarantee finite-time convergence of all signals in closed-loop control system. Meanwhile, a saturation function is integrated into the controller to decrease the thrusters??? energy consumption. Finally, simulations and comparisons demonstrate the performance of finite-time ESO and DP controller. ?? 2021 Society of Naval Architects of Korea. Production and hosting by Elsevier B.V.

   detection and ranging (lidar); mutual interference; signal cross-talk
AB Signal interference between two light detection and ranging (lidar) scanners can occur when the transmitted laser energy from one lidar is coupled into a second lidar either by scattering or direct transmission. By ray tracing lidar transmission paths, it is shown that signal interference can be modeled with the coincidence of intersections between two lidars' optical axes and a scattering target or medium. A geometric analysis of intersecting transmission paths is presented for circularly scanning lidars from which theoretical interference risks between two lidars may be deduced. Using the geometric rules proposed here for interference, a Monte Carlo simulation is presented that models interference risks and occurrences. This geometric approximation simplifies analysis by ignoring radiometry for scanners within proximity to one another. Simulation results are used to introduce the concept of intersection point density from which one may assess areas of greatest interference risk for two-lidar, in-plane scanning lidar configurations. It is shown from the intersection point density that the risk for signal interference between two lidars exponentially increases as targets are located closer to and between the two scanners. Simulation results are compared to previously published experimental observations of interference to demonstrate the theory's potential for interference modeling.

AB The availability of information and communication (IC) resources is a growing problem caused by the increase in the number of users, IC services, and the capacity constraints. IC resources need to be available to legitimate users at the required time. The availability is of crucial importance in IC environments such as smart city, autonomous vehicle, or critical infrastructure management systems. In the mentioned and similar environments the unavailability of resources can also have negative consequences on people's safety. The distributed denial of service (DDoS) attacks and traffic that such attacks generate, represent a growing problem in the last decade. Their goal is to disable access to the resources for legitimate users. This paper analyses the trends of such traffic which indicates the importance of its detection methods research. The paper also provides an overview of the currently used approaches used in detection system and model development. Based on the analysis of the previous research, the disadvantages of the used approaches have been identified which opens the space and gives the direction for future research. Besides the mentioned this paper highlights a DDoS traffic generated through Internet of things (IoT) devices as an evolving threat that needs to be taken into consideration in the future studies.

AB We present a laboratory experiment of the initial growth of a turbulent patch in a stably stratified fluid. The patch is created due to a localized source of turbulence, generated by a horizontally oriented and vertically oscillating grid much smaller than the tank size and far from solid boundaries. Synchronized and overlapping particle image velocimetry(PIV) and planar laser induced fluorescence (PLIF) measurements capture the evolution of the patch through its initial growth until it reached a maximum size. The simultaneous measurements of density and velocity fields allow for a direct quantification of the distribution of kinetic energy, buoyancy and degree of mixing within the patch. We can also relate the propagation speed of the turbulent/non-turbulent interface and its thickness to the properties of the turbulent fluid inside the evolving patch. The velocity measurements in this setup indicate significant transient effects inside the patch during its growth. A local analysis of the turbulent/non-turbulent interface provides direct measurements of the entrainment velocity w(e), as compared to the local vertical velocity and turbulent intensity at the proximity of the interface. The detailed information about the growth of localized sources of turbulence in stratified environment might be of use in stealth design of autonomous underwater vehicles. (C) 2017 Elsevier Inc.

AB Over the past decade, the fixed recorders have come into increasing use for long-term sampling of whale calls in remote ocean regions. Concurrently, the development of several types of autonomous underwater vehicles has demonstrated measurement capabilities that promise to revolutionize oceans science. These two lines of technical development were merged with the addition of broadband (5 Hz to 30 KHz) omni-directional hydrophones to seagliders. In August 2006, the capability of three Acoustic Seagliders (ASGs) to detect whale calls was tested in an experiment offshore Monterey, California. In total, 401 dives were completed and over 107 hours of acoustic data record. Blue whale calls were detected on all but two of the 76 dives on roughly 20% of those dives. Various whistles, clicks and burst calls, similar to those produced by dolphins and small whales, were also detected , suggesting that the capability of ASGs can be expanded of sample a broad range of marine mammal species. The potential to include whale call detection in the suite of standard oceanographic measures is unprecedented and provides a foundation for mobile sampling strategies at scales that better match the vertical and horizontal movements of whales themselves. This capability opens new doors for investigation of cetacean habitats and their role in marine ecosystems, as envisioned in future ocean observing systems.

AB The National Aeronautics and Space Administration's (NASA's) New Millennium Program (NMP) is designed to reduce the cost of spacecraft in the 21st century while simultaneously increasing spacecraft capabilities, thereby increasing the return on our investment in space exploration. The NMP process is being enacted in the following manner: We are developing a science vision for the 21st century and identifying the attendant missions of this vision. These missions, in turn, will specify the capabilities that future spacecraft require. Technology-validation flights will be selected to demonstrate specific high pay-off technologies needed to provide these capabilities. These hey technologies are categorized by certain areas - autonomy, microelectronics, communications, and so on and will be flight validated prior to the 21st century in order to enable our vision for the next century. To that end, and keeping in mind our science vision, the technologies will primarily be those that allow us to reduce the size of spacecraft instruments, and in turn the size of the spacecraft itself, so that smaller launch vehicles can be employed Also, these technologies will provide for autonomous spacecraft capability and shorter mission flight times so that the ground operations staff for future space missions can be reduced, thus bringing down costs in this area as well. This paper presents specific examples of these hey technologies and their pay-offs. Copyright (C) 1997 Elsevier Science Ltd.

As such, this paper presents a cooperative decision-making method based on incomplete information dynamic game to generate maneuver strategies for multiple UAVs in air combat. Firstly, a cooperative situation assessment model is presented to measure the overall combat situation. Secondly, an incomplete information dynamic game model is proposed to model the dynamic process of air combat, and a dynamic Bayesian network is designed to infer the tactical intention of the opponent. Then a reinforcement learning framework based on multi-agent deep deterministic policy gradient is established to obtain the perfect Bayes-Nash equilibrium solution of the air combat game model. Finally, a series of simulations are conducted to verify the effectiveness of the proposed method, and the simulation results show effective synergies and cooperative tactics.(c) 2022 China Ordnance Society.

AB Aiming at the requirement of autonomous navigation capability of the underwater unmanned vehicle (UUV), a novel bionic method for underwater navigation based on polarization pattern within Snell's window is proposed. Inspired by creatures, polarization navigation is a satellite-free navigation scheme and has great potential to be used in the water. However, because of the complex underwater environment, whether UUV polarization navigation can be realized is doubtful. To illustrate the feasibility of underwater polarization navigation, we firstly establish the model of underwater polarization patterns to prove the stability and predictability of the underwater polarization pattern within Snell's window. Then, we carry out static and dynamic experiments of underwater heading determination based on developed polarization information detection equipment. Finally, we obtain underwater polarization patterns and conduct the tracking experiment at different water depths. The experimental results of the underwater polarization patterns are consistent with the simulation, which proves the correctness of the proposed model. At the water depth of 5 m, the average angle and position error of the tracking experiment are 14.3508 & DEG; and 4.0812 m, respectively. It is illustrated that underwater polarization navigation is realizable and the precision can meet the real-time navigation requirements of UUV. This study promotes the improvement of underwater navigation ability and the development of marine equipment.

AB Image registration is an electronic imaging technology that matches two or more images acquired at different times or under different conditions. Here, we highlight the application of image registration in monitoring robots (e.g., autonomous vehicles) of coal mines. In image registration processing, the scale-invariant feature transform algorithm and its improved versions achieve poor extraction effects for feature points on smooth-edge curves. In comparison, the speeded-up robust features (SURF) algorithm achieves more stable registration results in various images. To improve the accuracy of the SURF algorithm, it is optimized using the particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm and several improved PSOs, but it achieves unstable accuracy. Therefore, we optimize the improved gray wolf algorithm (IGWO) using advanced mathematical models in several computing steps. We add the memory function of both experienced individual and group optimal locations in PSO to update the particle positions. The evaluations performed on different datasets show that the accuracy and range of registration are substantially improved by IGWO and IGWO-PSO; however, the running time is extended. Thus, our improved method is competitive with other state-of-the-art image registration methods. (c) 2022 SPIE and IS&T

AB Deep learning algorithms for object detection used in autonomous vehicles require a huge amount of labeled data. Data collecting and labeling is time consuming and, most importantly, in most cases useful only for a single specific sensor application. Therefore, in the course of the research which is presented in this paper, the LiDAR pedestrian detection algorithm was trained on synthetically generated data and mixed (real and synthetic) datasets. The road environment was simulated with the application of the 3D rendering Carla engine, while the data for analysis were obtained from the LiDAR sensor model. In the proposed approach, the data generated by the simulator are automatically labeled, reshaped into range images and used as training data for a deep learning algorithm. Real data from Waymo open dataset are used to validate the performance of detectors trained on synthetic, real and mixed datasets. YOLOv4 neural network architecture is used for pedestrian detection from the LiDAR data. The goal of this paper is to verify if the synthetically generated data can improve the detector's performance. Presented results prove that the YOLOv4 model trained on a custom mixed dataset achieved an increase in precision and recall of a few percent, giving an F1-score of 0.84.

ID HARDWARE IMPLEMENTATION; MECHANISM
AB In recent years, the recreational and commercial use of flight and driving simulators has become more popular. All these applications require the calculation of orientation in either two or three dimensions. Besides the Euler angles notation, other alternatives to represent rigid body rotations include axis-angle notation, homogeneous transformation matrices, and quaternions. All these methods involve transcendental functions in their calculations, which represents a disadvantage when these algorithms are implemented in hardware. The use of transcendental functions in software-based algorithms may not represent a significant disadvantage, but in hardware-based algorithms, the potential of rational models stands out. Generally, to calculate transcendental functions in hardware, it is necessary to utilize algorithms based on the CORDIC algorithm, which requires a significant amount of hardware resources (parallel) or the design of a more complex control unit (pipelined). This research presents a new procedure for model orientation using rational trigonometry and quaternion notation, avoiding trigonometric functions for calculations. We describe the orientation of a gimbal mechanism presented in many applications, from autonomous vehicles such as cars or drones to industrial manipulators. This research aims to compare the efficiency of a rational implementation to classical modeling using the techniques mentioned above. Furthermore, we simulate the models with software tools and propose a hardware architecture to implement our algorithms.

AB In recent years, the autonomous landing of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) has attracted extensive attention due to the widespread applications of UAVs. With the rapid improvements in machine learning and artificial intelligence, recent research has begun to explore deep reinforcement learning (DRL) to learn the landing policy directly from raw observation data. However, current DRL-based solutions tend to suffer poor generalization to unseen environments. To deal with this issue, we formulate the landing problem as a two-stage DRL problem and bootstrap the DRL procedures by augmenting regular DRL loss with an auxiliary localization task. The auxiliary localization task provides dense supervision signals that aid in landing-relevant representation learning. In particular, two marker localization approaches are delicately designed based on deep classification and regression models, and differences between the two configurations are explored, aiming to answer the fundamental question of how to exploit localization better for representation learning. Furthermore, we propose a novel and flexible sampling strategy called Dynamic Partitioned Experience Replay to stabilize and accelerate the training procedure. Experimental results show that the auxiliary localization tasks combined with the improved sampling strategy aid the trained model to generalize in unseen environments. In addition, the trained model can be seamlessly transferred to the real-world quadrotors and has achieved outstanding landing performances.

AB Embedded systems continue to rapidly proliferate in diverse fields, including medical devices, autonomous vehicles, and more generally, the Internet of Things (IoT). Many embedded systems require application-specific hardware components to meet precise timing requirements within limited resource (area and energy) constraints. High-level synthesis (HLS) is an increasingly popular approach for improving the productivity of designing hardware and reducing the time/cost by using high-level languages to specify computational functionality and automatically generate hardware implementations. However, current HLS methods provide limited or no support to incorporate or utilize precise timing specifications within the synthesis and optimization process. In this paper, we present a hybrid high-level synthesis (H-HLS) framework that integrates state-based highlevel synthesis (SB-HLS) with performance-driven high-level synthesis (PD-HLS) methods to enable the design and optimization of application-specific embedded systems in which timing information is explicitly and precisely defined in state-based system models. We demonstrate the results achieved by this H-HLS approach using case studies including a wearable pregnancy monitoring device, an ECG-based biometric authentication system, and a synthetic system, and compare the design space exploration results using two PD-HLS tools to show how HHLS can provide low energy and area under timing constraints.(c) 2021 Elsevier Science.

AB Navigation solutions suitable for cases when both autonomous robot's pose (i.e., attitude and position) and its environment are unknown are in great demand. Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) fulfills this need by concurrently mapping the environment and observing robot's pose with respect to the map. This work proposes a nonlinear observer for SLAM posed on the manifold of the Lie group of SLAM(n)(3), characterized by systematic convergence, and designed to mimic the nonlinear motion dynamics of the true SLAM problem. The system error is constrained to start within a known large set and decay systematically to settle within a known small set. The proposed estimator is guaranteed to achieve predefined transient and steady-state performance and eliminate the unknown bias inevitably present in velocity measurements by directly using measurements of angular and translational velocity, landmarks, and information collected by an inertial measurement unit (IMU). Experimental results obtained by testing the proposed solution on a real-world dataset collected by a quadrotor demonstrate the observer's ability to estimate the six-degrees-of-freedom (6 DoF) robot pose and to position unknown landmarks in three-dimensional (3D) space.

AB Mapping knowledge domain (MKD) is an important application in bibliometrics, which is a method of visually presenting and explaining newly developed interdisciplinary scientific fields using data mining, information analysis, scientific measurement, and graphic rendering. This study combines applied mathematics, visual analysis technology, information science, and scientometrics to systematically analyze the development status, research distribution, and future trend of the heterogeneous traffic flow by using the MKD software tools VOSviewer and CiteSpace. Based on the MKD and Bibliometrics approaches, 4709 articles have been studied, which were published by Science Citation Index Expanded (SCIE) and Social Sciences Citation Index (SSCI) from 2004 to 2021 in the field of heterogeneous traffic flows. Firstly, this paper presents the annual numbers of articles, origin countries, main research organizations, and groups as well as the source journals on heterogeneous traffic flow studies. Then, cocitation analysis is used to divide heterogeneous traffic flow into three main research directions, which include "heterogeneous traffic flow model," "traffic flow capacity analysis," and "traffic flow stability analysis." The keyword cooccurrence analysis is applied to identify five dominant clusters: "modeling and optimization methods," "traffic flow characteristics analysis," "driving behavior analysis," "simulation experiment," and "policies and barriers." Finally, burst keywords were studied according to the publication date to present more clearly the change of research focus and direction over time.

AB Increasingly, robotic systems require a level of perception of the scenario to interact in real-time, but they also require specialized equipment such as sensors to reach high performance standards adequately. Therefore, it is essential to explore alternatives to reduce the costs for these systems. For example, a common problem attempted by intelligent robotic systems is path planning. This problem contains different subsystems such as perception, location, control, and planning, and demands a quick response time. Consequently, the design of the solutions is limited and requires specialized elements, increasing the cost and time development. Secondly, virtual reality is employed to train and evaluate algorithms, generating virtual data. For this reason, the virtual dataset can be connected with the authentic world through Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), reducing time development and employing limited samples of the physical world. To describe the performance, metadata information details the properties of the agents in an environment. The metadata approach is tested with an augmented reality system and a micro aerial vehicle (MAV), where both systems are executed in an authentic environment and implemented in embedded devices. This development helps to guide alternatives to reduce resources and costs, but external factors limit these implementations, such as the illumination variation, because the system depends on only a conventional camera.

AB Simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) is a quintessential problem in autonomous navigation, augmented reality, and virtual reality. In particular, low-power SLAM has gained increasing importance for its applications in power-limited edge devices such as unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) and small-sized cars that constitute devices with edge intelligence. This article presents a 7.25-to-8.79-TOPS/W mixed-signal oscillator-based SLAM accelerator for applications in edge robotics. This study proposes a neuromorphic SLAM IC, called NeuroSLAM, employing oscillator-based pose-cells and a digital head direction cell to mimic place cells and head direction cells that have been discovered in a rodent brain. The oscillatory network emulates a spiking neural network and its continuous attractor property achieves spatial cognition with a sparse energy distribution, similar to the brains of rodents. Furthermore, a lightweight vision system with a max-pooling is implemented to support low-power visual odometry and re-localization. The test chip fabricated in a 65-nm CMOS exhibits a peak energy efficiency of 8.79 TOPS/W with a power consumption of 23.82 mW.

AB With robotics technologies advancing rapidly, there are many new robotics applications such as surveillance, mining tasks, search and rescue, and autonomous armies. In this work, we focus on the use of robots for target searching. For example, a collection of Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) could be sent to search for survivor targets in disaster rescue missions, with no prior knowledge of locations and movement behaviors of the survivor targets. Our objective is to compute a search plan that maximizes the probability of finding the targets and minimizes the searching latency. These are critical in search and rescue applications. Our idea is to partition the search area into grid cells and apply the divide-and-conquer approach. We propose two searching strategies, namely, the circuit strategy and the rebound strategy. The robots search the cells in a Hamiltonian circuit in the circuit strategy while they backtrack in the rebound strategy. We prove that the expected searching latency of the circuit strategy for a moving target is upper bounded by 3n(2)-4n+3/2n where n is the number of grid cells of the search region. To handle robot failure, each robot regularly communicates with neighboring robots and takes over the task of a failed neighbor robot. Simulations are conducted and the results show that the circuit strategy with our failure handling mechanism achieves the best search effectiveness.

AB Most of Solar Photovoltaic (PV) cells are limited to space, dryland and rooftop applications leading to huge scope in exploring the performance of PV cells in an underwater environment. Such underwater Solar energy has tremendous potential to be used in many commercial and defense applications like sensors, underwater vehicles, autonomous power systems, etc. Nowadays, another major constraint in Solar PV systems is the cooling and cleaning of PV cells, which can also be overcome by placing PV cells underwater. Although the Solar spectrum itself changes underwater and becomes narrower with increasing the water depth, yet one of the possible solutions is using a suitable type of Solar cells for maximum power conversion underwater. In this work, an experimental setup has been designed and implemented to create an underwater environment. Further, Solar cells have been encapsulated with polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) and diverse characterizations have been accomplished to sense the behavior of amorphous and monocrystalline cells with different water types. This study gives a better understanding to monitor the performance characteristics of Solar PV cells underwater with various factors such as the water depth, type of Solar cell, salinity, total dissolved salts and other impurities which will immensely affect the performance of Solar cells underwater.

AB A dual-coupled inductor-capacitor-capacitor and series (LCC-S) compensated wireless power transfer (WPT) system with a compact receiver size is proposed in this paper to improve the misalignment performance and achieve fault tolerant operation as well as a stable output power. The compensation coil and the main coil are integrated as two decoupled unipolar coils on the transmitter side, while they are both coupled with the receiver coil. The two mutual inductances among the two decoupled coils and the receiver coil have opposite impacts on the output power when they both increase or decrease. Therefore, the output power can remain stable when the misalignment increases. The short- and open-circuit characteristics are analyzed, which demonstrates that the proposed topology can achieve both short- and open-circuit protection. A prototype was built and the experimental results verified the theoretical analysis and simulations. The system can deliver from 297 W to 321 W when the x-misalignment increases from 0 mm to 90 mm, with a dc-dc efficiency of 92.78% to 93.56%. The proposed WPT system can be used for the wireless charging of e-mobility scooters and autonomous underwater vehicles. The system can provide a stable output and can tolerate both short- and open-circuit faults at the output.

AB System of interest (SoI) failures can sometimes be traced to an unexpected behavior occurring within another system that is a member of the system of systems (SoS) with the SoI. This article presents a method for use when designing an SoI that helps to analyze an SoS for unexpected behaviors from existing SoS members during the SoI's conceptual functional modeling phase of system architecture. The concept of irrationality initiators-unanticipated or unexpected failure flows emitted from one system that adversely impact an SoI, which appear to be impossible or irrational to engineers developing the new system-is introduced and implemented in a quantitative risk analysis method. The method is implemented in the failure flow identification and propagation framework to yield a probability distribution of failure paths through an SoI in the SoS. An example of a network of autonomous vehicles operating in a partially denied environment is presented to demonstrate the method. The method presented in this paper allows practitioners to more easily identify potential failure paths and prioritize fixing vulnerabilities in an SoI during functional modeling when significant changes can still be made with minimal impact to cost and schedule.

AB The infotaxis scheme is a search strategy for a diffusive source, where the sensor platform is driven to reduce the uncertainty about the source through climbing the information gradient. The infotaxis scheme has been successfully applied in many source searching tasks and has demonstrated fast and stable searching capabilities. However, the infotaxis scheme focuses on gathering information to reduce the uncertainty down to zero, rather than chasing the most probable estimated source when a reliable estimation is obtained. This leads the sensor to spend more time exploring the space and yields a longer search path. In this paper, from the context of exploration-exploitation balance, a novel search scheme based on minimizing free energy that combines the entropy and the potential energy is proposed. The term entropy is implemented as the exploration to gather more information. The term potential energy, leveraging the distance to the estimated sources, is implemented as the exploitation to reinforce the chasing behavior with the receding of the uncertainty. It results in a faster effective search strategy by which the sensor determines its actions by minimizing the free energy rather than only the entropy in traditional infotaxis. Simulations of the source search task based on the computational plume verify the efficiency of the proposed strategy, achieving a shorter mean search time.

AB Despite increasingly abundant data on revealed travel behaviors, stated preference surveys still play an indispensable role in analyzing and predicting human behaviors in hypothetical scenarios. Recent needs for forecasting travel behaviors in the era of autonomous vehicles and more prevalent sharing economy are examples. However, it is well known that the framing effect in surveys could be significant when asking the same question with different modes, instruments, and wordings. Moreover, systematic deviation is observed when stated preference and revealed preference are compared, per a growing body of studies, due to the framing effect, the change of decision context, and the altered mental states of participants. These situations resemble two prevalent quantum phenomena - measurement influences the state of a system, and different observation sequences on a system render different results. This paper proposes a quantum cognition model consistent with quantum logic and demonstrates its usefulness in the quantitative study of stated and revealed preference. Examples show how to calibrate the model and forecast revealed preference when only stated preference is available. Although the proposed model is not limited to the number of questions, the examples focus on single-question scenarios. This paper takes a utilitarian perspective on quantum mechanics and demonstrates how it could improve survey designs and prediction on revealed preference. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB We study the problem of actively locating a static target using mobile robots equipped with bearing sensors. The goal is to reduce the uncertainty in the target's location to a value below a given threshold in minimum time. Our cost formulation explicitly models time spent in traveling, as well as taking measurements. In addition, we consider distance-based communication constraints between the robots. We provide the following theoretical results. First, we study the properties of an optimal offline strategy for one or more robots with access to the target's true location. We derive the optimal offline algorithm and bound its cost when considering a single robot or an even number of robots. In other cases, we provide a close approximation. Second, we provide a general method of converting the offline algorithm into an online adaptive algorithm (that does not have access to the target's true location), while preserving near optimality. Using these two results, we present an online strategy proven to locate the target up to a desired uncertainty level at near-optimal cost. In addition to theoretical analysis, we validate the algorithm in simulations and multiple field experiments performed using autonomous surface vehicles carrying radio antennas to localize radio tags.

AB This study proposes an experimental framework for collecting on-board data on users' emotions, psychophysiological indicators, and context, to characterize their experience in a granular, scalable, non-intrusive, and ecological way. To gather emotions data, clustering techniques are used to adapt Russell's circumplex model to a transport framework, allowing data to be collected on-board using a smartphone application. For psychophysiological indicators, a specially designed portable PCB (Biomonitor 2.0) is used to record heart rate, heart rate variation, skin temperature, and electrodermal activity with high frequency and fidelity. Context information is collected using ambient sensors and a smartphone application. A proof-of-concept case study is conducted on 44 engineering students traveling for 2.5 hours on various public transport modes in Santiago, Chile, including an autonomous vehicle. The results show that the framework is feasible, and that emotions data can be effectively related to granular records of psychophysiological indicators and context using a discrete choice model. This study sets a precedent for future research to incorporate new granular public transport user satisfaction indicators based on emotions inferred from psychophysiological data and detect causal factors related to users' physical, emotional, and cognitive state.

DE automatic driving; 3D object detection; multi-modal fusion; point cloud
AB In autonomous driving, 3D object detection based on multi-modal data has become an indispensable perceptual approach when facing complex environments around the vehicle. During multi-modal detection, LiDAR and a camera are simultaneously applied for capturing and modeling. However, due to the intrinsic discrepancies between the LiDAR point and camera image, the fusion of the data for object detection encounters a series of problems, which results in most multi-modal detection methods performing worse than LiDAR-only methods. In this investigation, we propose a method named PTA-Det to improve the performance of multi-modal detection. Accompanied by PTA-Det, a Pseudo Point Cloud Generation Network is proposed, which can represent the textural and semantic features of keypoints in the image by pseudo points. Thereafter, through a transformer-based Point Fusion Transition (PFT) module, the features of LiDAR points and pseudo points from an image can be deeply fused under a unified point-based form. The combination of these modules can overcome the main obstacle of cross-modal feature fusion and achieves a complementary and discriminative representation for proposal generation. Extensive experiments on KITTI dataset support the effectiveness of PTA-Det, achieving a mAP (mean average precision) of 77.88% on the car category with relatively few LiDAR input points.

AB This paper empirically examines the hydrodynamic performances of squat submarines under the resistance and wave tests beside numerical investigation of pressure drag reduction techniques. Despite vast information about the operation of the streamlined fluid vessels, there is not much information about the geometries and hydro-dynamic behaviors of squat vessels with L/D ratios below four. This study experimentally investigates the im-pacts of various relative depths and flow inclinations, intending to find drag, heave, and sway forces at the velocities of 0.5, 1.0, 1.5, 2.0, and 2.5-m/s. A one-tenth scaled model of a squat submarine is examined under the resistance and wave train scenarios as the captive model in the towing tank experiments via 110 unique testing scenarios. Then, different pressure drag reduction techniques on the full-scale submarine are evaluated numerically at one-phase fluid by developing stern geometric optimization, nose rod devices, water corridors, and surface patterns at the bow and stern. Results present drag forces increase up to 150% at the 0.5D level for the resistance and wave tests due to the influences of the free surface water. The drag coefficients at the fully submerged depth of 6D differ by up to 13.3% between the numerical and experimental evaluations.

AB In this article, we present a gliding efficiency optimization strategy based on deep reinforcement learning for a gliding robotic fish. For the gliding motion in shallow waters, the nonsteady motion strongly impacts the gliding range and also reduces efficiency. This article presents a concept of transient gliding motion and illustrates its importance for the gliding robotic fish. For better gliding performance of active fins, several pectoral fins with different sizes are designed and their hydrodynamics and optimizing capabilities are analyzed by computational fluid dynamics simulation. Then, a double deep Q network-based optimization strategy is proposed to improve gliding efficiency by active pectoral fins, in which an adversarial model and a two-stage reward function are presented for the adequate calculation of gliding range. Simulations are conducted to validate the convergence and effectiveness of the proposed strategy. The aquatic experiments are carried out to further verify the proposed strategy. The results reveal that the optimization strategy can save about 4.88% of energy and 19.45% of travel time. This article provides clues to the design of active control surfaces and improvement of gliding efficiency for underwater vehicles. Remarkably, the proposed strategy can significantly improve the duration and endow the robot with the potential to perform complex tasks.

AB Visual localization enables autonomous vehicles to navigate in their surroundings and augmented reality applications to link virtual to real worlds. Practical visual localization approaches need to be robust to a wide variety of viewing conditions, including day-night changes, as well as weather and seasonal variations, while providing highly accurate six degree-of-freedom (6DOF) camera pose estimates. In this paper, we extend three publicly available datasets containing images captured under a wide variety of viewing conditions, but lacking camera pose information, with ground truth pose information, making evaluation of the impact of various factors on 6DOF camera pose estimation accuracy possible. We also discuss the performance of state-of-the-art localization approaches on these datasets. Additionally, we release around half of the poses for all conditions, and keep the remaining half private as a test set, in the hopes that this will stimulate research on long-term visual localization, learned local image features, and related research areas. Our datasets are available at visuallocalization.net, where we are also hosting a benchmarking server for automatic evaluation of results on the test set. The presented state-of-the-art results are to a large degree based on submissions to our server.
