AB Detection and prevention of faults in overhead electric lines is critical for the reliability and availability of electricity supply. The disadvantages of conventional methods range from cumbersome installations to costly maintenance and from lack of adaptability to hazards for human operators. Thus, transmission inspections based on unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV) have been attracting the attention of researchers since their inception. This article provides a comprehensive review for the development of UAV technologies in the overhead electric power lines patrol process for monitoring and identifying faults, explores its advantages, and realizes the potential of the aforementioned method and how it can be exploited to avoid obstacles, especially when compared with the state-of-the-art mechanical methods. The review focuses on the development of advanced Learning Control strategies for higher manoeuvrability of the quadrotor. It also explores suitable recharging strategies and motor control for improved mission autonomy.

TI Smart vehicular communication via 5G mmWaves
SO COMPUTER NETWORKS
LA English
DT Article
DE Vehicular communication; 5G mmWaves; Online learning
AB Millimeter-Wave (mmWave) communication is conceived as a viable approach for 5G vehicular communication systems, where vehicles are equipped with more sensors that generate Gbps data for future autonomous driving. However, such directional mmWave communication relies on accurate beam alignment and is sensitive to blockage. Dense deployment of mmWave base stations (mmBSs) and high mobility of vehicles also lead to frequent handovers and complex beam alignment calculation. 5G mmWave vehicular communication calls for a smart and stable solution. To this end, we propose an online learning scheme to address the problem of beam selection with blockage-free guarantee in 5G mmWave vehicular networks. We first model this problem as a contextual combinatorial multi-armed bandit (MAB) problem with QoS constraints and delayed feedback. Next, we propose an online learning algorithm, BPG, to predict beam directions, with provable sub-linear regret and blockage-free bounds. BPG exploits the context space and learns the expected weight of each beam from arrived vehicles' contexts and the delayed feedback. To validate the efficiency of BPG, we also conduct trace-driven simulations based on real-world traffic patterns. Simulation results show that BPG achieves close-to-optimal throughput with low violation and outperforms other benchmark algorithms.

AB With the increasing popularity of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), it is foreseen that they will play an important role in broadening the horizon of mobile crowd sensing (MCS). Specifically, UAV-aided MCS allows autonomous data collection anytime and anywhere due to the capability of fast deployment and controllable mobility. However, the on-board battery capacity of UAVs imposes a limitation on their endurance capability and performance. In this paper, we consider the fixed-wing UAV-aided MCS system and investigate the corresponding joint route planning and task assignment problem from an energy efficiency perspective. The formulated joint optimization problem is transformed into a two-sided two-stage matching problem, in which the route planning problem is solved in the first stage based on either dynamic programming or genetic algorithms, and the task assignment problem is addressed in the second stage by exploring the Gale-Shapley algorithm. We provide a comprehensive theoretical analysis, and elaborate the procedures of practical implementation. Numerical results demonstrate that significant performance improvement can be achieved by the proposed scheme.

AB With the development of marine technology, the research of unmanned surface vehicles (USVs) has received wide attention from the world. Designing effective collision avoidance algorithm in dynamic sea environment is necessary for the navigation of USVs. This paper describes a collision avoidance system (CAS) with COLREGs compliance to improve autonomous navigational ability of USV. For small podded propulsion USV, a three-DOFs maneuvering model is established and the parameters of model are determined by the parameter identification method based on field experiments. About the COLREGs rules, the different maneuvering behaviors are summed up according to encounter situation and collision risk assessment. In the CAS, finite control set model predictive control is adopted, and COLREGs rules are taken as an evaluation standard in the quality function. Finally, the system is verified to avoid multiple dynamic obstacles and compliance vessel in the simulation and real environment, and the results of collision avoidance under four encounter situations are described in detail.

AB This article proposes a novel unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)-enabled wireless-powered mobile edge computing (WP-MEC) network, where several Internet of Things (IoT) nodes use the energy harvested from the UAV's radio frequency signals to support the local computation and the hybrid active-passive communications-based task offloading. Two weighted sum computation bits (WSCB) maximization problems are formulated under the partial and binary offloading, respectively, by jointly optimizing the local computing frequencies and time, the IoT nodes' reflection coefficients, the IoT nodes' transmit powers, the UAV's trajectory, etc., subject to the quality-of-service and energy-causality constraints per IoT node, the speed constraint of the UAV, etc. Since the formulated problems are highly nonconvex, two iterative algorithms are proposed to solve the formulated problems under two modes. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed iterative algorithms have a fast convergence rate, and the proposed schemes achieve higher WSCB than several baseline schemes.

AB The rapidly growing deployment of Electric Vehicles (EV) put strong demands on the development of Lithium-Ion Batteries (LIBs) but also into its dismantling process, a necessary step for circular economy. The aim of this study is therefore to develop an autonomous task planner for the dismantling of EV Lithium-Ion Battery pack to a module level through the design and implementation of a computer vision system. This research contributes to moving closer towards fully automated EV battery robotic dismantling, an inevitable step for a sustainable world transition to an electric economy. For the proposed task planner the main functions consist in identifying LIB components and their locations, in creating a feasible dismantling plan, and lastly in moving the robot to the detected dismantling positions. Results show that the proposed method has measurement errors lower than 5 mm. In addition, the system is able to perform all the steps in the order and with a total average time of 34 s. The computer vision, robotics and battery disassembly have been successfully unified, resulting in a designed and tested task planner well suited for product with large variations and uncertainties.

AB The Mohamed Bin Zayed International Robotics Challenge (MBZIRC) 2017 has defined ambitious new benchmarks to advance the state-of-the-art in autonomous operation of ground-based and flying robots. This study covers our approaches to solve the two challenges that involved micro aerial vehicles (MAV). Challenge 1 required reliable target perception, fast trajectory planning, and stable control of an MAV to land on a moving vehicle. Challenge 3 demanded a team of MAVs to perform a search and transportation task, coined "Treasure Hunt," which required mission planning and multirobot coordination as well as adaptive control to account for the additional object weight. We describe our base MAV setup and the challenge-specific extensions, cover the camera-based perception, explain control and trajectory-planning in detail, and elaborate on mission planning and team coordination. We evaluated our systems in simulation as well as with real-robot experiments during the competition in Abu Dhabi. With our system, we-as part of the larger team NimbRo- won the MBZIRC Grand Challenge and achieved a third place in both subchallenges involving flying robots.

AB This paper designs a novel ground-to-air communication scheme to serve unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) through legacy terrestrial base stations (BSs). In particular, a tractable coordinated multi-point (CoMP) transmission based on the geometry of Poisson-Delaunay triangulation is developed, which provides reliable and seamless connectivity for UAVs. An effective dynamic frequency allocation scheme is designed to eliminate inter-cell interference by using the theory of circle packing. For exact performance evaluation, the handoff probability of a typical UAV is characterized, and then the coverage probability with handoffs is attained. Simulation and numerical results corroborate that the proposed scheme outperforms the conventional CoMP scheme with three nearest cooperating BSs in terms of handoff and coverage probabilities. Moreover, as each UAV has a fixed and unique CoMP BS set, it avoids the real-time dynamic BS searching process, thus reducing the feedback overhead.

ID SHAPE SLOT; DESIGN
AB An antenna design is presented for long-distance transmission in the unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) application. This antenna is in a dipole configuration but with dual-mode operations of both dipole and monopole mechanisms. The monopole behavior becomes apparent when installed on the UAV platform to provide a large ground. To ensure both modes' good integration to produce a broad bandwidth, the dipole arms are formed by H-slot loaded microstrips to create a slower phase velocity. The separation between adjacent harmonic resonances can be decreased. This antenna has good vertically polarized radiation and maximum gains near the horizontal plane to provide better long-distance connections. Various combinations of H-shaped slots are applied to examine the bandwidth behaviors. The achieved size is 90 mm, roughly 1/3 wavelengths at 1.25 GHz and 1/4 at 0.8 GHz. The bandwidth is larger than 50%. Numerical HFSS full-wave simulation and measurement results are compared to validate the feasibility.

ID VEHICULAR FOG; NETWORK; SCHEME; TRENDS
AB Future autonomous electric vehicles (EVs) are equipped with several IoT sensors, smart devices, and wireless adapters, thus forming an Internet of Vehicles (IoVs). These intelligent EVs are envisioned to be a promising solution for improving transportation efficiency, road safety, and driving experience. Vehicular fog computing (VFC) is an evolving technology that allows vehicular application-related tasks to be offloaded to nearby computing nodes and process them quickly. A major challenge in the VFC system is to design energy-efficient task offloading algorithms. In this paper, we propose an optimal energy-efficient algorithm for task offloading in a VFC system that maximizes the expected reward function which is derived using the total energy and time delay of the system for the computation of the task. We use parallel computing and formulate the optimization problem as semi-Markov decision process (SMDP). Bellman optimal equation is used in value iteration algorithm (VIA) to get an optimal scheme by selecting the best action for the current state that maximizes the energy-based reward function. Numerical results show that the proposed scheme outperforms the greedy algorithm in terms of energy consumption.

AB Networking between autonomously flying aerial vehicles requires efficient control and sustainable path for data transmission. Aerial nodes are extremely dynamic and provide a vast range of applications especially focusing on surveillance and data acquisition. However, these dynamic nodes are prone to unstable connectivity which hinders network operations, and also decreases the network lifetime. Such issues directly influence the control and relaying over aerial vehicles. Thus, it becomes essential to have an efficient strategy for controller selection and autonomous relaying. In this paper, a quaternion based neural model is proposed, which uses Decision Making Trial and Evaluation Laboratory Technique (DEMATEL) for the selection of network controllers and relays. The proposed algorithms are capable of selecting controller with a complexity O(n), and provide cooperative relaying with a complexity O(n x k). The effectiveness of the proposed model is demonstrated by using simulations. The results show that the proposed approach reduces delays by 25% during the selection of controller, and increases the transfer speed by 20% compared to existing approaches. (C) 2017 Elsevier Inc.

AB The research focuses on the autonomous docking of unmanned underwater vehicles (UUV) to a recovery mother ship. Firstly, a novel fork-pole docking station was designed, which could operate independently or be transported onboard a recovery mother ship. Subsequently, a docking guidance scheme combining long-range acoustic guidance and short-range opti-acoustic guidance was proposed. Acoustic guidance employed ultrashort baseline sonar and acoustic beacons to measure relative position information, while optical guidance utilized camera and L-shaped light arrays to obtain relative pose information. Then, an opti-acoustic complementary recovery control strategy was developed to address the instability of acoustic signals. Finally, experimental tests were conducted in a pool to evaluate the performance of the proposed recovery docking system in both static and dynamic docking scenarios, which demonstrated that the docking system was capable of achieving fully autonomous recovery of UUV. Furthermore, the experimental data analysis shows that the presented recovery control strategy is effective and feasible.

AB This paper presents a novel collision-free navigation system for the unmanned aerial vehicle based on point clouds that outperform compared to baseline methods, enabling high-speed flights in cluttered environments, such as forests or many indoor industrial plants. The algorithm takes the point cloud information from physical sensors (e.g. lidar, depth camera) and then converts it to an occupied map using Voxblox, which is then used by a rapid-exploring random tree to generate finite path candidates. A modified Covariant Hamiltonian Optimization for Motion Planning objective function is used to select the best candidate and update it. Finally, the best candidate trajectory is generated and sent to a Model Predictive Control controller. The proposed navigation strategy is evaluated in four different simulation environments; the results show that the proposed method has a better success rate and a shorter goal-reaching distance than the baseline method.

In particular, a complete simulation environment has been developed to analyse the system performance obtained by adopting the future European GNSSs when GALILEO will be fully operative. Moreover, this tool has been adopted in the development phase of a precise GNSS-based localization system and developed within the MOW-BY-SAT project, an FP7 project funded by the European Commission; this architecture relies on an innovative algorithm that allows for a Real Time Kinematic localization system, while requiring only a pair of low-cost GPS receivers. The results show the validity of the developed localization and control architecture and the potential of the future European GALILEO system.

AB While machine learning models are powering more and more everyday devices, there is a growing need for explaining them. This especially applies to the use of deep reinforcement learning in solutions that require security, such as vehicle motion planning. In this paper, we propose a method for understanding what the RL agent's decision is based on. The method relies on conducting a statistical analysis on a massive set of state-decisions samples. It indicates which input features have an impact on the agent's decision and the relationships between the decisions, the significance of the input features, and their values. The method allows us to determine whether the process of making a decision by the agent is coherent with human intuition and what contradicts it. We applied the proposed method to the RL motion planning agent which is supposed to drive a vehicle safely and efficiently on a highway. We find out that making such an analysis allows for a better understanding of the agent's decisions, inspecting its behavior, debugging the ANN model, and verifying the correctness of the input values, which increases its credibility.

ID OBJECT TRACKING
AB Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) has been widely used in military reconnaissance, smart transportation, public security and other fields. UAV-based person tracking is attracting incremental attention for its wide application requirements. Currently, some state-of-the-art visual tracking methods have achieved promising performance in common scenarios. However, in the scene of UAV-based person tracking, there will be long-term target disappearance and unpredictable dramatic target appearance changes, which still pose a huge challenge to UAV-based person tracking. In this work, a human-machine hybrid augmented tracking system based on eye tracking is proposed to cope with the challenge. During tracking, through the interaction between humans and machines, humans can provide real-time guidance and corrections to the tracker, and the tracker can also learn interesting targets from humans to enhance itself. The experimental results show that human-in-the-loop can remarkable improve the success rate and robustness of the tracking and our tracking system outperforms the state-of-the-art tracker in complex environments.

AB In intelligent transportation systems, wireless connected vehicles moving in platoons can improve roads' throughput. For managing driving status of the platoon, a lead vehicle transmits driving information to following autonomous vehicles by using multi-hop data dissemination. We study a novel data dissemination protocol which investigates a chain-based transmit rate control to reduce data dissemination latency. The optimal resource allocation algorithm is formulated to minimize the total dissemination latency of the platoon under guaranteed bit error rates, and can be judiciously reformulated and solved using standard optimization techniques. A novel dynamic programming algorithm is presented to solve the platooning resource allocation optimization, which uses backward induction to significantly reduce the resource allocation complexity. In addition, we interpret the vehicular platoon as one-dimensional Markov chain, and derive a closed form of dissemination latency. Simulations are carried out to evaluate the performance of the proposed dynamic programming algorithm. The numerical results show that our algorithm achieves optimal solutions with cutting off the complexity by orders of magnitude, while improving dissemination rate in the vehicular platoon.

AB In inertial navigation system (INS)/doppler velocity log (DVL) integrated navigation, DVL commonly provides the 3-D velocity of the vehicle to the navigation filter. Theoretically, this INS/DVL fusion is the loosely coupled approach, in which DVL requires sufficient beam measurements (at least three) to calculate the 3-D velocity. However, in cases that DVL only has limited (fewer than three) beam measurements, which is possible in the underwater environment, the loosely coupled navigation system can no longer work, and only leaves the INS to work alone. Therefore, the navigation error will accumulate with time. In contrast to the loosely coupled approach, the tightly coupled approach directly uses DVL beam measurements without transforming them to 3-D velocity. In this paper, a method based on the tightly coupled approach for INS/DVL integrated navigation with limited DVL beam measurements is proposed, in which depth updates from a pressure sensor generally equipped by most autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) are applied. Simulation results verify that the proposed method is efficient in most kinds of tasks of the AUV.

AB Small- and medium-sized compact hybrid remotely operated vehicles (HROVs) are particularly sensitive to force control, and research on the interaction of their propulsion system is key and essential to their development. In this paper, the effects of the relative position to the cabin, ambient velocity and rotational speed of adjacent thrusters on the thrust characteristics of a propulsion system are analyzed. The influence of the propulsion system at high flow velocity is obviously different from that in static water. At high flow velocity, different rotational speeds of adjacent thrusters can result in thrust variation of more than 18% for the observed thrusters, compared to no rotation of adjacent thrusters. In Group 1 (with larger space), the operating thrusters arranged perpendicular to the flow and along the flow can affect the thrust change by 19.87% and 19.27%, respectively. In Group 2 (with smaller space), those are 12.71% and 17.28%, respectively. An explanation is given for the mechanism of the influence of adjacent thrusters at different positions.

AB Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) with integrated computing platforms can be used to provide computing offloading services for ground user equipments (UEs) with limited local computing capabilities, especially in remote areas. In this paper, we focus on the task offloading in an aerial edge network (AEN) assisted by a UAV. We aim at minimizing the sum energy consumption of all UEs by the joint optimization of the task offloading decisions and the UAV position under the constraints of the latency and the total energy of UAV. The formulated optimization problem is a mixed-integer nonconvex problem and involves coupling of many optimization variables. To address this challenge, we first transform the original optimization problem into a linear convex optimization problem via reformulation linearization technology, and then the alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) algorithm is proposed to achieve the approximate optimal solution. Numerical results confirm that the proposed ADMM algorithm can effectively reduce the total of energy consumption of UEs and ensure the continuous operation of the UEs.

AB Autonomous Driver Assistance Systems (ADAS) are of increasing importance to warn vehicle drivers of potential dangerous situations. In this paper, we propose one system to warn drivers of the presence of pedestrians crossing the road. The considered ADAS adopts a CNN-based pedestrian detector (PD) using the images captured from a local camera and to generate alarms. Warning messages are then forwarded to vehicle drivers approaching the crossroad by means of a communication infrastructure using public radio networks and/or local area wireless technologies. Three possible communication architectures for ADAS are presented and analyzed in this paper. One format for the alert message is also presented. Performance of the PDs are analyzed in terms of accuracy, precision, and recall. Results show that the accuracy of the PD varies from 70% to 100% depending on the resolution of the videos. The effectiveness of each of the considered communication solutions for ADAS is evaluated in terms of the time required to forward the alert message to drivers. The overall latency including the PD processing and the alert communication time is then used to define the vehicle braking curve, which is required to avoid collision with the pedestrian at the crossroad.

AB Traditional tools and methodologies for mesoscale observation of oceanographic phenomena are limited by under-sampling and data latency. In this article we evaluate three different scenario variants of an architecture for how heterogeneous sensor nodes can be integrated with satellite remote sensing. Independent space and marine sensing platforms are interconnected either directly or by means of a ground-based mission control center responsible for data processing, relay, and coordination of the assets. A wave-propelled unmanned surface vehicle (USV) persistently collects in situ data of the targeted phenomenon. In two variants of the architecture, a dedicated small satellite acts as a sensor node, a data processing facility and a communication node. We have used a System-of-Systems (SoS) modeling approach coupled with operational simulations in different locations on Earth, in order to support the proposed methodology and investigate quantitatively the reduction the data latency to end-users. Through a combination of field experiments and simulations we estimate how the different scenarios perform with respect to providing remote sensing data that are used to create a measurement and navigation plan for the autonomous vessel.

AB The inspection of aquatic environments is a challenging activity, which is made more difficult if the environment is complex or confined, such as those that are found in nuclear storage facilities and accident sites, marinas and boatyards, liquid storage tanks, or flooded tunnels and sewers. Human inspections of these environments are often dangerous or infeasible, so remote inspection using unmanned underwater vehicles (UUVs) is used. Due to access restrictions and environmental limitations, such as low illumination levels, turbidity, and a lack of salient features, traditional localisation systems that have been developed for use in large bodies of water cannot be used. This means that UUV capabilities are severely restricted to manually controlled low-quality visual inspections, generating non-geospatially located data. The localisation of UUVs in these environments would enable the autonomous behaviour and the development of accurate maps. This article presents a review of the state-of-the-art in localisation technologies for these environments and identifies areas of future research to overcome the challenges posed.

AB This study presents a novel navigation and control system allowing a biomimetic-autonomous underwater vehicle (BAUV) to track a target. A Bayesian approach using an extended Kalman filter and combined localization and environmental mapping by a BAUV are implemented. This strategy selects the best sensor measurement by choosing one of several forward-looking directions. The body of the BAUV moves in a cyclical pattern; thus, an inexpensive echo sounder can be installed on the BAUV head to detect environmental features without the need for expensive scanning devices. The localization and environmental mapping problem is then transformed into a non-linear two-point boundary value problem. Optimal policies are to maintain the accuracy of predicted states and to approach minimal observation cost by solving the control problem. A line-of-sight guidance law is utilized that drives the BAUV to the target. An approach that controls the motion of the body/caudal fin and pectoral fins of the BAUV is utilized for target tracking. Estimation, measurement, and control processes are integrated to form a working system. Experiments using a test bed BAUV confirm the effectiveness of the proposed approach. (c) 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

AB Unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) networks will become one of the key components of the future mobile communication systems, especially suitable for on-demand coverage extension and prompt capacity enhancement. However, UAV networks, detached from the ground infrastructure, are usually constrained for traffic-intensive network-wide signal processing. This paper tackles this issue by considering the multi-user signal detection at the UAV swarm, where the uplink signals of multiple ground users are cooperatively recovered. In particular, to reduce the signaling exchange and the coordination latency, a two-stage distributed minimum mean squared error (MMSE) detection is proposed for the UAV swarm, which merges the local MMSE detections at each UAV with one-shot weighted combining at a central station. The combining weights only depend on the long-term statistical channel state informations (CSIs) and therefore, are suitable for distributed network with limited signaling exchange. Numerical results show that the proposed distributed MMSE detection achieves similar performance to the centralized MMSE detection.

AB In this paper, we study a cooperative perception scheme in a vehicular sensor network, attempting to fuse the semantic information provided by different sensors at multiple vehicles, so as to expand the vehicle's perception range, eliminate blind spots, improve the ability to handle environmental interference and enhance the accuracy and robustness of the perception results. The key to guide the fusion process is the evaluation of the confidence levels of the outputs provided by various machine learning schemes implemented at individual sensors in the vehicular sensor network. We first propose an evaluation criterion termed as Environmental Sensitivity (ES), which is used to measure the sensitivity of the network to environmental changes. Based on the ES, we further evaluate the confidence of the perception output of neural networks and quantify the confidence level considering the abnormal level of the input data, the general performance of the perception algorithm, the detection performance and the ES of the network. Semantic information fusion algorithm is then developed based upon the confidence levels. Experiment results are provided to validate the proposed fusion method in various scenarios.

AB In order to improve the accuracy of simultaneous localization and mapping problem, plane motion assumption is often used for advanced ground vehicle SLAM system. However, such an assumption is not always suitable to complex and changeable road scenes. In this letter, we propose a stereo-vision based SLAM framework that tightly couples the local ground manifold constraints into accurate camera trajectory estimation. Instead of considering a planar manifold assumption, we model the road as a sequence of local planes with different slopes named local ground manifolds (LGM). The impact region of the LGM is represented as a spherical area in the map, where the vehicle's motion is constrained by the corresponding local plane model. ORB features and road segmentations are utilized to perform the environmental reconstruction and ground manifold representation. The structures of surroundings and the plane normal of LGMs are jointly optimized with the trajectory of the vehicle within a novel point-LGM tightly-coupled bundle adjustment framework. The experiments on KITTI datasets demonstrate that the proposed ground manifold representation can greatly benefit the camera trajectory estimation.

AB This paper presents a Multiple Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) cooperative reconnaissance task allocation model based on heterogeneous target value and proposes an improved Multi-Verse Optimizer (MVO) algorithm. Firstly, according to the reconnaissance value of the target, the reconnaissance targets are divided into high-value targets, low-value targets and decoy targets. It improves the authenticity of the problem. The purpose of task allocation is to maximize the reconnaissance revenue of UAVs as much as possible under the condition of minimizing the reconnaissance time and fuel loss of UAVs to the targets. Then, to solve the model, this paper improves the traditional MVO algorithm. Adaptive compression factor is introduced to improve the convergence speed of the algorithm. In addition, the differential mutation operation is performed in the wormhole movement stage to enhance the global search ability of the algorithm. The simulation results show that the improved algorithm can successfully solve the reconnaissance task allocation problem under different target values, and has obvious advantages in reconnaissance revenue and calculation speed compared with other methods.

AB Autonomous underwater vehicles require estimation of their velocity relative to the surrounding flow to perform essential navigation tasks. Available technologies for speed estimation rely on Doppler velocity logs or acoustic Doppler current profilers and are not suitable for application in small low cost or energy consumption vehicles. Encouraged by the successful results of our previous lab-scale investigations using pressure-based speedometry, we developed differential pressure sensor speedometry as an alternative to conventional technologies. We built a fullscale physical prototype, compared analog and digital differential pressure sensors and evaluated the performance in variable velocity (0-2 m/s) and acceleration (0-2 m(2)/s) conditions in a marine tow tank. A simple equation based on the conservation of energy accurately estimated the velocity, with estimated mean absolute errors of 0.0087 m/s for analog and 0.0107 m/s and digital configurations. This equation is shown to hold under variable velocity and acceleration conditions. We conclude that differential pressure sensor speedometry is a valid solution to perform underwater speedometry and we confirm that the system can provide instantaneous and stable velocity estimates with a sampling rate higher than 10 Hz.

AB Increasing the penetration levels of renewable energy sources (RESs) in microgrids (MGs) may lead to frequency instability issues due to intermittent nature of RESs and low inertia of MG generating units. On the other hand, presence of electric vehicles (EVs), as new high-electricity- consuming appliances, can be a good opportunity to contribute in mitigating the frequency deviations and help the system stability. This paper proposes an optimal charging/discharging scheduling of EVs with the goal of improving frequency stability of MG during autonomous operating condition. To this end, an efficient approach is applied to reschedule the generating units considering the EVs owners' behaviors. An EV power controller (EVPC) is also designed to determine charge and discharge process of EVs based on the forecasted day-ahead load and renewable generation profiles. The performance of the proposed strategy is tested in different operating scenarios and compared to those from non-optimized methodologies. Numerical simulations indicate that the MG performance improves considerably in terms of economy and stability using the proposed strategy.

AB Road scene analysis is a challenging problem that has applications in autonomous navigation of vehicles. An integral component of this system is the robust detection and tracking of lane markings. It is a hard problem primarily due to large appearance variations in lane markings caused by factors such as occlusion (traffic on the road), shadows (from objects like trees), and changing lighting conditions of the scene (transition from day to night). In this paper, we address these issues through a learning-based approach using visual inputs from a camera mounted in front of a vehicle. We propose the following: 1) a pixel-hierarchy feature descriptor to model the contextual information shared by lane markings with the surrounding road region; 2) a robust boosting algorithm to select relevant contextual features for detecting lane markings; and 3) particle filters to track the lane markings, without knowledge of vehicle speed, by assuming the lane markings to be static through the video sequence and then learning the possible road scene variations from the statistics of tracked model parameters. We investigate the effectiveness of our algorithm on challenging daylight and night-time road video sequences.

AB The United States Navy aims to enhance its fleet by expanding the deployment of unmanned aircraft in carrier air wings. However, certifying the autonomous refueling of unmanned aerial platforms currently lacks a publicly available method. Ongoing research at the United States Naval Academy focuses on investigating certification evidence that would enable a deep neural network (DNN) to facilitate autonomous aerial refueling (AAR). This study explores training a DNN to accurately detect the drogue and coupler deployed by a KC-130 tanker and a tanker-configured F/A-18 jet. Both tankers have a similar drogue refueling system but differ vastly in image background noise and contrast, posing a challenge for object detection. Using salient metrics, the performance of a DNN model trained separately on video footage of both tankers is tested to enable the AAR task. Our results indicate that a DNN trained on developmental flight test videos of aircraft refueling from a KC-130 tanker effectively completes the aerial refueling task on a F/A-18 tanker compared to another DNN trained on video footage of the same tanker. These findings might validate the idea that a DNN trained on a specific aircraft dataset with a similar probe and drogue refueling system satisfactorily performs the aerial refueling task on various tankers, eliminating the need for additional training data for each tanker individually.

AB In this paper, we provide a decentralized theoretical framework for coordination of connected and automated vehicles (CAVs) at different traffic scenarios. The framework includes: (1) an upper-level optimization that yields for each CAV its optimal time trajectory and lane to pass through a given traffic scenario while alleviating congestion; and (2) a low-level optimization that yields for each CAV its optimal control input (acceleration/deceleration). We provide a complete, analytical solution of the low-level optimization problem that includes the rear-end, speed-dependent safety constraint. Furthermore, we provide a problem formulation for the upper-level optimization in which there is no duality gap. The latter implies that the optimal time trajectory for each CAV does not activate any of the state, control, and safety constraints of the low-level optimization, thus allowing for online implementation. Finally, we present a geometric duality framework with hyperplanes to derive the condition under which the optimal solution of the upper-level optimization always exists. We validate the effectiveness of the proposed theoretical framework through simulation. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

ID PERCEPTION; SYSTEM
AB Over the past few years, numerous technologies have emerged to enable safe and convenient driving. However, there still exist various problems autonomous vehicles should overcome. Precise detection and perception of surrounding environments are the essential foundations to overcome them. Consequently, many sensor fusion algorithms have been developed to handle more complex situations, with sensor manufacturers also making strenuous efforts to enhance sensor performance. Although Light Detection And Ranging(LiDAR) sensor generally outperforms other sensor types, they remain prohibitively expensive from car manufacturing companies perspective. Therefore, camera and radar sensors have been enhanced, and are starting to provide free space information, similar to LiDAR sensor data and somewhat different from target information they have previously provided. The aim of this paper was to utilize the free space information to improve track information for vehicles. We employ the probability model with two occupancy grid map (OGM) types, which are Bayesian theory and Dempster-Shafer theory based OGMs, to classify free space information states and to efficiently handle free space information. Final output from the proposed algorithm is the target vehicle's compensated track. Experimental results verify superior performance compared with non-compensated algorithms.

AB Free-space detection is a primary task for car navigation. Unfortunately, classical approaches have difficulties in adverse weather conditions, in particular in daytime fog. In this paper, a solution is proposed thanks to a contrast restoration approach on images grabbed by an in-vehicle camera. The proposed method improves the state-of-the-art in several ways. First, the segmentation of the fog region of interest is better segmented thanks to the computation of the shortest routes maps. Second, the fog density as well as the position of the horizon line is jointly computed. Then, the method restores the contrast of the road by only assuming that the road is flat and, at the same time, detects the vertical objects. Finally, a segmentation of the connected component in front of the vehicle gives the free-space area. An experimental validation was carried out to foresee the effectiveness of the method. Different results are shown on sample images extracted from video sequences acquired from an in-vehicle camera. The proposed method is complementary to existing free-space area detection methods relying on color segmentation and stereovision.

AB Since the potential of soft computing for driver assistance systems has been recognized, much effort has been spent in the development of appropriate techniques for robust lane detection, object classification, tracking, and representation of task relevant objects. For such systems in order to be able to perform their tasks the environment must be sensed by one or more sensors. Usually a complex processing, fusion, and interpretation of the sensor data is required and imposes a modular architecture for the overall system. In this paper, we present specific approaches considering the main components of such systems. We concentrate on image processing as the main source of relevant object information, representation and fusion of data that might arise from different sensors, and behavior planning and generation as a basis for autonomous driving. Within our system components most paradigms of soft computing are employed; in this article we focus on Kalman filtering for sensor fusion, neural field dynamics for behavior generation, and evolutionary algorithms for optimization of parts of the system.

AB This paper addresses modeling and global motion planning issues for an autonomous wheeled mobile robot moving on an uneven three-dimensional (3-D) terrain. We focus particularly on the issue of dealing with dynamic and wheel/ground interaction constraints. A key feature of our approach is that it incorporates appropriate physical models to cope with the task dynamics in the motion planning paradigm. The planner is based on a two-level scheme, The high level considers a simplified two-dimensional (2-D) instance of the motion task and searches a subset of the configuration space of the robot in order to generate nominal subgoals through which the robot is steered, The local level solves for continuous feasible trajectories and actuator controls to move the robot between neighboring subgoals in the presence of the entire task constraints. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first Implemented planner that solves for feasible trajectories to be performed by a wheeled vehicle on quite complex terrains. Simulation results are presented for the case of a six-wheeled articulated robot.

AB The limited time duration and spatial instability of TSTs increase the difficulty of mission planning for unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) formations, which in turn affects the task execution abilities of UAVs. Aiming at this problem, a multi-UAV dynamic mission planning algorithm based on the time window mechanism is proposed under a distributed formation structure. The proposed algorithm comprehensively considers a variety of complex constraints involved in actual application scenarios and constructs a UAV formation mission planning model with minimum task execution cost and path planning cost as the optimization goal. In this article, particle swarm optimization algorithm is improved by introducing a specific particle coding method and a competitive co-evolutionary population updating strategy, to enhance the solution speed and accuracy of the mission planning model. In this way, the optimal task allocation strategy and task execution path are obtained to meet the mission requirements, and to achieve the multi-UAV cooperative reconnaissance, strike and evaluation of multiple TSTs. Furthermore, the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm is validated via simulations.

AB Vehicle-to-infrastructure (V2I) communication is becoming indispensable for successful roll-out of connected and autonomous vehicles (CAVs). While increasing the CAVs' speed improves the average CAV traffic flow, it increases communication handoffs (HOs) thus reducing wireless data rates. Furthermore, unplanned density of active base-stations (BSs) may result in severe interference which negatively impacts CAV data rate. In this letter, we first characterize macroscopic traffic flow by considering log-normal distribution of the spacing between CAVs. We then derive novel closed-form expressions for the exact HO-aware rate outage probability and ergodic capacity in a large-scale network with interference. Then, we formulate a traffic flow maximization problem to optimize the speed of CAVs and deployment density of BSs with HO-aware rate constraints and collision avoidance constraints. Our numerical results validate the closed-form analytical expressions, extract useful insights about the optimal speed and BS density, and highlight the key trade-offs between the HO-aware data rates and CAV traffic flow.

AB Unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) carried base stations can provide on-demand deployment for ground users. Given a target area to be serviced, this letter proposes a three-dimensional (3D) deployment method for multiple UAVs based on the knowledge of statistical user position information to maximize the total network throughput. The 3D deployment problem is divided into horizontal deployment problem and vertical deployment problem. Specifically, a virtual force field is built based on the statistical user distributions to help model the communication demand of users. Based on that, the horizontal placement scheme for each UAV is obtained by calculating the force balance points in the virtual field. The classical particle swarm optimization algorithm is adopted to determine the vertical coordinates of UAVs. In order to demonstrate the validity of the proposed algorithm, we also evaluate it through comparison with benchmark algorithms on a real-world telecommunication dataset. Experimental results show that the throughput performance can be improved by the proposed method compared with those benchmark schemes.

AB The simultaneous control of multiple coordinated robotic agents represents an elaborate problem. If solved, however, the interaction between the agents can lead to solutions to sophisticated problems. The concept of swarming, inspired by nature, can be described as the emergence of complex system-level behaviors from the interactions of relatively elementary agents. Due to the effectiveness of solutions found in nature, bio-inspired swarming-based control techniques are receiving a lot of attention in robotics. One method, known as swarm shepherding, is founded on the sheep herding behavior exhibited by sheepdogs, where a swarm of relatively simple agents are governed by a shepherd (or shepherds) which is responsible for high-level guidance and planning. Many studies have been conducted on shepherding as a control technique, ranging from the replication of sheep herding via simulation, to the control of uninhabited vehicles and robots for a variety of applications. A comprehensive review of the literature on swarm shepherding is presented in order to reveal the advantages and potential of the approach to be applied to a plethora of robotic systems in the future.

AB Flow visualisations are essential to better understand the unsteady aerodynamics of flapping wing flight. The issues inherent to animal experiments, such as poor controllability and unnatural flapping when tethered, can be avoided by using robotic flyers that promise for a more systematic and repeatable methodology. Here, we present a new flapping-wing micro air vehicle (FWMAV)-specific control approach that, by employing an external motion tracking system, achieved autonomous wind tunnel flight with a maximum root-mean-square position error of 28 mm at low speeds (0.8-1.2 m/s) and 75 mm at high speeds (2-2.4 m/s). This allowed the first free flight flow visualisation experiments to be conducted with an FWMAV. Time-resolved stereoscopic particle image velocimetry was used to reconstruct the three-dimensional flow patterns of the FWMAV wake. A good qualitative match was found in comparison to a tethered configuration at similar conditions, suggesting that the obtained free-flight measurements are reliable and meaningful.

AB Autonomous vehicles not only provide a new impetus in the development of car models in the automotive industry-even in agriculture there has recently been talk of autonomous field robots (AFR). Great expectations are placed on these digital assistants from a wide variety of perspectives. However, it is still unclear whether they will make the transition from market niches to broad-based distribution. Apart from various factors, this depends on user acceptance of this new technology expected by the innovators, since this is likely to be essential for the further development of AFR. For this purpose, the ex ante user acceptance of farmers from the perspective of various AgTech startups with AFR involvement in Europe was investigated in this exploratory and qualitative study. The Technology Acceptance Model (TAM) served as the basis for the developed interview guideline. In summary, the results confirm that a variety of factors potentially influence farmer acceptance and AFR diffusion from the perspective of AgTech startups, with perceived usefulness being considered the main motivation for using AFR. The interviewed experts believe that AFR will initially be used in crops that have relatively high costs for crop protection treatments before becoming economically attractive for other crops. The basic prerequisite for a successful market launch is an adjustment of the legal framework, which sets standards in relation to AFR and thus, provides security in the production process. The results could support political decision-makers in dealing with this new technology and AFR manufacturers in the promotion of AFR.

AB Nowadays, due to the advances and the increasing implementation of the autonomous braking systems in vehicles, the non-collision accident is expected to become more common than a crash when a sudden stop happens. The most common injury in this kind of accident is whiplash or cervical injury since the neck has high sensitivity to sharp deceleration. To date, biomechanical research has usually been developed inside laboratories and does not entirely represent real conditions (e.g., restraint systems or surroundings of the experiment). With the aim of knowing the possible neck effects and consequences of an automatic emergency braking inside an autonomous bus, a surface electromyography (sEMG) system built by low-cost elements and developed by us, in tandem with other devices, such as accelerometers or cameras, were used. Moreover, thanks to the collaboration of 18 participants, it was possible to study the non-collision effects in two different scenarios (braking test in which the passenger is seated and looking ahead while talking with somebody in front of him (BT1) and, a second braking test where the passenger used a smartphone (BT2) and nobody is seated in front of him talking to him). The aim was to assess the sEMG neck response in the most common situations when somebody uses some kind of transport in order to conclude which environments are riskier regarding a possible cervical injury.

AB Reasoning over visual data is a desirable capability for robotics and vision-based applications. Such reasoning enables forecasting the next events or actions in videos. In recent years, various models have been developed based on convolution operations for prediction or forecasting, but they lack the ability to reason over spatiotemporal data and infer the relationships of different objects in the scene. In this letter, we present a framework based on graph convolution to uncover the spatiotemporal relationships in the scene for reasoning about pedestrian intent. A scene graph is built on top of segmented object instances within and across video frames. Pedestrian intent, defined as the future action of crossing or not-crossing the street, is very crucial piece of information for autonomous vehicles to navigate safely and more smoothly. We approach the problem of intent prediction from two different perspectives and anticipate the intention-to-cross within both pedestrian-centric and location-centric scenarios. In addition, we introduce a new dataset designed specifically for autonomous-driving scenarios in areas with dense pedestrian populations: the Stanford-TRI Intent Prediction (STIP) dataset. Our experiments on STIP and another benchmark dataset show that our graph modeling framework is able to predict the intention-to-cross of the pedestrians with an accuracy of 79.10 % on STIP and 79.28 % on Joint Attention for Autonomous Driving (JAAD) dataset up to one second earlier than when the actual crossing happens. These results outperform baseline and previous work. Please refer to http://stip.stanford.edu/ for the dataset and code.

AB Self-driving car automated control problem includes automated routing problem. This paper addresses the self-driving taxi routing problem formalized as the Pickup and Delivery problem (PDP). We use small moves technique as the basis for our evolutionary computation framework that considers small moves as mutation operations. We introduce strategies, which determine vector of probabilities to apply small moves on each step. Also we introduce policies, which determine how strategies evolve during the algorithm runtime. Finally, we also apply meta-learning to select the best strategy and policy for a given dataset. We test suggested methods with several genetic schemes. The best performance is shown by strategies that apply small moves with probability depending on its success rate and/or complexity. It outperforms Hill Climbing as well as a constraint satisfaction problem solver adopted for PDP.

DT Article
DE Multi-task learning; Autonomous driving; Deep learning
AB Autonomous driving research is an emerging area in the machine learning domain. Most existing methods perform single-task learning, while multi-task learning (MTL) is more efficient due to the leverage of shared information between different tasks. However, MTL is challenging because different tasks may have different significance and varying ranges. In this work, we propose an end-to-end deep learning architecture for statistically correlated MTL using a single input image. Statistical correlation of the tasks is handled by including shared layers in the architecture. Later network separates into different branches to handle the difference in the behavior of each task. Training a multi-task model with varying ranges may converge the objective function only with larger values. To this end, we explore different normalization schemes and empirically observe that the inverse validation-loss weighted scheme has best performed. In addition to estimating steering angle, braking, and acceleration, we also estimate the number of lanes on the left and the right side of the vehicle. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to propose an end-to-end deep learning architecture to estimate this type of lane information. The proposed approach is evaluated on four publicly available datasets including Comma.ai, Udacity, Berkeley Deep Drive, and Sully Chen. We also propose a synthetic dataset GTA-V for autonomous driving research. Our experiments demonstrate the superior performance of the proposed approach compared to the current state-of-the-art methods. The GTA-V dataset and the lane annotations on the four existing datasets will be made publicly available via

AB A high level of computation is required for edge detection in color images captured by unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) to address issues, such as noise, distortion, and information loss. Thus, an edge detection method for UAV-captured color images based on the improved whale optimization algorithm (WOA) is proposed in this study. In this method, the color image pixels are represented by quaternions, and the global random position variables and information exchange mechanism are introduced into the random walk foraging formula of the WOA. Further, a random disturbance factor is also introduced into the predator-prey formula of the spiral bubble net. The proposed improved WOA is then used to obtain the preliminary edge of the UAV-captured color image. An edge-point classification method using the radius of the shortest distance between the whale and the current global optimum in each iteration is presented to enhance a preliminary edge. The experimental results show that the proposed edge detection method has the advantages of strong denoising, fast speed, and good quality.

AB Finding correspondences between a pair of images is the key ingredient for many applications such as localization and panorama. However, due to a variety of challenges between multiview images in practice, the results of using a single kind of descriptor may vary significantly across different scenes. In this letter, we treat the assignment task as a clustering problem and propose an image matching method that fuses multiple descriptors to tackle the above difficulties. First, we extract multiple descriptors at the keypoints on two images. Then, we compute a pairwise similarity matrix for each kind of descriptor. Afterward, we compute a weighted combination of these similarity matrices, and use it to build correspondences via a modified multikernel clustering module. The proposed method is tested on three public image datasets: two ground image sets and an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) image set. Experiments show that the proposed method can adapt to different number of descriptors. It significantly improves the matching accuracy in a variety of scenarios and downstream tasks.

AB The operational capabilities of automated driving features are limited and sometimes require drivers' intervention through a transition of control. Assistance at an operational level might be extremely beneficial during transitions but the literature lacks evidence on the topic. A simulator study was conducted to investigate the potential impacts that lateral assistance systems might have while the Automated Driving System (ADS) hands back control to the driver. Results showed that drivers benefitted from a strong Lane Keeping Assist during the first phase of the transfer, helping them to keep the lane centre. However, assisting the drivers at an operational level did not enhance their capability of addressing a more complex task, presented as a lane change. In fact, it was more task-specific assistance (Blind-spot assist) that allowed drivers to better cope with the tactical decision that the lane change required. Moreover, longer exposure to lane keeping assist systems helped them in gaining awareness of the surrounding traffic and improved the way drivers interacted with the Blind-spot assist.

AB The use of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) is expected to provide a prompt communication service area under disasters and emergencies. Using the multiple frequency bands called carrier aggregation increases the system throughput and can support situations where urgent traffic could explode. We previously developed a multiband sector antenna with multiple reflectors employing the metamaterial for a UAV-mounted mobile base station. The metamaterial reflector, which has electromagnetic band gap (EBG) characteristics, can reflect the electromagnetic waves of the desired band, i.e. EBG band, and transmit those of the specific bands. It has been a challenge to adjust the beamwidth under the constraint of the metamaterial reflector. This paper proposes the beamwidth adjustment algorithm considering the EBG band and evaluates the system throughput performance utilizing the designed multiband sector antenna. The proposed algorithm designed the dual-band sector antenna with 90 degrees beamwidth in the horizontal plane of each frequency band (800 MHz and 2 GHz), and the measurements match the electromagnetic field simulations well. Moreover, the system-level simulation evaluates the system throughput performance utilizing the designed dual-band sector antenna.

AB Runway detection is a demanding task for autonomous landing of unmanned aerial vehicles. Inspired by the attenuation effect and surround suppression mechanism, a novel biologically computational method based on the avian contrast sensitivity is proposed for runway contour detection. For the noisy stimuli, deniosed responses of the biologically inspired Gabor energy operator are generalized followed by the denoising layer and the multiresolution fusion layer. Moreover, two factors such as contour effect and texture suppression are considered in the contrast sensitivity based surround inhibition. Different from traditional detectors, which do not distinguish between contours and texture edges, the proposed method can respond strongly to contours and suppress the texture information. Applying the contrast sensitivity inspired detector to noisy runway scenes yields effective contours, while the non-meaningful texture elements are removed dramatically at the same time. Besides the superior performance over traditional detectors, the proposed method is capable to provide insight into the attenuation effect of the avian contrast sensitivity function and has potential applications in computer vision and pattern recognition.

AB Autonomous underwater manipulation has been a topic of interest since the early 1990s. In the past few years, several milestone projects such as SAUVIM and TRIDENT have demonstrated autonomy capabilities for a single underwater vehicle manipulator system (UVMS) in performing simple manipulation tasks, e.g., the recovery of an object from the seafloor. The Italian funded MARIS project aims to extend some of these results to multiple UVMSs performing a cooperative transportation task of a long object such as a pipe. This paper presents the results achieved in developing a unifying architecture for the control of both individually and cooperatively operating UVMSs which explicitly makes use of a limited amount of information exchange between the agents, which is needed due to the severe bandwidth limitations of the underwater acoustic communications. A complete execution of the reference transportation mission is presented to support the proposed distributed algorithm. Furthermore, hydrodynamic simulations of the cooperative transportation phase are presented and an analysis of the achievable performances as different communication schemes are employed is given.

AB Current dehazing methods for unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) remote sensing images often have texture detail loss and color distortion problems, especially in highlighted regions. This is mainly due to the rich texture and low intensity of UAV remote sensing images being ignored, which results in incorrect transmission estimation. In this letter, we propose a UAV remote sensing image dehazing method based on a double-scale transmission optimization strategy. First, we propose a double-scale optimization strategy to estimate the transmission map with more accurate texture details and color preservation, especially in highlighted regions of hazy UAV images that are most severely distorted. Second, a UAV-adaptive haze-line prior algorithm is proposed to address the large scene depth and low intensity of UAV remote sensing images. Finally, we introduce a luminance-weighted frequency-domain saliency model to avoid texture detail loss and color distortions for better transmission optimization, especially in highlighted regions. Compared with state-of-the-art methods, our method shows better detail performance and visual effects, especially for UAV images with highlighted regions.

AB Autonomous ships or Unmanned Surface Vehicles (USV) collision avoidance and path planning problems among multi-vessels are investigated in this paper. Firstly, a modified fuzzy dynamic risk of collision model based on time and space collision risk index is proposed, which is much closer to real ship applications. Then, the fitness functions based on the risk of collision, navigational economy, International Regulations for Preventing Collisions at Sea 1972 (COLREGs) and collision avoidance timing are established respectively to ensure the rationality of ship collision avoidance decisions. Moreover, path planning with global search capability is realized by the multi-objective decision theory combined with a genetic algorithm. The practicability and rationality of the recommended trajectory are guaranteed. Meanwhile, the problem of the non-inferior solution can be addressed by adapting the weight method and the constraint method and the optimized solution of the decision-making system can be achieved finally. Simulation results are further presented to validate the effectiveness of the proposed path planning and collision avoidance methods.

AB Due to the random wave motions as well as the vehicle's movement pattern changes, the attitude dynamics (including heading, pitch, and roll motions) of the vehicle induced degrades the accuracy of doppler velocity log (DVL), which is a key element in deciding the precision of strapdown inertial navigation system (SINS)/DVL integrated navigation system. In this paper, the effects of heading, pitch and roll dynamics are first analyzed separately. Then, the general error model for DVL measurement errors caused by attitude dynamics is established. In the modeling process, the changes of angular position and angular rate between the DVL signal transmission and reception instant are considered. Subsequently, by utilizing the established error model, a correction method based on the real-time attitude information from SINS/DVL system is presented. Finally, the performance of the proposed method is examined through numerical simulations in which typical scenarios with a series of attitude dynamics are used. Simulation results show that the errors can be effectively corrected by using the correction method. This contributes to an improved positioning accuracy of SINS/DVL navigation.

AB This study proposes a novel approach to evaluating and controlling the traction force of a wheel directly driven by an electric motor on different road surfaces. Instead of slip ratio measurements, the database of the motor called the current-RPM-torque database can evaluate the traction force of the wheel. The feedback of the measured current and the rotational speed can assist the autonomous traction controller synthesized from this database by the neural network approach when one traction wheel of the vehicle is traveling on different kinds of road surfaces. The adequate gains which are the training data for the neural network control synthesis have to satisfy the assigned specifications in time domain for different slip ratios. This paper also finds that the adequate gains mainly depend on slip ratio slope rather than slip ratio. Based on a scenario similar to real situations, the simulated results in this study show that it is feasible to evaluate and control the traction force through the motor database by the feedback of the current and the RPM.

AB A vision-based vehicle guidance system for road vehicles can have three main roles: I) road detection; 2) obstacle detection; and 3) sign recognition, The first two have been studied for many years and with many good results, but traffic sign recognition is a less-studied held, Traffic signs provide drivers with very valuable information about the road, in order to make driving safer and easier, Sire think that traffic signs must play the same role for autonomous vehicles, They are designed to be easily recognized by human drivers mainly because their color and shapes are very different from natural environments, The algorithm described in this paper takes advantage of these features, It has two main parts, The first one, for the detection, uses color thresholding to segment the image and shape analysis to detect the signs, The second one, for the classification, uses a neural network. Some results from natural scenes are shown, On the other hand, the algorithm is valid to detect other Binds of marks that would tell the mobile robot to perform some task at that place.

ID MODEL
AB To reduce the number of ground control points required for block adjustment of unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) synthetic aperture radar (SAR) images, a robust block adjustment method is pro-posed. The proposed method aims to solve the problem of unstable adjustment solutions caused by the jittering of UAV SAR platforms. This method is based on the range Doppler model. By analyzing the correlation between the antenna phase center, velocity, and Doppler centroid of the seven orientation parameters, this method performs a block adjustment of UAV SAR images with three orientation parameters: the antenna phase center initial imaging moment, Doppler centroid, and proximity delay. UAV SAR images obtained from an area of 2 x 3 km in Dengfeng were used to conduct adjustment experiments. The results obtained using different orientation parameter set-tings verify the robustness and effectiveness of the proposed method. The adjustment results under various control-point layout plans indicate that a uniform layout plan can achieve an adjustment accuracy better than 1 m with a small number of control points.

AB This paper addresses the problem of optimizing the deployment of Flying Backhaul Networks (FBNs). The latter comprise Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs), which are used as access points to provide coverage to a set of ground nodes deployed in a target area. The optimization problem is addressed by means of a Multi-Objective Optimization Algorithm (MOEA), which calculates Pareto curves of UAV placement, providing different trade-offs between the considered objectives: (1) to minimize the number of UAVs, and (2) to maximize the Packet Delivery Ratio (PDR). The selected MOEA is NSGA-II. An embedded single objective Genetic Algorithm (inner-GA) is used to optimize routing, finding the paths that maximize the PDR. In order to obtain consistent solutions for the PDR taking into account MAC layer contention, the scheme makes use of an existing fixed-point algorithm (FPA). Simulation results were obtained for different scenarios combining average versus maximin PDR objective funtions, two different routing optimization algorithms, as well as single sink versus multiple sink traffic patterns.

DT Article
AB This paper presents an approach to simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) suitable for efficient bathymetric mapping that does not require explicit identification tracking or association of seafloor features This is accomplished using a Rao-Blackwellized particle filter in which each particle maintains a hypothesis of the current vehicle state and a grid-based two-dimensional depth map efficiently stored by exploiting redundancies between different maps Distributed particle mapping is employed to remove the computational expense of map copying during the resampling process The proposed approach to bathymetnc SLAM is validated using multibeam sonar data collected by an autonomous underwater vehicle over a small-timescale mission (2 h) and a remotely operated vehicle over a large-timescale mission (11 h) The results demonstrate how observations of the seafloor structure improve the estimated trajectory and resulting map when compared to dead reckoning fused with ultrashort-baseline or long-baseline observations The consistency and robustness of this approach to common errors in navigation is also explored Furthermore, results are compared with a preexisting state-of-the art bathymetnc SLAM technique confirming that similar results can be achieved at a fraction of the computation cost (C) 2010 Wiley Periodicils Inc

ID COMMUNICATION
AB With the rapid development of wireless communication and autonomous driving technologies, the Internet of Vehicles (IoV) technology has emerged to build a large network that supports interactive communication between vehicles, roadside infrastructure and the surrounding environment. This allows vehicle sensors to collect massive amount of data. However, data is at risk of attack. In order to ensure data security, in this paper, we design a heterogeneous online/offline signcryption (HGOOSC) scheme. This construction allows a sender in Certificateless Cryptography (CLC) to send messages to a receiver in Public Key Infrastructure (PKI). CLC has neither key escrow problem in Identity-Based Cryptography (IBC) nor public key certificate management problem in PKI. PKI is widely used in the Internet server to ensure its security. For signcryption, the online/offline technology can save a lot of time compared with the ordinary one. It can preprocess complex operations without the message and the receiver's identity in the offline phase. While in the online phase, it just needs some light operations with the message and the receiver's identity. In addition, the proposed scheme can provide the confidentiality, authentication, integrity and non-repudiation in the random oracle model under the Elliptic Curve Discrete Logarithm Problem (ECDLP). Comprehensive analysis shows that our design is the most efficient. Compared with other three schemes, for offline storage and ciphertext size, our scheme is optimal. For computational cost, our scheme reduces by 23%, 17% and 17%, respectively. Therefore, our design is suitable for the IoV application. & COPY; 2023 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB On highways, the interaction with surrounding vehicles is very crucial for the decision-making and planning of autonomous vehicles. However, the multi-modal driving intentions of surrounding vehicles have brought great challenges. Aiming at the multi-modal driving intention of surrounding vehicles, a multi-modal driving risk field based on dynamic collision region is proposed, and multi-modal driving intention partially observable markov decision process (MDI-POMDP) decision framework is established, which integrating behavior decision and motion planning. Firstly, the multi-modal probability distribution of driving intention is fused to establish a driving risk field. Moreover, combined with the longitudinal safety distance model and lateral driving direction, the concept of dynamic collision area is proposed in the driving risk field. Then, MDI-POMDP is formulated to analyze the influence of the uncertainty on planning, which is caused by the multi-modal driving intention of surrounding vehicles. In the following, with the help of the previous state, a time-dependent deep reinforcement learning (DRL) algorithm recurrent deterministic policy gradient (RDPG) is designed to enhance the current observation, to solve the optimal driving policy under partial observation and generate the optimal trajectory. Furthermore, the simulation results show that the performance of our proposed motion planning algorithm is outstanding, compared with the states-of-the-art methods. And our algorithm has the powerful ability to model the multi-modality of driving intention, to ensure the traffic safety.

AB Aerospace and defense industries are particularly vulnerable to cyber threats given their sensitive nature, significantly extending the consequences of security breaches to the national level. Aerospace vehicles are augmented by cooperative control, intelligent, connected, and autonomous systems. The risk against such systems is further amplified due to commonly relying on the MIL-STD-1553 communication bus developed with a high focus on reliability and fault tolerance, albeit with security as a second priority. MIL-STD-1553 (a.k.a., STANAG 3838 by NATO) is a standard that describes a serial data communication bus primarily used in aerospace vehicles for military and civilian applications, including avionics, aircraft, and spacecraft data handling. In the absence of core security measures such as authentication, authorization, and encryption, the bus connecting sensitive functions, including autopilot, GPS, fuel valve switches, and other avionics equipment, is easily vulnerable to a wide range of attacks. This paper proposes, AdaptIDS, a novel adaptive intrusion detection system as a security analytics framework for the MIL-STD-1553 communication bus. AdaptIDS mainly adopts data science principles and leverages advanced deep learning techniques (i.e., the stacking ensemble) to boost its generalization capabilities for detecting unseen patterns of attacks in the dynamic changing environment of aerospace vehicles. Extensive experiments are conducted using two datasets generated from an open-source simulation system, reflecting dynamic real-life scenarios. The evaluation results demonstrate that our solution outperforms existing solutions with high detection effectiveness of 0.99 F1-measure and computational time efficiency.

AB The traffic experiment conducted by Sugiyama et al. (2007) has been a seminal work in transportation research. In the experiment, a group of vehicles are instructed to drive on a circular track starting with uniform spacing. The isolated experimental environment provides a safe, economic, and controlled environment to study free flow traffic and phantom traffic waves. This article introduces a novel method that automates the data collection process in such an environment Specifically, the vehicle trajectories are measured using a 360-degree camera, and the fuel rates are recorded via on-board diagnostics (OBD-II) scanners. The video data from the 360-degree camera is then processed by an offline unsupervised computer vision algorithm. To validate the data collection method, the technique is then evaluated on a series of eight experiments. Analysis shows that the collected data are highly accurate, with a mean positional bias of less than 0.002 m and a small standard deviation of 0.11 m. The positional data also yields reliable velocity estimates: the derived velocities are biased by only 0.02 m/s with a small standard deviation of 0.09 m/s. The produced trajectory and fuel rate data can be readily used to study human driving behaviors, to calibrate microsimulation models, to develop fuel consumption models, and to investigate engine emissions. To facilitate future research, the source code and the data are made publicly available online.

AB Research on the acceptability of assistive systems for improving the safety of powered two-wheelers (PTWs) is a pressing issue. The use of safety-enhancing assistive systems for motorised vehicles, including advanced driver assistance systems and in-vehicle information systems is widespread in many countries. Yet, there is only a limited number of equivalent intelligent transport systems (ITS) for PTWs, namely advanced rider assistance systems and on-bike information systems. This study describes the methodological development of a specific tool for assessing motorcyclists' acceptability of ITS, as part of the motorcyclists' profiling questionnaire (MOPROQ). There were three stages of development. First, a literature review was undertaken to assess the current state of the art regarding ITS for PTWs and to determine the most relevant facets of acceptability that should be measured. Second, a series of focus group interviews were conducted to explore riders' attitudes towards ITS. Finally, the focus group results were used to develop a large-scale survey (MOPROQ), which was administered to an initial sample of over 6000 riders internationally. The designed tool can be used as a basis for the determination of rider acceptability of ITS systems in the future.

AB Thelast decade has witnessed growing research interests in the path-planning problem for unmanned ground vehicles (UGVs) equipped with RGB-D cameras or LiDARs. However, apart from their extremely high cost, these sensors may be obscured by obstacles, which makes them impractical for many complex scenarios. Besides, most of the existing works for path planning have not considered energy efficiency for UGVs that are usually constrained by limited on-board batteries. Distinct from existing methods, this work presents a vision-based unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)-assisted cooperative system for multiple UGVs. The proposed system harnesses the broad vision of UAV and operates in both general outdoor and global positioning system (GPS)-denied indoor environments. In sharp contrast to the conventional heuristic algorithms such as the rapidly exploring random tree (RRT) algorithm and the Dijkstra methods, the proposed energy-efficient path planning for UGVs is formulated as a non-convex optimization problem by considering the collision-aware obstacle-avoidance. More specifically, the proposed path-planning scheme contains two stages, namely the semantic segmentation that localizes UGVs and obstacles in the environment by exploiting the wide-angle camera mounted on the UAV, followed by the trajectory generation in which a disciplined convex and concave programming (DCCP) algorithm is devised for the non-convex energy-minimization problem. Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness of the UAV-UGV cooperative system and the proposed DCCP-based path-planning scheme.

AB Understanding multi-node vehicular wireless communication channels is crucial for future time-sensitive safety applications for human-piloted as well as partly autonomous vehicles on roads, railways and in the air. These highly dynamic wireless communication channels are characterized by rapidly changing channel statistics. In this paper we present the first fully mobile multi-node vehicular wireless channel sounding system, which is capable of simultaneously capturing multiple channel frequency responses, ensuring that measurement conditions are identical for all observed links. We use it to analyze road scenarios with multiple vehicles and a large obstructing double-decker bus. The empirical measurement data is used to parametrize a model for the large obstructing vehicle within a geometry-based stochastic channel model. We compare the time-variant channel statistics obtained from our channel model with the ones from the measurement campaign. By means of a channel emulator we obtain the packet error rates of commercial modems for the measured and the simulated wireless communication channels and compare them, in order to validate the model at the link level. We find that the path loss, the root mean square (RMS) delay spread, and the RMS Doppler spread deviate by less than 3.6 dB, 78 ns, and 52 Hz, respectively, for 80% of the total simulation duration. The PER obtained from measured data is within the maximum and minimum bounds of our model for 86% of the simulation duration.

DE vehicular ad-hoc network (VANET); peer-to-peer overlay network;
   publish/subscribe communication paradigm; distributed hash table (DHT)
AB A vehicular ad-hoc network (VANET) can be visualized as a network of moving vehicles communicating in an asynchronous and autonomous fashion. Efficient and scalable information dissemination in VANET applications is a major challenge due to the movement of vehicles which causes unpredictable changes in network topology. The publish/ subscribe communication paradigm provides decoupling in time, space, and synchronization between communicating entities, and presents itself as an elegant solution for information dissemination for VANET like environments. In this paper, we propose our approach for information dissemination which utilizes publish/subscribe and distributed hash table (DHT) based overlay networks. In our approach, we assume a hybrid VANET consisting of stationary info-stations and moving vehicles. These info-stations are installed at every major intersection of the city and vehicles can take the role of publisher, subscriber, or broker depending upon the context. The info-stations form a DHT based broker overlay among themselves and act as rendezvous points for related publications and subscriptions. Further, info-stations also assist in locating vehicles that have subscribed to information items. We consider different possible deployments of this hybrid VANET with respect to the number of info-stations and their physical connectivity with each other. We perform Received August 22, 2011; accepted January 21, 2012 E-mail: tulika_mishra@rediffmail.com simulations to assess the performance of our approach in these different deployment scenarios and discuss their applicability in urban and semi-urban areas.

AB Microscopic traffic flow data, an important input to virtual test scenarios for autonomous driving, are often difficult to obtain in large quantities to allow for batch testing. In this paper, a neural network for generating microscopic traffic flow scene fragments is proposed, which is improved by adding Gate Recurrent Units (GRU) to the discriminator of the Deep Convolutional Generative Adversarial Network (DCGAN) to enable it to better discriminate continuous data. Subsequently, this paper compares individual sample motion trajectories of the generated data using Grey Relational Analysis (GRA) and Dynamic Time Warping algorithm (DTW) at the microscopic scale, and evaluates the overall scenes generated using averaged statistics at the macroscopic scale. The results show that the method proposed in this paper can generate realistic microscopic traffic flow data very well and that the neural network proposed in this paper can generate better near-realistic microscopic traffic flow data than the original DCGAN under the evaluation metrics used in this paper.

AB It is demonstrated that data augmentation is a promising approach to reduce the size of the captured dataset required for training automatic road surface classifiers. The context is on-board systems for autonomous or semi-autonomous driving assistance: automatic power-assisted steering. Evidence is obtained by extensive experiments involving multiple captures from a 10-channel multisensor deployment: three channels from the accelerometer (acceleration in the X, Y, and Z axes); three microphone channels; two speed channels; and the torque and position of the handwheel. These captures were made under different settings: three worm-gear interface configurations; hands on or off the wheel; vehicle speed (constant speed of 10, 15, 20, 30 km/h, or accelerating from 0 to 30 km/h); and road surface (smooth flat asphalt, stripes, or cobblestones). It has been demonstrated in the experiments that data augmentation allows a reduction by an approximate factor of 1.5 in the size of the captured training dataset.

AB Several pieces of research during the last decade in intelligent perception are focused on the development of algorithms allowing vehicles to move efficiently in complex environments. Most of existing approaches suffer from either processing time which do not meet real-time requirements, or inefficient in real complex environment, which also does not meet the full availability constraint of such a critical function. To improve the existing solutions, an algorithm based on curved lane detection by using a Bayesian framework for the estimation of multi-hyperbola parameters is proposed to detect curved lane under challenging conditions. The general idea is to divide a captured image into several parts. The trajectory is modeled by a hyperbola over each part, whose parameters are estimated using the proposed hierarchical Bayesian model. Compared to the existing works in the state of the art, experimental results prove that our approach is more efficient and more precise in road marking detection.

TI Traffic Light Detection in Autonomous Driving Systems
SO IEEE CONSUMER ELECTRONICS MAGAZINE
LA English
DT Article
AB Vision-only systems are currently very popular for use in autonomous driving systems and advanced driver-assistance systems. These systems operate by using input images from a camera and no other sensors. One of the tasks these systems needs to perform is the detection and understanding of traffic lights in a traffic environment, by localizing all relevant traffic lights in an image received from an on board camera mounted on the vehicle. This article proposes a traffic light recognition system where adaptive thresholding and deep learning are used for region proposal and traffic light localization, respectively. The LISA open-source dataset is used along with custom augmentation methods in order to increase the number of available data samples. Performance of the developed system is presented in the form of true and false positive rates obtained on the test data. The classification part of the algorithm gives a total of 89.60% true detection rate, while the regression part of the model produced a correct location of the traffic light in 92.67% of cases.

AB Vision-based bio-inspired control strategies offer great promise in demonstrating safe autonomous navigation of aerial microsystems in completely unstructured environments. This paper presents an innovative navigation technique that embeds bio-inspired wide-field processing of instantaneous optic flow patterns within the H-infinity loop shaping synthesis framework, resulting in a dynamic controller that enables robust stabilization and command tracking behavior in obstacle-laden environments. The local environment is parameterized as a series of simpler corridor-like environments in the optic flow model, and the loop shaping controller is synthesized to provide robust stability across the range of modeled environments. Experimental validation is provided using a quadrotor aerial vehicle across environments with large variation in local structure, with the loop shaping controller demonstrating better tracking performance than other comparable controllers in straight-line corridors of different widths. The current approach is computationally efficient, as it does not involve explicit extraction of an environment depth map, and makes for an attractive paradigm for aerial microsystem navigation in urban environments.

AB We investigate path planning algorithms that are based on level set methods for applications in which the environment is static, but where an a priori map is inaccurate and the environment is sensed in real-time. Our principal contribution is not a new path planning algorithm, but rather a formal analysis of path planning algorithms based on level set methods. Computational costs when planning paths with level set methods are due to the creation of the level set function. Once the level set function has been computed, the optimal path is simply gradient descent down the level set function. Our approach rests on the formal analysis of how value of the level set function changes when the changes in the environment are detected. We show that in many practical cases, only a small domain of the level set function needs to be re-computed when the environment changes. Simulation examples are presented to validate the effectiveness of the proposed method.

AB This paper describes the use of Obstacle Analysis to identify anomaly handling requirements for a safety-critical, autonomous system. The software requirements for the system evolved during operations due to an on-going effort to increase the autonomous system's robustness. The resulting increase in autonomy also increased system complexity. This investigation used Obstacle Analysis to identify and to reason incrementally about new requirements for handling failures and other anomalous events. Results reported in the paper show that Obstacle Analysis complemented standard safety-analysis techniques in identifying undesirable behaviors and ways to resolve them. The step-by-step use of Obstacle Analysis identified potential side effects and missing monitoring and control requirements. Adding an Availability Indicator and feature-interaction patterns proved useful for the analysis of obstacle resolutions. The paper discusses the consequences of these results in terms of the adoption of Obstacle Analysis to analyze anomaly handling requirements in evolving systems.

AB This study proposes a method for detecting and tracking traversable regions in off-road conditions for unmanned ground vehicles (UGVs). Off-road conditions, such as rough terrain or fields, present significant challenges for UGV navigation, and detecting and tracking traversable regions is essential to ensure safe and efficient operation. Using a 3D laser scanner and range-image-based approach, a method is proposed for detecting traversable regions under off-road conditions; this is followed by a Bayesian fusion algorithm for tracking the traversable regions in consecutive frames. Our range-image-based traversable-region-detection approach enables efficient processing of point cloud data from a 3D laser scanner, allowing the identification of traversable areas that are safe for the unmanned ground vehicle to drive on. The effectiveness of the proposed method was demonstrated using real-world data collected during UGV operations on rough terrain, highlighting its potential as a solution for improving UGV navigation capabilities in challenging environments.

AB With the continuous development of artificial intelligence and computer vision technology, autonomous vehicles have developed rapidly. Although self-driving vehicles have achieved good results in normal environments, driving in adverse weather can still pose a challenge to driving safety. To improve the detection ability of self-driving vehicles in harsh environments, we first construct a new color levels offset compensation model to perform adaptive color levels correction on images, which can effectively improve the clarity of targets in adverse weather and facilitate the detection and recognition of targets. Then, we compare several common one-stage target detection algorithms and improve on the best-performing YOLOv5 algorithm. We optimize the parameters of the Backbone of the YOLOv5 algorithm by increasing the number of model parameters and incorporating the Transformer and CBAM into the YOLOv5 algorithm. At the same time, we use the loss function of EIOU to replace the loss function of the original CIOU. Finally, through the ablation experiment comparison, the improved algorithm improves the detection rate of the targets, with the mAP reaching 94.7% and the FPS being 199.86.

AB This paper presents a parallel motion planner for mobile robots and autonomous vehicles based on lattices created in the sensor space of planar range finders. The planner is able to compute paths in a few milliseconds, thus allowing obstacle avoidance in real time. The proposed sensor-space lattice (SSLAT) motion planner uses a lattice to tessellate the area covered by the sensor and to rapidly compute collision-free paths in the robot surroundings by optimizing a cost function. The cost function guides the vehicle to follow a vector field, which encodes the desired vehicle path. We evaluated our method in challenging cluttered static environments, such as warehouses and forests, and in the presence of moving obstacles, both in simulations and real experiments. In these experiments, we show that our algorithm performs collision checking and path planning faster than baseline methods. Since the method can have sequential or parallel implementations, we also compare the two versions of SSLAT and show that the run time for its parallel implementation, which is independent of the number and shape of the obstacles found in the environment, provides a speedup greater than 25.

AB Negligence law is often asked to adapt to new technologies. So it is with artificial intelligence ("AI"). Though AI often conjures images of autonomous robots, especially autonomous vehicles, most existing AI technologies are not autonomous. Rather, they are decision-assistance tools that aim to improve on the inefficiency, arbitrariness, and bias of human decisions. Decision-assistance tools are frequently used in contexts in which negligence law or negligence analogues operate, including medicine, financial advice, data security, and driving (in partially autonomous vehicles). Users of these tools interact with AI as they would any other form of technological development-by incorporating it into their existing decision-making practices. Accordingly, it is important to understand how the use of these tools affects the duties of care required by negligence law and people's ability to meet them.
   This Article takes up that discussion, arguing that AI poses serious challenges for negligence law's ability to continue compensating the injured. By inserting a layer of inscrutable, unintuitive, and statistically derived code in between a human decisionmaker and the consequences of her decisions, AI disrupts our typical understanding of responsibility for choices gone wrong. This Article argues that AI's unique nature introduces four complications into negligence: 1) the inability to predict and account for AI errors; 2) physical or cognitive capacity limitations at the interface where humans interact with AI; 3) the introduction of AI-specific software vulnerabilities into decisions not previously mediated by software; and 4) distributional concerns based on AI's statistical nature and potential for bias. In those contexts where we rely on current negligence law to compensate for injuries, AI's use will likely result in injured plaintiffs regularly losing out, as errors cease being the fault of the operator and become statistical certainties embedded within the technology. With most new technologies, negligence law adapts over time as courts gain familiarity with the technology's proper use. But the unique nature of AI suggests that this may not occur without legislation requiring AI to be built interpretably and transparently, at a minimum, and that other avenues of regulation may be better suited to preventing uncompensated losses by injured parties.

AB Over the last decades, the development of Advanced Driver Assistance Systems (ADAS) has become a critical endeavor to attain different objectives: safety enhancement, mobility improvement, energy optimization and comfort. In order to tackle the first three objectives, a considerable amount of research focusing on autonomous driving have been carried out. Most of these works have been conducted within collaborative research programs involving car manufacturers, OEM and research laboratories around the world. Recent research and development on highly autonomous driving aim to ultimately replace the driver's actions with robotic functions. The first successful steps were dedicated to embedded assistance systems such as speed regulation (ACC), obstacle collision avoidance or mitigation (Automatic Emergency Braking), vehicle stability control (ESC), lane keeping or lane departure avoidance. Partially automated driving will require co-pilot applications (which replace the driver on his all driving tasks) involving a combination of the above methods, algorithms and architectures. Such a system is built with complex, distributed and cooperative architectures requiring strong properties such as reliability and robustness. Such properties must be maintained despite complex and degraded working conditions including adverse weather conditions, fog or dust as perceived by sensors. This paper is an overview on reliability and robustness issues related to sensors processing and perception. Indeed, prior to ensuring a high level of safety in the deployment of autonomous driving applications, it is necessary to guarantee a very high level of quality for the perception mechanisms. Therefore, we will detail these critical perception stages and provide a presentation of usable embedded sensors. Furthermore, in this study of state of the art of recent highly automated systems, some remarks and comments about limits of these systems and potential future research ways will be provided. Moreover, we will also give some advice on how to design a co-pilot application with driver modeling. Finally, we discuss a global architecture for the next generation of co-pilot applications. This architecture is based on the use of recent methods and technologies (AI, Quantify self, IoT...) and takes into account the human factors and driver modeling. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

AB This paper describes the developmental effort involved in prototyping the first indigenous autonomous mobile robot, AMR, with a manipulator for carrying out tasks related to manufacturing. The objective is to design and develop a vehicle that can navigate autonomously and transport jobs and tools in a manufacturing environment. Proprioceptive and exteroceptive sensors are mounted on AMR for navigation. Among the exteroceptive sensors, a stereovision camera is mounted in front of AMR for mobile robot perception of the environment. Using the widely supported JPEG image file format, full high-resolution color images are transmitted frame by frame from the mobile robot to multiple viewers located within the robot work area, where fast reconstruction of these images enables remote viewing. A CMOS camera mounted on the manipulator identifies jobs for pick-and-place operation. A variation of correlation based adaptive predictive search (CAPS) method, a fast search algorithm in template matching, is used for job identification. The CAPS method justifiably selects a set of search steps rather than consecutive point-to-point search for faster job identification. Search steps, i.e., either coarse search or fine search, are selected by calculating the correlation coefficient between template and the image. Adaptive thresholding is used for image segmentation for parametric calculations required for proper gripping of the object. Communication with the external world allowing remote operation is maintained through wireless connectivity. It is shown that autonomous navigation requires synchronization of different processes in a distributed architecture, while concurrently maintaining the integrity of the network.

TI Shared planning and control for mobile robots with integral haptic

ID BILATERAL TELEOPERATION; COVERAGE; SYSTEMS
AB This paper presents a novel bilateral shared framework for online trajectory generation for mobile robots. The robot navigates along a dynamic path, represented as a B-spline, whose parameters are jointly controlled by a human supervisor and an autonomous algorithm. The human steers the reference (ideal) path by acting on the path parameters that are also affected, at the same time, by the autonomous algorithm to ensure: (i) collision avoidance, (ii) path regularity, and (iii) proximity to some points of interest. These goals are achieved by combining a gradient descent-like control action with an automatic algorithm that re-initializes the traveled path (replanning) in cluttered environments to mitigate the effects of local minima. The control actions of both the human and the autonomous algorithm are fused via a filter that preserves a set of local geometrical properties of the path to ease the tracking task of the mobile robot. The bilateral component of the interaction is implemented via a force feedback that accounts for both human and autonomous control actions along the whole path, thus providing information about the mismatch between the reference and traveled path in an integral sense. The proposed framework is validated by means of realistic simulations and actual experiments deploying a quadrotor unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) supervised by a human operator acting via a force-feedback haptic interface. Finally, a user study is presented to validate the effectiveness of the proposed framework and the usefulness of the provided force cues.

AB This paper focuses on a fuzzy logic based intelligent decision making system that aims to improve the safety of marine vessels by avoiding collision situations. It can be implemented in a decision support system of an oceangoing vessel or included in the process of autonomous ocean navigation. Although Autonomous Guidance and Navigation (AGN) is meant to be an important part of future ocean navigation due to the associated cost reduction and improved maritime safety, intelligent decision making capabilities should be an integrated part of the future AGN system in order to improve autonomous ocean navigational facilities. In this study, the collision avoidance of the Target vessel with respect to the vessel domain of the Own vessel has been analyzed and input, and output fuzzy membership functions have been derived. The if-then rule based decision making process and the integrated novel fuzzy inference system are formulated and implemented on the MATLAB software platform. Simulation results are presented regarding several critical collision conditions where the Target vessel fails to take appropriate actions, as the "Give way" vessel to avoid collision situations. In these situations, the Own vessel is able to take critical actions to avoid collisions, even when being the "Stand on" vessel. Furthermore, all decision rules are formulated in accordance with the International Maritime Organization Convention on the International Regulations for Preventing Collisions at Sea (COLREGs), 1972, to avoid conflicts that might occur during ocean navigation.

AB This paper presents a supervisory multi-agent control policy over an acoustic communication network subject to imperfections (packet dropout and transmission delay) for localisation of an underwater flow source (e.g., source of chemical pollution, fresh water, etc.) with an unknown location at the bottom of the ocean. A two-loop control policy combined with a coding strategy for reliable communication is presented to perform the above task. A simulator is developed and used to evaluate the trade-offs between quality of communication, transmission delay and control for a fleet of autonomous underwater vehicles supervised over a noisy acoustic communication network by an autonomous surface vessel. It is illustrated that without compensation of the effects of severe random packet dropout, localisation of an unknown underwater flow source is not possible for the condition simulated just by implementing a two-loop control policy. But a two-loop control policy combined with a strategy for reliable communication locates the unknown location of flow source.

DE autonomous robots; evolutionary algorithms; radial basis functions;

AB The use of evolutionary methods to generate controllers for real-world autonomous agents has attracted recent attention. Most of the pertinent research has employed genetic algorithms or variations thereof. Recent research has applied an alternative evolutionary method, evolution strategies, to the generation of simple Braitenberg vehicles. This application accelerates the development of such controllers by more than an order of magnitude (a few hours compared to more than two days). Motivated by this useful speedup, this paper investigates the evolution of more complex architectures, receptive-field controllers, that can employ nonlinear interactions and, therefore, can yield more complex behavior. It is interesting to note that the evolution strategy yields the same efficacy in terms of function evaluations, even though the second class of controllers requires up to 10 times more parameters than the simple Braitenberg architecture. In addition to the speedup, there is an important theoretical reason for preferring an evolution strategy over a genetic algorithm for this problem, namely the presence of epistasis.

AB In this paper, a new method of multi-objective optimization of the shape parameters was proposed for the Autonomous Underwater Vehicle (AUV) with both towed and self-propelled, aiming to reduce drag and enhance motion stability during navigation. In this study, the hydrodynamics calculation of AUV was conducted by CFD method covering a wide range of Reynolds number between 105 and 107, and the optimization was performed by NSGA-II multi-objective optimization algorithm. Prior to deploying the optimization process, a sample library was created using the Latin hypercube sampling method to construct the Kriging approximation model. Thereafter, the model was used as the NSGA-II multi-objective optimization function, in which the range of design variables was considered to obtain the Pareto optimal solution. Furthermore, we also introduce and discuss the Pareto optimal points with special characteristics. In addition, the objective function values of these four optimal points were compared with the results of the initial model. The results showed that the drag at the four optimal points were reduced by 12.07%, 11.59%, 10.98% and 7.94%, respectively, and the overturning moments were reduced by 1.96%, 7.38%, 12.73% and 14.08%, respectively. The proposed multi-objective optimization method optimizes the shape of AUV effectively and provides valuable guidance for the design of AUV.

AB Path planning has received more and more attention due to its indispensability in autonomous vehicle (AV). Generally speaking, the stability of AV is not fully considered in path planning, therefore, the planned path may be detrimental for maintaining the stability. And this problem is even more acute for roll stability in complex 3D environment, such as off-road terrain environment. To enhance the roll stability on off-road terrain, a 3D gradient reconstruction-based path planning method (3DGRB-PPM) is presented in this work. The 3DGRB-PPM can keep the roll angle at a low level even in complex 3D environment, thus greatly enhancing the roll stability. The 3DGRB-PPM includes two parts, a gradient reconstruction unit and an adaptive fusion unit. In order to ensure the roll stability of AV in path planning, the gradient reconstruction unit is designed by constructing two potential fields, a joint potential field of gradient and roll angle for enhancing the roll stability and a 3D artificial potential field for reaching the destination. In order to coordinate these two potential fields, an adaptive fusion unit is designed by fuzzy inference rule. The simulation is implemented on the Matlab-Carsim co-simulation platform, and the simulation results show that the path planned by 3DGRB-PPM has good performance with enhanced roll stability.

AB The assistance and autonomous performance of overtaking manoeuvres can offer significant safety benefits. The impact of driving context on perceived risk emphasises the benefits of using contextual information to adjust the manoeuvring behaviour. This paper follows a mixed approach, addressing two main objectives: identifying factor combinations related to overtaking crashes (objective risk) and exploring their relationship to perceived risk. Factor combinations were extracted from a multi-year dataset, acquired from the UK in-depth study RAIDS (Road Accident In-depth Studies). Selected factors were used to create motorway overtaking scenarios with different manoeuvring behaviour (pull-out distance, manoeuvre duration, speed) and driving context (day/night, overtaking car/truck), while 237 participants assessed their impact on perceived risk through an online survey. The findings highlight the strong impact of manoeuvre characteristics on perceived risk, mediated or intensified by the driving context. Long pull-out distance and short manoeuvre duration time were preferred; under night conditions, short pullout distances were perceived as riskier compared to daytime, while the opposite effect appeared for high speed, which was considered safer. The results can inform future research on motorway overtaking safety perception and acceptability, as well as the design of systems that assist or autonomously perform overtaking. Specifically, they can be used as guidelines for incorporating context related information to adjust overtaking behaviour according to user preferences and create a positive passenger experience.

AB An autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) is an economical and safe tool that is well-suited for search, investigation, identification, and salvage operations on the sea floor. Path planning technology, which primarily includes modeling methods and path search algorithms, is an important technology for AUVs. In recent years, the AUV path planning technology has rapidly developed. Compared with land robots, AUVs must endure complex underwater environments and consider various factors, such as currents, water pressure, and topography. Challenges exist in terms of online obstacle avoidance, three-dimensional environment path planning, and the robustness of the algorithms. Adapting a complex environment and finding a suitable path planning method comprise the main problem that must be solved. In this paper, we summarize the principles, advantages, and disadvantages of modeling and path search technologies for AUVs. The most prominent feature of this paper is to summarize the improvement methods of various technical shortcomings and improve the original methods, such as dynamic obstacle avoidance, optimization path, coverage, and processing speed. In addition to summarizing the characteristics of each algorithm, this paper intuitively demonstrates the experimental environment, the real-time nature, the path planning range of the AUV, and so on. We also discuss the application scenarios of various modeling and path search technologies for AUVs. In addition, we discuss the challenges of AUVs and the direction of future research.

AB Autonomous air drones, known as unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), often accomplish missions with real-time video streaming leveraging the available cellular network. Video streaming is a typical application with stringent quality of service (QoS) requirements, which are not always supported in the whole mission area. In this paper, we address the offline path planning problem of finding the optimal path from a source to a destination in 2-D space in order to maximize the communication quality, given a cellular coverage, and thus providing throughput guarantees to the video streaming In addressing the problem, the restricted amount of available energy, the wind effect, and the path post-smoothing problem are considered. We propose two innovative path planning algorithms and we show that our algorithms outperform classical approaches that are oblivious of communication network coverage. Both algorithms are variants of classical A* algorithm and they optimize the path jointly in terms of distance and of the experienced throughput by the drone: in this way, the quality of the video streaming along the path is optimized while preserving the energy budget for the flight. We describe both of the algorithms and investigate their performance. Moreover, we introduce a novel path smoothing method that outperforms classing approaches in terms of distance and computation cost. Finally, in order to prove that our algorithms can be practically utilized in the real-world path planners, we integrate our proposed path planning algorithms into the popular QGroundControl (QGC) control station.

AB This paper presents a novel design of a Linear Parameter Varying (LPV) controller based-on the polytopic approach, for the path-following system of an automated vehicle. The implementation of the proposed steering system is based-on the reduction of the initial 3D (3 Dimensional) polytope that, due to the conservatism of the specific approach suffers from over-bounding. The proposed algorithm aims at tightening the polytope by reducing the vertices and the volume of the polytope that includes the parameter variations i.e the longitudinal velocity of the car, its inverse and, the look-ahead distance of the steering algorithm. In this paper, a novel real-time implementation of the reduced LPV/Polytopic controller is proposed as a real-time optimization problem according to the current measured values of parameters. The novel control system, has been validated in high-fidelity simulations, and to a real-life experiment at a test-bed platform (Renault Zoe) in a private test track for low and higher speeds showing encouraging performance and sustaining good tracking and comfort at the same time.

AB Advanced communication and artificial intelligence (AI) technologies facilitate the development of green smart cities. Connected and automated vehicles (CAVs) are crucial components, which are aware of the environment by collecting data from sensors and modeling through AI to realize automatic decision-making. Intelligence networking enables each CAV to train appropriate models locally to learn how to drive in different environments, which can make up for the lack of experience of single-vehicle. However, model training and intelligence networking consume a lot of energy, calling on high-energy-efficient solutions. In this paper, we propose a non-fungible token (NFT)-based green intelligence networking scheme (NGIN) for CAVs in smart cities. We use NFT to tokenize and describe intelligence by metadata, enabling applications to network intelligence efficiently, thereby reducing energy consumption. We present the architecture, modules, and efficient mechanisms of distributed intelligence networking. Moreover, we formulate the core problem as a discrete Markov decision process (MDP) and adopt the quantum-inspired reinforcement learning (QRL) algorithm to solve it. Also, the convergence rate and performance are evaluated. Simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed scheme.

AB In the industrial field, Automatic Guided Vehicles (AGV) are frequently used for the transport of goods, usually replacing manual means of transport or conveyor belts, to reduce operating costs and human errors in this way. In order to increase the performance of these industrial systems and enable more advanced applications, it is key to develop control-oriented models to test new strategies and control techniques, with the aim of making them safer and more efficient. Thus, in this work a kinematic and dynamic control-oriented model of an AGV is developed. The main objective of this work is to obtain a mathematical representation of the complex dynamics of the AGV Easybot, a hybrid tricycle-differential vehicle, which will allow us to study the effects of towed load and wheel-ground interaction. To do so, the kinematic models of the differential and the tricycle robot have been developed and combined together with the developed vehicle dynamics model. The AGV has been split into its different components and the Newton-Euler equations have been applied to obtain the equations of its dynamics. The model has been validated in simulation for different trajectories, varying the speed and the load.

DE Underwater vehicle; Added mass; Damping; CFD; Robust
AB The two critical issues of robust control are stable controller synthesis and control performance guarantee in the presence of model uncertainties. Inside all robust stable solutions, small modeling parametric uncertainties lead to better performance controllers. However, the cost to develop an accurate hydrodynamic model, which shrinks the uncertainty intervals, is usually high. Meanwhile, when the robot geometry is complex, it becomes very difficult to identify its dynamic and hydrodynamic parameters. In this paper, the main objective is to find an efficient modeling approach to tune acceptable control design models. A control-oriented modeling approach is proposed for a low-speed semi-AUV (Autonomous Underwater Vehicle) CISCREA, which has complex-shaped structures. The proposed solution uses cost efficient CFD (computational fluid dynamic) software to predict the two hydrodynamic key parameters: The added mass matrix and the damping matrix. Four DOF (degree of freedom) model is built for CISCREA from CFD and verified through experimental results. Numerical and experimental results are compared. In addition, rotational damping CFD solutions are studied using STAR-CCM+ (TM). A nonlinear compensator is demonstrated to tune linear yaw model for robust control scheme.

AB We describe a real-time highway surveillance system (RHSS), which operates autonomously to collect statistics (speed and volume) and generates incident alerts (e.g., stopped vehicles). The system is designed to optimize long-term real-time performance accuracy. It also provides convenient integration to an existing surveillance infrastructure with different levels of service. Innovations include a novel 3-D Hungarian algorithm which is utilized for object tracking and a practical, hands-off mechanism for camera calibration. Speed is estimated based on trajectories after mapping/alignment with respect to dominant paths learned based on an evolutionary dynamics model. The system, RHSS, is intensively evaluated under different scenarios such as rain, low-contrast and high-contrast lightings. Performance is presented in comparison to a current commercial product. The contribution is innovation of new technologies that enable hands-off calibration (i.e., automatic detection of vanishing points) and improved accuracy (i.e., illumination balancing, tracking via a new 3-D Hungarian algorithm, and re-initialization of background detection on-the-fly). Results indicate the capability and applicability of the proposed system in real-time and real-world settings. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The ability of generating and interpreting a three-dimensional representation of the environment in real-time is one of the key technologies for autonomous vehicles. While active sensors like ultrasounds have been commercially used, their cost and precision is not favorable. On the other hand, integrating passive sensors, like video cameras, in modern vehicles is quite appealing especially because of their low cost. However, image processing requires reliable real-time algorithms to retrieve depth from visual information. In addition, the limited processing power in automobiles and other mobile platforms makes this problem even more challenging. In this paper we introduce a parking assistance system which relies on dense motion-stereo to compute depth maps of the observed environment in real-time. The flexibility and robustness of our method is showcased with different applications: automatic parking slot detection, a collision warning for the pivoting ranges of the doors and an image-based rendering technique to visualize the environment around the host vehicle. We evaluate the accuracy and reliability of our system and provide quantitative and qualitative results. A comparison to ultrasound and feature-based motion-stereo solutions shows that our approach is more reliable.

AB Malicious attackers may disrupt the safety of autonomous systems through compromising sensors to feed wrong measurements to the controller. This article proposes attack-resilient sensor fusion that combines local sensor readings and shared sensing information from multiple sources. The method results in higher resilience against sensor attacks through jointly considering sensing noise and uncertain communication delay. To be specific, we first identify the considerable impact of the delay on determining attacked sensors. Second, we present a novel two-dimensional abstract sensor model, where each measurement is augmented as a probabilistic interval based on the convolution of the noise and delay. Third, we propose a fusion algorithm that admits the fused value with highest joint probability distribution of the intervals to tolerate corrupted measurements. Finally, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our method in a vehicle-platoon case study using extensive simulations and testbed experiments.

AB Detecting failure cases is an essential element for ensuring the safety self-driving system. Any fault in the system directly leads to an accident. In this paper, we analyze the failure of semantic segmentation, which is crucial for autonomous driving system, and detect the failure cases of the predicted segmentation map by predicting mean intersection of union (mIoU). Furthermore, we design a deep neural network for predicting mIoU of segmentation map without the ground truth and introduce a new loss function for training imbalance data. The proposed method not only predicts the mIoU, but also detects failure cases using the predicted mIoU value. The experimental results on Cityscapes data show our network gives prediction accuracy of 93.21% and failure detection accuracy of 84.8%. It also performs well on a challenging dataset generated from the vertical vehicle camera of the Hyundai Motor Group with 90.51% mIoU prediction accuracy and 83.33% failure detection accuracy.

DE Moral judgment; Mind perception; Artificial intelligence; Social

AB Three studies compared peoples judgments of autonomous vehicles (AVs) and humans faced with a moral dilemma. Study 1 showed that, for identical decisions, AVs were judged as more blameworthy, less moral, and less trustworthy compared to humans. However, perceiving AVs as having a human-like mind reduced this difference. Study 2 extended this finding by manipulating AV mindedness. Describing AVs' decision-making capacity in mentalistic terms (relative to mechanistic terms) reduced blame and anger and fostered greater trust and perceptions of morality. Study 3, replicated these findings, and demonstrated that perceived mindedness predicted judgments of trust, morality, and willingness to purchase or ride in an AV. These findings suggest that people's moral reservations about AVs may derive from doubting that AVs have the mental capacities necessary for moral judgment, and that one route for improving trust in AVs is to design them with a veneer of human-like mental qualities.

SO PLOS ONE

DT Article
ID PARTICLE SWARM OPTIMIZATION; ASSIGNMENT; NAVIGATION
AB Research on distributed task planning model for multi-autonomous underwater vehicle (MAUV). A scroll time domain quantum artificial bee colony (STDQABC) optimization algorithm is proposed to solve the multi-AUV optimal task planning scheme. In the uncertain marine environment, the rolling time domain control technique is used to realize a numerical optimization in a narrowed time range. Rolling time domain control is one of the better task planning techniques, which can greatly reduce the computational workload and realize the tradeoff between AUV dynamics, environment and cost. Finally, a simulation experiment was performed to evaluate the distributed task planning performance of the scroll time domain quantum bee colony optimization algorithm. The simulation results demonstrate that the STDQABC algorithm converges faster than the QABC and ABC algorithms in terms of both iterations and running time. The STDQABC algorithm can effectively improve MAUV distributed tasking planning performance, complete the task goal and get the approximate optimal solution.

TI Optic-flow based slope estimation for autonomous landing
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MICRO AIR VEHICLES
LA English
DT Article
AB Micro Air Vehicles need to have a robust landing capability, especially when they operate outside line-of-sight. Autonomous landing requires the identification of a relatively flat landing surface that does not have too large an inclination. In this article, a vision algorithm is introduced that fits a second-order approximation to the optic flow field underlying the optic flow vectors in images from a bottom camera. The flow field provides information on the ventral flow (V-x /h), the time-to-contact (h/ - V-z), the flatness of the landing surface, and the surface slope. The algorithm is computationally efficient and since it regards the flow field as a whole, it is suitable for use during relatively fast maneuvers. The algorithm is subsequently tested on artificial image sequences, hand-held videos, and on the images made by a Parrot AR drone. In a preliminary robotic experiment, the AR drone uses the vision algorithm to determine when to land in a scenario where it flies off a stairs onto the flat floor.

AB In this paper, we present a novel multiclass-target classification method for mmWave frequency modulated continuous wave (FMCW) radar operating in the frequency range of 77 - 81 GHz, based on custom range-angle heatmaps and machine learning tools. The elevation field of view (FoV) is increased by orienting the Radar antennas in elevation. In this orientation, the radar focuses the beam in elevation to improve the elevation FoV. The azimuth FoV is improved by mechanically rotating the Radar horizontally, which has antenna elements oriented in the elevation direction. The data from the Radar measurements obtained by mechanical rotation of the Radar in Azimuth are used to generate a range-angle heatmap. The measurements are taken in a variety of real-world scenarios with various objects such as humans, a car, and an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV), also known as a drone. The proposed technique achieves accuracy of 97.6 % and 99.6 % for classifying the UAV and humans, respectively, and accuracy of 98.1 % for classifying the car from the range-angle FoV heatmap. Such a Radar classification technique will be extremely useful for a wide range of applications in cost-effective and dependable autonomous systems, including ground station traffic monitoring and surveillance, as well as control systems for both on-ground and aerial vehicles.

ID LOCALIZATION; DIAGNOSIS
AB Thermal inspection is a powerful tool that enables the diagnosis of several components at its early stages. One critical aspect that influences thermal inspection outputs is the infrared reflection from external sources. This situation may change the readings, demanding that an expert correctly define the camera position, which is a time consuming and expensive operation. To mitigate this problem, this work proposes an autonomous system capable of identifying infrared reflections by filtering and fusing data obtained from both stereo and thermal cameras. The process starts by acquiring readings from multiples Observation Points (OPs) where, at each OP, the system processes the 3D point cloud and thermal image by fusing them together. The result is a dense point cloud where each point has its spatial position and temperature. Considering that each point's information is acquired from multiple poses, it is possible to generate a temperature profile of each spatial point and filter undesirable readings caused by interference and other phenomena. To deploy and test this approach, a Directional Robotic System (DRS) is mounted over a traditional human-operated service vehicle. In that way, the DRS autonomously tracks and inspects any desirable equipment as the service vehicle passes them by. To demonstrate the results, this work presents the algorithm workflow, a proof of concept, and a real application result, showing improved performance in real-life conditions.

AB This study proposes a method for identification of the nonlinear dynamic model of an AUV while some states are unmeasured; hence, it concentrates on a nonlinear "state and parameter estimation" issue. In this method, a local linearization is used for solving the nonlinear dynamics based on the extended Kalman filter (EKF), and a particle filter (PF) is used to minimize errors and variances of the nonlinear system. In other words, the PF is combined with the EKF in the form of the extended Kalman particle filter (EKPF). The EKPF method is independent of the initial values and satisfies the limits of the parameters and also the assumption that the hydrodynamic coefficients are constant. Hence, it is shown when the ranges or signs of some parameters are known, the EKPF is a more accurate estimator than the EKF. Moreover, a new simulation is done using the model estimated by the EKPF and the results are compared and validated with the measured data of a new experimental test. It is shown that the obtained model can predict the trajectory path with the total normalized root-mean-square error (NRMSE) of 14% and the surge mean speed with the NRMSE of 5%; and it describes the 6DOF motion of the AUV more accurate than the EKF model.

AB Autonomous buses are expected to expand the mobility-on-demand options in cities in the next 10 years. An essential aspect of ensuring optimal usage of fleets of autonomous buses is the task of scheduling. This paper presents a scheduling approach based on the construction of all possible trips used to formulate an optimization problem. While in the past most research is focused on the scheduling of taxi trips, there is an increasing interest in the research for the scheduling of last-mile travel options. A street network has been generated based on open street map data as a basis for the scheduling. All possible combinations of buses and requests are calculated, and for each of those trips, a close to optimal order of requests is created. These are used to formulate the optimization problem, calculating a close to optimal assignment of requests on the buses. The approach has considered constraints such as maximum waiting time, travel delay, and targets to exploit shared trips for higher efficiency. Experiments have been carried out in a simulated environment of a university campus area with fleets of up to 10 vehicles. By performing various trials with changing parameters, the influence of the constraints on waiting time and travel delay to the scheduling is determined. Depending on the setup, service rates above 90%, while trails with strict constraints show that the approach can handle short-term requests. Based on the results, a use case-specific composition of the autonomous bus fleet can be done.

AB Pedestrians are essential component in traffic, and with the advent of intelligent transportation systems, conflicts over right-of-way between pedestrians and other traffic participants have become prevalent. Predicting pedestrian intentions and motions is crucial for autonomous driving and intelligent transportation. However, pedestrian prediction faces challenges such as the variability of pedestrian intentions and the flexibility of their motions, as well as the need for highly generalization capability and lightweight modeling on autonomous vehicles with limited computing power. To face these challenge, this paper proposes a Social Artificial Potential Field (Social-APF) method for pedestrian trajectory prediction. The method combines target intention feature and surrounding obstacles features. We test the performance of Social-APF on several public datasets. The results demonstrate that the Social-APF method outperforms state-of-the-art approaches on the public datasets in both lightweight and model accuracy.

AB Recent years, unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) have been used to perform various tasks such as surveillance, monitoring, rescue, photography, and security. Quadcopter configuration of UAV is most common due to its simplicity, stability, and versatile controllability. Quadcopter landing is most crucial part of the overall operating process. It needs a lot of practice and effort for a safe landing. Therefore, a fuzzy logic-based safe landing system is proposed in this paper. This paper includes a landing system based on laser rangefinder, Arduino Mega MCU, and Pixhawk flight controller. The lookup table technique is used to implement fuzzy logic inside Arduino Mega. This technique takes very small execution time for data processing in fuzzy logic, which is essential for high-speed data processing and updating. Autonomous landing process can be triggered and override at any time using remote controller. Furthermore, various tests are performed on a quadcopter to verify the feasibility of proposed algorithm.

ID SIMULTANEOUS LOCALIZATION; SONAR
AB This paper presents the use of fuzzy models to explicitly consider sensor uncertainty and finite resolution in solving the SLAM (simultaneous localization and mapping) problem for autonomous mobile robots. The approach establishes fuzzy confidence models in describing occupied obstacles and available space. The problem is transformed into an optimization task of minimizing the alignment error between newly scanned local fuzzy maps and selected parts of a developing global fuzzy map. In aligning local fuzzy maps into a global fuzzy map, we developed a prediction strategy to crop the most potential part from the sensed local fuzzy maps to be overlapped with the global fuzzy map. A mobile vehicle equipped with a laser range finder, the Hokuyo URG-04LX, is used to demonstrate the procedure of fuzzy map building. Experimental results show that the proposed architecture is effective in generating a comprehensive global fuzzy map, which is suitable for both human comprehension and path design during real-time navigation.

AB This paper will discuss the US Army Tank Automotive Research, Development and Engineering Center's (TARDEC's) four (4) axis strategy for integration of robotics into the legacy, interim, and objective forces. At the cornerstone of this strategy is the R&D effort concentrating on autonomous perception and navigation, intelligent tactical behavior, command and control, and man-robot interface entailed in the Demo III and Robotic Follower programs. Smart Manned Systems will focus on a systems engineering approach for robotic solutions into the interim force (Vetronics Technology Testbed and Crew Integration & Automation Testbed). In the near-term, application of robotics to the legacy force will be achieved through adapting commercial automation technologies, which address military requirements. Finally, Intelligent Mobility will investigate improving intrinsic platform mobility to lessen the burden on robotic sensing performance. The ultimate goal of this strategy is to advance the robotics technology state-of-the-art to achieve off-road full autonomous operations for military systems in support of the objective force.

AB The vital statistics of the last century highlight a sharp increment of the average age of the world population with a consequent growth of the number of older people. Service robotics applications have the potentiality to provide systems and tools to support the autonomous and self-sufficient older adults in their houses in everyday life, thereby avoiding the task of monitoring them with third parties. In this context, we propose a cost-effective modular solution to detect and follow a person in an indoor, domestic environment. We exploited the latest advancements in deep learning optimization techniques, and we compared different neural network accelerators to provide a robust and flexible person-following system at the edge. Our proposed cost-effective and power-efficient solution is fully-integrable with pre-existing navigation stacks and creates the foundations for the development of fully-autonomous and self-contained service robotics applications.

AB Robust prediction of pedestrian behavior is one of the most challenging problems for autonomous driving. Particularly, predicting pedestrian crossings at crosswalks is of considerable importance for avoiding accidents on the one hand and not unnecessarily slowing down traffic on the other hand. Traditional model-based motion tracking and prediction approaches have difficulties in capturing abrupt changes in motions, as humans can perform them. In this paper, an approach for predicting pedestrian motions that combines established motion tracking algorithms with data-driven methods is presented. The approach is built upon a hierarchical structure, where first, the intent of each pedestrian is classified. Then, the approach computes several qualitative metrics, such as time-to-cross, for the pedestrians classified as crossing. The approach is evaluated on a challenging urban data set collected for different types of crosswalks such as roundabouts and straight roads. The evaluation also provides a thorough analysis of the generalization performance of the proposed approach.

AB Full autonomy for fixed-wing unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) requires the capability to autonomously detect potential landing sites in unknown and unstructured terrain, allowing for self-governed mission completion or handling of emergency situations. In this letter, we propose a perception system addressing this challenge by detecting landing sites based on their texture and geometric shape without using any prior knowledge about the environment. The proposed method considers hazards within the landing region such as terrain roughness and slope, surrounding obstacles that obscure the landing approach path, and the local wind field that is estimated by the on-board EKF. The latter enables applicability of the proposed method on small-scale autonomous planes without landing gear. A safe approach path is computed based on the UAV dynamics, expected state estimation and actuator uncertainty, and the on-board computed elevation map. The proposed framework has been successfully tested on photo-realistic synthetic datasets and in challenging real-world environments.

ID HELICOPTER
AB In this paper a vision-based approach for guidance and safe landing of an Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) is proposed. The UAV is required to navigate from an initial to a final position in a partially known environment. The guidance system allows a remote user to define target areas from a high resolution aerial or satellite image to determine either the waypoints of the navigation trajectory or the landing area. A feature-based image-matching algorithm finds the natural landmarks and gives feedbacks to an onboard, hierarchical, behaviour-based control system for autonomous navigation and landing. Two algorithms for safe landing area detection are also proposed, based on a feature optical flow analysis. The main novelty is in the vision-based architecture, extensively tested on a helicopter, which, in particular, does not require any artificial landmark (e.g., helipad). Results show the appropriateness of the vision-based approach, which is robust to occlusions and light variations.

ID NAVIGATION
AB Classical autonomous navigation systems can control robots in a collision-free manner, oftentimes with verifiable safety and explainability. When facing new environments, however, fine-tuning of the system parameters by an expert is typically required before the system can navigate as expected. To alleviate this requirement, the recently-proposed Adaptive Planner Parameter Learning paradigm allows robots to learn how to dynamically adjust planner parameters using a teleoperated demonstration or corrective interventions from non-expert users. However, these interaction modalities require users to take full control of the moving robot, which requires the users to be familiar with robot teleoperation. As an alternative, we introduce apple, Adaptive Planner Parameter Learning from Evaluative Feedback (real-time, scalar-valued assessments of behavior), which represents a less-demanding modality of interaction. Simulated and physical experiments show apple can achieve better performance compared to the planner with static default parameters and even yield improvement over learned parameters from richer interaction modalities.

ID MIMO RADAR
AB This article addresses the signal processing challenges for the design of a radar-on-chip/in-package in the autonomous-driving era, taking into account recent integration trends and technology capabilities. Radar signal processing platform specifications are discussed, and the radar sensor is compared with other competing sensors, such as lidars, ultrasonics, and video cameras, that aim at detecting still or moving objects and measuring their motion parameters. This survey first focuses on signal processing techniques for a low-cost and power-efficient radar sensor, which operates in real time while ensuring the automotive coverage-range needs. The main signal processing techniques for velocity-range estimation, direction estimation, waveform design, and beamforming are analyzed with particular emphasis on the radar physical layer codesign. The future evolution of embedded computing platforms and advanced signal processing techniques are explored, such as multiple-input, multiple-output (MIMO) and cognitive radars, along with adaptive waveforms for solving interference and spectrum scarcity issues.

AB Human nonverbal communication tools are very ambiguous and difficult to transfer to machines or artificial intelligence (AI). If the AI understands the mental state behind a user's decision, it can learn more appropriate decisions even in unclear situations. We introduce the Brain-AI Closed-Loop System (BACLoS), a wireless interaction platform that enables human brain wave analysis and transfers results to AI to verify and enhance AI decision-making. We developed a wireless earbud-like electroencephalography (EEG) measurement device, combined with tattoo-like electrodes and connectors, which enables continuous recording of high-quality EEG signals, especially the error-related potential (ErrP). The sensor measures the ErrP signals, which reflects the human cognitive consequences of an unpredicted machine response. The AI corrects or reinforces decisions depending on the presence or absence of the ErrP signals, which is determined by deep learning classification of the received EEG data. We demonstrate the BACLoS for AI-based machines, including autonomous driving vehicles, maze solvers, and assistant interfaces.

AB Producing a robotic system that can operate autonomously on other planets is a challenging task: The robot must be extremely self-reliant; it must be able to operate on a limited power budget; and it must be able to traverse a wide range of rugged terrain features. This article describes an integrated software system that combines perception, planning, real-time control, and task-level control to navigate autonomously the Ambler a six-legged revel: The overall approach to walking is highly deliberative: Where actions are goal-directed, steps are planned out in detail using explicit models of the terrain and the vehicle, and moves are checked for safety prior to execution. We believe that this approach is well-suited to meeting the challenges of reliability, efficiency, and terrainability faced by autonomous planetary revers. The Ambler system has been extensively rested, both indoors and outdoors, and the results confirm our expectations regarding the degree of system capability and performance afforded by our approach.

AB How to operate an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) safely and efficiently in an interactive environment is challenging. A large amount of research has been devoted to improve the intelligence of a UAV while performing a mission, where finding an optimal maneuver decision-making policy of the UAV has become one of the key issues when we attempt to enable the UAV autonomy. In this paper, we propose a maneuver decision-making algorithm based on deep reinforcement learning, which generates efficient maneuvers for a UAV agent to execute the airdrop mission autonomously in an interactive environment. Particularly, the training set of the learning algorithm by the Prioritized Experience Replay is constructed, that can accelerate the convergence speed of decision network training in the algorithm. It is shown that a desirable and effective maneuver decision-making policy can be found by extensive experimental results.

AB Automated Guided Vehicle (AGV) indoor autonomous cargo handling and commodity transportation are inseparable from AGV autonomous navigation, and positioning and navigation in an unknown environment are the keys of AGV technology. In this paper, the extended Kalman filter algorithm is used to match the sensor observations with the existing features in the map to determine the accurate positioning of the AGV. This paper proposes an improved joint compatibility branch and bound (JCBB) method to divide the data and then randomly extract part of the data in the divided data set, thereby reducing the data association space; then, the JCBB algorithm is used to perform data association and finally merge the associated data. This method can solve the problem of the increased computational complexity of JCBB when the amount of data to be matched is large to achieve the effect of increasing the correlation speed and not reducing the accuracy rate, thereby ensuring the real-time positioning of the AGV.

AB The cyber-enabled ship (C-ES) is either an autonomous or a remotely controlled vessel which relies on interconnected cyber physical-systems for its operations. Such systems are not well protected against cyberattacks. Considering the criticality of the functions that such systems provide, it is important to address their security challenges, thereby ensuring the ship's safe voyage. In this article, we leverage the maritime architectural framework reference architecture to analyze and describe the environment of the C-ES. We then apply the Secure Tropos methodology to systematically elicit the security requirements of the three most vulnerable cyber-physical systems (CPSs) onboard a C-ES, namely the automatic identification system (AIS), the electronic chart display information system, and the global maritime distress and safety system. The outcome is a set of cyber-security requirements for the C-ES ecosystem in general and these systems in particular.

AB Capacitive power transfer (CPT) has attracted attention for on-road electric vehicles, autonomous underwater vehicles, and electric ships charging applications. High power transfer capability and high efficiency are the main requirements of a CPT system. This paper proposes three possible solutions to achieve maximum efficiency, maximum power, or conjugate-matching. Each solution expresses the available load power and the efficiency of the CPT system as functions of capacitive coupling parameters and derives the required admittance of the load and the source. The experimental results demonstrated that the available power and the efficiency decrease by the increasing of the frequency from 300 kHz to 1 MHz and the separation distance change from 100 to 300 mm. The maximum efficiency solution gives 83% at 300 kHz and a distance of 100 mm, while the maximum power solution gives the maximum normalized power of 0.994 at the same frequency and distance. The CPT system can provide a good solution to charge electric ships and underwater vehicles over a wide separation distance and low-frequency ranges.

AB This paper develops a unifying framework to unveil the physical car-following (CF) behaviors of automated vehicles (AVs) under different control paradigms and parameter settings. The proposed framework adopts the flexible asymmetric behavior (AB) model to reveal the control mechanisms and their manifestation in the physical CF behavior, particularly their response to traffic disturbances. A mapping relationship between the AB model parameters and control parameters is then obtained to understand the range of CF behavior possible. Finally, a predictive modeling approach based on a logistic classifier coupled with a convoluted Multivariate Gaussian Process (MGP) is designed to predict the CF behavior of an AV. Analysis of two well-known controllers, linear state-feedback and Model Predictive Control (MPC), show how the proposed framework can uncover the CF mechanisms and provide insights into traffic-level disturbance evolution. The proposed analysis framework remains scalable and can be applied to a variety of controllers. Ultimately, it can guide AV control design that is not myopic, but considers trafficlevel performance.

AB Interest in aerial image analysis has increased owing to recent developments in and availability of aerial imaging technologies, like unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), as well as a growing need for autonomous surveillance systems. Variant illumination, intensity noise, and different viewpoints are among the main challenges to overcome in order to determine changes in aerial images. In this paper, we present a robust method for change detection in aerial images. To accomplish this, the method extracts three-dimensional (3D) features for segmentation of objects above a defined reference surface at each instant. The acquired 3D feature maps, with two measurements, are then used to determine changes in a scene over time. In addition, the important parameters that affect measurement, such as the camera's sampling rate, image resolution, the height of the drone, and the pixel's height information, are investigated through a mathematical model. To exhibit its applicability, the proposed method has been evaluated on aerial images of various real-world locations and the results are promising. The performance indicates the robustness of the method in addressing the problems of conventional change detection methods, such as intensity differences and shadows.

AB Rich image information is one of the important means through which unmanned surface vehicles effectively and reliably identify targets during autonomous navigation. However, the adaptability of traditional artificial design feature methods in target representation and differentiation remains limited due to the diversity of ship target types, different scales, and complex and dynamic outdoor scenes. This study proposed a ship target recognition method based on single shot multibox detector (SSD) deep learning. First, training and test sample sets were constructed by acquiring and creating a ship's target image and background image under different types and scenes in an actual river environment. Subsequently, the sample set was used to train and optimize the SSD depth model to achieve adaptive extraction and recognition of target features. Lastly, ship identification experiments with different background environments and foreground targets were performed to test the effectiveness of the proposed method. The support vector machine method based on artificial feature extraction was used for the comparative experiments. Experiment results showed that the SSD-based deep learning method achieved better results than the artificial design feature method in terms of recall and precision rates.

AB In this paper, a tracking algorithm for autonomous navigation of automated guided vehicles (AGVs) is presented. The developed navigation algorithm is an interacting multiple-model (IMM) algorithm used to detect other AGVs using fused information from multiple sensors. In order to detect other AGVs, two kinematic models were derived: A constant-velocity model for linear motion, and a constant-speed turn model for curvilinear motion. In the constant-speed turn model, a nonlinear information filter (IF) is used in place of the extended Kalman filter (KF). Being equivalent to the KF algebraically, the IF is extended to N-sensor distributed dynamic systems. The model-matched filter used in multi-sensor environments takes the form of a federated nonlinear IF. In multi-sensor environments, the information-based filter is easier to decentralize, initialize, and fuse than a KF-based filter. In this paper, the structural features and information-sharing principle of the federated IF are discussed. The performance of the suggested algorithm using a Monte Carlo simulation is evaluated under the three navigation patterns. Copyright (C) 2006 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB This paper considers a refinement problem for the flight altitude, speed, and flight-path angle of an aircraft during aerodynamic deceleration in the atmosphere of Mars using inaccurate discrete g-load measurements. For solving this problem, several suboptimal discrete nonlinear filters of higher accuracy than the extended Kalman filter based on the Taylor linearization procedure with static (Gaussian) linearization of the nonlinearities are applied and compared with each other. The equations of these filters are derived, the Gaussian moments of their structural functions are calculated, and the resulting accuracy of these filters is analyzed in statistical terms.

AB In realm of researches involved in autonomous tractor-trailer robot, novel purpose of this applied research has been dedicated to motion energy perspective of tracked locomotion system of the robot. Hence, motion energy indicators including motion energy consumption, motion energy dissipation, and drawbar pull energy of the robot were ascertained as affected by operational variables of robot forward speed (0.17, 0.33 and 0.5 m/s) and payload weight (1, 2, 3, 4 and 5 kN). Analytical results clarified that meaningful contribution of robot forward speed to the motion energy indicators was marginal (<10-35 times) in comparison with that of payload weight. Modeling results described that combinatorial effect of robot forward speed and payload weight on the motion energy indicators was synergetic. This disclosed linear increasing dependency of motion energy consumption (154.02-831.38 J/m2), motion energy dissipation (20.60-165.70 J/m2), and drawbar pull energy (135.96-800.4 J/m2) on concurrent proliferation of robot forward speed and payload weight. The aforementioned amplitudes divulge that 7.20-22.01% of motion energy consumption was dissipated by tracked locomotion system. Overall, these results are profitable for energy-efficient design and performance optimization of tractor-trailer robot with tracked locomotion system in order to proliferate autonomous transportation capacity of payloads, especially for indoor and outdoor shipping and warehouse of factories and industrial environments.

AB Accurate and robust ego-motion estimation is critical for aiding autonomous vehicle localization in environments devoid of map landmarks or accurate GNSS measurements. RADAR measurements provide unique capabilities for ego-motion estimation while also posing unique challenges. This paper presents the novel real-time RADAR-based ego-motion estimation algorithm, RADARODO (RADAR Odometry). RADARODO is differentiated from similar techniques by two novel attributes. First, it decouples sensor translational and rotational motion by estimating them from Doppler and spatial data, respectively. Secondly, it directly analyzes RADAR images to estimate rotational motion via correspondence-free non-linear optimization. Unlike other methods, RADARODO estimates ego-motion along with its predicted uncertainty from a single RADAR sensor without depending on a lever-arm offset or the zero side-slip assumption. The real-world results demonstrate accurate ego-motion estimates that are particularly suited for integration within a "tightly-coupled" sensor fusion framework.

AB The conventional sense-and-avoid collision avoidance mode of UAV (unmaned aerial vehicle) lacks applicability and timeliness in a multi-threat environment. In this paper, a new efficient collision avoidance approach for uncertain threat environments derived from the idea of autonomous mental development is proposed. The proposed collision avoidance pattern consists of a sensory layer, a logic layer and a development layer. The threat information is sensed using the sensory layer, and the path planning approach in the logical layer is applied to the output configuration of UAV. In the development phase, the developmental networks approach is used for online learning, training and updating the logical layer so as to form the sense-action mapping, which is stored as the "basic experience" for UAV executing the avoidance manoeuvre. In the implementation phase, the command is executed by matching the sensing information and action base. The simulation results show that the proposed approach has better timeliness compared to the conventional approaches.

AB A novel method of underwater object detection based on gravity gradient is presented, which can be used on autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) to detect abnormal objects underwater. Gravity gradient anomalies of partial area, which are caused by the object, can be measured by a gravity gradiometer on an AUV. Then, anomalies can be inversed with a gravity gradient inversion algorithm, so the mass and barycenter of an object can be estimated. Simulation results show that approximate information of an object can be provided by the proposed method.

Each agent plans its actions without knowing the destinations of the others and the positions of those agents lying outside its sensing neighborhood. The stability properties of the closed loop system are checked via Lyapunov stability techniques for nonsmooth systems. The collision avoidance and global convergence properties are verified through simulations.

AB In order to solve the problem of power transmission efficiency reduction resulting from misalignment in the Wireless Power Transfer (WPT) system for Autonomous Underwater Vehicle (AUVs), a novel coupling structure with strong tolerance to misalignment is proposed. A solenoid coil is selected as the transmitting coil, and the receiving coil is composed of dual combined planar coils. The WPT system can still maintain stable output under uncertain axial misalignments for AUVs. The magnetic field distribution of the proposed magnetic coupling structure is analyzed theoretically, and the distance between the coils in the dual combined planar receiving coil is optimized. The theoretical analysis shows that the proposed solenoid-dual combined planar coils coupling structure can effectively maintain a stable mutual inductance between the transmitting coil and receiving coil under different axial misalignments compared with solenoid-unipolar planar coil coupling structure. An S-S resonant compensated WPT experimental prototype is built to verify the output characteristics of the proposed magnetic coupling structure. Compared to the magnetic coupler with the unipolar planar coil, it is validated by experiment that the proposed magnetic coupler substantially enhances the stability of power transmission efficiency and output power when axial misalignment occurs. The power transmission efficiency decreases by 6.74% when axial misalignment increases from 0 to 40 mm in saltwater. Meanwhile, the variation of output power is less than 4.15%.

ID ODOMETRY
AB The navigation and localization of Autonomous Underwater Vehicle (AUV) face many challenges. In surface missions, AUV typically relies only on Global Positioning System (GPS) to perform navigation. However, the GPS data output frequency is low, usually only 1 Hz. Meanwhile, the navigation system is susceptible to interference from GPS measurement outliers. For underwater missions, without the assistance of additional underwater absolute positioning measurements, the unknown errors introduced by the navigation system modeling process and state estimation process will affect the navigation accuracy. Therefore, in this paper, we propose an integrated navigation method for small-sized AUV in shallow-sea applications. Firstly, a robust GPS/Attitude and Heading Reference System (AHRS)/Doppler Velocity Log (DVL) navigation method for surface missions is proposed to maintain high-frequency output and robustness. Secondly, a Multiple Model (MM) integrated navigation method is proposed for AUV underwater missions. An AHRS/DVL/NavNet sub-model is proposed to perform measurement correction to correct the unknown errors. At the same time, an adaptive AHRS/DVL sub-model based on Variational Bayesian (VB) is presented to estimate the time-varying measurement noise covariance to improve the state estimation accuracy without the extra external observations. Two sub-models run parallel based on the Interacting Multiple Model (IMM). The effectiveness of the proposed integrated navigation method is verified by actual sea trial data from Sailfish 210 AUV.

AB Car ownership has been the object of interest in various research areas. Studies on the topic focus especially on the influence of factors such as environment, life, family events, use, and availability, usually restricted to a given city or region. This paper focuses on recent studies that identified enablers, barriers, and trends related to car ownership in the automotive sector. We use an exploratory-qualitative approach based on systematic mapping of the literature to select papers published between 2019 and March 2021 on the Scopus database. As a result, we first classified the factors that act as enablers or barriers to the acquisition and maintenance of cars. These factors were divided into the following six groups: personal, cultural, political, economic, technological, and environmental. Next, we identified car-ownership-related trends for the automotive sector: purchase replaced by effective use; restrictions on car ownership; autonomous driving; sustainable mobility; new mobility models; customized customer service; real-time integrated modal communication, systematic global traffic, and integrated urban planning. We consider our findings to be relevant contributions to the industry in relation to establishing strategies and public administrators acting in the transportation planning field.

AB Path-tracking and lane-keeping efficiency of driverless cars remain critical characteristics of the efficient and safe deployment of such vehicles in future intelligent transportation systems. This study introduces a robust type-3 (T3) fuzzy controller implementation for the path-tracking task of driverless cars during critical driving conditions and subject to exogenous disturbances. Unlike many existing control paradigms, the proposed scheme is independent of the parameter information and assumes the system dynamics are unknown and non-linear. Control inputs are constructed to improve robustness by eliminating the error bounds while ensuring stability by leveraging the Lyapunov stability theorem and Barbalat's lemma. Also, a predicate scheme based on non-linear predictive control technique is introduced to enhance the lateral displacement. Based on the obtained results, the schemed controller exhibits competitive effectiveness in path-tracking tasks, and strong efficiency under various road conditions, parametric uncertainties, and unknown disturbances.

ID SCHEDULABILITY ANALYSIS
AB In-vehicle network (IVN) technologies are changing corresponding to the rapidly increasing demand in autonomous driving and vehicle electrification. Due to the increase in real-time data generated from the control modules and sensors, controller area networks (CANs) have a heavier burden to satisfy the strict delay bounds. Therefore, CAN with flexible data rate (CAN-FD) and Automotive Ethernet (AE) have drawn attention as promising IVNs. This paper provides an overview of the IVN transmission protocols, time delay characteristics, and analysis methods. Most of the existing IVN timing analysis studies assume the worst case and consider only the occurrence of periodic or aperiodic messages, however for more accurate control, the average time delay needs to be accurately estimated. In this paper, CAN, CAN-FD, and AE analytical models based on queueing analysis are proposed to estimate the average response time for mixed traffic. For CAN and CAN-FD systems, the network synchronization statuses are considered and AE with 1-level preemption to support deterministic delays is analyzed. The improved accuracy of the newly derived analytical models is verified based on comparison with existing CAN queueing models through simulation experiments.

AB Twenty-two years after the advent of the first-generation vehicular network, that is, dedicated short-range communications (DSRC) standard/ IEEE 802.11p, the vehicular technology market has become very competitive with a new player, Cellular Vehicle-to-Everything (C-V2X). Currently, C-V2X technology likely dominates the race because of the big advantages of comprehensive coverage and high throughput/reliability. Meanwhile, DSRC-based technologies are struggling to survive and rebound with many hopes betting on success of the second-generation standard, IEEE P802.11bd. While the standards battle to attract automotive makers and dominate the commercial market landing, the research community has started thinking about the shape of the next-generation vehicular networks. This article details the state-of-the-art progress of vehicular networks, particularly the cellular V2X-related technologies in specific use cases, compared to the features of the current generation. Through the typical examples, we also highlight why 5G is inadequate to provide the best connectivity for the vehicular applications and then 6G technologies can fill up the vacancy.

AB In this paper, we apply a Control Lyapunov Function methodology to design two families of cruise controllers for the two-dimensional movement of autonomous vehicles on lane-free roads using the bicycle kinematic model. The control Lyapunov functions are based on measures of the energy of the system with the kinetic energy expressed in ways similar to Newtonian or relativistic mechanics. The derived feedback laws (cruise controllers) are decentralized, as each vehicle determines its control input based on its own speed and on the relative speeds and distances from adjacent vehicles and from the boundary of the road. Moreover, the corresponding macroscopic models are derived, obtaining fluid-like models that consist of a conservation equation and a momentum equation with pressure and viscous terms. Finally, we show that, by selecting appropriately the parameters of the feedback laws, we can determine the physical properties of the "traffic fluid ", i.e. we get free hand to create an artificial fluid that approximates the emerging traffic flow.

AB One application for autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) is detecting and classifying hazardous objects on the seabed. An acoustic approach to this problem has been studied in which an acoustic source insonifies seabed target while receiving AUVs with passive sensing payloads discriminate targets based on features of the three dimensional scattered fields. The OASES-SCATT simulator was used to study how scattering data collected by mobile receivers around targets insonified by mobile sources might be used for sphere and cylinder target characterization in terms of shape, composition, and size. The impact of target geometry on these multistatic scattering fields is explored, and a discrimination approach developed in which the source and receiver circle the target with the same radial speed. The frequency components of the multistatic scattering data at different bistatic angles are used to form models for target characteristics. Data are then classified using these models. Classification accuracies were greater than 98% for shape and composition. Regression for target volume showed potential, with 90% chance of errors less than 15%. The significance of this approach is to make classification using low-cost vehicles plausible from scattering amplitudes and the relative angles between the target, source, and receiver vehicles.

AB The ability of multiple manned and unmanned aircraft systems to cooperatively engage and disable an aerial threat plays a decisive role in modern warfare scenarios. In this paper, we apply key methods to enable the so-called cooperative threat engagement capability among multiple networked agents, e.g., a swarm of drones, with combat and communication capabilities. In particular, this research combines AI-based decision-making and control techniques for a swarm of loyal wingman drones to coordinate efficient defense actions in a cooperative and autonomous manner. We apply these concepts in a defense scenario that is modeled to analyze the loyal wingman concept, which we consider an interesting testbed for cooperative decision-making and low-level control techniques. The investigated methods were implemented in a realistic 3D UAV simulator for demonstration and evaluation.

AB Self-sensing road pavements can autonomously monitor their stress/strain and damage states without the need for embedded sensors. This kind of multifunctional pavements could be used for the realisation of autonomous structural health monitoring (SHM) systems. Moreover, it would permit to collect important traffic data for traffic-monitoring analysis and the development of Vehicle to Infrastructure Communication (V2I) tools, hence contributing to the digitalisation of the transport sector. The sensing mechanism is based on the piezoresistive effect, consisting of a change in the electrical response of the road material when subjected to stress/strain or damage. This paper aims to investigate the piezoresistive behavior of conductive asphalt mixtures with electric arc furnace slag (EAFS) and graphene nanoplatelets (GNPs) for self-sensing application. The results showed that asphalt mixtures with EAFS as fine aggregate and 7 wt% of GNPs exhibited excellent self-sensing properties for both traffic monitoring and SHM systems.

AB In this article, we propose a novel reinforcement learning (RL) approach specialized for autonomous boats: sample-efficient probabilistic model predictive control (SPMPC), to iteratively learn control policies of boats in real ocean environments without human prior knowledge. SPMPC addresses difficulties arising from large uncertainties in this challenging application and the need for rapid adaptation to dynamic environmental conditions, and the extremely high cost of exploring and sampling with a real vessel. SPMPC combines a Gaussian process model and model predictive control under a model-based RL framework to iteratively model and quickly respond to uncertain ocean environments while maintaining sample efficiency. A SPMPC system is developed with features including quadrant-based action search rule, bias compensation, and parallel computing that contribute to better control capabilities. It successfully learns to control a full-sized single-engine boat equipped with sensors measuring GPS position, speed, direction, and wind, in a real-world position holding task without models from human demonstration.

AB This commentary responds to Kimberley Peters and Philip Steinberg's new provocation, 'The ocean in excess: Towards a more-than-wet ontology', and suggests a further contribution can be made by consideration of bodies that are other than human, and of worlds beyond our own. The Southern Ocean and its increasingly autonomous underwater drone intelligences are examined for their potential to flex the many multiplicities and possibilities that emerge from Peters and Steinberg's arguments, and to reveal potentially destructive processes within a very much more-than-wet ocean. Thinly veiled intentions to export such actions beyond our own planet are also brought to bear on this discussion. Here, the imagined ocean reveals planetary and extra-planetary excesses often masked from human experience and oversight, and signals the scale of radical transformation required to make sense of both our own ocean-world and an increasingly fluid universe of multiple worlds.

AB In recent years, studying how drivers allocate their attention while driving is critical in achieving human-like cognitive ability for autonomous vehicles. And it has been an active topic in the community of human-machine augmented intelligence for self-driving. However, existing state-of-the-art methods for driver attention prediction are mainly built upon convolutional neural network (CNN) with local receptive field which has a limitation to capture the long-range dependencies. In this work, we propose a novel Attention prediction method based on CNN and Transformer which is termed as ACT-Net. In particular, CNN and Transformer are combined as a block which is further stacked to form the deep model. Through this design, both local and long-range dependencies are captured that both are crucial for driver attention prediction. Exhaustive comparison experiments over other state-of-the-art techniques conducted on widely used dataset of BDD-A and private collected data on BDD-X validate the effectiveness of the proposed ACT-Net.

DE Multi-modal Fusion; Multi-scale; Channel attention; Autonomous driving;

AB Fusion object detection using camera and LiDAR information in autonomous driving is still a challenging task, the difference between sensor data increases the difficulty of data fusion. To address this issue, we propose a multi-scale selective kernel fusion(MSSKF) method and demonstrate its practical utility by using LiDAR-camera fusion in object detection network. Specifically, a multi-scale feature fusion module that uses multi-scale convolution to separate the feature expression of multi-modal information and calculates the weight of each modal feature channel is proposed. We use the idea of multi-scale convolution and selection kernel to complete multi-modal fusion in object detection, which is conducive to solving the problem that the image and point cloud fusion are difficult to match due to the difference in data structure, and the complementarity of multi-modal information has been fully utilized. To verify the effectiveness of MSSKF, experiments on the KITTI object detection benchmark dataset are conducted. It has been observed that the proposed method achieves more accurate detection for pedestrians and vehicles, with a 1.6% gain in AP(50) compared to the values of the original fusion method, reaching a score of 90.1%, and the mAP reached 60.9%. Experiments show that the proposed method introduces a new optimization idea for multi-modal fusion in the field of autonomous driving object detection, and the fusion detection efficiency is at over 12 fps on a single GPU.

AB The current research of the global chassis control problem for the full drive-by-wire vehicle focuses on the control allocation (CA) of the four-wheel-distributed traction/braking/steering systems. However, the path following performance and the handling stability of the vehicle can be enhanced a step further by automatically adjusting the vehicle speed to the optimal value. The optimal solution for the combined longitudinal and lateral motion control (MC) problem is given. First, a new variable step-size spatial transformation method is proposed and utilized in the prediction model to derive the dynamics of the vehicle with respect to the road, such that the tracking errors can be explicitly obtained over the prediction horizon at varying speeds. Second, a nonlinear model predictive control (NMPC) algorithm is introduced to handle the nonlinear coupling between any two directions of the vehicular planar motion and computes the sequence of the optimal motion states for following the desired path. Third, a hierarchical control structure is proposed to separate the motion controller into a NMPC based path planner and a terminal sliding mode control (TSMC) based path follower. As revealed through off-line simulations, the hierarchical methodology brings nearly 1700% improvement in computational efficiency without loss of control performance. Finally, the control algorithm is verified through a hardware in-the-loop simulation system. Double-lane-change (DLC) test results show that by using the optimal predictive controller, the root-mean-square (RMS) values of the lateral deviations and the orientation errors can be reduced by 41% and 30%, respectively, comparing to those by the optimal preview acceleration (OPA) driver model with the non-preview speed-tracking method. Additionally, the average vehicle speed is increased by 0.26 km/h with the peak sideslip angle suppressed to 1.9A degrees. This research proposes a novel motion controller, which provides the full drive-by-wire vehicle with better lane-keeping and collision-avoidance capabilities during autonomous driving.

AB Recent advancements in environmental perception for autonomous vehicles have been driven by deep learning-based approaches. However, effective traffic target detection in complex environments remains a challenging task. This paper presents a novel dual-modal instance segmentation deep neural network (DM-ISDNN) by merging camera and LIDAR data, which can be used to deal with the problem of target detection in complex environments efficiently based on multi-sensor data fusion. Due to the sparseness of the LIDAR point cloud data, we propose a weight assignment function that assigns different weight coefficients to different feature pyramid convolutional layers for the LIDAR sub-network. We compare and analyze the adaptations of early-, middle-, and late-stage fusion architectures in depth. By comprehensively considering the detection accuracy and detection speed, the middle-stage fusion architecture with a weight assignment mechanism, with the best performance, is selected. This work has great significance for exploring the best feature fusion scheme of a multi-modal neural network. In addition, we apply a mask distribution function to improve the quality of the predicted mask. A dual-modal traffic object instance segmentation dataset is established using a 7481 camera and LIDAR data pairs from the KITTI dataset, with 79,118 manually annotated instance masks. To the best of our knowledge, there is no existing instance annotation for the KITTI dataset with such quality and volume. A novel dual-modal dataset, composed of 14,652 camera and LIDAR data pairs, is collected using our own developed autonomous vehicle under different environmental conditions in real driving scenarios, for which a total of 62,579 instance masks are obtained using semi-automatic annotation method. This dataset can be used to validate the detection performance under complex environmental conditions of instance segmentation networks. Experimental results on the dual-modal KITTI Benchmark demonstrate that DM-ISDNN using middle-stage data fusion and the weight assignment mechanism has better detection performance than single- and dual-modal networks with other data fusion strategies, which validates the robustness and effectiveness of the proposed method. Meanwhile, compared to the state-of-the-art instance segmentation networks, our method shows much better detection performance, in terms of AP and F1 score, on the dual-modal dataset collected under complex environmental conditions, which further validates the superiority of our method.

TI An Efficient Self-Evolution Method of Autonomous Driving for Any Given
   Algorithm
SO IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON INTELLIGENT TRANSPORTATION SYSTEMS

DT Article; Early Access
DE Autonomous driving; reinforcement learning; policy improvement
AB Autonomous vehicles are expected to achieve self-evolution in the real-world environment to gradually cover more complex and changing scenarios. Reinforcement learning focuses on how agents act in the environment to maximize the cumulative reward, with a great potential to achieve self-evolution ability. However, most of reinforcement learning algorithms suffer from a low sample efficiency, which greatly limits their application in autonomous driving. This paper presents an efficient self-evolution method for any given algorithm based on the combination of Soft Actor Critic (SAC) and Behavioral Cloning(BC). First, the states of the sample trajectory in the replay buffer are separated and input into the given algorithm (algorithm with fundamental performance) to get the output label of actions such that the SAC algorithm can be guided using BC to achieve fast iteration in the direction of optimization with existing basic performance. Then, the value iteration algorithm is combined to achieve the proportion allocation of mixed gradient feedback, in order to trade off exploitation and exploration. In addition, the proposed methodology is evaluated in simulation environment taking automated speed control as an example. Experiment results show that compared with SAC algorithm, the proposed method can realize more than three times of convergence efficiency improvement, while without destroying the exploration enhancement advantage of reinforcement learning algorithm, that is, the performance is improved by 20% compared with the given algorithm (Intelligent Driver Model, IDM). The proposed method can easily extended to improve any given model no matter it is model-based or learning-based algorithm.

AB Efficient urban emergency response is vital for saving lives and property after disasters. However, urban emergency response is challenging because it involves many demands, with a very tight time for making decisions, and is frequently threatened by the disruption of road networks and infrastructures. Taking these challenges into consideration, this article proposes a dynamic truck-UAV (DTU) collaboration strategy to realize efficient and resilient urban emergency response. Specifically, a DTU collaboration strategy is first proposed based on the characteristics of urban emergency management. Then, an integrated truck-UAV collaborative scheduling model is developed and indicated to be an NP-hard problem. Then, a tabu search-based integrated (TSI) scheduling algorithm is developed, with several tailored local search operators and a recursion-based evaluation (RE) algorithm. Finally, comprehensive experiments are conducted to demonstrate the superiority of our proposed strategy over existing truck-UAV collaboration strategies and verify the performance of our proposed solution algorithm.

AB Parallel parking a car is a difficult task and may be frustrating and stressful for the driver, while commonly causes traffic jam. One way to mitigate such negative effects is to provide vehicles with self-driving capabilities. As a cornerstone of a mobile robot's ability to move autonomously stands trajectory planning, which despite many works in the literature, is still considered an open problem especially with regards to nonholonomic vehicles such as car-like robots. Based on this scenario, this work presents a trajectory planning algorithm to parallel park car-like mobile robots based on polynomial parametrization and genetic algorithm optimization. The aim is to define a law of motion to lead the vehicle from an initial pose near a parking space to a final pose within the latter in a smooth way, with no interruption and avoiding any obstacles in the way. Simulation results validate the feasibility of the proposed algorithm which lays the foundation to broader studies.

AB SLAM (Simultaneous Localization And Mapping) plays a vital role in navigation tasks of AUV (Autonomous Underwater Vehicle). However, due to a vast amount of image sonar data and some acoustic equipment's inherent high latency, it is a considerable challenge to implement real-time underwater SLAM on a small AUV. This paper presents a filter based methodology for SLAM algorithms in underwater environments. First, a multi-beam forward looking sonar (MFLS) is utilized to extract environmental features. The acquired sonar image is then converted to sparse point cloud format through threshold segmentation and distance-constrained filtering to solve the calculation explosion issue caused by a large amount of original data. Second, based on the proposed method, the DVL, IMU, and sonar data are fused, the Rao-Blackwellized particle filter (RBPF)-based SLAM method is used to estimate AUV pose and generate an occupancy grid map. To verify the proposed algorithm, the underwater vehicle is equipped as an experimental platform to conduct field tasks in both the experimental pool and wild lake, respectively. Experiments illustrate that the proposed approach achieves better performance in both state estimation and suppressing divergence.

AB Unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) swarms have attracted great interests in numerous civil and military scenarios due to their flexible deployment and mobility. The increased network size poses a challenge for the network scalability. Clustering as an effective scheme, is able to provide efficient communication and network performance. In order to adapt to the change of network topology, the link subsistence probability is used to evaluate the mobility of UAVs. However, the UAVs usually perform tasks collaboratively, which leads to their movements are typically group-based. To this end, a coalition game theoretic framework is proposed to cluster UAVs into coalitions in a distributed autonomous manner, based on the group and the mobility information. The proposed game allows the UAVs with the same group, as much as possible, into one coalition under some constraints, such as cluster size and cluster diameter. To solve the game, each UAV makes its decision whether to switch based on the coalition value. Finally, some comparisons are provided to illustrate the efficiency of the proposed algorithm.

AB Sustainability is a key point in the design and management of mobility and traffic systems, which affects also the development of traffic control strategies for freeway networks. According to sustainability-related concepts, freeway traffic controllers should be devised not only for maximally exploiting the road capacity and decreasing vehicles travel delays, but also for reducing pollutant emissions, fuel consumptions, accidents, noise, and so on. This paper analyses the state of the art of freeway traffic control strategies characterised by sustainability-related objectives, in particular referred to traffic emissions and traffic safety, by providing a classification of the research papers in this area. The final part of the paper highlights the main research challenges for modelling and control techniques brought by the introduction of emerging information and communication technologies, that are becoming more and more widespread and are transforming the concept of vehicles in intelligent and connected agents, able to measure the traffic state and to implement specific traffic control policies.

AB Plug-in electric vehicles (PEVs) could provide valuable ancillary service for power systems with intermittent renewables. This paper proposes a charging model of a large amount of PEVs to mitigate the high-level wind power fluctuations in a distribution network so as to regulate system frequency. With the prerequisite that all PEV daily driving patterns are completely satisfied, the PEV charging power is economically allocated to counterbalance the wind generation intermittency. Afterward, a center-free control scheme based on the consensus algorithm is designed for PEVs to share the fluctuating wind generation in a fully distributed manner. The scheme is robust and flexible to practical PEV charging behaviors including arrival and departure time, initial and desired SOC, as well as the frequently changed departure time. Comprehensive simulations on a distribution system with coal and diesel generators, several wind farms and 2000 PEVs demonstrate that the proposed PEV charging scheme could effectively regulate the system frequency in the real time while the PEV users' charging requirements could be flexibly satisfied.

AB This paper presents a construction process of the three-dimensional roadway geometry map for an autonomous driving system. The presented process focuses on the post-processing and the three-dimensional roadway geometry modelling algorithms. The post-processing algorithm refines the raw Global Positioning System position data by combining the novel three-dimensional roadway geometry model which originated from the construction engineering of roadways and vehicle motion data from onboard sensors using a Rauch-Tung-Striebel smoother. The three-dimensional geometry modelling algorithm approximates the road geometry information described in three-dimensional point clouds into a mathematical curve model based on the B-spline. An adaptive curve refinement method using dominant points was applied to the road modelling algorithm. This dominant-point-based refinement method can reduce the number of knots and the number of control points of the B-spline road model while maintaining the desired accuracy of the roadway map. Also, since the dominant-point refinement method considers a road shape factor, such as the curvature and the arc length, for the road modelling, it is more efficient than the previous B-spline road modelling algorithms. The proposed map generation algorithm was verified and evaluated through experiments in various test conditions. The experimental results show that the presented construction process of the three-dimensional roadway geometry map can provide sufficient accuracy, reliability and efficiency for applications of autonomous driving systems in comparison with those of other roadway map construction processes.

AB The definition of the desired functions and the design of an ultimate versatile personal robot is an ongoing debate. Meanwhile, however, precursors of this yet to evolve species are well on their way to become commercial products. Cleaning robots for public environments as well as for private households seem to be able to provide the breakthrough which the designers of non-industrial robot systems have long awaited.
   This survey describes a selection of 30 different cleaning robots, with the first developments reaching back more than 15 years. With a few exceptions we have focused on floor cleaning, in particular indoor floor cleaning. We describe a variety of scrubbing and vacuuming robots which were developed for this task. The described systems range from heavy, large, and expensive industrial cleaning vehicles to small-size, light-weight, low-cost household devices. The survey does not include, however, systems for cleaning facades of buildings, or windows, or production tools.
   Although not all of the 30 cleaning robots abovementioned have yet reached the state of commercial products, their number alone certainly reflects the expectations regarding the economic value associated with the automation of cleaning tasks. In Europe only the estimates for the market for cleaning services range up to the order of US$ 100 billion per year. It is therefore not surprising that the cleaning industry and the manufacturers of cleaning devices are rather enthusiastic with respect to the automation of cleaning tasks using (semi-)autonomous mobile robot systems.

AB Localization is a critical capability for robots, drones, and autonomous vehicles operating in a wide range of environments. One of the critical considerations for designing, training, or calibrating visual localization systems is the coverage of the visual sensors equipped on the platforms. In an aerial context for example, the altitude of the platform and camera field of view plays a critical role in how much of the environment a downward facing camera can perceive at any one time. Furthermore, in other applications, such as on roads or in indoor environments, additional factors, such as camera resolution and sensor placement altitude can also affect this coverage. The sensor coverage and the subsequent processing of its data also have significant computational implications. In this letter, we present for the first time a set of methods for automatically determining the tradeoff between coverage and visual localization performance, enabling the identification of the minimum visual sensor coverage required to obtain optimal localization performance with minimal compute. We develop a localization performance indicator based on the overlapping coefficient, and demonstrate its predictive power for localization performance with a certain sensor coverage. We evaluate our method on several challenging real-world datasets from aerial and ground-based domains, and demonstrate that our method is able to automatically optimize for coverage using a small amount of calibration data. We hope these results will assist in the design of localization systems for future autonomous robot, vehicle, and flying systems.

AB The SDRE (State-Dependent Riccati Equation) is a technique recently proposed as a nonlinear control method. Despite the benefits due to its flexibility, the SDRE places high demand on the computational load of real-time applications, which is one of its most significant drawbacks. This paper discusses a new nonlinear feedback controller for autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs), which eventually converges to a conventional SDRE-based optimal controller. The proposed controller is derived by direct forward integration of an SDRE. This enables fast computation, and so is applicable to real-time applications. For a state-dependent system, the proposed controller may be an alternative candidate to a conventional SDRE-based optimal controller if the system is slow-varying to different states. To cope with fast-varying systems, we introduced a deviation index, which indicates the extent of deviation of the proposed controller from the solution of a conventional SDRE-based one. Whenever the index exceeds a designated bound, the controller is initialized to the conventional SDRE optimal value. Using the deviation index, a designer can achieve a compromise between computation time and optimality. We applied the proposed controller to a numerical model of an AUV called ODIN (Choi et al., 1995), a well-known nonlinear, relatively higher order, and slow-varying system. The global position/attitude regulation, tracking problems, and fault tolerance properties were examined in the simulation to show the effectiveness of the proposed controller.

AB Underwater acoustic communication is a key point for performance improvement in an autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) swarm. The communication process is essential for improving the AUVs localization accuracy for navigation and is a convenient way for sharing information among the AUVs in a network. The objective of this work, which was developed in the COMET and NEMOSENS projects, is to address the communication process required in a mobile underwater wireless network, with a focus on the proposal of an adaptive physical layer methodology. We discuss about the employed channel access method, the frame structure, and we propose the usage of an adaptive guard interval in order to ameliorate the network usage rate. We explain the physical layer aspect of the communication: the data processing at the transmitter and receiver side. In addition to that, we propose the usage of smart communications among AUVs. We design a method for adapting some physical layer parameters. The proposed approach relies only on the knowledge of the transmission geometry, and it optimizes the number of subcarriers and the cyclic-prefix length of the Orthogonal Frequency-Division Multiplexing (OFDM) system. The obtained results show a performance improvement in terms of bit-error rate when compared with the case of random parameters selection. These results corroborate the benefits of our adaptive parameters approach.

AB In this paper, adaptive noise estimation is used along with a previously proposed Huber-based robust algorithm for cooperative localisation of Autonomous Underwater Vehicles (AUVs). The Huber-based robust cooperative localisation algorithm named Huber-based Iterative Divided Difference Filtering (HIDDF), proposed in our previous work, effectively achieved a robust result against abnormal measurement noise, enhanced the stability of the filtering algorithm and improved the performance of cooperative localisation state estimation. However, its performance could be significantly further improved if it could estimate the system's noise statistical properties online in real time and then adaptively adjust the filtering gain matrix accordingly. In this paper, a novel adaptive noise estimation algorithm is proposed based on a covariance matching method. The proposed algorithm is suitable for adaptively estimating Gaussian and non-Gaussian measurement as well as process noise. The efficacy of the proposed algorithm has been verified through simulation results. In order to further verify the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm in practical systems, lake tests were conducted. Then, based on offline test data, the performance of the cooperative positioning algorithm under dual-pilot and single-pilot schemes was simulated. The advantages and feasibility of the algorithm are analysed and compared through performance comparison. Cooperative localisation accuracy of the previously proposed Huber-based robust algorithm has been enhanced significantly when used with the proposed adaptive noise estimation algorithm.

AB Autonomous motion planning is challenging in multi-obstacle environments due to nonconvex collision avoidance constraints. Directly applying numerical solvers to these nonconvex formulations fails to exploit the constraint structures, resulting in excessive computation time. In this letter, we present an accelerated collision-free motion planner, namely regularized dual alternating direction method of multipliers (RDADMM or RDA for short), for the model predictive control (MPC) based motion planning problem. The proposed RDA addresses nonconvex motion planning via solving a smooth biconvex reformulation via duality and allows the collision avoidance constraints to be computed in parallel for each obstacle to reduce computation time significantly. We validate the performance of the RDA planner through path-tracking experiments with car-like robots in both simulation and real-world settings. Experimental results show that the proposed method generates smooth collision-free trajectories with less computation time compared with other benchmarks and performs robustly in cluttered environments.

The source of uncertainty in this study is identified as hydrodynamic coefficients, which are prone to errors due to the challenges involved in obtaining accurate values. The proposed optimization method utilizes a complex nonlinear ship model provided by Maneuver Modelling Group (MMG) as the reference for the ship motion model. The optimization process is divided into two stages: a blind search followed by bisection optimization, to obtain a robust optimal controller. To demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach, system response analysis and practical tests were performed on Step, M-Turn, and Doublet maneuvers. The results show that the controller parameters obtained from the proposed optimization method are capable of achieving high success rates in controlling a system with uncertain parameters.

AB It can he difficult to autonomously produce driver behavior so that it appears natural to other traffic participants. Through Inverse Reinforcement Learning (IRL), we can automate this process by learning the underlying reward function from human demonstrations. We propose a new IRL algorithm that learns a goal-conditioned spatio-temporal reward function. The resulting costmap is used by Model Predictive Controllers (MPCs) to perform a task without any hand-designing or hand-tuning of the cost function. We evaluate our proposed Goal-conditioned SpatioTemporal Zeroing Maximum Entropy Deep IRL (GSTZ)-MEDIRL framework together with MPC in the CARLA simulator for autonomous driving, lane keeping, and lane changing tasks in a challenging dense traffic highway scenario. Our proposed methods show higher success rates compared to other baseline methods including behavior cloning, state-of-the-art RL policies, and MPC with a learning-based behavior prediction model.

AB Modern applications require robots to comply with multiple, often conflicting rules and to interact with the other agents. We present Posetal Games as a class of games in which each player expresses a preference over the outcomes via a partially ordered set of metrics. This allows one to combine hierarchical priorities of each player with the interactive nature of the environment. By contextualizing standard game theoretical notions, we provide two sufficient conditions on the preference of the players to prove existence of pure Nash Equilibria in finite action sets. Moreover, we define formal operations on the preference structures and link them to a refinement of the game solutions, showing how the set of equilibria can be systematically shrunk. The presented results are showcased in a driving gamewhere autonomous vehicles select from a finite set of trajectories. The results demonstrate the interpretability of results in terms of minimum-rank-violation for each player.

AB Flocking of the unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) network refers to utilize the node's autonomous mobility to satisfy the principle of cohesion, separation, and alignment. A network with flocking ensures the connectivity between high-speed UAV nodes and simplifies the design of various swarm applications. In this paper, we propose a novel distributed flocking model for UAV swarm networks. The model follows the Boid principle and establishes the master-slave transmission mode among the nodes. The slave node performs the distributed autonomous regulation. An effective flocking method is proposed, which is based on the positioning and communication capabilities of Wi-Fi. The slave node can sense and adjust their distance and direction from the master node. The simulation and experimental results show that our model can guarantee the connectivity between all nodes and has 1.4 x the network goodput gain outperforms the traditional flying ad hoc network.

ID ALGORITHM
AB This paper presents a new algorithm for three-dimensional coverage path planning for autonomous structural inspection operations using aerial robots. The proposed approach is capable of computing short inspection paths via an alternating two-step optimization algorithm according to which at every iteration it attempts to find a new and improved set of viewpoints that together provide full coverage with decreased path cost. The algorithm supports the integration of multiple sensors with different fields of view, the limitations of which are respected. Both fixed-wing as well as rotorcraft aerial robot configurations are supported and their motion constraints are respected at all optimization steps, while the algorithm operates on both mesh- and occupancy map-based representations of the environment. To thoroughly evaluate this new path planning strategy, a set of large-scale simulation scenarios was considered, followed by multiple real-life experimental test-cases using both vehicle configurations.

AB The stratospheric airship, which is a new concept of autonomous atmospheric flight platforms, can operate over a period of time at very high altitudes to accomplish various military or commercial missions, such as monitoring, surveillance, and scientific exploration. The worldwide interest in stratospheric airships is still growing. However, modelling and control techniques for airships have fallen far behind those for fixed-wing aircraft. To show recent advances in modelling and control for stratospheric airships, this paper provides an insightful description of the related problems and a list of references for researchers and engineers focusing on this area. The literature is categorized according to major topics in this area: dynamic modelling, control design, and ascent/descent flight control. Moreover, an application of the path-following control with realtime flight test results is presented for an autonomous prototype airship. Finally, some challenging issues are addressed for future research.

AB To address the need for autonomous control of remote and distributed mobile systems, Machine-to-Machine (M2M) communications are rapidly gaining attention from both academia and industry. M2M communications have recently been deployed in smart grid, home networking, health care, and vehicular networking environments. This paper focuses on M2M communications in the vehicular networking context and investigates areas where M2M principles can improve vehicular networking. Since connected vehicles are essentially a network of machines that are communicating, preferably autonomously, vehicular networks can benefit a lot from M2M communications support. The M2M paradigm enhances vehicular networking by supporting large-scale deployment of devices, cross-platform networking, autonomous monitoring and control, visualization of the system and measurements, and security. We also present some of the challenges that still need to be addressed to fully enable M2M support in the vehicular networking environment. Of these, component standardization and data security management are considered to be the most significant challenges.

AB In light of the prevailing approach in which data from side-scan sonar (SSS) from Autonomous Underwater Vehicles (AUVs) are primarily processed and visualized post mission, failing to meet the requirements in terms of timeliness for on-the-fly image acquisition, this paper introduces a novel method for real-time processing and superior imaging of navigation strip data from SSS aboard AUVs. Initially, a comprehensive description of the real-time processing sequence is provided, encompassing the integration of multi-source navigation data using Kalman filtering, and high-pass filtering of attitude and heading data to exclude anomalies, as well as the use of bidirectional filtering techniques within and between pings, ensuring real-time quality control of raw data. In addition, this study adopts the semantic segmentation Unet network for automatic real-time tracking of seafloor lines, devises a real-time correction strategy for radial distortion based on historical echo data, and utilizes the alternating direction multiplier method for real-time noise reduction in strip images. With the combined application of these four pivotal techniques, we adeptly address the primary challenges in real-time navigation data processing. In conclusion, marine tests conducted in Bohai Bay substantiate the efficacy of the methodologies delineated in this research, offering a fresh paradigm for real-time processing and superior visualization of SSS navigation strip data on AUVs.

AB This study investigated the fault feature extraction and fusion problem for autonomous underwater vehicles with weak thruster faults. The conventional fault feature extraction and fusion method is effective when thruster faults are serious. However, for a weak thruster fault, that is, when the loss of effectiveness of thrusters is less than 10%, the following two problems occur if the conventional method is used. First, the ratio of fault features to noise features is small. Second, there is no monotonic relationship between the fusion fault features fused by the conventional method and the fault severity. In this paper, the following two methods are proposed to solve this problem: 1) Fault feature extraction method. Based on negentropy, this method improves the evaluation index of the parameter optimization of the modified variational mode decomposition and finally enhances the fault features extracted by the modified Bayesian classification algorithm. 2) Fault-feature fusion method. To create a monotonic relationship between the fusion fault features and fault severity, this method expands the number of original signals of the traditional fusion method based on D-S evidence theory, improves the focus element of the traditional fusion method, and adopts the strategy of double fusion. Finally, the effectiveness of the proposed method was verified by pool-experiment results on Beaver II prototype.

AB Path planning is a key technology for autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) navigation. With the emphasis and research on AUV, AUV path planning technology is continuously developing. Path planning techniques generally include environment modelling methods and path planning algorithms. Based on a brief description of the environment modelling methods, this paper focuses on the path planning algorithms commonly used by AUV. According to the basic principles of the algorithm, the AUV path planning algorithms are divided into four categories: artificial potential field methods, geometric model search methods, random sampling methods, and intelligent bionic methods. In this review, we summarize in detail the development and application of various path planning algorithms in recent years. Meanwhile, we analyse the advantages and disadvantages of various algorithms and their improvement methods. Obstacles, ocean currents, and undersea terrain have an impact on AUV path planning. Therefore, how to deal with the complex underwater environment adds some limits to AUV path planning algorithms. In addition to the external environment, path planning algorithms also need to consider AUV's physical constraints, such as energy constraints and motion constraints. Then, we analyse the motion constraints in AUV path planning. Finally, we discuss the development direction of AUV path planning algorithm. Time-varying ocean currents, special obstacles, multiobjective constraints, and practicability will be the problems that AUV path planning algorithms need to solve.

ID CAR-FOLLOWING MODEL; DRIVING BEHAVIOR
AB Most of the tactic manoeuvres during driving require a certain understanding of the surrounding environment from which to devise our future behaviour. In this paper, a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) approach is used to model the lane change behaviour to identify when a driver is going to perform this manoeuvre. To that end, a slightly modified CNN architecture adapted to both spatial (i.e., surrounding environment) and non-spatial (i.e., rest of variables such as relative speed to the front vehicle) input variables. Anticipating a driver's lane change intention means it is possible to use this information as a new source of data in wide range of different scenarios. One example of such scenarios might be the decision making process support for human drivers through Advanced Driver Assistance Systems (ADAS) fed with the data of the surrounding cars in an inter-vehicular network. Another example might even be its use in autonomous vehicles by using the data of a specific driver profile to make automated driving more human-like. Several CNN architectures have been tested on a simulation environment to assess their performance. Results show that the selected architecture provides a higher degree of accuracy than random guessing (i.e., assigning a class randomly for each observation in the data set), and it can capture subtle differences in behaviour between different driving profiles.

AB This paper examines the feasibility of using an audio-visual methodology for sound source localization of acoustic sources hidden from direct view. A four channel microphone array is used in conjunction with LiDAR and 2D/3D mapping to merge estimated angles of arrival with room parameters for sound source localization. The time difference of arrival (TDOA) approach is used to estimate the angle(s) of arrival from an unknown sound source and a reverse ray-tracing approach is used to identify a possible source location behind a barrier/obstacle. Using a single-source zone approach based TDOA algorithm, a variety of estimated source directions are identified, each arising from multiple sound sources due to reflections in the room. Results are combined with a three-dimensional map of the space acquired from a ground robot equipped with a 2D SICK LMS LiDAR, and a reverse ray tracing approach is used to triangulate the likely position of the source. Tests were performed in both controlled and uncontrolled environments and the method was capable of finding the hidden source to within 0.5 m accuracy, which is approximately 10% of the length of an automobile. It is proposed that a methodology like this could be used to add sound source localization capabilities on autonomous vehicles to detect the position of emergency/warning sounds in traffic that may be shielded from the direct field of view.

TI Steel Bridge Load Rating Impacts Owing to Autonomous Truck Platoons
SO TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH RECORD
LA English
DT Article
AB Autonomous truck platoons are two or more trucks driving together as a single unit through the use of vehicle-to-vehicle communication technology. These platoons can automatically accelerate or brake together, allowing them to travel at closer distances. With the world moving towards a more environment-friendly approach to everyday decisions, it is not a surprise that the concept of truck platooning is gaining momentum, as it reduces CO2 emissions by lowering fuel consumption. However, studies need to be performed to confirm that existing bridges will be able to adequately support truck platoons. The scope of this research is to study the effects of truck platooning on steel girder bridges in the United States (US). A multi-dimensional parametric study was conducted, which evaluated a variety of bridge span configurations and span lengths. Load ratings (using three different methodologies) were calculated for each of these structures for a range of truck platoons (both the number of trucks within a platoon and spacing between trucks). For comparison, the American Association of State Highway Transportation Officials (AASHTO) design and legal load ratings were also calculated for each bridge and were used to quantify the adequacy of current bridges to carry truck platoons. The study was able to identify the potentially inadequate existing bridges based on the original design methodology, configuration, and span length. This information is intended to be valuable to bridge owners as an initial screening process along corridors that will be subjected to regular truck platoon traffic.

AB This paper presents the development of simple but powerful path-following and obstacle-avoidance control laws for an underactuated autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV). Potential function-based proportional derivative (PFPD) as well as a potential function-based augmented proportional derivative (PFAPD) control laws are developed to govern the motion of the AUV in an obstacle-rich environment. For obstacle avoidance, a mathematical potential function is used, which formulates the repulsive force between the AUV and the solid obstacles intersecting the desired path. Numerical simulations are carried out to study the efficacy of the proposed controllers and the results are observed. To reduce the values of the overshoots and steady-state errors identified due to the application of PFPD controller a PFAPD controller is designed that drives the AUV along the desired trajectory. From the simulation results, it is observed that the proposed controllers are able to drive the AUV to track the desired path, avoiding the obstacles in an obstacle-rich environment. The results are compared and it is observed that the PFAPD outperforms the PFPD to drive the AUV along the desired trajectory. It is also proved that it is not necessary to employ highly complicated controllers for solving obstacle-avoidance and path-following problems of underactuated AUVs. These problems can be solved with the application of PFAPD controllers.

SO HUMAN FACTORS
LA English
DT Article
AB Objective: This study examined operators' capacity to successfully reallocate highly autonomous in-flight missiles to time-sensitive targets while performing secondary tasks of varying complexity.
   Background: Regardless of the level of autonomy for unmanned systems, humans will be necessarily involved in the mission planning, higher level operation, and contingency interventions, otherwise known as human supervisory control. As a result, more research is needed that addresses the impact of dynamic decision support systems that support rapid planning and replanning in time-pressured scenarios, particularly on operator workload.
   Method: A dual screen simulation that allows a single operator the ability to monitor and control 8, 12, or 16 missiles through high level replanning was tested on 42 U.S. Navy personnel.
   Results: The most significant finding was that when attempting to control 16 missiles, participants' performance on three separate objective performance metrics and their situation awareness were significantly degraded.
   Conclusion: These results mirror studies of air traffic control that demonstrate a similar decline in performance for controllers managing 17 aircraft as compared with those managing only 10 to 11 aircraft. Moreover, the results suggest that a 70% utilization (percentage busy time) score is a valid threshold for predicting significant performance decay and could be a generalizable metric that can aid in manning predictions.
   Application: This research is relevant to human supervisory control of networked military and commercial unmanned vehicles in the air, on the ground, and on and under the water.

AB In this paper, the computer-aided vehicle dynamic analysis of a 6x6 heavy military truck is presented and examined. For the analysis, a MATLAB/Simulink (R) platform is used to design and model a truck. The vehicle configuration taken into account for the analysis is the powertrain (engine, gear box, transfer gear, differential), suspension, steering system and tire model according to the Pacekja 89' formulation. In addition, the effect of the rolling resistance and drag is considered, in order to represent the vehicle behavior as real as possible. The longitudinal dynamic and lateral dynamic are formulated. First, the longitudinal dynamic model is established by means of implementation of the weight transfer function. The vehicles are considered as rigid bodies with 1 degree of freedom. Second, the vehicular planar model with three wheels, well known as bicycle model, is applied following the North Atlantic Treaty Organization double line change maneuver test reaching 3 degree of freedom. The driver behavior is represented by using an adaptive model predictive control varying the longitudinal velocity. The forces for braking, inertia of the rotating components, the energy lost in the powertrain, and the effect of dive squat and rollover. The numerical simulation results are shown and compared with a full-vehicle model formed by using Mechanical Simulation Corporation's truckSIM (R). There were chosen simulation scenarios applied to the model to observe the effects of different parameters concerning the dynamic behavior, and also prepared in truckSIM (R) environment. The main contributions of this article are the development of the vehicular model, through the use of block diagrams in a reliable and relatively simple programming code such as MATLAB/Simulink (R), with innovative tools used in the control of autonomous vehicle driving and the flexibility to adapt said model to different environmental conditions and different vehicle parameters.

ID RECOGNITION
AB Classifying traffic signs is an indispensable task for autonomous driving systems. Depending on the country, traffic signs possess a wide variability in their visual appearance making it harder for classification systems to succeed. Either the classifier should be fine-tuned or a bigger collection of images should be used. In this paper, we introduce a real-world European dataset for traffic sign classification. The dataset is composed of traffic sings from six European countries: Belgium, Croatia, France, Germany, The Netherlands, and Sweden. It gathers publically available datasets and complements French traffic signs with images acquired in Belfort with the equipped university autonomous vehicle. It is composed of more than 80 000 images divided in 164 classes that at the same time belong to four main categories following the Vienna Convention of Road Signs. We analyzed the intra variability of classes and compared the classification performance of five convolutional neural network architectures.

ID MODEL
AB This paper addresses the problem of pitch and depth control for a novel deep-sea, high-speed, and heavy-load autonomous underwater vehicle based on the lift principle (LP-AUV). One of the characteristics of an LP-AUV is the use of downward lift to overcome varying residual buoyancy and achieve rapid diving. The pitch angle determines the action direction of the lift force, thus affecting the safety and stability of diving and navigation. Specifically, the main requirement for the controller is accuracy and no overshoot in either the depth or pitch outputs of the system. To offer accurate and reliable control ability, with various speeds and residual buoyancies, unmatched disturbances and the action of lift taken into consideration, a single-neuron controller with self -learning and self-adaptive capabilities is proposed. Based on the Hebb learning rule, a supervised learning rule that can learn not only from the principles of neural networks but also from tuning experience is designed. Hence, the weights of the single-neuron controller can be constantly adjusted online to improve the control performance of the system more rapidly. Simulation results show the robustness and effectiveness of the pro-posed controller toward external disturbances. Finally, a series of lake tests using the LP-AUV are conducted to validate the proposed method.

AB This paper proposes an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) rapid autonomous landing strategy in GNSS-denied environments using pan-tilt based visual servoing (PTBVS) system. First, we propose a PTBVS system for navigating the UAV landing on a square platform. Through the status of the airborne camera and image information, the relative position information between the UAV and landing point can be obtained for navigation. Second, we made the UAV move horizontally and vertically at the same time when returning, which greatly shortens the flight distance and reduces the landing time. Moreover, in different landing stages, we adopt different positioning information acquisition methods. When the UAV is approaching the landing point, it uses the PTBVS system for navigation. Instead, it uses the pixel coordinate offset of the landing point to further improve the landing accuracy when landing vertically. Finally, we put forward the PTZ and UAV control algorithm. The PTZ control which keeps the landing point in the center range of the image consists of the time delay and PID control. And the UAV control guides the UAV to return and land. We test the proposed landing algorithm in the simulation platform and the actual environment. It is proved that the proposed method can bring the UAV earlier visual foresight, less landing time, and higher landing accuracy. (C) 2021 Elsevier Masson SAS. All rights reserved.

TI Cross-National Focus Group Response to Autonomous Vehicles
SO TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH RECORD
LA English
DT Article
AB The development of autonomous vehicles (AVs) is advancing quickly in some enclaves around the world. Consequently, AVs exist in the public consciousness, featuring regularly in mainstream media. As the form and function of AVs emerge, the attitudes of potential users become more important. The extent to which the public trusts AV technology and anticipates benefits, will drive consumer willingness to use AVs. Broadly, public attitudes will determine whether AVs can attract public investment in infrastructure and become a feature of the future transport mix or fail to realize the potential their developers assert. As part of UK Autodrive, a program trialing the introduction of AVs in the United Kingdom, researchers conducted focus groups in five UK cities, and a comparison focus group in San Francisco (December 2017 to September 2018) using representative samples (total n = 137). Focus group facilitators guided discussions in three areas considered central to usage decisions: trust in the technology, ownership models, and community benefit. This paper describes findings from a quasi-quantitative study supported with qualitative insights. This research provides three key takeaways centering on trust in the technology and in delivering benefit. First, some participants gain trust through experience and others through evidence. Second, participants had difficulty discriminating between AV developers, indicating a need for industry cooperation. Third, partnerships were found to demonstrate trust, highlighting the need for more and deeper partnerships moving forward. Generally, participants had positive attitudes toward AVs and expect AVs to provide benefits. However, these attitudes and expectations could change as AV development progresses.

TI Falco: Fast likelihood-based collision avoidance with extension to
   human-guided navigation
SO JOURNAL OF FIELD ROBOTICS
LA English
DT Article
DE aerial robotics; obstacle avoidance; planning
AB We propose a planning method to enable fast autonomous flight in cluttered environments. Typically, autonomous navigation through a complex environment requires a continuous search on a graph generated by a k-connected grid or a probabilistic scheme. As the vehicle travels, updating the graph with data from onboard sensors is expensive as is the search on the graph especially if the paths must be kinodynamically feasible. We propose to avoid the online search to reduce the computational complexity. Our method models the environment differently in two separate regions. Obstacles are considered to be deterministically known within the sensor range and probabilistically known beyond the sensor range. Instead of searching for the path with the lowest cost (typically the shortest path), the method maximizes the likelihood to reach the goal in determining the immediate next step for navigation. With such a problem formulation, the online method realized by a trajectory library can determine a path within 0.2-0.3 ms using a single central processing unit thread on a modem embedded computer. The method supports two configurations working with and without a prior map. Both configurations can be used to plan toward a goal point. Further, the later can allow human guidance for the navigation through a directional input. In experiments, it enables a lightweight unmanned aerial vehicle to fly at 10 m/s in a cluttered forest environment (see Figure 1 as an example).

AB High costs of owning fully-automated or autonomous vehicles (AVs) will fuel the demand forsharedmobility, with zero driver costs. Although sharing sounds good for the transport system, congestion can easily rise without adequate policy measures. Many or all public transit lines will continue to exist, and carefully-designed policies can be implemented to make good use of fixed public assets, like commuter- and light-rail lines. In this study, a shared AV (SAV) fleet is analyzed as a potential solution to the first-mile-last-mile (FMLM) problem for access to and from public transit. Essentially, SAVs are analyzed as collector-distributor systems for these mass-movers and compared with a door-to-door (D2D) service. Results from an agent-based simulation of Austin, Texas, show that SAVs have the potential to help solve FMLM transit problems when fare benefits are provided to transit users. Restricting SAV use for FMLM trips increases transit coverage, lowers average access and egress walking distance, and shifts demand away from park-and-ride and long walk trips. When SAVs are available for both D2D use and FMLM trips, high SAV fares help maintain transit demand, without which the transit demand may decrease significantly, affecting the transit supply and the overall system reliability. Policy makers and planners should be wary of this shift away from transit and may be able to increase transit usage using policies tested in this study.

AB Autonomous systems have advanced substantially, yet on-board energy capacity still constrains endurance. Liquid hydrogen (LH2) fuel storage coupled with a high efficiency fuel cell may offer greater endurance. An LH2 storage system has been developed, featuring a lightweight dewar with active pressure control. The dewar has 20.46 L internal volume, yielding <= 7.6 kWh kg(-1) specific energy and <= 1.2 Wh L-1 energy density (LHV basis) depending on fuel withdrawal rate and ambient conditions. It demonstrated 48 h continuous flight in the Naval Research Laboratory's Ion Tiger unmanned air vehicle, which is similar to 85% longer than prior gaseous hydrogen (GH(2)) fueled flights, with the same dry mass as the GH(2) system. Design considerations included matching the LH2 evaporation rate and variable consumption rate, and satisfying constraints imposed by the existing aircraft. Heat transfer models were used to design for low dewar heat leak, which is necessary to balance evaporation and consumption. The heat leak depends on ambient temperature, with evaporation ranging from 16 g h(-1) at 240 K to 29 g h(-1) at 300 K, at 275 kPa storage pressure. The LH2/GH(2)/dewar system takes >= 4 h to reach thermodynamic equilibrium after fueling. LH2 can extend the endurance of small autonomous systems, but at the expense of greater design effort and reduced operational flexibility. Copyright (C) 2014, Hydrogen Energy Publications, LLC.

AB The difference in sensors' readings can be exploited to reveal phenomena other than the measured quantities. Two examples of extracting information beyond what is directly measured by these sensors are presented. The first example describes the identification of the environment in which an autonomous guided vehicle is moving, based on the difference between measurements from odometry and triangulation systems. The original intent of these two sensor systems is to track the trajectory of an autonomous guided vehicle. The roughness of the floor is classified and identified from the difference between the sensors' readings, with the aid of neural networks. The second example describes the detection of intermittent contact in flexibly mounted rotor mechanical face seal. The intermittent contact causes high harmonic oscillations that can be detected through complicated power spectrum analysis of the proximity probes signals measuring the clearance or, similar sensor fusion techniques. However, it is shown that a simple analysis of the difference in variance of the probes' clearance readings may provide accurate indication whether such contact occurs, without relating to the actual measurements of the gap. It is suggested that the process of detecting phenomena from the differences in sensors' measurements will be called "Sensor/Information Intersection", to be distinguished from "Sensor Association", or, "Sensor Fusion", in which the data are complementing each other and are used to confirm the directly sensed, or, measured quantity.

AB This article investigates transmissibility operators for time-variant systems with bounded nonlinearities. Transmissibility operators are mathematical objects that characterize the relationship between two subsets of responses of an underlying system. The underlying system parameters and nonlinearities are assumed to be unknown. Time-domain transmissibility operators are independent of the system inputs and initial conditions. In this article, we propose an algorithm to identify time-varying transmissibilities using recursive least-squares and noncausal finite impulse response models. The identified transmissibilities are then used for fault detection in three different systems. The first system is an autonomous multirobotic system formulated to emulate connected autonomous vehicle platoons, where the varying parameters are the robot mass and the ground friction coefficient. The second system is a flexible structure with unknown excitation, where the variant parameter is the location of the excitation. Finally, the third system is a robotic manipulator that picks objects with different mass values.

AB With the increasing demands for high-accuracy autonomous navigation, the integrated strapdown inertial navigation system and refractive celestial navigation system (SINS/ RCNS) have received close attention. Aided by stellar refraction information, it can correct position and velocity errors. However, atmospheric density error is a critical element that restricts the accuracy of SINS/RCNS. To solve this problem, this article proposes a novel tightly-coupled method. In this scheme, the atmospheric density error is estimated and compensated to accommodate for the unknown model perturbation. Additionally, a tight integration model based on star pixel coordinates is derived to handle the time-varying measurement noise. The proposed method is evaluated by representative suborbital flight vehicle navigation simulations, and the results indicate that the introduction of atmospheric density error compensation can improve navigation accuracy without adding extra sensors and enhance performance.

AB With recent developments, the performance of automotive radar has improved significantly. The next generation of 4D radar can achieve imaging capability in the form of high-resolution point clouds. In this context, we believe that the era of deep learning for radar perception has arrived. However, studies on radar deep learning are spread across different tasks, and a holistic overview is lacking. This review paper attempts to provide a big picture of the deep radar perception stack, including signal processing, datasets, labelling, data augmentation, and downstream tasks such as depth and velocity estimation, object detection, and sensor fusion. For these tasks, we focus on explaining how the network structure is adapted to radar domain knowledge. In particular, we summarise three overlooked challenges in deep radar perception, including multi-path effects, uncertainty problems, and adverse weather effects, and present some attempts to solve them.

AB The hydrodynamic performance during multidirectional motions of a disk-shaped autonomous underwater helicopter, which are being developed recently, are investigated by means of computational fluid dynamics. High mesh quantity is essential to capture the realistic behavior during the horizontal motion. With the saucer-shaped basic geometry, pulsation of the drag force components against and normal to the moving direction is observed during the horizontal motion, which becomes more obvious with increasing velocity, while the motion is hydrodynamically more stable during the vertical movement with a relatively stable zero lateral force. At both moving directions, when the effect of thrusters are considered, the water flux induced by propellers disturbs the flow field, which enhances drag force fluctuation and moving instability. It is concluded that a high-performance controlling system is required to realize a stable and straight motion, or the dishing shape of the vessel needs to be optimized in order to improve the hydrodynamic stability.

AB In this paper, our focus is on using a rule-based approach to develop agents with artificial general intelligence. In rule-based systems, developing effective rules is a huge challenge, and coding rules for agents requires a large amount of manual work. Association rules mining (ARM) can be used for discovering specific rules from data sets and determining relationships between data sets. In this paper, we introduce a modified ARM method and use it to discover rules that analyse the surrounding environment and determine movements for an agent-guided vehicle that has been designed to achieve autonomous parking. The rules are created by our ARM-based method from training data gained during manual training in customised parking scenarios. In this system, data are represented in terms of fuzzy symbolic elements. We have tested our system by simulation in a virtual environment to demonstrate the effectiveness of this new approach.

AB This paper presents a hybrid path planning algorithm for the design of autonomous vehicles such as mobile robots. The hybrid planner is based on Potential Field method and Voronoi Diagram approach and is represented with the ability of concurrent navigation and map building. The system controller (Look-ahead Control) with the Potential Field method guarantees the robot generate a smooth and safe path to an expected position. The Voronoi Diagram approach is adopted for the purpose of helping the mobile robot to avoid being trapped by concave environment while exploring a route to a target. This approach allows the mobile robot to accomplish an autonomous navigation task with only an essential exploration between a start and goal position. Based on the existing topological map the mobile robot is able to construct sub-goals between predefined start and goal, and follows a smooth and safe trajectory in a flexible manner when stationary and moving obstacles co-exist.

AB Robustness of the decision-making system is essential to safe driving, especially under the environment with inevitable defective information due to the limitations of the perception and positioning modules. The traditional fault-injection approach is widely used in robustness tests, but it mainly focuses on the endogenous fault instead of the exogenous errors of systems. In this paper, a robustness verification method based on error injection is proposed for the decision-making system against exogenous data errors. First, an error model is designed to generate potential data errors for different environment information. Then, an error injection framework with high versatility is proposed to support different decision-making systems and virtual test platforms. In addition, an optimization algorithm called LAMBDA is introduced to adaptively design experiments aiming to realize a quick search of safety-critical errors. Furthermore, an error injection tool is developed to conduct the verification test automatically. The proposed approach is verified on a city autopilot system under typical hazardous scenarios by the error injection tool, and the tolerance boundary of the system can be obtained as well. Compared to random-based and traditional optimization algorithms, the LAMBDA algorithm is able to quickly achieve a higher coverage for safety-critical errors. Although the approach is proposed for the decision-making module, it is can be easily extended to others, such as planning and control.

AB Aiming at the problem of unstable output power of wireless charging systems for autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs), a magnetic coupler (MC) with an arc-shaped core structure is introduced and an output power stabilization control strategy based on mutual inductance identification algorithm is proposed. Firstly, an arc-shaped MC with high tolerances, excellent magnetic coupling and weak electromagnetic interference (EMI) is designed for the cylinder-shaped AUV. Based on ANSYS Maxwell simulation, an analysis of the magnetic field and comparative misalignment tests are carried out for the arc-shaped and the double dipole core structures. Secondly, a mathematical model of the LCC-S type magnetically coupled resonant wireless power transfer (MCR-WPT) system is developed, and a particle swarm parameter identification algorithm with adaptive inertia weights is proposed. Finally, the output power is steadily controlled by real-time adaptation of the duty cycle for the Buck-Boost circuit. The results show there is a maximum error within 2.5% in mutual inductance identification when the load is changed from 0 omega to 12 omega and the mutual inductance is changed from 25 mu H to 50 mu H. The system output power is steady at around 680 W with a maximum fluctuation rate of 4.90%, which verifies the efficiency of the power stabilization control strategy.

AB Traffic Sign Detection (TSD) is a complex and fundamental task for developing autonomous vehicles; it is one of the most critical visual perception problems since failing in this task may cause accidents. This task is fundamental in decision-making and involves different internal conditions such as the internal processing system or external conditions such as weather, illumination, and complex backgrounds. At present, several works are focused on the development of algorithms based on deep learning; however, there is no information on a methodology based on descriptive statistical analysis with results from a solid experimental framework, which helps to make decisions to choose the appropriate algorithms and hardware. This work intends to cover that gap. We have implemented some combinations of deep learning models (MobileNet v1 and ResNet50 v1) in a combination of the Single Shot Multibox Detector (SSD) algorithm and the Feature Pyramid Network (FPN) component for TSD in a standardized dataset (LISA), and we have tested it on different hardware architectures (CPU, GPU, TPU, and Embedded System). We propose a methodology and the evaluation method to measure two types of performance. The results show that the use of TPU allows achieving a processing training time 16.3 times faster than GPU and better results in terms of precision detection for one combination.

AB The cooperative localization of submerged autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) using the Time Difference of Arrival (TDOA) measurements of surface AUV sensors is an effective method for many applications of AUVs. Proper positioning of the sensors to maximize the observability of the AUVs is very critical for cooperative localization. In this paper, a novel method for obtaining the optimal formation of sensor AUVs has been presented for the three-dimensional (3D) cooperative localization of targets using the TDOA technique. An evaluation function for estimating the optimal formation has been derived based on Fisher Information Matrix (FIM) theory for a single target as well as multiple-target cooperative localization systems. An iterative stepping algorithm has been followed to solve the evaluation function and obtain the optimal positions of the sensors. The algorithm ensured that the computation complexity should remain limited, even when the number of sensor AUVs is increased. Various simulation examples are then presented to calculate the optimal formation for different systems/situations. The effect of the position of the reference sensor and operating depth of the target AUVs on the optimal formation of the sensors has also been studied, and conclusions are drawn. For implementation of the proposed method for more practical scenarios, a simulation example is also presented for cases when the target's position is only known with uncertainty.

AB This study proposes a novel autonomous system that is able to retrieve an underwater glider safely and quickly. After a long-period mission, the glider is out of its energy, floats up in the middle of the sea, and needs retrieval. However, most of the recovery processes are conducted manually, which is not effective and even damages the glider or injures the worker. In this study, we propose the use of a remotely operated vehicle (ROV) in a recovery process that consists of three stages: (i) driving the ROV into the near area of the glider, (ii) automatically catching the glider using the ROV's onboard sensors and capturing mechanisms, and (iii) retrieving the glider to the mother ship or station. Mathematical models were formulated to realize the feasibility of the system. A cascade adaptive sliding mode control-proportional integral controller is designed to cope with the thruster's characteristics, the dynamics of the ROV and the glider, and oceanic disturbances. Finally, simulation studies were conducted in the system operation scenarios and their results validate the efficiency of the proposed process.

AB As an independent unit, microgrid operator (MGO) should respond to the energy demand of customers with an optimal provision cost. Apart from the ability to guarantee the security of microgrid (MG) operation, the MGO should consider the greenhouse emission effects as well. This paper investigates a novel energy management system for an islanded MG. In the proposed strategy, two efficient methodologies are used to maximize the profit and security of the MG: (a) the optimal operation of electric vehicles (EVs) in vehicle-to-grid (V2G) mode and (b) the use of demand response (DR) program. Besides, a hierarchical control structure is proposed to manage frequency and voltage uncertainties in a permissible range. Improving the reliability of the MG is another goal of the proposed strategy, which is pursued by the studied controlling framework. The proposed approach is evaluated through a set of simulation and GAMS tests. Results indicate that the frequency deviation of the MG is damped through the proposed management strategy and place the spotlight on the effectiveness of the approach.

ID VEHICLE YAW STABILITY; STEERING CONTROL; STABILIZATION; BRAKING
AB In this paper, explicit Model Predictive Control(MPC) is employed for automated lane-keeping systems. MPC has been regarded as the key to handle such constrained systems. However, the massive computational complexity of MPC, which employs online optimization, has been a major drawback that limits the range of its target application to relatively small and/or slow problems. Explicit MPC can reduce this computational burden using a multi parametric quadratic programming technique(mp-QP). The control objective is to derive an optimal front steering wheel angle at each sampling time so that autonomous vehicles travel along desired paths, including straight, circular, and clothoid parts, at high entry speeds. In terms of the design of the proposed controller, a method of choosing weighting matrices in an optimization problem and the range of horizons for path-following control are described through simulations. For the verification of the proposed controller, simulation results obtained using other control methods such as MPC, Linear-Quadratic Regulator(LQR), and driver model are employed, and CarSim, which reflects the features of a vehicle more realistically than MATLAB/Simulink, is used for reliable demonstration.

DT Article
DE Collision avoidance; intelligent vehicles; mechatronics; vehicle safety
ID THREAT ASSESSMENT
AB Automotive collision avoidance (CA) systems help drivers to avoid collisions through autonomous interventions by braking or steering. If the decision to intervene is made too early, the intervention can become a nuisance to the driver, and if the decision is made too late, the safety benefits of the intervention will be reduced. The decision to intervene is commonly based on a threat function. The dimensionality of the input state space for the threat function is, in general, very large, making exhaustive evaluation in real vehicles intractable. This paper presents a method for efficient estimation of a conservative bound on CA system performance, i.e., the worst-case performance. Closed-form expressions are derived for the worst-case performance, in terms of early or unnecessary interventions, with regard to longitudinal or lateral prediction and measurement errors. In addition, we derive closed-form expressions for robust avoidance scenarios, in which no unnecessary intervention will occur. For a system example, numerical results show how decision timing and robustness depend on scenario and system parameters. The method can be used for defining system requirements, system verification, system tuning, or system sensitivity analysis with regard to scenario variations and sensor measurement errors.

AB This paper addresses the motion planning problem using hybrid symbolic techniques. The proposed approach develops a unified hierarchical hybrid control framework using a bismulation-based abstraction technique over the partitioned motion space that can be applied to autonomous aerial robots (3-D symbolic motion planning) or ground vehicles (2-D symbolic motion planning). The bisimulation relation between the abstracted model and the original continuous system guarantees that their behaviors are the same. This allows to design a discrete supervisor for the abstracted model, and then, the designed supervisor can be applied to the original system while the closed-loop behavior does not change. To apply the discrete supervisor to the original continuous system, an interface layer is developed, which on the one hand translates discrete commands of the supervisor to a continuous form applicable to the continuous plant and on the other hand, abstracts the continuous signals of the continuous low layer to discrete symbols understandable by the supervisor. The proposed algorithm is verified through implementation of a hybrid symbolic algorithm for the formation control of unmanned aerial vehicles.

   (DDPG); deep reinforcement learning (DRL); local motion planning
AB This study aims to solve the problems of sparse reward, single policy, and poor environmental adaptability in the local motion planning task of autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs). We propose a two-layer deep deterministic policy gradient algorithm-based end-to-end perception-planning-execution method to overcome the challenges associated with training and learning in end-to-end approaches that directly output control forces. In this approach, the state set is established based on the environment information, the action set is established based on the motion characteristics of the AUV, and the control execution force set is established based on the control constraints. The mapping relations between each set are trained using deep reinforcement learning, enabling the AUV to perform the corresponding action in the current state, thereby accomplishing tasks in an end-to-end manner. Furthermore, we introduce the hindsight experience replay (HER) method in the perception planning mapping process to enhance stability and sample efficiency during training. Finally, we conduct simulation experiments encompassing planning, execution, and end-to-end performance evaluation. Simulation training demonstrates that our proposed method exhibits improved decision-making capabilities and real-time obstacle avoidance during planning. Compared to global planning, the end-to-end algorithm comprehensively considers constraints in the AUV planning process, resulting in more realistic AUV actions that are gentler and more stable, leading to controlled tracking errors.

AB The major premise of deterministic artificial intelligence (D.A.I.) is to assert deterministic self-awareness statements based in either the physics of the underlying problem or system identification to establish governing differential equations. The key distinction between D.A.I. and ubiquitous stochastic methods for artificial intelligence is the adoption of first principles whenever able (in every instance available). One benefit of applying artificial intelligence principles over ubiquitous methods is the ease of the approach once the re-parameterization is derived, as done here. While the method is deterministic, researchers need only understand linear regression to understand the optimality of both self-awareness and learning. The approach necessitates full (autonomous) expression of a desired trajectory. Inspired by the exponential solution of ordinary differential equations and Euler's expression of exponential solutions in terms of sinusoidal functions, desired trajectories will be formulated using such functions. Deterministic self-awareness statements, using the autonomous expression of desired trajectories with buoyancy control neglected, are asserted to control underwater vehicles in ideal cases only, while application to real-world deleterious effects is reserved for future study due to the length of this manuscript. In totality, the proposed methodology automates control and learning merely necessitating very simple user inputs, namely desired initial and final states and desired initial and final time, while tuning is eliminated completely.

AB Autonomous vehicles (AVs), with an expectation of improving road safety, are closer to becoming a reality. A large number of people are still concerned about how AVs would operate in real-life driving environments. The present paper investigates the factors that affect people's views of the interactions between AVs and other road users based on a large sample from the 2015 and 2017 Puget Sound Travel Surveys. We specifically highlight the effects of the neighborhood environment and road infrastructure. We estimate a generalized ordered logit model to demonstrate the extent to which certain neighborhood environment and road infrastructure features affect individuals' safety perceptions of AVs, controlling for demographics, daily travel patterns, and general interest in riding AVs. The results reveal that designated bicycle facilities are positively associated with individuals' safety perceptions related to AVs. We find that residents from neighborhoods with more pedestrian facilities are more likely to express higher levels of concern on AVs' capabilities to react to the environment. Our results also suggest that people living in mixed-use neighborhoods are more confident in sharing the road with AVs. The findings provide useful implications for effective policy interventions and infrastructure provisions that may affect the market penetration rates of AVs while keeping up the standards for other road users, such as bicyclists and pedestrians.

AB In recent years, the important advances that have been made in unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) are being widely applied for civil purposes. However, several difficulties continue to exist in the implementation of missions, such as delivery and surveillance, in the private sector. Autonomous safe landing-area determination for small rotorcraft UAVs (RUAVs) is one of these unresolved issues, for the successful implementation of which adequate terrain information on the potential landing area is necessary. Previously, vision and light detection and ranging (LIDAR)-based methods were investigated for solving this problem. However, these light-based sensors have the disadvantage of being affected by weather or light conditions. The impulse radio ultra-wide band (IR-UWB) radar is a radar sensor with a wide frequency band that generates short-wavelength pulses. It has advantages such as light weight, small size, low power consumption, robustness to external environmental changes, and high range and distance resolutions. In this paper, we propose a novel safe landing-area determination system based on multiple IR-UWB radars, suitable for small RUAVs. Methods for detecting the ground and obstacles and estimating the ground slope and roughness values, based on the signals acquired by multiple IR-UWB radars are proposed. Through experiments, we demonstrate the feasibility and performance of the proposed method. (C) 2017 Elsevier Masson SAS. All rights reserved.

AB As part of ongoing efforts to better understand the nature of shipwrecks in National Marine Sanctuaries which may pose some level of pollution risk, and in this case, to definitively locate what is likely the only shipwreck in a sanctuary involved in both nuclear testing and nuclear waste disposal, NOAA's Office of National Marine Sanctuaries collaborated with NOAA's Office of Ocean Exploration and The Boeing Company, which provided their autonomous underwater vehicle, Echo Ranger, to conduct the first deep-water archeological survey of the scuttled aircraft carrier USS Independence in the waters of Monterey Bay National Marine Sanctuary (MBNMS) in March 2015. The presence of the deep-sea scuttled "radioactive" aircraft carrier USS Independence off the California coast has been the source of consistent media speculation and public concern for decades. The survey confirmed that a sonar target charted at the location was Independence, and provided details on the condition of the wreck, and revealed no detectable levels of radioactivity. At the same time, new information from declassified government reports provided more detail on Independence's use as a naval test craft for radiological decontamination as well as its use as a repository for radioactive materials at the time of its scuttling in 1951. While further surveys may reveal more, physical assessment and focused archival work has demonstrated that the level of concern and speculation of "danger" from either a radioactive or oil pollution threat posed may be exaggerated.

AB Purpose - This paper aims to propose a new method for combining global path planning with local path planning, to provide an efficient solution for unmanned surface vehicle (USV) path planning despite the changeable environment. Path planning is the key issue of USV navigation. A lot of research works were done on the global and local path planning. However, little attention was given to combining global path planning with local path planning.
   Design/methodology/approach - A search of shortcut Dijkstra algorithm was used to control the USV in the global path planning. When the USV encounters unknown obstacles, it switches to our modified artificial potential field (APF) algorithm for local path planning. The combinatorial method improves the approach of USV path planning in complex environment.
   Findings - The method in this paper offers a solution to the issue of path planning in changeable or unchangeable environment, and was confirmed by simulations and experiments. The USV follows the global path based on the search of shortcut Dijkstra algorithm. Both USV achieves obstacle avoidances in the local region based on the modified APF algorithm after obstacle detection. Both the simulation and experimental results demonstrate that the combinatorial path planning method is more efficient in the complex environment.
   Originality/value - This paper proposes a new path planning method for USV in changeable environment. The proposed method is capable of efficient navigation in changeable and unchangeable environment.

AB Modern land seismic acquisition is known for its complexity in terms of the number of equipment utilized, logistics, labor intensity and often harsh weather conditions. To solve some challenges and supplement conventional seismic exploration procedures, such as near-surface characterization, seismic-while-drilling, acquisition infill, we developed Autonomous Seismic Acquisition Device (ASAD). This robot is a quadrotor equipped with a special mechanism for coupling seismic sensors to the ground surface. The data from three orthogonal geophones and a 3-component accelerometer are recorded by developed onboard data acquisition module. The ASAD operator sets the starting position and density of recording points for the seismic exploration mission using a ground station that communicates with the robot via Wi-Fi. The seismic data collected by the ASAD is similar to those obtained using conventional wired seismic data acquisition system. The results of field tests in desert conditions showed stable data recording with a 2 ms sampling rate and a small clock drift up to 0.01 ms.

The proposed approach uses a vision-based photogrammetric position and attitude sensor (SVGS) to estimate the position of a landing target after video capture. A visual inertial odometry sensor (VIO) is used to provide position estimates of the UAV in a ground coordinate system during flight on a GPS-denied environment. The integration of both SVGS and VIO sensors enables the accurate updating of position setpoints during landing, providing improved performance compared with VIO-only landing, as shown in landing experiments. The proposed technique also shows significant operational advantages compared with state-of-the-art sensors for indoor landing, such as those based on augmented reality (AR) markers.

AB Autonomous mobile systems such as vehicles or robots are equipped with multiple sensor modalities including Lidar, RGB, and Radar. The fusion of multi-modal information can enhance task accuracy but indiscriminate sensing and fusion in all modalities increase demand on available system resources. This paper presents a task-driven approach to input fusion that minimizes the utilization of resource-heavy sensors and demonstrates its application to Visual-Lidar fusion for object tracking and path planning. The proposed spatiotemporal sampling algorithm activates Lidar only at regions-of-interest identified by analyzing visual input and reduces the Lidar 'base frame rate' according to the kinematic state of the system. This significantly reduces Lidar usage, in terms of data sensed/transferred and potentially power consumed, without a severe reduction in performance compared to both a baseline decision-level fusion and state-of-the-art deep multi-modal fusion.

AB Autonomous underwater vehicles are a prominent tool for underwater exploration because they can access dangerous places avoiding the risks for the human beings. However, the autonomous navigation still a challenge due to the characteristics of the environment that decrease the performance of the sensor and the robot perception. In this context, this paper proposes a loop closure detector addressed to the simultaneous localization and mapping problem at semistructured environments using acoustic images acquired by forward-looking sonars. The images are segmented by an adaptative approach based on the acoustic beams analysis. A pose-invariant topological graph is build to represent the relationship between image features. The loop closure detection is achieved using a graph comparison. The approach is evaluated in a real environment at a marina. The results reveal all loop closures of the data set are detected with a high precision and present an invariant to image rotation.

AB This article explores users' attitudes, perceptions, views, and emotions toward car automation and robotization, two processes increasingly affecting society in different ways--namely, the rise of autonomous and robotized cars (and vehicles in general) and the increasing level of robotization of current cars. To address these questions, we investigated the feeling of trust and comfort toward driverless cars among Europeans using two Eurobarometer surveys. Making use of two representative samples of the European population, we aimed to explore citizens' attitudes and opinions about automation and digitization. The two surveys involved, respectively, 27,801 and 27,901 participants from all EU-28 countries. Furthermore, we investigated, in Northern Italy, the perception of robotization of cars and other technologies of everyday use, as well as the attitudes and opinions of children and preteens (n = 740), and adolescents (n = 801)relevant social groups not covered in the Eurobarometer surveys.

AB This paper examines a couple of realizations of autonomous landing hazard avoidance technology of parafoil: a reinforcement-learning-based approach and a rule-based approach, advocating the former. Furthermore, comparative advantages and behavioral analogies between the two approaches are presented. In the data-driven approach, a decision process observing only a series of nadir-pointing images is designed without explicit augmentation of vehicle dynamics for the homogeneity of observation data. An agent then learns the hazard avoidance steering law in an end-to-end fashion. On the contrary, the rule-based approach is facilitated via explicit notions of guidance-control hierarchy, vehicle dynamic states, and metric details of ground obstacles. The soft actor-critic method is applied to learn a policy that maps the down-looking images to parafoil brakes, whereas a vector field guidance law is employed in the rule-based approach, considering each hazard as a repulsive source. This paper then presents empirical equivalences in designing both approaches and their distinctions. Numerical experiments in multiple test cases validate the reinforcement learning method and present comparisons between the approaches regarding their resultant trajectories. The interesting behaviors of the resultant policy of the data-driven approach are emphasized.

AB This article investigates a new autonomous mobile fog computing (MFC) system empowered by multiple unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) in order to serve medical Internet of Things devices (MIoTDs) efficiently. The aim of this article is to reduce the energy consumption of the UAVs-empowered MFC system by designing UAVs' trajectories. To construct the trajectories of UAVs, we need to consider not only the order of SPs but also the association among UAVs, SPs, and MIoTDs. The above-mentioned problem is very complicated and is difficult to be handled via applying traditional techniques, as it is NP-hard, nonlinear, non-convex, and mixed-integer. To handle this problem, we propose a novel simulated annealing trajectory optimization algorithm (SATOA), which handles the problem in three phases. First, the deployment (i.e., number and locations) of stop points (SPs) is updated and produced randomly using variable population sizes. Accordingly, MIoTDs are associated with SPs and extra SPs are removed. Finally, a novel simulated annealing algorithm is proposed to optimize UAVs' association with SPs as well as their trajectories. The performance of SATOA is demonstrated by performing various experiments on nine instances with 40 to 200 MIoTDs. The simulation results show that the proposed SATOA outperforms other compared state-of-the-art algorithms in terms of saving energy consumption.

AB Climate change is one of the greatest challenges for modern societies. Its consequences, often associated with extreme events, have dramatic results worldwide. New synergies between different disciplines, including artificial intelligence (AI), Internet of Things (IoT), and edge computing can lead to radically new approaches for the real-time tracking of natural disasters that are also designed to reduce the environmental footprint. In this article, we propose an AI-based pipeline for processing natural disaster images taken from drones. The purpose of this pipeline is to reduce the number of images to be processed by the first responders of the natural disaster. It consists of three main stages: 1) a lightweight autoencoder based on deep learning; 2) a dimensionality reduction using the t-distributed stochastic neighbor embedding algorithm; and 3) a fuzzy clustering procedure. This pipeline is evaluated on several edge computing platforms with low-power accelerators to assess the design of intelligent autonomous drones to provide this service in real time. Our experimental evaluation focuses on flooding, showing that the amount of information to be processed is substantially reduced, whereas edge computing platforms with low-power graphics accelerators are placed as a compelling alternative for processing these heavy computational workloads, obtaining a performance loss of only 2.3 x compared to its cloud counterpart version, running both the training and inference steps.

AB Two important aspects in dealing with autonomous navigation of a swarm of drones are collision avoidance mechanism and formation control strategy; a possible competition between these two modes of operation may have negative implications for success and efficiency of the mission. This issue is exacerbated in the case of distributed formation control in leader-follower based swarms of drones since nodes concurrently decide and act through individual observation of neighbouring nodes' states and actions. To dynamically handle this duality of control, a plan of action for multi-priority control is required. In this paper, we propose a method for formation-collision co-awareness by adapting the thin-plate splines algorithm to minimize deformation of the swarm's formation while avoiding obstacles. Furthermore, we use a non-rigid mapping function to reduce the lag caused by such maneuvers. Simulation results show that the proposed methodology maintains the desired formation very closely in the presence of obstacles, while the response time and overall energy efficiency of the swarm is significantly improved in comparison with the existing methods where collision avoidance and formation control are only loosely coupled. Another important result of using non-rigid mapping is that the slowing down effect of obstacles on the overall speed of the swarm is significantly reduced, making our approach especially suitable for time critical missions.

SO TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH RECORD

DT Article
AB Over the past six decades, as private automobiles have become more affordable and more universal among American families, previously uncounted costs for cars have come to the forefront of the modern transportation debate, with some activists calling for an end to cars. This paper identifies five transit criteria that a transportation system must satisfy if it hopes to dethrone the individually owned and operated car as king of the road: (a) a solution to the congestion problem, (b) safety improvements over conventional manually operated cars, (c) lesser impact on the environment, (d) economic feasibility, and (e) comfort and convenience to rival the automobile. Given recent advancements in the field of vehicle autonomy, a potential solution to the car's growing problems has presented itself: an autonomous taxi network (ATN). Drawing from the classic personal rapid transit model as well as Mark Gorton's idea of smart paratransit, two potential designs for an ATN are presented and compared with one another, and the viability of the ATN concept is explored in view of statewide transportation demand in New Jersey. With travel demand as generated by Talal Mufti in 2012, the smart paratransit model emerges as the more economically viable implementation, requiring a fleet size between 1.6 and 2.8 million sixpassenger vehicles to meet the state's travel demand in its entirety, at a cost to consumers of $16.30 to $23.50 per person per day.

ID EXPERT JUDGMENT; HEURISTICS; BENEATH; ISLAND; AUV
AB The deployment of a deep-diving long-range autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) is a complex operation that requires the use of a risk-informed decision-making process. Operational risk assessment is heavily dependent on expert subjective judgment. Expert judgments can be elicited either mathematically or behaviorally. During mathematical elicitation experts are kept separate and provide their assessment individually. These are then mathematically combined to create a judgment that represents the group view. The limitation with this approach is that experts do not have the opportunity to discuss different views and thus remove bias from their assessment. In this paper, a Bayesian behavioral approach to estimate and manage AUV operational risk is proposed. At an initial workshop, behavioral aggregation, that is, reaching agreement on the distributions of risks for faults or incidents, is followed by an agreed upon initial estimate of the likelihood of success of the proposed risk mitigation methods. Postexpedition, a second workshop assesses the new data and compares observed to predicted risk, thus updating the prior estimate using Bayes' rule. This feedback further educates the experts and assesses the actual effectiveness of the mitigation measures. Applying this approach to an AUV campaign in ice-covered waters in the Arctic showed that the maximum error between the predicted and the actual risk was 9% and that the experts' assessments of the effectiveness of risk mitigation led to a maximum of 24% in risk reduction.

AB A large-scale agent-based microsimulation scenario including the transport modes car, bus, bicycle, scooter, and pedestrian, is built and validated for the city of Bologna (Italy) during the morning peak hour. Large-scale microsimulations enable the evaluation of city-wide effects of novel and complex transport technologies and services, such as intelligent traffic lights or shared autonomous vehicles. Large-scale microsimulations can be seen as an interdisciplinary project where transport planners and technology developers can work together on the same scenario; big data from OpenStreetMap, traffic surveys, GPS traces, traffic counts and transit details are merged into a unique transport scenario. The employed activity-based demand model is able to simulate and evaluate door-to-door trip times while testing different mobility strategies. Indeed, a utility-based mode choice model is calibrated that matches the official modal split. The scenario is implemented and analyzed with the software SUMOPy/SUMO which is an open source software, available on GitHub. The simulated traffic flows are compared with flows from traffic counters using different indicators. The determination coefficient has been 0.7 for larger roads (width greater than seven meters). The present work shows that it is possible to build realistic microsimulation scenarios for larger urban areas. A higher precision of the results could be achieved by using more coherent data and by merging different data sources.

ID COOPERATIVE CONTROL; COORDINATED CONTROL; SYSTEM
AB Robots such as autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) and autonomous surface vehicles (ASVs) have been used for sensing and monitoring aquatic environments such as oceans and lakes. Environmental sampling is a challenging task because the environmental attributes to be observed can vary both spatially and temporally, and the target environment is usually a large and continuous domain whereas the sampling data are typically sparse and limited. The challenges require that the sampling method must be informative and efficient enough to catch up with the environmental dynamics. In this paper, we present a planning and learning method that enables a sampling robot to perform persistent monitoring tasks by learning and refining a dynamic data map that models a spatiotemporal environment attribute such as ocean salinity content. Our environmental sampling framework consists of two components: To maximize the information collected, we propose an informative planning component that efficiently generates sampling waypoints that contain the maximal information; to alleviate the computational bottleneck caused by large-scale data accumulated, we develop a component based on a sparse Gaussian process whose hyperparameters are learned online by taking advantage of only a subset of data that provides the greatest contribution. We validate our method with both simulations running on real ocean data and field trials with an ASV in a lake environment. Our experiments show that the proposed framework is both accurate in learning the environmental data map and efficient in catching up with the dynamic environmental changes.

TI AUV terrain-aided navigation using a Doppler velocity logger
SO ANNUAL REVIEWS IN CONTROL

DT Review
DE Particle filter; Complementary filtering; Doppler-based navigation;
   Terrain-aided navigation
AB This paper "addresses the design and implementation of terrain-aided navigation (TAN) methods for small autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) that rely on standard navigation sensors and dispense with the need for dedicated sensors for terrain data acquisition. The research described focuses on the problem of TAN implementation in underwater scenarios characterized by smooth sea-bottom topography and very shallow water, where the terrain information available for navigation is scarce. The navigation algorithms and the data fusion methods whose tests are documented in the paper build upon and expand prior theoretical work published by the authors; the TAN solutions adopted exploit the terrain information and the navigation data acquired with an inexpensive Doppler velocity logger (DVL) and a standard motion reference unit, respectively. The position estimation methods analyzed include a bi-dimensional particle filter (PF) and a four-dimensional Rao-Blackwellized PF that was designed to estimate the unknown Doppler velocity measurement biases responsible for the unbound localization errors typically observed in dead-recknoning navigation. The positioning accuracy achieved with these filters is compared with the output of a novel method, also proposed in the paper, that mechanizes a complementary-like filter designed to fuse the output of a TAN estimator with the velocity measurements provided by a DVL. Experimental results obtained during field tests with an autonomous marine vehicle are reported and analyzed. (C) 2016 International Federation of Automatic Control. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

ID PERFORMANCE
AB Hybrid-driven Underwater Glider (HUG) is a new type of underwater vehicle which integrates the functions of an Autonomous Underwater Glider (AUG) and an Autonomous Unmanned Vehicle (AUV). Although HUG has the characteristics of long endurance distance, its maneuverability still has room to be improved. This work introduces a new movement form of the neck of the underwater creature into HUG and proposes a parallel mechanism to adjust the attitude angle and displacement of the HUG's bow, which can improve the steering maneuverability. Firstly, the influence of bow movement and rotation on the hydrodynamic force and flow field of the whole machine is analyzed by using the Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) method. The degree of freedom, attitude control range and movement amount of the Movable Bow Mechanism (MBM) are obtained, and then the design of MBM is completed based on these constraints. Secondly, the kinematic and dynamic models of MBM are established based on the closed vector method and the Lagrange equation, respectively, which are fully verified by comparing the results of simulation in Matlab and Adams software, then a Radial Basis Function (RBF) neural network adaptive sliding mode controller is designed to improve the dynamic response effect of the output parameters of MBM. Finally, a prototype of MBM is manufactured and assembled. The kinematic, dynamics model and controller are verified by experiments, which provides a basis for applying MBM in HUGs.

ID DESIGN
AB In this paper, a wireless power transfer (WPT) system with a compact planar magnetic coupler for an autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) is proposed. A passive induction (PI) coil is integrated into the circular transmitter (Tx) coil to build a uniform magnetic field (UMF), which can guarantee the stable output of the WPT system under uncertain radial and axial misalignments for AUV. Based on normalized magnetic induction intensity distribution analysis, a UMF constructing method with a PI coil is given, aiming to eliminate the fluctuation of magnetic field intensity, and the PI coil design principles and flow chart are obtained. The theoretical analysis shows the proposed integrated coil can effectively enhance the radial misalignment tolerance compared with a conventional circular spiral coil. The zero-phase angle (ZPA) input condition can be achieved by adjusting the series capacitor connected with the Tx coil in S-S compensation topology. Experimental results show that the proposed magnetic coupler containing an integrated coil significantly improves the stability of output power and power transfer efficiency within the possible radial and axial misalignments compared with a conventional coupler. It was demonstrated that the output power changes less than 5.5% and the power transfer efficiency maintains at approximately 84.5% in arbitrary radial positions within the possible working region with an axial transfer distance of 50 mm in saltwater.

AB Nowadays, more than in the past, research is focused on the study and development of enabling technologies to achieve the goal of autonomous navigation. The investigations cover all industrial fields: automotive, aerospace, and maritime. The first level to be developed to achieve the goal of autonomous vehicles is obstacle detection and consecutively object tracking in real-time. The most important results were obtained in the automotive sector, where the available financial resources are more significant than the others. Indeed, several methods based on trained neural networks are used to detect the obstacles. Usually, the neural networks are trained by using large datasets of LiDAR point clouds and images. Unfortunately, it is impossible to emulate this approach in the marine sector because there are no large datasets for training a neural network. For such a reason, this paper aims to present multi-object tracking based on unsupervised learning. The proposed method is tailored for the challenging marine environment, and it is suitable for the detection and tracking of both fixed and moving obstacles. This paper presents a low-computational method for multi-object tracking based on unsupervised learning, and it is discussed and analysed step by step, indicating the pros and weaknesses. Moreover, the tracking has been tested on both experimental LiDAR point clouds and virtual LiDAR point clouds created employing a tailored virtual scenario. The results are reported and discussed.

ID VISION
AB Detecting pedestrians at high speed in high resolution (HR) images is important for preventing collisions in autonomous vehicle. The HR images provide more detail information while creating a heavy computational load, resulting in slower detection speed. We find that the pedestrians are usually not present in the upper part of the HR image, due to the camera vertical field of view and the distance between pedestrian and camera. We named this area a non-pedestrian area (NPA). Therefore, we are able to reduce the calculation time while maintaining the detection accuracy by removing NPA from the HR image. According to this concept, we propose a novel pedestrian detection acceleration algorithm called Non-Pedestrian Area Estimation (NPAE). The NPAE algorithm estimates and removes non-pedestrian areas of the image, followed by pedestrian detection of the NPAE output image. Two datasets with three different resolution images are used to test our proposed NPAE algorithm on both GPU and CPU platforms. The RetinaNet is chosen as the reference pedestrian detector. Our algorithm increases the detection speed with 42% on the GPU platform and with 52% speed increase on the CPU platform, for the test images with a resolution of 1920 x 1080 pixel. In terms of detection accuracy, NPAE improves by up to 37.94% compared to classical data optimization acceleration methods. The detection accuracy results are well preserved in both platforms.

AB The Ocean Bottom Flying Node (OBFN) belongs to Autonomous Underwater Vehicle (AUV) designed for detecting seabed resources. When considering model uncertainties, external disturbances, and thruster faults, by applying the nonsingular fast terminal sliding-mode technique, a distributed finite-time fault-tolerant error constraint containment control method for multiple OBFN systems is proposed under directed communication topology. Besides, only a part of follower OBFNs can get the information of leader OBFNs. First, the error constraint strategy is considered to improve the system performance while the defined error variable of containment control was converted into a suitable form. Then, by choosing the appropriate nonsingular fast terminal sliding surface, the systems states can reach the sliding surface in finite time such that the follower OBFNs could converge to the convex hull formed by the leader OBFNs in finite time. Neural Network (NN) is employed to estimate and compensate the general disturbances consisting of model uncertainties, external disturbances, and thruster faults. An adaptive law is designed to compensate the upper bound of the estimation errors. The finite-time stability of the systems and the boundedness of containment errors are proved by utilizing graph theory, finite time theory, and Lyapunov technique. Numerical simulations under different types of thruster faults are given to show the effectiveness of the proposed methods.

AB Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) are the emerging vital components of millimeter wave (mmWave) wireless systems. Accurate beam alignment is essential for efficient beam based mmWave communications of UAVs with base stations (BSs). Conventional beam sweeping approaches often have large overhead due to the high mobility and autonomous operation of UAVs. Learning-based approaches greatly reduce the overhead by leveraging UAV data, like position to identify optimal beam directions. In this paper, we propose a deep Q-Network(DQN)-based framework for uplink UAV-BS beam alignment where the UAV hovers around 5G new radio (NR) BS coverage area, with varying channel conditions. The proposed learning framework uses the location information and maximize the beamforming gain upon every communication request from UAV inside the multi-location environment. We compare the proposed framework against multi-armed bandit (MAB)-based and exhaustive approaches, respectively and then analyse its training performance over different coverage area requirements, antenna configurations and channel conditions. Our results show that the proposed framework converge faster than the MAB-based approach and comparable to traditional exhaustive approach in an online manner under real-time conditions. Moreover, this approach can be further enhanced to predict the optimal beams for unvisited UAV locations inside the coverage using correlation from neighbouring grid locations.

AB The importance of autonomous marine vehicles is increasing in a wide range of ocean science and engineering applications. Multi-objective optimization, where trade-offs between multiple conflicting objectives are achieved (such as minimizing expected mission time, energy consumption, and environmental energy harvesting), is crucial for planning optimal routes in stochastic dynamic ocean environments. We develop a multi-objective path planner in stochastic dynamic flows by further developing and improving our recently developed end-to-end GPU-accelerated single-objective Markov Decision Process path planner. MDPs with scalarized rewards for multiple objectives are formulated and solved in idealized stochastic dynamic ocean environments with dynamic obstacles. Three simulated mission scenarios are completed to elucidate our approach and capabilities: (i) an agent moving from a start to target by minimizing travel time and net-energy consumption when harvesting solar energy in an uncertain flow; (ii) an agent moving from a start to target by minimizing travel time and-energy consumption with uncertainties in obstacle initial positions; (iii) an agent attempting to cross a shipping channel while avoiding multiple fast moving ships in an uncertain flow. Optimal operating curves are computed in a fraction of the time that would be required for existing solvers and algorithms. Crucially, our solution can serve as the benchmark for other approximate AI algorithms such as Reinforcement Learning and help improve explainability of those models.

TI SegFast-V2: Semantic image segmentation with less parameters in deep

DE Compressed encoder-decoder model; Semantic image segmentation; Deep

AB Semantic image segmentation can be used in various driving applications, such as automatic braking, road sign alerts, park assists, and pedestrian warnings. More often, AI applications, such as autonomous modules are available in expensive vehicles. It would be appreciated if such facilities can be made available in the lower end of the price spectrum. Existing methodologies, come with a costly overhead with large number of parameters and need of costly hardware. Within this scope, the key contribution of this work is to promote the possibility of compact semantic image segmentation so that it can be extended to deploy AI based solutions to less expensive vehicles. While developing cheap and fast models one must also not compromise the factor of reliability and robustness. The proposed work is primarily based on our previous model named "SegFast", and is aimed to perform thorough analysis across a multitude of datasets. Beside "spark" modules and depth-wise separable transposed convolutions, kernel factorization is implemented to further reduce the number of parameters. The effect of MobileNet as an encoder to our model has also been analyzed. The proposed method shows a promising decrease in the number of parameters and significant gain in terms of runtime even on a single CPU environment. Despite all those speedups, the proposed approach performs at a similar level to many popular but heavier networks, such as SegNet, UNet, PSPNet, and FCN.

AB With the advancements in utilizing Artificial Intelligence (AI) in embedded safety-critical systems based on Field-Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs), assuring that these systems meet their safety requirements is of paramount importance for their revenue service. Based on this context, this paper has two main objectives. The first of them is to present the Safety ArtISt method, developed by the authors to guide the lifecycle of AI-based safety-critical systems, and emphasize its FPGA-oriented tasks and recommended practice towards safety assurance. The second one is to illustrate the application of Safety ArtISt with an FPGA-based braking control system for autonomous vehicles relying on explainable AI generated with High-Level Synthesis. The results indicate that Safety ArtISt played four main roles in the safety lifecycle of AI-based systems for FPGAs. Firstly, it provided guidance in identifying the safety-critical role of activities such as sensitivity analyses for numeric representation and FPGA dimensioning to achieve safety. Furthermore, it allowed building qualitative and quantitative safety arguments from analyses and physical experimentation with actual FPGAs. It also allowed the early detection of safety issues-thus reducing project costs-and, ultimately, it uncovered relevant challenges not discussed in detail when designing safety-critical, explainable AI for FPGAs.

AB PurposeThe purpose of this paper is to analyse how start-ups with a clear sustainability focus collaborate with multiple actors at different levels to pursue business ideas and develop sustainable freight transport solutions. Design/methodology/approachThis paper builds on a theoretical approach that includes three levels of analysis: the actor level (micro), business-network level (meso) and society and government level (macro). An embedded case study is used of a focal start-up aiming to innovate on networked platforms and electric and autonomous vehicles (EAVs). FindingsActivities and resources are developed at the firm (micro), network (meso) and societal levels (macro), and all three levels need to be considered for a start-up, with a clear sustainability focus. Interaction within as well as between levels affects the innovation development, integration and implementation. The many-folded collaborations at the meso level serve as a locus for the integration of EAVs. The start-up's networking activities with actors at meso and macro levels contribute to it gaining legitimacy in the transport system. Originality/valueThis paper focuses on the importance of collaboration in the context of developing innovative solutions for environmental sustainability and freight transport and provides a unique case of how a start-up company manages collaborations at the micro, meso and macro levels.

AB The rapid development of intelligent underwater devices promotes marine exploitation activities, including marine resource exploitation, marine target tracking, etc. This work will present how to utilize the Autonomous Underwater Vehicle (AUV) swarm or multi-AUVs system to track the underwater diffusion pollution, especially the equipotential line of particular concentration. Different from most of the current research, in this work, we take the AUV swam as a network system and utilize the Software-Defined Networking (SDN) technique to optimize the network architecture, constructing an SDN-enabled AUV network Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS). With the centralized management ability of the SDN technique, we propose the software-defined Centralized Training Decentralized Execution (CTDE) architecture based on the graph-based Soft Actor-Critic (SAC) algorithm to optimize the system control and management. To improve the computing and training efficiency, we embed the self-attention mechanism into the critic network construction, leading to a self-attention-based SAC algorithm. Evaluation results demonstrate that our proposed approach is able to exactly track the equipotential lines of a particular concentration in many categories (with different types of equipotential lines (including the shape, noise, and diffusion value)) of underwater diffusion fields. Meanwhile, our proposed approaches outperform some classical schemes in system awards, tracking errors, etc.

AB Autonomous Underwater Vehicle (AUV) is an automated navigation device, which can independently complete the underwater investigation and detection without supervision. However, the marine environment is getting increasingly severe, and the garbage in the ocean and fishnets cast by fishermen have a great negative influence on the work of AUV. To solve the problems of low precision and slow speed in the state-of-the-art network detection of weak and small targets in underwater sonar images, Yolo5 was improved by building the multi-branch shuttle neural network The dataset is collected by multi-beam forward-looking sonar Gemini720i, and includes "fishnet" and two representative types of knitted and plastic garbage, i.e., "cloth" and "plasticbag". The original dataset is enhanced and balanced, and the effect of dataset distribution on the model performance is studied. Utilizing pre-training, the effects of Yolo5 family, i.e., Yolo5s, Yolo5m, Yolo5l and Yolo5x are compared using the balanced dataset, to explore the impacts on detecting weak and small targets of the deeper and wider networks of this family. In addition, the combinations of Yolo5s with lightweight networks, i.e., MobileNet3 and ShuffleNet2 are experimented, which further illustrates the effectiveness of the proposed network, and can satisfy the high accuracy and real-time requirements of AUV.

AB Three-dimensional sound-speed distribution is essential for large-scale underwater acoustic applications due to its influence on the signal propagation trajectory. However, it is labor, energy, and time consuming to measure sound speed by traditional methods because of the weak system maneuverability. In this article, an autonomous-underwater-vehicle-assisted underwater sound-speed inversion framework that collaborates ray tracing and artificial intelligence model is proposed to quickly obtain 3-D sound-speed distribution through multicoordinate inversions. An autoencoding-translation neural network is proposed to establish the nonlinear relationship from signal propagation time to the sound-speed profile (SSP), and the inversion time can be shortened with once forward propagation through the model. Robustness could be improved by inverting error-resistant implicit features into the SSP through the proposed translating neural network, whereas the implicit features are extracted from the autoencoder by denoising reconstruction of the input time information. To solve the overfitting problem and extend the training data set, virtual SSPs based on sparse feature points of real SSPs are generated. Simulation results show that our approach can provide a reliable and instantaneous monitoring of 3-D sound-speed distribution.

AB Children who are too young to drive and adults who are unable to drive can represent a significant transportation burden, one typically shouldered by family members, i.e., "family chauffeur-associated-burdens" (Family CABs). This research examines how one's experience chauffeuring family members influences support for strategies to address family chauffeuring burdens. The research also examines if one's own experience chauffeuring family members affects perceptions of the possibility that they may reach a point at which they are no longer able to drive, and potentially become a transportation burden to others. Descriptive statistics and linear and logistic regression models of a household survey (n = 349) demonstrate the significance of demographics in the type and extent of chauffeuring burdens. Chauffeur youth and money spent chauffeuring are each positively-correlated with the desire to move to a more walkable place to address chauffeuring burdens. Alternately, youth and being male are each positively-correlated with favoring technological solutions (e.g., autonomous vehicles) to address chauffeuring burdens. One's own experience as a chauffeur does not significantly influence perceptions of eventually becoming a transportation burden for others. Women are more likely to prefer moving to a more walkable location and relying on family or friends if they are no longer able to drive, while men prefer the idea of relying on autonomous vehicles if they lose the ability to drive. Findings from this work can guide appropriate planning, policy, and technological responses to chauffeuring burdens.

AB The number of marine protected areas (MPAs) has increased dramatically in the last decade and poses a major logistic challenge for conservation practitioners in terms of spatial extent and the multiplicity of habitats and biotopes that now require assessment. Photographic assessment by autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) enables the consistent description of multiple habitats, in our case including mosaics of rock and sediment. As a case study, we used this method to survey the Greater Haig Fras marine conservation zone (Celtic Sea, northeast Atlantic). We distinguished 7 biotopes, detected statistically significant variations in standing stocks, species density, species diversity, and faunal composition, and identified significant indicator species for each habitat. Our results demonstrate that AUV-based photography can produce robust data for ecological research and practical marine conservation. Standardizing to a minimum number of individuals per sampling unit, rather than to a fixed seafloor area, may be a valuable means of defining an ecologically appropriate sampling unit. Although composite sampling represents a change in standard practice, other users should consider the potential benefits of this approach in conservation studies. It is broadly applicable in the marine environment and has been successfully implemented in deep-sea conservation and environmental impact studies. Without a cost-effective method, applicable across habitats, it will be difficult to further a coherent classification of biotopes or to routinely assess their conservation status in the rapidly expanding global extent of MPAs.

AB The problem of simultaneous fault detection, isolation and tracking (SFDIT) control design for linear systems subject to both bounded energy and bounded peak disturbances is considered in this work. A dynamic observer is proposed and implemented by using the H/H-/L-1 formulation of the SFDIT problem. A single dynamic observer module is designed that generates the residuals as well as the control signals. The objective of the SFDIT module is to ensure that simultaneously the effects of disturbances and control signals on the residual signals are minimised (in order to accomplish the fault detection goal) subject to the constraint that the transfer matrix from the faults to the residuals is equal to a pre-assigned diagonal transfer matrix (in order to accomplish the fault isolation goal), while the effects of disturbances, reference inputs and faults on the specified control outputs are minimised (in order to accomplish the fault-tolerant and tracking control goals). A set of linear matrix inequality (LMI) feasibility conditions are derived to ensure solvability of the problem. In order to illustrate and demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed design methodology, the developed and proposed schemes are applied to an autonomous unmanned underwater vehicle (AUV).

AB In many remote-sensing applications, measured data are a strong function of the environment in which they are collected. This paper introduces a new context-dependent classification algorithm to address and exploit this phenomenon. Within the proposed framework, an ensemble of classifiers is constructed, each associated with a particular environment. The key to the method is that the relative importance of each object (i.e., data point) during the learning phase for a given classifier is controlled via a modulating factor based on the similarity of auxiliary environment features. Importantly, the number of classifiers to learn and all other associated model parameters are inferred automatically from the training data. The promise of the proposed method is demonstrated on classification tasks seeking to distinguish underwater targets from clutter in synthetic aperture sonar imagery. The measured data were collected with an autonomous underwater vehicle during several large experiments, conducted at sea between 2008 and 2012, in different geographical locations with diverse environmental conditions. For these data, the environment was quantified by features (extracted from the imagery directly) measuring the anisotropy and the complexity of the seabed. Experimental results suggest that the classification performance of the proposed approach compares favorably to conventional classification algorithms as well as state-of-the-art context-dependent methods. Results also reveal the object features that are salient for performing target classification in different underwater environments.

AB Mobile devices, climate science, and autonomous vehicles all require advanced microwave antennas for imaging, radar, and wireless communications. We propose a waveguide-fed metasurface antenna architecture that enables electronic beamsteering from a lightweight circuit board with varactor-tuned elements. Our approach uses a unique feed structure and layout that enables spatial sampling at the Nyquist limit of half a wavelength. We detail the design of this Nyquist metasurface antenna and experimentally demonstrate electronic beamsteering in two directions. Nyquist metasurface antennas can realize high performance without costly and power hungry phase shifters, making them a compelling technology for future antenna hardware.

AB Mitigating the ground effect has become a big challenge for autonomous aerial vehicles. This paper proposes a sliding mode based on the Proportional Integral Derivative sliding surface control with backstepping (hybrid control) to improve quadcopter flight tracking performance during take-off and soft landing on the ground in a disrupted and windy environment. The proposed controller provided a quick adaptation and high robustness of the vehicle's fight control in the face of disturbances. Using the Lyapunov stability criterion condition has been derived to ensure that the Quadcopter system with a proposed hybrid controller is stable even when the upper bound for disturbance is unknown. The simulation results show that the total thrust generated by rotors increases linearly as the vehicle gets closer to the ground. Proposed controller during landing state reduces 4.77% settling time as compared to PIDSMC and 10% to SMC of the system with no load and with load it reduced 2.70% compared to PIDSMC and 7.35% to SMC. In terms of chattering effect and control effort, proposed controller PIDSMCBS outperformances the PIDSMC and SMC.

DT Article
DE PID; discrete-time; digital control
AB To create an autonomous surface vehicle, the microcontroller that will be responsible for the vessel' s response will have access to both engine thrust controls and steering controls. In the case of a vehicle with waterjet propulsion, the term "controls" refers to engine RPM and nozzle angle. The latter allows the thrust vectoring. Having performed the mathematical modelling of the surface vessel, a method must be found such that the microcontroller actions on the controls create the desired outputs, based on predefined performance objectives. A commonly selected control algorithm considered an industry standard for control applications-at least from the perspective of classical control methods-is the PID control scheme. Many times, a PID control scheme is sufficient for achieving the required performance. There are also many methods that extend the functionality of the PID to robust control schemes, to accomplish more specific targets, such as noise rejection. The vast majority of all these implementations, will have to be implemented using a digital microcontroller or an FPGA. This paper assists theoretically in implementing PID controllers digitally, by elaborating on the discrete-time perspective of PID control. It also provides a test method for evaluating the algorithmic implementation.

AB The accuracy and stability of an underwater vehicle manipulator system (UVMS) are essential for performing underwater tasks. However, exogenous disturbance and unmodeled dynamics will lead to poor UVMS performance in terms of degraded transient behavior and large steady-state errors. In this paper, the path following problem with prescribed performance of a UVMS with flexible joints is addressed. First, a terminal sliding mode control scheme with prescribed performance is presented along with a novel extended state observer (ESO) based sliding mode disturbance observer (SMDO). The proposed controller simplifies the parameter tuning process by ensuring the predefined system behaviors of interest right after the design. Subsequently, a path following scheme is designed for the UVMS such that the position of both base vehicle and robot arms can converge to the specified path in 3-D space. Finally, numerical simulations and comparisons are conducted to show the effectiveness of the proposed method in terms of trajectory tracking in the presence of environmental disturbances and modeling uncertainties.

AB The mobility of an Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) offers significant benefits when deploying remote Non-Destructive Testing (NDT) inspections of large-scale assets. Ultrasonic inspection is primarily a contact-based NDT method, that grants the opportunity to remotely monitor the structural health of an industrial asset with enhanced internal integrity information. Presented in this paper is an implementation of an autonomous UAV system, equipped with an ultrasonic thickness measurement payload. This system is designed to conduct ultrasonic inspections of non-magnetic facilities and industrial infrastructure where surface adhesion cannot be achieved magnetically. Operating within a laboratory environment, this system autonomously positioned the transducer on a vertically mounted, unpainted, aluminium sample and completed an ultrasonic thickness measurement without manual intervention. An onboard laser scanner provided instantaneous UAV alignment and standoff error measurements versus the sample's surface normal vector. While inspecting a region of the aluminium sample with 12.92 mm nominal thickness, the UAV system demonstrated a measurement error of 0.03 mm. During this process, the standard deviation of the craft's positional error was recorded to be below 63.26 mm, accompanied by an angular alignment error versus the surface normal vector of below 2.71 degrees. The accuracy of the UAV deployed inspection, including thickness measurement accuracy and positional accuracy, depends on many factors. As such, transducer alignment constraints, electrical noise and UAV stability are investigated and discussed. Findings from this paper may be taken to inform future research regarding autonomous airborne ultrasonic inspection of constructed infrastructure and industrial facilities.

AB We present a reinforcement learning (RL) model that is based on Q-learning for the autonomous control of ship auxiliary power networks. The development and application of the proposed model is demonstrated using a case-study ship as the platform. The auxiliary power network of the ship is represented as a Markov Decision Process (MDP). Q-learning is then used to teach an agent to operate in this MDP by choosing actions in each operating state which would minimize fuel consumption while also respecting the boundary conditions of the network. The presented work is based on an extensive data set received from one of the cruise-line operators on the Baltic Sea. This data set was preprocessed to extract information for the state representation of the auxiliary network, which was used for training and validating the model. As a result, it is shown that the developed method produces an autonomous control policy for the auxiliary power network that outperforms the current human operated manual control of the case-study ship. An average of 0.9 fuel oil savings are attained over the analyzed round-trips with control that displayed similar robustness against blackouts as the current operation of the ship. This amounts to 32 tons of fuel oil saved annually. In addition, it is shown that the developed model can be reconfigured for different levels of robustness, depending on the preferred trade-off between maintained reserve power and fuel savings.

DT Article; Early Access
DE Communication-aware; flocking; reinforcement learning; autonomous
   underwater vehicles (AUVs)
AB Communication efficiency and flocking stability are two basic requirements for the application of autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) in maritime transportation systems. Although they are closely related, most existing flocking approaches focus on the control techniques and ignore the influence of communication efficiency. This paper presents a joint design solution to the channel estimation and flocking control for multi-AUV-based maritime transportation systems, with the consideration of path loss, shadow and multipath fading channels. A value iteration-based reinforcement learning (RL) estimator is first designed to predict the channel quality of AUVs in positions that have not yet visited. With the predicted channel quality, we construct an integrated optimization problem for the co-design of communication and flocking strategies. Along with this, a value iteration-based RL flocking controller is developed to achieve the co-design of channel estimation and flocking control for AUVs. It is worth mentioning that, the value iteration-based RL estimator in this paper can avoid local optimal in traditional least-squares methods, and meanwhile the flocking controller in this paper can make a balance between flocking stability and communication efficiency for AUVs. Finally, simulation and experimental results reveal that the proposed approach in this paper has superior performances by comparing with the other works. As such, our approach is more useful for marine engineer to understand and explore the maritime transportation system from the communication and control view points.

ID UNDERWATER VEHICLES
AB Autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) as an efficient underwater exploration means have been used to perform various marine missions. However, limited by the technologies of underwater acoustic communications and intelligent autonomy, the most current and advanced AUVs only perform a limited number of tasks in the small-scale area and the known underwater environment. Therefore, in this paper, a one path planning model was proposed combining the global path planning and the local path planning for the large-scale complex marine environment. More specifically, the B-spline curve was used to represent the smooth path for the requirement of kinematic constraints of AUVs. After considering the various constraints, such as the energy/time consumption, the turning radius limitation, the marine environment, and the ocean current, the path planning was abstractly modeled as a multi-objective optimization model with the time cost, the curvature cost, the map cost, and the ocean current cost. The swarm hyper-heuristic algorithm (SHH) with the online learning ability was proposed to solve this model with real-time performance and stability. The results showed that the proposed online learning SHH algorithm had obvious advantages in terms of time efficiency, stability, and optimal performance compared with the results of two traditional heuristic algorithms, both particle swarm optimization (PSO) and firefly algorithm (FFA). The time efficiency of the online learning SHH algorithm improved at least 20% compared with PSO and FFA.

TI nPlug: An Autonomous Peak Load Controller
SO IEEE JOURNAL ON SELECTED AREAS IN COMMUNICATIONS

DE Smart Plug; Demand Response; Peak Loads; Scheduling; Multiple Access
AB The Indian electricity sector, despite having the world's fifth largest installed capacity, suffers from a 12.9% peaking shortage. This shortage could be alleviated, if a large number of deferrable loads, particularly the high powered ones, could be moved from on-peak to off-peak times. However, conventional Demand Side Management (DSM) strategies may not be suitable for India as the local conditions usually favor inexpensive solutions with minimal dependence on the pre-existing infrastructure. In this work, we present a completely autonomous DSM controller called the nPlug(1). nPlug is positioned between the wall socket and deferrable load(s) such as water heaters, washing machines, and electric vehicles. nPlugs combine local sensing and analytics to infer peak periods as well as supply-demand imbalance conditions. They schedule attached appliances in a decentralized manner to alleviate peaks whenever possible without violating the requirements of consumers. nPlugs do not require any manual intervention by the end consumer nor any communication infrastructure nor any enhancements to the appliances or the power grids. Some of nPlug's capabilities are demonstrated using experiments on a combination of synthetic and real data collected from plug-level energy monitors.
   Our results indicate that nPlug can be an effective and inexpensive technology to address the peaking shortage. This technology could potentially be integrated into millions of future deferrable loads: appliances, electric vehicle (EV) chargers, heat pumps, water heaters, etc.

AB Navigation is a broad topic that has been receiving considerable attention from the mobile robotic community over the years. In order to execute autonomous driving in outdoor urban environments it is necessary to identify parts of the terrain that can be traversed and parts that should be avoided. This paper describes an analyses of terrain identification based on different visual information using a MLP artificial neural network and combining responses of many classifiers. Experimental tests using a vehicle and a video camera have been conducted in real scenarios to evaluate the proposed approach.

AB Micro Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) such as quadrocopters have gained great popularity over the last years, both as a research platform and in various application fields. However, some complex application scenarios call for the formation of swarms consisting of multiple drones. In this paper a platform for the creation of such swarms is presented. It is based on commercially available quadrocopters enhanced with on-board processing and communication units enabling full autonomy of individual drones. Furthermore, a generic ground control station is presented that serves as integration platform. It allows the seamless coordination of different kinds of sensor platforms.

AB A central goal of artificial intelligence in high-stakes decision-making applications is to design a single algorithm that simultaneously expresses generalizability by learning coherent representations of their world and interpretable explanations of its dynamics. Here, we combine brain-inspired neural computation principles and scalable deep learning architectures to design compact neural controllers for task-specific compartments of a full-stack autonomous vehicle control system. We discover that a single algorithm with 19 control neurons, connecting 32 encapsulated input features to outputs by 253 synapses, learns to map high-dimensional inputs into steering commands. This system shows superior generalizability, interpretability and robustness compared with orders-of-magnitude larger black-box learning systems. The obtained neural agents enable high-fidelity autonomy for task-specific parts of a complex autonomous system.
   Inspired by the brain of the roundwormCaenorhabditis elegans, the authors design a highly compact neural network controller directly from raw input pixels. Compared with larger networks, this compact controller demonstrates improved generalization, robustness and interpretability on a lane-keeping task.

ID DESIGN
AB Image deteriorations due to vibrations have become a problem in autonomous systems such as unmanned aerial vehicles, robots, and autonomous cars. To suppress the vibration, a camera stabilizer using a gimbal mechanism is widely used. However, the size and weight of the system increase because the conventional image stabilization systems require some actuators and links to drive in multi-axes. In order to solve these problems, we proposed a novel three-degree-of-freedom (3DOF) electromagnetic actuator for image stabilization. The actuator can be driven by only three-phase and has a simple structure and control system. This paper describes the experimental verification of the proposed actuator. The torque characteristics are clarified, and the analysis and measured torque characteristics are compared to verify the analysis validity. For verifying the dynamic performance, the frequency characteristics are measured. The effectiveness of the proposed magnetic structure and operating principle are investigated.

AB Most current unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) primarily use a global positioning system (GPS) and an inertial measurement unit (IMU) for position estimation. However, compared to birds and insects, the abilities of current UAVs to recognize the environment are not sufficient. To achieve autonomous flight of UAVs, like birds, the UAVs should be able to process and respond to information from their surrounding environment immediately. Therefore, in this paper, we propose a direct visual servoing system for UAVs, using an onboard high-speed monocular camera. There are two advantages of this system. First, the high image sampling rates help to improve the ability to recognize the environment. Second, the issue of control latency can be effectively solved because the position control signals are transmitted to the flight controller directly. In the experiment, the UAV could recognize a target at update rates of about 350 Hz, and a target tracking task was successfully realized.

ADA consists of off-the-shelf components and features open-source hardware and firmware. It can be deployed as a testbed for depth controllers, as well as a mobile sensor platform for research or in industrial tanks. We introduce a control law that is based on the feedback linearization method and enhanced by an adaptive fuzzy algorithm to cope with modeling inaccuracies. The proposed depth controller is computationally light enough to run on ADAs embedded hardware. In experiments performed in a wave tank, the adaptive fuzzy scheme shows the ability to deal with both depth regulation and depth profile tracking. ADA is even able to hold on to dynamic isobars despite external disturbances. We demonstrate that under the influence of waves, ADA describes orbital motions similar to water particles.

AB The problem of pursuit has been studied mostly in the context of missile guidance and navigation; however, it is also an essential component in biological systems ranging from prey capture to mating and in bioinspired engineering applications with small agile vehicles. This paper considers the pursuit problem with a focus on robustness to noisy sensor measurements and efficiency in the control effort. We design a pursuit law based on Lyapunov analysis and establish its robustness to unknown target acceleration and measurement errors using the concept of ultimate boundedness. Robustness to control saturation is analyzed using the phase portrait of the closed-loop system. We also present results from experiments that were conducted to study the practical challenges involved in pursuit by lightweight platforms with noisy sensors. These experiments highlight the benefit of using less control effort in the presence of large measurement errors compared with existing pursuit guidance laws.

AB In order to provide autonomous broadband communications among mobile vehicles, especially in an environment without fixed terrestrial vehicular base stations, a Cognitive Non-Continuous Carrier Interferometry Orthogonal Signal Division Multiplexing (Cognitive NCI-OSDM) transmission system is proposed in this paper. Specifically, Orthogonal Signal Division Multiplexing (OSDM) provides the system with high transmission capacity and good adaptability to variable mobile speeds. Carrier Interferometry (CI) codes make a system with limited Peak to Average Power Ratio (PAPR) of the transmitted signal. The incorporation of adaptive OSDM scheme provides an efficient approach to control Inter-Carrier Interference (ICI). Moreover, the non-continuous scheme is quite suitable in cognitive radio applications. Compared with traditional broadband OFDM-based transmission, such as Non-Continuous OFDM (NC-OFDM) in IEEE802.22, Cognitive NCI-OSDM has advantages of higher transmission capacity and spectrum efficiency, lower ICI, limited PAPR, adaptability to its cognitive environment and variable mobile speed. In this paper, the application system and the structure of Cognitive NCI-OSDM transmission is proposed for autonomous vehicular communications. Furthermore, the performance is evaluated, including the Bit Error Rate (BER), throughput, PAPR and Power of Inter-Carrier Interference (PICI). Finally, the system complexity, which is considered as the potential drawback when compared with an OFDM-based system, is investigated and confirmed to be controllable. The results reported in this paper show the promise of the proposed cognitive NCI-OSDM system and identify some possibilities for its future application in autonomous vehicular communications.

AB With the development of sensing, communication and automated driving technology, connected and automated vehicles (CAVs) are becoming promising solutions for future transport require-ments. It is widely believed that a vehicle platoon is a good form to organize urban traffic in the CAV era. Due to the multicommodity nature of urban traffic streams, vehicles will continuously leave and join a multilane platoon, which inevitably gives rise to the need of lane changing within a multilane platoon. This paper studies the coordinated lane-changing scheduling problem in a CAV platoon, with the goal of transferring the platoon from an initial state to a target state to minimize a certain cost measurement (e.g., number of steps), while heterogeneous scenarios are considered. Two approaches, i.e., an exact and an approximate approach, are proposed. For the exact approach, we formulate an integer linear programming (ILP) model to identify the global optimal solution. Multiple objective functions are defined to meet the different needs. To relieve the computational issue of the exact approach, we further propose a tree-based heuristic search (THS), an approximate algorithm framework. THS is able to obtain an acceptable solution with negligible computational effort, and has the potential to handle the scheduling problem with more precise modeling or larger platoons. Numerical experiments are conducted to demonstrate the performance of different algorithms on both small-and large-scale cases (with up to 60 vehicles in a platoon), and the parameter combinations in the THS are tested for the optimal trade-off between solution quality and computational load. The findings indicate that ILP is practical for small-or medium-scale cases, which can generate multiple optimal solutions for different objectives; THS can solve large-scale cases in milliseconds on an ordinary personal computer, while the acquired solution is verified to be only slightly worse than the global optimum.

AB An adequate understanding of consumer affinity towards automated vehicles (AVs) is necessary to more reliably forecast the potential impacts of AVs on transportation system. The road to fully automated driving systems pass through partially automated driving systems. This study contributes by simultaneously analyzing consumer affinity towards partially (Level 3/4 automation) connected automated vehicles (CAVs) and fully AVs (FAVs) (Level 5 automation), and how it relates to sustainable travel behavior, user valuation of different vehicle attributes, (electric) vehicle ownership, and safety concerns. Unique data for over 3500 households from the 2017 California Vehicle Survey are harnessed. With an on-average positive correlation between consumer affinity towards partially CAVs and FAVs (Kendall's tau b of 0.506), significant contrasts are also observed. Compared to around 64% of the households with positive affinity towards partially CAVs, only 35% were willing to consider buying a FAV in future. Around 30% of the households had negative affinity for FAVs but positive affinity for partially CAVs. A comprehensive simulation-assisted joint bivariate ordered discrete outcome modeling framework is used, considering preference heterogeneity at different geographic/ecological levels, from the region to household level, and further within and across the choices for partially CAVs and FAVs. Participation in carshare, rideshare programs, and more transit trips per member were independently associated with a greater affinity towards partially CAVs and FAVs. Ownership of a plug-in electric vehicle was associated with a 19.9% and 9.6% increase in the likelihood of highest affinity levels towards partially CAVs and FAVs, respectively. Some evidence is found that consumers may possibly use shared AVs, but not necessarily in combination with ride sharing. Simultaneous correlations between affinity towards partially CAVs and FAVs and most valued vehicle attributes, safety concerns, and sociodemographic factors are quantified. Methodologically, the results underscore the importance of considering preference heterogeneity at different geographic/ecological levels. Captured through random parameters, the associations of several factors with consumer affinity towards partially CAVs and FAVs varied in magnitude and direction. In addition, statistically significant interactive effects (opposite and counterbalancing) of the latent unobserved factors underlying several random parameters were observed. The presence of multilayered preference heterogeneity highlights the personalized and complex nature of behavioral phenomenon underlying user acceptance of AVs. By reflecting the users' preferences towards CAVs and FAVs and characterizing the taste/preference heterogeneity at multiple levels,

AB The position of the source is sensitive and critical information in underwater acoustic sensor networks (UASNs). In this study, a network coding-based scheme called the stratified source location privacy protection scheme (SSLP-NC) with autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) is suggested for a strong adversary that can decode data. First, for the adversary with passive attacks, several fake source selection algorithms are suggested for two circumstances where the source is in the shallow and deep sea, respectively. Each node then utilizes a pseudo-random number generator to create sequences on a regular basis so that the key data can be delivered to the sink without interference. Then, for the adversary with the active attack, the node encrypts the source and fake data using the pre-existing pseudo-random number sequence as an encoding vector to thwart the adversary's decryption. Further, this work develops a relay node selection approach for transmitting the encoded data, which increases the variety of the data transmission pathways. Finally, this study includes a hole avoidance strategy that uses nodes or an AUV to address the potential hole issue. The simulation demonstrates that the SSLP-NC successfully fends off an adversary that can decode data packets, and performs better than the EECOR and DBR-MAC algorithms in terms of network safe time and packet delivery rate.

AB Multiextended target tracking (METT) has important applications in many fields, including autonomous vehicles, traffic flow monitoring, etc. However, as an acknowledged METT algorithm, the labeled multi-Bernoulli (LMB) filter cannot handle the intertarget occlusion problem, which frequently observed among METT, leading to an estimated trajectory break and even target loss. To tackle this problem, this article proposes an improved LMB filter with intertarget occlusion handling ability for METT. First, an intertarget occlusion probability (IOP) model based on a labeled random finite set using a laser range finder is developed. The IOP model theoretically describes the probability that each tracked target being occluded, considering both partial and full occlusion. Second, a true detection probability (TDP) model is presented to describe the probability that a target will generate corresponding measurement of a sensor in the presence of occlusion. The TDPs of tracked targets provide a way to integrate their estimated occlusion probabilities into the LMB filter to improve its capability of handling occluded tracks. We carried out multiple vehicle tracking simulation and field test using a laser range finder. Both simulation and experiment results illustrate that our improved LMB filter with occlusion handling ability can successfully tackle the intertarget occlusion problem and outperform conventional algorithms.

AB The cloud-enabled Internet of controlled things (IoCT) envisions a network of sensors, controllers, and actuators connected through a local cloud in order to intelligently control physical devices. Because cloud services are vulnerable to advanced persistent threats (APTs), each device in the IoCT must strategically decide whether to trust cloud services that may be compromised. In this paper, we present iSTRICT, an interdependent strategic trust mechanism for the cloud-enabled IoCT. iSTRICT is composed of three interdependent layers. In the cloud layer, iSTRICT uses FlipIt games to conceptualize APTs. In the communication layer, it captures the interaction between devices and the cloud using signaling games. In the physical layer, iSTRICT uses optimal control to quantify the utilities in the higher level games. Best response dynamics link the three layers in an overall "game-of-games," for which the outcome is captured by a concept called Gestalt Nash equilibrium (GNE). We prove the existence of a GNE under a set of natural assumptions and develop an adaptive algorithm to iteratively compute the equilibrium. Finally, we apply iSTRICT to trust management for autonomous vehicles that rely on measurements from remote sources. We show that strategic trust in the communication layer achieves a worst-case probability of compromise for any attack and defense costs in the cyber layer.

AB The work described in this paper is motivated by the need to develop efficient and robust estimation filters with application to terrain-aided navigation of underwater robotic vehicles. One of the main problems addressed is the development of navigation particle filters that can deal with the scarcity of landmarks and the terrain ambiguity that characterize vast regions of the ocean floor. As a contribution to solve this problem, the paper proposes three novel particle filter algorithms and assesses their estimation efficiency and robustness to non-informative measurements using two well-known benchmarking tests. The performance of the new filters in these tests demonstrates their potential to solve a class of nonlinear problems that include, but are not limited to, the type of underwater navigation problem that motivated the present work. Our study concludes by examining the performance of the filters in terms of determining the position and velocity of an autonomous underwater vehicle in the presence of unknown ocean currents. When applied to terrain-aided navigation, the novel particle filter formulations formulations mitigate filter divergence issues frequently caused by terrain symmetries and are more robust than other well-known versions when used in scenarios with poor terrain information. The theoretical developments presented and the results obtained in simulations are validated using real data acquired during tests with an autonomous marine robot.

AB For driving assistance systems, intelligent vehicles and autonomous robots to be viable in complex environments, it is necessary to have a reliable and robust localisation function. Due to the large variability and uncertainty of such complex environments, which include theme parks, university campuses, suburbs, industrial estates and the like, it is difficult to rely on a specific method or set of sensor data to correctly and robustly estimate the robot path/pose. The key to solving the localisation problem is to optimally use and fuse all useful sources of information available to the mobile platform. For the envisaged environment, it is not unusual to have approximate digital maps of the road network. In this paper, in addition to the typical sensory information provided by extereoceptive and proprioceptive sensors, it is shown how a priori approximate knowledge available in the form of a road map can be systematically fused within a Simultaneous Localisation and Map Building (SLAM) framework to obtain more accurate and robust localisation results. This reformulation of SLAM through the introduction of constraints in the form of a priori map information not only makes the problem theoretically more correct in the sense of observability but also makes the system viable and effective, yielding more accurate results. The results obtained in an actual environment are presented to validate the claims. (c) 2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Cellular vehicle-to-everything (C-V2X) is one of the enabling vehicular communication technologies gaining momentum from the standardization bodies, industry, and researchers aiming to realize fully autonomous driving and intelligent transportation systems. The 3rd Generation Partnership Project (3GPP) standardization body has actively been developing the standards evolving from 4G-V2X to 5G-V2X providing ultra-reliable low-latency communications and higher throughput to deliver the solutions for advanced C-V2X services. In this survey, we analyze the 3GPP standard documents relevant to V2X communication to present the complete vision of 3GPP-enabled C-V2X. To better equip the readers with knowledge of the topic, we describe the underlying concepts and an overview of the evolution of 3GPP C-V2X standardization. Furthermore, we provide the details of the enabling concepts for V2X support by 3GPP. In this connection, we carry out an exhaustive study of the 3GPP standard documents and provide a logical taxonomy of C-V2X related 3GPP standard documents divided into three categories: 4G, 4G & 5G, and 5G based V2X services. We provide a detailed analysis of these categories discussing the system architecture, network support, key issues, and potential solution approaches supported by the 3GPP. We also highlight the gap and the need for intelligence in the execution of different operations to enable the use-case scenarios of Level-5 autonomous driving. We believe, the paper will equip readers to comprehend the technological standards for the delivery of different ITS services of the higher level of autonomous driving.

AB The traffic control is an essential part of autonomous movement of different kinds of vehicles in a virtual model of a (real) city. By the traffic control we mean not only collisions avoiding and optimal setting of traffic lights. The movement should be realistic enough too, so traffic (together with changing day-time/night-time and seasons of the year) significantly improves feeling of reality for a virtual visitor. This paper describes some implementations of the city traffic in the project named Praha4D (www.Praha4D.net) aimed at the city of Prague and its historical development.

AB Autonomous maneuvering decisions of unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) in short-range air combat remain a challenging research topic, and a decision method based on an improved deep deterministic policy gradient (DDPG) is proposed. First, the problem model is improved from the perspective of energy-air combat, and a decision model with engine thrust, angle of attack, and roll angle as control variables is established. The normal and tangential overloads are determined by these control variables, and the decision is constrained by the flight stability and threshold range. Subsequently, the decision learning algorithm of the maneuver command is designed based on the DDPG framework. According to the energy air combat, speed is introduced into the return function in some states to make the return value more in line with reality. In view of the slow learning speed of the DDPG algorithm, the winning rate is introduced into the e-greedy strategy to adjust the exploration and application probabilities in real time. In view of the decrease in computational efficiency caused by the large amount of empirical data, a similar empirical exclusion was carried out based on the vector distance. The simulation results show that the DDPG-based algorithm realizes autonomous decisions of engine thrust, roll angle, and attack angle under constraints, and the comparative simulation shows that the improvement measures are effective.

SO TRANSACTIONS OF THE INSTITUTE OF MEASUREMENT AND CONTROL
LA English
DT Article
DE Adaptive sliding mode control; AUV; noise cancellation; chattering
   cancellation; reaching law
AB Since autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) have highly nonlinear dynamics, the employed controller in these systems must be accurate and robust against noise and uncertainties. Sliding Mode Controller is very robust against both the parameters changing and external disturbance. But, there are some major drawbacks of these controllers such as chattering and high vulnerability against noise. In this paper, by modifying the reaching law and using an adaptive gain in the proposed sliding mode controller, these problems are eliminated from the input signal of the system. In the presented reaching law, a continuous term is used instead of the discrete sign function as well as the velocity term is entered in the reaching law. Since there are external disturbances, noises and uncertainties in the system dynamics and modeling, the states may be separated from the surface. Since the reaching law acts when the states separate from the sliding surface, then the gain of reaching law is adapted according to the uncertainties, states error and velocity. Also, the upper bound of disturbance and uncertainty are estimated. Furthermore, the reaching condition and limitation of the switching variable rate for the proposed controller are investigated. Finally, stability and convergence of the closed-loop system are proven analytically using the Lyapunov stability theorem. Some simulations and comparisons with other methods show efficiency of the presented method.

AB One of the most important problem of autonomous flight for UAS is the wind identification, especially for small scale vehicles. This research focusses on an identification methodology based on the Extended Kalman Filter (EKF). In particular authors focus their attention on.the filter tuning problem. The proposed procedure requires low computational power, so it is very useful for UAS. Besides it allows a robust wind component identification even when, as it is usually, the measurement data set is affected by noticeable noises. (C) 2019 Elsevier Masson SAS. All rights reserved.

A compact multi-spectral image capture system was mounted on an unmanned autonomous vehicle (UAV) and used to survey a landscape. Five spectral bands (three visible, two near infrared bands) were imaged, processed and analyzed to measure the quantity of vegetation in the scene. The UAV equipped with the multi-spectral imaging system finished the test flights successfully and the results of these experiments suggest that this type of system would be useful for agricultural applications as precision farming or crop yield management.

One of the core technologies for autonomous driving is high-definition map technology, while refined mine maps are also needed to support scenarios such as vehicle-shovel collaboration, loading and unloading, production scheduling, and traffic safety control. To better serve the construction of intelligent mines and address the autonomous driving needs in open-pit mining scenarios, a universal high-definition map data model oriented toward data production and exchange, Open-Pit Map (OP map for short), has been designed. Based on various working scenarios of open-pit mines, eight practical basic elements, eleven location elements, and eight traffic elements in OP map were proposed. A map visualization tool, MapViewer, was developed based on OP map, and the effectiveness and practicality of the data model in the practical application of an intelligent shipping system in a Chinese mine were validated.

This method approximates the Bayesian function using multiple Gaussian components, and the components can be obtained by radial basis function neural network. This method has no resampling process, the particle depletion of particle filtering is eliminated in principle. The simulation shows that the proposed method has good matching performance, which is suitable for autonomous underwater vehicle navigation.

AB Mobility as a service (MaaS) integrates various transport modes into an on-demand and real-time platform, providing door-to-door service, and has received extensive attention. For MaaS, personalized trip planning is important but intractable. In this paper, we present a two-phase decision-support optimization framework for the problem of a MaaS system incorporating metros and shared autonomous vehicles (SAVs). First, a mixed integer programming model is proposed to optimize the routes of heterogeneous travelers considering five transport mode combinations, in which SAVs are regarded as not only a first- and last-mile connector to the metro but also a competitor. Next, the scheduling of SAVs and departure time of each traveler is determined with the purpose of minimizing the SAV operation cost. To apply the proposed framework to scenarios with real-time requests, we adopt the rolling horizon solution method, which includes four sub-modules. The method is evaluated on the Sioux Falls network, and the experimental results show that travelers become more sensitive to the mode choice as the additional time of the metro increases. In addition, the connectivity of the metro network has a considerable influence on the relationship between the metro and SAVs. The methodology can be useful for the trip planning of other transport mode combinations.

AB Measurement is an essential part of modern science as well as of engineering, commerce, and daily life. As per recent reports of world health organization (WHO), most accidents occur due to human negligence and hence need of a system which can access the surrounding environment and reflect exact measurement of obstacle is a must to enable fully autonomous vehicle (AV). Photonic radars have materialized as promising candidate to realize AVs via distinguishing traffic pattern, navigation, lane detection and self-parking etc. In this work, we have developed coherent detection-based linear frequency modulated continuous wave (LFMCW) photonic radar to detect multiple targets multiplexed over a single free space channel via polarization division multiplexing (PDM). Also, the proposed system is tested for detection under zero visibility conditions under the impact of atmospheric turbulences up to 140 m of range distance. The reported results in terms of range frequency peaks and signal to noise ratio (SNR) indicate successful detection of both the targets at 4 GHz of bandwidth. The system is further tested for moving traffic condition with the target speed of 50 km/hr and 100 km/hr, respectively. Lastly, the range resolution of the proposed system is tested and reported as 15 cm at 1 GHz and 6.75 cm with 4 GHz of bandwidth at a distance of 100 m.

AB This paper describes a quadcopter manipulator system, an aerial robot with an extended workspace, its controller design, and experimental validation. The aerial robot is based on a quadcopter with a three degree of freedom robotic arm connected to the base of the vehicle. The work aims to create a stable airborne robot with a robotic arm that can work above and below the airframe, regardless of where the arm is attached. Integrating a robotic arm into an underactuated, unstable system like a quadcopter can enhance the vehicle's functionality while increasing instability. To execute a mission with accuracy and reliability during a real-time task, the system must overcome the inter-coupling effects and external disturbances. This work presents a novel design for a robust adaptive feedback linearization controller with a model reference adaptive controller and hardware implementation of the quadcopter manipulator system with plant uncertainties. The closed-loop stability of the aerial robot and the tracking error convergence with the robust controller is analyzed using Lyapunov stability analysis. The quadcopter manipulator system is custom developed in the lab with an off-the-shelf quadcopter and a 3D-printed robotic arm. The robotic system architecture is implemented using a Jetson Nano companion computer for autonomous onboard flight. Experiments were conducted on quadcopter manipulator system to evaluate the autonomous aerial robot's stability and trajectory tracking with the proposed controller.

ID AUTONOMOUS UNDERWATER VEHICLES
AB This paper aims to focus on the path planning problem of AUV in the marine environment. As well as considering the path length and safe obstacle avoidance, ocean currents should not be ignored as the main factor affecting the navigation energy consumption of AUV. At the same time, the path should satisfy the mobility constraint of AUV; otherwise, the path is inaccessible to AUV. For the above problems, this paper presents a path planning algorithm based on an improved particle swarm (EPA-PSO); the fitness function is designed based on path length, energy consumption, and mobility constraints. The updated law of particle velocity and the initialization law of particles are improved, and the possible optimal solutions are stored in the feasible solution set; finally, the optimal solutions are obtained by comparison. The local jumping ability is given to the particle swarm so that the particles can jump out of the local optimal solution. The path planning simulation experiment is compared with the traditional PSO algorithm. The results show that the EPA-PSO algorithm proposed in this paper can be used in the AUV three-dimensional path planning process. It can effectively save energy and make the navigation path of AUV satisfy the requirements of maneuverability. The field experiment was completed in Shanghai, China, and the experiment proved that it was feasible to obtain a path satisfying the maneuverability constraints with optimal energy consumption for the problems studied in this paper.

By combining the well-known principles of time-gating and single-pixel detection with neural networks, we aim to ultimately detect objects within the scene rapidly and robustly with a low-cost sensor. Here, we evaluate the possible data reduction such a system can provide compared to a conventional time-gated camera.

   Feature recognition
AB Introduction Speed bumps are used as the main means of controlling vehicle speeds all over the world. It is not too infrequent, especially in the emerging economies, to have unmarked bumps that can be perilous for the passengers. Fortuitously, the roadways and mobile phone networks have grown simultaneously in emerging economies. This paper demonstrates the capability of smartphones placed inside the vehicles in characterisation of road bumps. The smart mobile phones have accelerometers and position sensors that can be useful for autonomous monitoring roads. This can empower the user community in monitoring of roads. However, the capability of the smartphone in discerning different types of speed bumps while travelling in heterogeneous vehicle types needs to be examined.
   Methods A range of road vehicles is mathematically modelled as mass, spring, and damper systems. The mathematical model of the vehicle is excited with parameters analogous to some common speed bumps and its acceleration response is calculated. The accelerometer of a smartphone is validated by comparing it with high precision accelerometers. The acceleration response of the phone while passing over the corresponding road bumps, which was used in the model earlier, is recorded using an Android based application. The experiment is repeated for different classes of vehicles. Filters have been used to reduce noise in the signals. A time averaging technique has been employed to compress the collected data.
   Results and conclusions The acceleration signals have been digitally processed to capture road bumps. The importance of using a mathematical model to understand the acceleration response of a vehicle has been established. Also, the use of pass filters to extract the signal of concern from the noisy data has been exhibited. The ability of the technique to discern different types of speed bumps while travelling in a variety of vehicle types has been demonstrated. This investigation demonstrates the potential to automatically monitor the condition of roadways obviating costly manual inspections. As smartphones are ubiquitous, the methodology has the potential to empower the user community in the maintenance of infrastructure.

AB Automated vehicles represent a technology that promises to increase mobility for many groups, including the senior population (those over age 65) but also for non-drivers and people with medical conditions. This paper estimates bounds on the potential increases in travel in a fully automated vehicle environment due to an increase in mobility from the non-driving and senior populations and people with travel-restrictive medical conditions. In addition, these bounding estimates indicate which of these demographics could have the greatest increases in annual vehicle miles traveled (VMT) and highlight those age groups and genders within these populations that could contribute the most to the VMT increases. The data source is the 2009 National Household Transportation Survey (NHTS), which provides information on travel characteristics of the U.S. population. The changes to light-duty VMT are estimated by creating and examining three possible travel demand wedges. In demand wedge one, non-drivers are assumed to travel as much as the drivers within each age group and gender. Demand wedge two assumes that the driving elderly (those over age 65) without medical conditions will travel as much as a younger population within each gender. Demand wedge three makes the assumption that working age adult drivers (19-64) with medical conditions will travel as much as working age adults without medical conditions within each gender, while the driving elderly with medical any travel-restrictive conditions will travel as much as a younger demographic within each gender in a fully automated vehicle environment. The combination of the results from all three demand wedges represents an upper bound of 295 billion miles or a 14% increase in annual light-duty VMT for the US population 19 and older. Since traveling has other costs besides driving effort, these estimates serve to bound the potential increase from these populations to inform the scope of the challenges, rather than forecast specific VMT scenarios.

AB The largely unexplored underwater world has strong and multifaceted ties with our lives. There are numerous ocean-related areas and applications, such as oceanography, climate, pollution, and environmental monitoring, that have created increasing demand for wireless acoustic data communication among underwater sensors, platforms, and autonomous vehicles. Contrary to wireless transmission in air, electromagnetic waves are strongly attenuated in water, whereas acoustic waves are proper carriers of information in water, since compared to electromagnetic waves, they typically incur less attenuation in water. However, the underwater bandwidth is usually highly limited. Here, we demonstrate that it is possible to multiplex multiple data streams over acoustic particle velocity field components using a proposed compact vector transmitter over the same bandwidth. In existing underwater communication systems, data are conventionally modulated on acoustic pressure, i.e., scalar component of the acoustic field, using one scalar transmitter. Arrays of several spatially-separated scalar transmitters are also used to transmit multiple data streams simultaneously. However, given the large size of equipment carrying an array of several transmitters, many modern underwater platforms, such as autonomous underwater vehicles, cannot use multiple transmitters. Our experimental results demonstrate that using the developed vector transmitter, together with the proposed physics-based particle velocity modulation method over co-located underwater vector field components, multiple data streams can be concurrently transmitted, without requiring additional bandwidth. Using our findings, small-size underwater acoustic systems, modems, and equipment can be built that benefit from the acoustic vector field components.

AB According to WHO, 1.35 million people, every year are cut short in road accidents, most of them caused due to human misconduct and ignorance. To improve safety over the roads, road perception and lane detection play a crucial part in avoiding accidents. Lane Detection is a constitution for various Advanced Driver Assisting System (ADAS) like Lane Keeping Assisting System (LKAS) and Lane Departure Warning System (LDWS). It also enables fully assistive and autonomous navigation in self-driving vehicles. Therefore, it has been an effective field of research for the past few decades, but various milestones are yet to be achieved. The problem has encountered various challenging scenarios due to the past limitations of resources and technologies. In this paper, we reviewed the different approaches based on image processing and computer vision that have revolutionized the lane detection problem. This paper also summarizes the different benchmark data sets for lane detection, evaluation criteria. We implemented Lane detection system using Unet and Segnet model and applied it on Tusimple dataset. The Unet performance is better as compared to Segnet model. We also compare the detection performance and running time of various methods, and conclude with some current challenges and future trends for deep learning-based lane marking detection algorithm. Finally, we compare various researcher's approaches with their performances. This paper concluded with the challenges to predict accurate lanes under different scenarios.

AB The core value of simulation-based autonomy tests is to create densely extreme traffic scenarios to test the performance and robustness of the algorithms and systems. Test scenarios are usually designed or extracted manually from the real-world data, which is inefficient with a remarkable domain gap compared with testing in real scenarios. Therefore, it is crucial to automatically generate realistic and diverse dynamic traffic scenarios making autonomy tests efficient. Moreover, scenario generation is expected to be interpretable, controllable, and diversified, which can be hard to achieve simultaneously by methods based on rules or deep networks. In this paper, we propose a dynamic traffic scenario generation method called SceGene, inspired by genetic inheritance and mutation processes in biological intelligence. SceGene applies biological processes, such as crossover and mutation, to exchange and mutate the content of scenarios, and involves the natural selection process to control generation direction. SceGene has three main parts: 1) a new representation method for describing the traffic scenarios feature; 2) a new scenario generation algorithm based on crossover, mutation, and selection; and 3) an abnormal scenario information repair method based on the microscopic driving model. Evaluation on the public traffic scenario dataset shows that SceGene can ensure highly realistic and diversified scenario generation in an interpretable and controllable way, significantly improving the efficiency of the simulation-based autonomy tests.

ID LEVEL CONTROL
AB The survivability of autonomous underwater vehicles (AUV) in complex missions and dangerous situations is of great significance to ocean resource exploration, hydrological research, maritime rescue, and undersea military. Existing researches on motion control for the AUV mainly focus on its normal operating, but the active self-rescue method in emergency situations is hardly found. As classical control methods are not sufficient enough for complicated self-rescue missions of the AUV, this paper uses the deep reinforcement learning (DRL) algorithm to solve this problem because the DRL algorithm has the advantages in learning and decision making for complex robot control missions. In this paper, the normal motion control of the AUV based on the deep deterministic policy gradient algorithm is explored, including the yaw angle adjustment, yaw angle adjustment extension, trajectory tracking, and normal floating-up control of the AUV. Then, active self-rescue methods are successfully achieved to recover the AUV from emergencies, such as ocean water density decreasing sharply or one fin getting jammed at a random angle. What is more, real environment experiments are successfully conducted on a self-developed platform of the AUV to validate the feasibility of the proposed control methods. The results can effectively improve the survivability of the AUV and can be a reference to submarine survivability technologies. (c) 2022 Author(s).

AB Vast and diverse microbial communities exist within the ocean. To better understand the global influence of these microorganisms on Earth's climate, we developed a robot capable of sampling dissolved and particulate seawater biochemistry across ocean basins while still capturing the fine-scale biogeochemical processes therein. Carbon and other nutrients are acquired and released by marine microorganisms as they build and break down organic matter. The scale of the ocean makes these processes globally relevant and, at the same time, challenging to fully characterize. Microbial community composition and ocean biochemistry vary across multiple physical scales up to that of the ocean basins. Other autonomous underwater vehicles are optimized for moving continuously and, primarily, horizontally through the ocean. In contrast, Clio, the robot that we describe, is designed to efficiently and precisely move vertically through the ocean, drift laterally in a Lagrangian manner to better observe water masses, and integrate with research vessel operations to map large horizontal scales to a depth of 6000 meters. We present results that show how Clio conducts high-resolution sensor surveys and sample return missions, including a mapping of 1144 kilometers of the Sargasso Sea to a depth of 1000 meters. We further show how the samples obtain filtered biomass from seawater that enable genomic and proteomic measurements not possible through in situ sensing. These results demonstrate a robotic oceanography approach for global-scale surveys of ocean biochemistry.

ID EXPLORATION
AB To autonomously explore complex underwater environments, it is convenient to develop motion planning strategies that do not depend on prior information. In this publication, we present a robotic exploration algorithm for autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) that is able to guide the robot so that it explores an unknown 2-dimensional (2D) environment. The algorithm is built upon view planning (VP) and frontier-based (FB) strategies. Traditional robotic exploration algorithms seek full coverage of the scene with data from only one sensor. If data coverage is required for multiple sensors, multiple exploration missions are required. Our approach has been designed to sense the environment achieving full coverage with data from two sensors in a single exploration mission: occupancy data from the profiling sonar, from which the shape of the environment is perceived, and optical data from the camera, to capture the details of the environment. This saves time and mission costs. The algorithm has been designed to be computationally efficient, so that it can run online in the AUV's onboard computer. In our approach, the environment is represented using a labeled quadtree occupancy map which, at the same time, is used to generate the viewpoints that guide the exploration. We have tested the algorithm in different environments through numerous experiments, which include sea operations using the Sparus II AUV and its sensor suite.

AB The fuzzy vault is an innovative way to share secret keys, combining traditional cryptography with biometrics and biometric template protection. This method forms the basis for the reliable operation of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) through anonymizing drone operators and safely using their data and onboard information. However, due to the inherent instability of biometrics, traditional fuzzy vault schemes face challenges, such as reduced recognition rates with increased chaff points, impractical runtimes due to high-order polynomial reconstruction, and susceptibility to correlation attacks. This paper proposes an efficient fuzzy vault scheme to address these challenges. We generate two secret keys based on biometrics: the first key is produced from the operator's unique features like the face and iris, using a confidence interval; the second key, used to construct a polynomial, is based on what the operator remembers. These dual-key fuzzy vaults enable the stable generation of genuine points during encoding, easy extraction during decoding, and effective operator authentication while maintaining anonymity. Our experimental results demonstrate improved security and secret acquisition accuracy using the AR face database. These results are achieved regardless of increased false vaults, enabling real-time polynomial reconstruction and resilience against correlation attacks. Importantly, our enhanced fuzzy vault scheme allows the application of this secure, real-time authentication process, safeguarding the anonymity of drone operators.

AB Cooperative navigation is part of the essential method for multiple autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) to gain an accurate position when performing tasks underwater. However, the positioning accuracy and stability of the traditional algorithms are affected by the dimension of state-space and the unknown time-varying noise in the ocean, which cannot meet the demand of the increasing positioning performance. For this problem, we propose a cooperative navigation method based on the augmented adaptive embedded cubature Kalman filter (A-AECKF) algorithm. Due to the non-additivity of the system noise in the realistic model of multi-AUV cooperative navigation, we augment the dimension of the state variables firstly, which combines with the system model to estimate the noise. Then we adopt embedded cubature criterion reselecting cubature points and their weights to minimize the positioning error caused by state augmentation. Finally, a nonlinear noise statistical estimator is used to estimate the time-varying ranging noise in real time, which effectively suppresses the positioning error caused by the non-Gaussian white noise. We evaluate the performance of the proposed A-AECKF cooperated navigation method comprehensively under the circumstance with high-dimensional state-space and the unknown time-varying measurement noise. Compared with other related algorithms, the experimental results indicate that the presented method possesses higher positioning accuracy and stability.

SO JOURNAL OF DYNAMIC SYSTEMS MEASUREMENT AND CONTROL-TRANSACTIONS OF THE

ID VISION
AB In order for autonomous vehicles to safely navigate the road ways, accurate object detection must take place before safe path planning can occur. Currently, general purpose object detection convolutional neural network (CNN) models have the highest detection accuracies of any method. However, there is a gap in the proposed detection frameworks. Specifically, those that provide high detection accuracy necessary for deployment but do not perform inference in realtime, and those that perform inference in realtime but detection accuracy is low. We propose multimodel fusion detection system (MFDS), a sensor fusion system that combines the speed of a fast image detection CNN model along with the accuracy of light detection and range (LiDAR) point cloud data through a decision tree approach. The primary objective is to bridge the tradeoff between performance and accuracy. The motivation for MFDS is to reduce the computational complexity associated with using a CNN model to extract features from an image. To improve efficiency, MFDS extracts complimentary features from the LiDAR point cloud in order to obtain comparable detection accuracy. MFDS is novel by not only using the image detections to aid three-dimensional (3D) LiDAR detection but also using the LiDAR data to jointly bolster the image detections and provide 3D detections. MFDS achieves 3.7% higher accuracy than the base CNN detection model and is able to operate at 10 Hz. Additionally, the memory requirement for MFDS is small enough to fit on the Nvidia Tx1 when deployed on an embedded device.

AB Mobile systems traveling through a complex environment present major difficulties in determining accurate dynamic models. Autonomous underwater vehicle motion in ocean conditions requires investigation of new control solutions that guarantee robustness against external parameter uncertainty. A diving-control design, based on Lyapunov theory and back-stepping techniques, is proposed and verified. Using adaptive and switching schemes, the control system is able to meet the required robustness. The results of the control system are theoretically proven and simulations are developed to demonstrate the performance of the solutions proposed. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Trajectory tracking and configuration stabilization for the vertical takeoff and landing (VTOL) aircraft has been so far considered in the literature only in the presence of a slight (or zero) input coupling (i.e., for a small epsilon). In this note, our main contribution is to address global configuration stabilization for the VTOL aircraft with a strong input coupling using a smooth static state feedback. In addition, the differentially flat outputs for the VTOL aircraft are automatically obtained as a by-product of applying a decoupling change of coordinates.

AB Path planning is one of the most important issues in the robotics field, being applied in many domains ranging from aerospace technology and military tasks to manufacturing and agriculture. Path planning is a branch of autonomous navigation. In autonomous navigation, dynamic decisions about the path have to be taken while the robot moves towards its goal. Among the navigation area, an important class of problems is Coverage Path Planning (CPP). The CPP technique is associated with determining a collision-free path that passes through all viewpoints in a specific area. This paper presents a method to perform CPP in 3D environment for Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) applications, namely 3D dynamic for CPP applications (3DD-CPP). The proposed method can be deployed in an unknown environment through a combination of linear optimization and heuristics. A model to estimate cost matrices accounting for UAV power usage is proposed and evaluated for a few different flight speeds. As linear optimization methods can be computationally demanding to be used on-board a UAV, this work also proposes a distributed execution of the algorithm through fog-edge computing. Results showed that 3DD-CPP had a good performance in both local execution and fog-edge for different simulated scenarios. The proposed heuristic is capable of re-optimization, enabling execution in environments with local knowledge of the environments.

AB In the past few decades, Intelligent Transport System (ITS) has gained the popularity in smart society. Global automotive stakeholders such as Google, Uber, and Toshiba are the driving force in that and also looking for the interconnection of autonomous vehicles (AVs) for road traffic management, that is, connected AVs (CAV). CAVs are vulnerable to various safety and security issues, for instance, denial-of-service, global positioning system (GPS) spoofing, man-in-the-middle, and timing attacks, which raise serious concerns for their development in application specific areas. Although many solutions exist in the literature, most of them are focused on centralized systems, which is having a single-point-failure. In light of the above facts, we analyze and classify the security and privacy issues in CAV and proposed a solution taxonomy in this article. We emphasized the defense mechanism for these attacks on the CAV system along with their enactment on issues and discovered how emergent blockchain technology could handle it. Furthermore, we proposed a blockchain-based secure and decentralized CAV architecture to mitigate security and privacy issues such as denial of service, man-in-the-middle, hijacking, GPS spoofing, and replay attacks. Finally, we reconnoiter the open research challenges associated with the blockchain-based CAV system. To validate the efficacy of the proposed system, a real-time case study on smart city integration over edge computing using computation and communication costs is proposed in this article.

AB This work presents an enhanced autonomous airborne Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) imaging system able to provide full 3D radar images from the subsurface. The proposed prototype and methodology allow the safe detection of both metallic and non-metallic buried targets even in difficult-to-access scenarios without interacting with the ground. Thus, they are particularly suitable for detecting dangerous targets, such as landmines and Improvised Explosive Devices (IEDs). The prototype is mainly composed by an Ultra-Wide-Band (UWB) radar module working from Ultra-High-Frequency (UHF) band and a high accuracy dual-band Real Time Kinematic (RTK) positioning system mounted on board an Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV). The UAV autonomously flies over the region of interest, gathering radar measurements. These measurements are accurately geo-referred so as to enable their coherent combination to obtain a well-focused SAR image. Improvements in the processing chain are also presented in order to deal with some issues associated to UAV-based measurements (such as non-uniform acquisition grids) as well as to enhance the resolution and the signal to clutter ratio of the image. Both the prototype and the methodology were validated with measurements, showing their capability to provide high-resolution 3D SAR images.

AB Using autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) for mapping underwater topography of seaice and icebergs, or detecting keels of ice ridges, is foreseen as enabling technology in future arctic marine operations. Wind, current, and Coriolis forces affect an iceberg's trajectory, making automated mapping difficult. This paper presents a method aiming at enabling autonomous iceberg mapping using AUVs equipped with a multibeam echosounder by estimating the position and orientation of the iceberg. The method is based on a bathymetric simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) algorithm, namely, the bathymetric distributed particle filter SLAM (BPSLAM) algorithm. The proposed method estimates the AUV's pose in an iceberg-fixed coordinate system. The relative states can be used for both guiding the vehicle to achieve complete coverage, as well as estimation of a consistent iceberg topography. The algorithm also provides an estimate of the iceberg's drift velocity - an important parameter for the AUV trajectory planning as well as any related ice management (IM) operations. Two new weighting algorithms for the BPSLAM method are proposed, enabling batch processing of multibeam echosounder (MBE) measurements to ensure real-time operation without discarding information. The proposed method is demonstrated using a real iceberg topography taken from the PERD iceberg sightings database, with simulated AUV and MBE range measurements. The algorithm is also evaluated on a real world bathymetric dataset, collected using the HUGIN HUS AUV.

   FEDERALISM; ENTRENCHMENT; INFORMATION; HEALTH; RULEMAKING
AB Why has the EPA not regulated fracking? Why has the FDA not regulated e-cigarettes? Why has NHTSA not regulated autonomous vehicles? This Article argues that administrative agencies predictably fail to regulate emerging risks when the political environment for regulation is favorable. The cause is a combination of administrative law and interest group politics. Agencies must satisfy high initial informational thresholds to regulate, so they postpone rulemaking in the face of uncertainty about the effects of new technologies. But while regulators passively acquire more information, fledgling industries consolidate and become politically entrenched. By the time agencies can justify regulation, the newly entrenched industries have the political capital to thwart them.
   This Article offers a prophylactic against this predictable regulatory failure. It defends an experimentalist model of regulation, in which agencies are empowered to impose moratoria on risky emerging technologies while regulators organize experiments to learn about the risks they pose and the means to mitigate them. The agency-coordinated experiments would expedite the promulgation of empirically informed rules. The moratoria would extend the political window for regulatory action and protect the public in the interim. The Article applies this experimentalist model to the regulation of fracking, ecigarettes, and autonomous vehicles. It also identifies legal strategies for implementing experimental regulation under existing law. It challenges the conventional wisdom that agencies should postpone regulation until they can confidently predict the effects of new risky technologies.

AB This paper presents an approach for defining, solving, and implementing dynamic cooperative maneuver problems in autonomous driving applications. The formulation of these problems considers a set of cooperating cars as part of a multiagent system. A reinforcement learning technique is applied to find a suboptimal policy. The key role in the presented approach is a multiagent maneuvering environment that allows for the simulation of car-like agents within an obstacle-constrained space. Each of the agents is tasked with reaching an individual goal, defined as a specific location in space. The policy is determined during the reinforcement learning process to reach a predetermined goal position for each of the simulated cars. In the experiments, three road scenarios-zipper, bottleneck, and crossroads-were used. The trained policy has been successful in solving the cooperation problem in all scenarios and the positive effects of applying shared rewards between agents have been presented and studied. The results obtained in this work provide a window of opportunity for various automotive applications.

AB To realize autonomous navigation and intelligent management in orchards, vehicles require real-time positioning and globally consistent mapping of surroundings with sufficient information. However, the unstructured and unstable characteristics of orchards present challenges for accurate and stable localization and mapping. This study proposes a framework fusing LiDAR, visual, and inertial data by using the extended Kalman filter (EKF) to achieve real-time localization and colorful LiDAR point-cloud mapping in orchards. First, the multi-sensor data were integrated into a loosely-coupled framework based on the EKF to improve the pose estimation, with the pose estimation from LiDAR and gyroscope acting as the predictions, while that from visual-inertial odometry acting as the observations. Then, the Loam_Livox algorithm was enhanced by incorporating color from the image into the LiDAR point cloud, enabling the real-time construction of a three-dimensional colorful map of the orchard. The method demonstrates a high accuracy for localization in different motion trajectories (average RMSE: 0.3436) and different scenarios (average RMSE: 0.1230) and clear and efficient construction of three-dimensional colorful mapping, taking only 75.01 ms in localization and mapping for a frame of LiDAR point cloud. This indicates the proposed method has a great potential for the autonomous navigation of agricultural vehicles.

AB This paper investigates the practical leader-follower formation control issue of underactuated vehicles. To achieve the waypoints-based formation navigation, the autonomous dynamic logic (ADL) guidance is proposed by incorporating the marine practice into the virtual ship-based formation guidance strategy. In the proposed guidance, only a dominant virtual leader is required for constructing the waypointsbased formation reference framework, which shows the simplicity and the practicability. As for the control part, a constrained output feedback algorithm is developed by means of the linear extended state observer (LESO). By constructing the augmented variable, the model uncertainty and unknown disturbances are integrated to be estimated and compensated together. In addition, a second-order dynamic auxiliary system is designed to handle the problem of actuator saturation, where two additional saturation compensation terms are introduced to stabilize the kinematics and the kinetics error dynamics, respectively, and the smoothness of constrained control signals can be guaranteed owing to the modification of Gaussian error function. Using the Lyapunov direct method, all signals in the closed-loop system are proved to be semi-global uniformly ultimately bounded (SGUUB). Finally, two simulation experiments, including the comparative experiment and the formation navigation experiment in the presence of simulated ocean disturbances, are carried out to illustrate the feasibility and the superiority of proposed scheme.

AB This study focuses on lightweight optimum design of head pressure shell of an autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) with reliability requirements. The grid sandwich structure is applied to the pressure shell for lightweight. An optimal mathematical model is established, which takes weight and the maximum von-Mises stress as objective and strength requirement as a constraint condition. This optimization model is solved by genetic algorithm (GA) based on back propagation (BP) neural network surrogate model, which is optimized by particle swarm optimization (PSO) for improving accuracy. Additionally, the randomness of geometry sizes, material properties and loads are considered to ensure reliability. A stress-strength interference model is established for obtaining failure probability and reliability according to statistical regularity of yield strength and the maximum von-Mises stress. The result shows that the weight of grid sandwich structure pressure shell is reduced by 38.26% compared with the solid pressure shell. The width of transverse grid has more influence on the maximum von-Mises stress than longitudinal grid. The critical load factor is 21.611 and buckling deformation will not occur under given conditions. The pressure shell with grid sandwich structure meets three sigma level with random variables, which can ensure enough reliability of AUV. The above analysis shows that application of grid sandwich structure to the pressure shell of AUV head is feasible.

AB Both backstepping control (BC) and sliding mode control (SMC) have been studied extensively over the past few decades, and many variations of controller designs based on them can be found in the literature. In this paper, sliding mode control in a backstepping framework (SBC) for a class of nonlinear systems is proposed and its connections to SMC studied. SMC is shown to be a special case of SBC. Without losing generality, the regulation control problem is studied, while tracking control is achieved by replacing the states with the difference between the states and their desired values. The SBCs are designed for nonlinear single-input-single-output (SISO) and multiple-input-multiple-output (MIMO) systems with the presence of bounded uncertainties from unmodeled dynamics, parametric variations, disturbances, and measurement noise, and the closed loop systems are proven to be asymptotically stable using the Lyapunov stability theory. The comparison of SBC to SMC from the design process, chattering effects, and chatter reduction are also discussed. SBC inherits the merits of backstepping control in choosing gains independently, while leveraging useful nonlinear dynamics for controller design simplification. Hence, it provides more flexibility in controller design in the sense of controlling coverage speed and making use of useful nonlinearities in the dynamics. To demonstrate the effectiveness of SBC, an application on cruise tracking control of an autonomous underwater vehicle was studied.

AB Operation of autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) in large spatiotemporal missions is currently challenged by onboard energy resources requiring manned support. With current methods, AUVs are programmed to return to a static charging station based on a threshold in their energy level. Although this approach has shown success in extending the operational life, it becomes impractical due to interruption of AUV operation and loss of energy needed to return to charging station. It is also not practical for large networks due to shortage of charging stations. We introduce mobile onsite power delivery, which will fundamentally change the range and duration of underwater operations. This letter presents a mission planning method to generate mobile charger trajectories, given pre-defined working AUV trajectories, considering environmental constraints such as currents and obstacles. The problem is formulated as a multiple generalized traveling salesman problem, which is then transformed into a traveling salesman problem. Energy cost in dynamic currents is integrated with a path planning algorithm using a grid-based environment model. A scheduling strategy extends the problem over multiple charging cycles. Simulation results show that the planning method significantly improves mission success and energy expenditure. Field experiments in Lake Superior using two types of AUVs, an unmanned surface vessel, and a manned support vessel validate the feasibility of the planned trajectories for long-term marine missions.

AB Currents, wind, bathymetry, and freshwater runoff are some of the factors that make coastal waters heterogeneous, patchy, and scientifically interesting-where it is challenging to resolve the spatiotemporal variation within the water column. We present methods and results from field experiments using an autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) with embedded algorithms that focus sampling on features in three dimensions. This was achieved by combining Gaussian process (GP) modeling with onboard robotic autonomy, allowing volumetric measurements to be made at fine scales. Special focus was given to the patchiness of phytoplankton biomass, measured as chlorophyll a (Chla), an important factor for understanding biogeochemical processes, such as primary productivity, in the coastal ocean. During multiple field tests in Runde, Norway, the method was successfully used to identify, map, and track the subsurface chlorophyll a maxima (SCM). Results show that the algorithm was able to estimate the SCM volumetrically, enabling the AUV to track the maximum concentration depth within the volume. These data were subsequently verified and supplemented with remote sensing, time series from a buoy and ship-based measurements from a fast repetition rate fluorometer (FRRf), particle imaging systems, as well as discrete water samples, covering both the large and small scales of the microbial community shaped by coastal dynamics. By bringing together diverse methods from statistics, autonomous control, imaging, and oceanography, the work offers an interdisciplinary perspective in robotic observation of our changing oceans.

DE Spatial fields-aided navigation; water current; seabed slope
AB This paper evaluates methods for the long-range navigation of autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) at a middle depth of deep water from the viewpoint of spatial fields-aided navigation. Motivated by experimental works on the geomagnetic field-aided navigation of aquatic animals, we focus on the application of inertia systems with reference to maps of geomagnetic and bathymetric fields of the Earth to the navigation of AUVs. The Inertia Navigation System (INS) in combination with acoustic transponders, the Doppler velocity log, normally used for navigation systems of AUVs near the sea floor, cannot be used for long-range navigation of an AUV at a middle depth of deep water. We first carried out experiments to obtain geomagnetic and bathymetric data in the Harima Sea with a gentle slope of the sea floor and geomagnetic field. At Suruga Bay, which has a steep seabed slope, however, we used a bathymetric map and digital geomagnetic map published by the Japan Coast Guard. We performed a simulation to evaluate the performance of these navigation methods, and found that the precision of navigation of an AUV in water current by the method using the geomagnetic map and bathymetric map without INS is better than by the method using INS alone or by the method using INS with a positional correction by geomagnetic and bathymetric information.

ID WIRELESS SENSOR NETWORK; COMPREHENSIVE SURVEY
AB Sensing plays a vital role in enabling smart cities. The mobile surveillance of different sectors, the retransmission of radio signals, and package delivery are the main applications conducted by unmanned vehicles in smart cities. Multiple unmanned vehicles or miniaturized real-time flying machines with onboard sensors, whether land- or air-based, communicate with each other to form a flying sensor network. Almost all of these machines are battery-operated. Therefore, power preservation is an extremely important factor to be taken into consideration. This paper proposes a power-aware biologically inspired secure autonomous routing protocol (P-BIOSARP) that depends on enhanced ant colony optimization (eACO). eACO autonomously and securely routes the data packet, and the power awareness maintains the power consumption of the flying sensor network. The novel intelligent power-aware routing protocol was implemented in network simulator 2 to perform a number of experiments with different scenarios. The scenarios included varying numbers of total nodes and mobile nodes, different packet rates, mobile source nodes, multiple mobile routing nodes, and, on the side of security, the injection of malicious nodes. The proposed protocol is compared with BIOSARP, E-BIOSARP, and SRTLD in terms of energy consumption, the delivery ratio, and traffic overhead. The analysis shows that the P-BIOSARP remarkably reduces energy consumption compared to other well-known protocols implemented on real testbeds.

An optimization-based controller commands the formation to follow an artistic trajectory defined by the director of photography, while actively avoiding collisions and cameras' mutual visibility. The proposed scheme, based on the cluster-space formulation, presents an intuitive way of maneuvering the virtual camera fixture while automatically adjusting the motions by imposing artistic and safety constraints, facilitating the operator task.

AB This paper describes the design, development, and testing of an automatic envelope protection system as implemented on Georgia Institute of Technology's unmanned helicopter GTMax. The envelope protection system makes use of online-learning adaptive neural networks to generate online dynamic models, which are used to estimate limits on controller commands. The system provides command capability up to the limit boundaries while preventing envelope exceedance. Simulation and flight-test results are provided for load factor and rotor stall limit protection during aggressive maneuvering.

AB Fuzzy logic control is a relatively new technology and hence it needs rigorous comparative experimental analyses with other well-established conventional control schemes. Further, fuzzy controller stability analysis is a major hindrance for its popularity among control engineers. In this paper, stable fuzzy variable structure systems or Sliding Mode Controllers (SMC) and fuzzy PD/PID controllers for steer and drive control of an Autonomous Guided Vehicle (AGV) are developed and implemented on an actual AGV. The synthesized controllers are further assessed against conventional SMC, PD/PID through actual implementation on a moderately sized outdoor AGV.

AB Autonomous Vehicles (AV s) take advantage of Machine Learning (ML) for yielding improved experiences of selfdriving. However, large-scale collection of AV s' data for training will inevitably result in a privacy leakage problem. Federated Learning (FL) is proposed to solve privacy leakage problems, but it is exposed to security threats such as model inversion, membership inference. Therefore, the vulnerability of the FL should be brought to the forefront when applying to AV s. We propose a novel Byzantine-Fault-Tolerant (BFT) decentralized FL method with privacy-preservation for AV s called BDFL. In this paper, a Peer-to-Peer (P2P) FL with BFT is built by extending the HydRand protocol. In order to protect theirmodel, eachAV uses the Publicly Verifiable Secret Sharing(PVSS) scheme, which allows anyone to verify the correctness of encrypted shares. The evaluation results on the MNIST dataset have shown that introducing decentralized FL into AV area is feasible, and the proposed BDFL is superior to other BFT-based FL method. Furthermore, the experimental results on KITTI dataset indicate the practicality of BDFL on improving performances of multi-object recognition in AV areas. Finally, the proposed PVSS-based data privacy preservation scheme is also justified its characteristic of no side-effect on models' parameters by the experiments on the MNIST and KITTI datasets.

TI Crater Navigation System for Autonomous Precision Landing on the Moon

DT Article
ID SPACECRAFT; IDENTIFICATION; ALGORITHM; MARS
AB Interest in autonomous planetary precision landing missions has been increasing in the scientific and engineering community, and is likely to continue to do so for the foreseeable future. As an enabling technology in the context of lunar landing, DLR, German Aerospace Center has been developing a terrain absolute navigation system that matches craters detected in image data to globally available lunar crater maps. The proposed Crater Navigation (CNav) system is adaptive, comprising three different crater matching methods that are specifically tailored to different navigation conditions encountered during the vehicle descent, so that it may be used as a stand-alone navigation sensor that can be closely integrated with a lander guidance, navigation, and control system to enable reliable absolute navigation throughout the entire descent phase of a mission. As robustness is a vital aspect to mission success, the CNav system includes verification mechanisms that ensure high dependability of the resulting navigation solution. This robustness is verified separately for all of the three different matching techniques presented in this paper. Closed-loop performance of the matchers is demonstrated as well, both for simulated image data sets, as for navigation camera images acquired during the Chinese Chang'e-3 landing mission. Successful uninterrupted estimation of the entire Chang'e-3 kinematic vehicle state during the powered descent until a final altitude of 350 m above ground, with neither known camera calibration nor inertial measurement unit data available, showcases the potential of the CNav system.

AB We present the first results of a system that allows small fixed-wing UAVs to land and cling on surfaces such as brick walls using arrays of microspines that engage asperities on the surface. The requirements of engaging and loading the spines lead to an approach in which an open-loop pitch-up motion is triggered by a range sensor as the plane nears the wall. The subsequent dynamics result in a period during which the plane stays within an envelope of acceptable orientation and velocity (pitch from 60-105 deg, vertical velocity from 0 to -aEuro parts per thousand 2.7 m/s and up to 3 m/s of horizontal velocity) that permit successful perching. At touchdown, a non-linear suspension absorbs the remaining kinetic energy to minimize peak forces, prevents bouncing and facilitates spine engagement. The total maneuver duration is less than 1 s. We describe the spine suspension and its analysis and present results of typical perching maneuvers (10 landings under autonomous control and 20 under manual control). Under calm conditions, the success rate for autonomous perching on building walls is approximately 80%, the failures being attributed to erroneous wall detection. We conclude with a discussion of future work to increase the robustness of the approach (e.g. with wind) and allow subsequent take-offs to resume flight.

ID DIGITAL WATERMARKING; ARCHITECTURE
AB The modern-day vehicle is evolved in a cyber-physical system with internal networks (controller area network (CAN), Ethernet, etc.) connecting hundreds of micro-controllers. From the traditional core vehicle functions, such as vehicle controls, infotainment, and power-train management, to the latest developments, such as advanced driver assistance systems (ADAS) and automated driving features, each one of them uses CAN as their communication network backbone. Automated driving and ADAS features rely on data transferred over the CAN network from multiple sensors mounted on the vehicle. Verifying the integrity of the sensor data is essential for the safety and security of occupants and the proper functionality of these applications. Though the CAN interface ensures reliable data transfer, it lacks basic security features, including message authentication, which makes it vulnerable to a wide array of attacks, including spoofing, replay, DoS, etc. Using traditional cryptography-based methods to verify the integrity of data transmitted over CAN interfaces is expected to increase the computational complexity, latency, and overall cost of the system. In this paper, we propose a light-weight alternative to verify the sensor data's integrity for vehicle applications that use CAN networks for data transfers. To this end, a framework for 2-dimensional quantization index modulation (2D QIM)-based data hiding is proposed to achieve this goal. Using a typical radar sensor data transmission scenario in an autonomous vehicle application, we analyzed the performance of the proposed framework regarding detecting and localizing the sensor data tampering. The effects of embedding-induced distortion on the applications using the radar data were studied through a sensor fusion algorithm. It was observed that the proposed framework offers the much-needed data integrity verification without compromising on the quality of sensor fusion data and is implemented with low overall design complexity. This proposed framework can also be used on any physical network interface other than CAN, and it offers traceability to in-vehicle data beyond the scope of the in-vehicle applications.

AB Distributed stochastic search is proposed for cooperative behavior in multi-robot systems. Distributed gradient is examined. This method consists of multiple stochastic search algorithms that start from different points in the solutions space and interact to each other while moving towards the goal position. Distributed gradient is shown to be efficient when the motion of the robots towards the goal position is described by a quadratic cost function. The algorithm's performance is evaluated through simulation tests. (c) 2007 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

ID CONGESTION
AB Current transport infrastructure and traffic management systems are overburdened due to the increasing demand for road capacity, which often leads to congestion. Building more infrastructure is not always a practical strategy to increase road capacity. Therefore, services from Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITSs) are commonly applied to increase the level of service. The growth of connected and autonomous vehicles (CAVs) brings new opportunities to the traffic management system. One of those approaches is Variable Speed Limit (VSL) control, and in this paper a VSL based on Q-Learning (QL) using CAVs as mobile sensors and actuators in combination with Speed Transition Matrices (STMs) for state estimation is developed and examined. The proposed Dynamic STM-QL-VSL (STM-QL-DVSL) algorithm was evaluated in seven traffic scenarios with CAV penetration rates ranging from 10% to 100%. The proposed STM-QL-DVSL algorithm utilizes two sets of actions that include dynamic speed limit zone positions and computed speed limits. The proposed algorithm was compared to no control, rule-based VSL, and two STM-QL-VSL configurations with fixed VSL zones. The developed STM-QL-DVSL outperformed all other control strategies and improved measured macroscopic traffic parameters like Total Time Spent (TTS) and Mean Travel Time (MTT) by learning the control policy for each simulated scenario.

AB Offshore wind farms are a crucial source of renewable energy, but maintenance and repair can be challenging due to their remote locations and harsh environmental conditions. Professional divers or Remotely Operated Vehicles (ROVs) are commonly used to conduct maintenance operations, but they come with high daily operational costs. Autonomous Underwater Vehicles (AUVs) have the potential to improve the efficiency, safety, and costs of maintenance operations. This project evaluates the feasibility of using an AUV to conduct a cathodic protection (CP) survey, which involves measuring the corrosion potential of underwater structures to prevent deterioration. The AUV is equipped with a manipulator that has a CP probe with a sharp tip to puncture through the structure's coating and make contact with the steel underneath. To ensure high accuracy and reduce environmental perturbances, the AUV attaches to the structure while conducting the survey. The technology and methods used in this project are demonstrated in a water tank using a Girona1000 AUV. Task Priority kinematic control is combined with a custom force control strategy based on admittance control to enable tracking of the end-effector configuration and contact force during the probing operation. The mission flow control is implemented using behavior trees. The results show that the use of AUVs for CP surveys is feasible and has the potential to significantly improve the efficiency, safety, and costs of maintenance operations in offshore wind farms.

ID OBJECT DETECTION; ADAPTATION
AB Convolutional neural networks based object detection usually assumes that training and test data have the same distribution, which, however, does not always hold in real-world applications. In autonomous vehicles, the driving scene (target domain) consists of unconstrained road environments which cannot all possibly be observed in training data (source domain) and this will lead to a sharp drop in the accuracy of the detector. In this paper, we propose a domain adaptation framework based on pseudo-labels to solve the domain shift. First, the pseudo-labels of the target domain images are generated by the baseline detector (BD) and optimized by our data optimization module to correct the errors. Then, the hard samples in a single image are labeled based on the optimization results of pseudo-labels. The adaptive sampling module is approached to sample target domain data according to the number of hard samples per image to select more effective data. Finally, a modified knowledge distillation loss is applied in the retraining module, and we investigate two ways of assigning soft-labels to the training examples from the target domain to retrain the detector. We evaluate the average precision of our approach in various source/target domain pairs and demonstrate that the framework improves over 10% average precision of BD on multiple domain adaptation scenarios on the Cityscapes, KITTI, and Apollo datasets.

TI Impacts of Holding Area Policies on Shared Autonomous Vehicle Operations
SO TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH RECORD
LA English
DT Article
ID SIMULATION; DEMAND; MOBILITY
AB Shared mobility has an important role in supporting existing transportation options in cities. However, when not deployed carefully, shared services may have operational inefficiencies such as low occupancies and increased deadheading. One reason is the spatio-temporal variance in the distribution of urban trip demand, which may lead to an unbalanced fleet displaced in cities thus unable to serve requested trips. Strategically siting holding areas (depots for dispatching and relocating fleets) could help improve fleet performance. Therefore, this paper considers shared autonomous vehicle (SAV) fleet operations by modeling the impacts of different holding area policies on service performance. Modeling and comparing multiple holding area policies for tactically deploying SAVs is novel, and the insights from this paper can inform service providers on how to site holding areas for improved performance. We develop a model of SAV fleet with pooling in the City of Toronto, with 27,951 total SAV trip requests across a 16-h period. We then integrate four holding area policies estimated using different spatial clustering methods, centralized positioning, and existing taxi stands. Findings indicate that using agglomerative clustering results in superior SAV fleet performances (average passenger waiting times reduced by about 20% compared with the worst performing policy), with increased served demand and reduced deadheading. A single holding area at a high trip density location yields efficient service performance at lower fleets but struggles to serve sparse demand (producing worst results); this method may suffice for operating SAV services within a small geofence with high trip densities.

AB Habitat use by the endangered Mediterranean sperm whale subpopulation remains poorly understood, especially in winter. The sustained presence of oceanographic autonomous underwater vehicles in the area presents an opportunity to improve observation effort, enabling collection of valuable sperm whale distribution data, which may be crucial to their conservation. Passive acoustic monitoring loggers were deployed on vertically profiling oceanographic gliders surveying the north-western Mediterranean Sea during winter 2012-2013 and June 2014. Sperm whale echolocation `usual click' trains, characteristic of foraging activity, were detected and classified from the recordings, providing information about the presence of sperm whales along the glider tracks. Widespread presence of sperm whales in the north-western Mediterranean Sea was confirmed. Winter observations suggest different foraging strategies between the Ligurian Sea, where mobile and scattered individuals forage at all times of day, and the Gulf of Lion, where larger aggregations target intense oceanographic features in the open ocean such as fronts and mixing events, with reduced acoustic presence at dawn. This study demonstrates the ability to successfully observe sperm whale behaviour from passive acoustic monitoring gliders. We identified possible mission design changes to optimize data collected from passive acoustic monitoring glider surveys and significantly improve sperm whale population monitoring and habitat use.

AB Future wireless communications aim to meet multifarious quality-of-experience (QoE) requirements for emerging applications, such as autonomous driving, personalized healthcare, and the Internet-of-Everything (IoE). In particular, in human-computer interaction scenarios, humans may simultaneously control multiple IoE devices using speech and augmented/ virtual reality commands, thus, making the communication pervasive in small-range wireless networks, which poses critical challenges to traditional bit-oriented communications. It is important for future wireless communications to support real-time human-to-machine and machine-to-machine interactions by using text, speech, image, and augmented/virtual reality. To support such interactions, the received information that ultimately matters is mostly intention-dependent rather than bit-information-dependent in the common sense. These applications motivate the development of task-oriented communication using advanced signal processing. However, there are still many fundamental problems that have not been well investigated in the task-oriented communications.

ID REINFORCEMENT LEARNING APPROACH; AUTONOMOUS SURFACE VEHICLES;
   COLLISION-AVOIDANCE
AB In the existing research on the intelligent navigation of ships, navigation route planning often regards light buoys as fixed obstructions. However, due to factors such as water ripples, the position of the buoys keeps periodically changing. If the buoys are set to a fixed range of avoidance areas in the process of ship navigation, it is easy to allow a collision between the ship and the light buoys. Therefore, based on historical motion trajectory data of the buoys, a SARIMA-based time-series prediction model is proposed to estimate the offset position of a given buoy in a specified time. Furthermore, the collision-free path planning approach is presented to dynamically recommend an accurate sailing path. The results of the simulation experiment show that this method can effectively deal with collisions of ships caused by the offset position of the light buoys during the navigation of the large and low-speed autonomous ships.

AB High-definition map building and map navigation systems often require detailed, complete, and up-to-date data of road markings. The real-time and accurate recognition of road markings also serves significantly to the autonomous vehicles. This letter designs a self-attention (SA)-guided high-resolution capsule network to conduct road marking extraction from aerial images. First, by combining the superiorities of capsule formulation and high-resolution network architecture, this model behaves advantageously in providing fine-grained and strong feature semantics for promoting pixel-wise marking extraction accuracy. Furthermore, boosted by the capsule-based SA and adversarial learning mechanisms, the feature encoding quality and robustness are positively enhanced. Quantitative assessments, qualitative inspections, and comparative analyses on two aerial image datasets prove the excellent feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed model in road marking extraction tasks.

AB Extensive manual driving is liable to attention lapses and driver exhaustion resulting in lane offset errors, driver comfort minimization and degradation in vehicle stability. On the contrary, apart from being expensive, autonomous vehicles suffer from the issue of trust, ethics and traffic mapping. In order to address the above limitations, this paper deals with the design of a Game Theoretic based Shared Control (GTSC) framework that enables an interaction between the human and the machine. The novelty lies in the generation of automatic driver automation relative weights based on the vehicle's lateral position relative to the maximum admissible lateral offset. The interaction between the human driver and automated system based on the cooperative game theory is utilized to develop a robust shared control framework. The driver model parameters have been estimated using the experimentally obtained driver steering torque and steering wheel angle respectively through an inverse modelling procedure. The lateral dynamics of the vehicle model in the presence of crosswinds and yaw moment as disturbances are considered for the design. A higher order sliding mode observer is designed to ensure robust estimation of the unknown states. Unlike the existing studies that primarily concentrates on the robust game theoretic shared controller design, this new study broadens its focus. The study introduces an observer-based robust design for GTSC and establishes the stability of the closed-loop system. The effectiveness of this proposed framework is verified through simulations in Carsim as well as real-world testing on a Hardware-in-the-loop (HIL) platform with a human driver. The study also addresses the challenge of obstacle avoidance using the GTSC framework. Comparisons have been performed with the state-of-the-art shared control studies while considering factors like crosswinds, variation in the longitudinal velocities and alterations in the reference path to evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed shared control study. The results demonstrate the improvement in the lateral offset, driver comfort and the vehicle stability compared to the manual control of the vehicle.

AB Deep reinforcement learning (DRL) is a promising way to achieve human-like autonomous driving. However, the low sample efficiency and difficulty of designing reward functions for DRL would hinder its applications in practice. In light of this, this article proposes a novel framework to incorporate human prior knowledge in DRL, in order to improve the sample efficiency and save the effort of designing sophisticated reward functions. Our framework consists of three ingredients, namely, expert demonstration, policy derivation, and RL. In the expert demonstration step, a human expert demonstrates their execution of the task, and their behaviors are stored as state-action pairs. In the policy derivation step, the imitative expert policy is derived using behavioral cloning and uncertainty estimation relying on the demonstration data. In the RL step, the imitative expert policy is utilized to guide the learning of the DRL agent by regularizing the KL divergence between the DRL agent's policy and the imitative expert policy. To validate the proposed method in autonomous driving applications, two simulated urban driving scenarios (unprotected left turn and roundabout) are designed. The strengths of our proposed method are manifested by the training results as our method can not only achieve the best performance but also significantly improve the sample efficiency in comparison with the baseline algorithms (particularly 60% improvement compared with soft actor-critic). In testing conditions, the agent trained by our method obtains the highest success rate and shows diverse and human-like driving behaviors as demonstrated by the human expert. We also find that using the imitative expert policy trained with the ensemble method that estimates both policy and model uncertainties, as well as increasing the training sample size, can result in better training and testing performance, especially for more difficult tasks. As a result, the proposed method has shown its potential to facilitate the applications of DRL-enabled human-like autonomous driving systems in practice. The code and supplementary videos are also provided. [https://mczhi.github.io/Expert-Prior-RL/]

AB Recently, IoV-based services and vehicles have come to the forefront as part of the growing market for the automobile industry. Since IoV-based services and vehicles were introduced, they have been expected to grow rapidly. However, contrary to optimistic expectations for future market growth, the IoV-based services and vehicles market has appeared to hit a roadblock and remains at an early market stage. Therefore, research of the determinants leading to consumers' intention to accept and purchase IoV-based services and vehicles is significant for either academics or practitioners. Drawing upon the extended unified theory of acceptance and use of technology acceptance model (UTAUT2), the perceived risk theory, and the initial trust model, we developed an integrated conceptual model and explored what and how various determinant antecedent conditions fit together on consumer intention to accept IoV-based services and vehicles. The proposed model and hypotheses were assessed by both symmetric (partial least square structural equation modeling, PLS-SEM) and asymmetric (fsQCA) approaches using online survey datasets with 362 Chinese consumers. The findings suggest that PLS-SEM and fsQCA are complementary analytical techniques providing comparable results. PLS-SEM results indicate that performance expectancy, price value, habit, and initial trust have significant effects on behavioral intention to accept IoV services. Despite other determinants, e.g., effort expectancy, social influence, facilitating conditions, hedonic motivation, and perceived risk, have no significant effect. FsQCA results reveal twelve different configurations of determinants resulting in a high level of behavioral intention to accept IoV services, and eight causal paths equifinally leading to the negation of behavioral intention to accept IoV services. These findings suggest that several conditions that were not significant in PLS-SEM are sufficient conditions when combined with other conditions. This study enriches relevant research studies on IoV-based services acceptance and provides relevant insights and marketing suggestions for incentivizing consumers to accept the IoV-based services.

AB The visual loop-closure detection for autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) is a key component to reduce the drift error accumulated in simultaneous localization and mapping tasks. However, due to viewpoint changes, textureless images, and fast-moving objects, the loop closure detection in dramatically changing underwater environments remains a challenging problem to traditional geometric methods. Inspired by strong feature learning ability of deep neural networks, we propose an underwater loop-closure detection method based on a variational autoencoder network in this article. Our proposed method can learn effective image representations to deal with the challenges caused by dynamic underwater environments. Specifically, the proposed network is an unsupervised method, which avoids the difficulty and cost of labeling a great quantity of underwater data. Also included is a semantic object segmentation module, which is utilized to segment the underwater environments and assign weights to objects in order to alleviate the impact of fast-moving objects. Furthermore, an underwater image description scheme is used to enable efficient access to geometric and object-level semantic information, which helps to build a robust and real-time system in dramatically changing underwater scenarios. Finally, we test the proposed system under complex underwater environments and get a recall rate of 92.31% in the tested environments.

AB With small size, high flexibility, low cost, and deployment convenience, Micro-sized autonomous underwater vehicle (Micro-AUV) is capable of performing diverse underwater missions efficiently in confined underwater space, for the extensive purpose of rescue, sightseeing, pipeline engineering and so on. The underwater acoustic (UWA) communication technique provides an effective way to support this types of underwater mission for telemetry and remote control of Micro-AUV. However, while the adverse multipath caused by confined space poses significant challenge to the classic coherent acoustic communication schemes that need channel estimation and equalization processing, the employment of non-coherent communication scheme is generally limited by low data rate. By utilizing time-domain and frequency-domain differential modulation to suppress the influence of multipath, a low-complexity UWA communication payload is designed to provide an effective solution to make a tradeoff between data rate and implementation complexity. Based on a STM32 series processor, this paper introduced the software and hardware implementation of a time-frequency differential OFDM UWA communication payload for Micro-AUV and presented the performance evaluation of the system in confined underwater space. The experimental results achieved in a confined lake show that the proposed system has the potential of being used for Micro-AUV to achieve a data rate of 1.96 kbps at a distance of 200m with acceptable implementation overhead.

AB This study proposes a method for generating a high-precision three-dimensional (3D) map using two-dimensional (2D) sonar images from an imaging sonar installed on an autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV). The 2D sonar image sequence was analyzed pairwise to estimate the amount of displacement and used to create a 2D mosaic sonar image. The mosaic sonar map contains intensity information in a wide area and precise shape information but has no height information. To overcome this limitation, we can generate a 3D point cloud from 2D sonar image sequences. This method takes advantage of the mobility of the AUV to reconstruct the height information and partially solves the ambiguity issues in the imaging sonar's elevation angle. The height map generated from the 3D point cloud contains height information of a wide area, but the shape information is inaccurate. By fusing two maps to complement each other's imperfections, we can generate a precise 3D sonar map. This map enables the AUV to estimate the pose and recognize the surrounding environment. We verified the proposed method by conducting experiments in an indoor water tank. After placing various objects on the floor, the AUV with the imaging sonar scanned the floor and objects to generate a 3D sonar map. We analyzed the estimated AUV trajectory and the accuracy of the 3D sonar map.

AB Recent developments in the state-of-the-art Intelligent Transportation Systems enable autonomous vehicles to offer significant safety services to take appropriate and prompt actions to avoid any probable unfortunate road-hazard. As the utmost functions of the advanced driving assistance system-equipped autonomous vehicles governed by the equipped radar, therefore, the radar system should have the ability to track multiple-targets accurately with high radar-resolutions. Unlike the microwave-radar, the photonic-radar comes out as an attractive candidate owing to provide wide-spectra to attain improved and precise radar-resolutions at low-power requirements along with extended target-range even under severe atmospheric fluctuations. Therefore, a linear frequency-modulated continuous-wave photonic-radar is developed in this work to carry out a radar cross-section-based tracking of multiple mobile-targets in the presence of fog, cloud, and rain. Besides it, some complex real-time traffic-scenarios consisting of multiple mobile-targets make the target-detection, data-association, and classification processes more complicated. Therefore, this work is tested for different multiple-mobile targets in different complicated traffic-scenarios modeled by using MATLAB (TM) software. The performance of the demonstrated photonic-radar is assessed through the power spectral density and range-Doppler mapping measurements. Furthermore, a comparison of the developed photonic-radar is also established with conventional microwave-radar to present a comparative analysis.

AB An adaptive self-organizing map (SOM) neural network method is proposed for distributed formation control of a group of autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs). This method controls the AUVs holding their positions in the formation when the formation moves as a whole. The group of AUVs can reach the desired locations in an expected formation shape along preplanned trajectories. The proposed control law is distributed in the sense that the controller of each AUV only uses its own information and limited information of its neighboring AUVs. Formation-control strategies based on self-organizing competitive calculations are carried out with workload balance taken into consideration, so that a group of AUVs can reach the desired locations on the premise of workload balance and energy sufficiency. Moreover, the formation can avoid obstacles and change its shape as needed. The formation is in a distributed leader-follower-like structure, but there is no need to designate the leader and the followers explicitly. All the AUVs in the formation are treated equal to be the leader and the followers, so that important characteristics such as adaption and fault tolerance are achieved. Comparison results with traditional methods and experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.

AB Mobile robots with manipulators have been more and more commonly applied in extreme and hostile environments to assist or even replace human operators for complex tasks. In addition to autonomous abilities, mobile robots need to facilitate the human-robot interaction control mode that enables human users to easily control or collaborate with robots. This paper proposes a system which uses human gestures to control an autonomous mobile robot integrating a manipulator and a video surveillance platform. A human user can control the mobile robot just as one drives an actual vehicle in the vehicle's driving cab. The proposed system obtains human's skeleton joints information using a motion sensing input device, which is then recognized and interpreted into a set of control commands. This is implemented, based on the availability of training data set and requirement of in-time performance, by an adaptive cerebellar model articulation controller neural network, a finite state machine, a fuzzy controller and purposely designed gesture recognition and control command generation systems. These algorithms work together implement the steering and velocity control of the mobile robot in real-time. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed approach is able to conveniently control a mobile robot using virtual driving method, with smooth manoeuvring trajectories in various speeds.

AB This paper presents a single-chip, high-performance, and energy-efficient stereo vision depth-estimation processor for micro aerial vehicles (MAVs). The proposed processor implements the state-of-the-art semi-global matching (SGM) algorithm to deliver full high-definition (HD, 1920 x 1080) stereo-depth outputs with a maximum of 38 frames/s throughput. Algorithm-architecture co-optimization is conducted, introducing overlapping block-based processing that eliminates very large on-chip memory and off-chip DRAM. We exploit inherent data parallelism in the algorithm by processing 128 local disparity costs and aggregating the SGM costs along four paths for all 128 disparities in parallel. A dependence-resolving scan associated with 16-stage deep pipeline is introduced to hide the data dependence between neighboring pixels in the SGM algorithm. Moreover, we propose a customized ultra-high bandwidth dual-port SRAM that utilizes the unique memory access characteristic of SGM to achieve highly energy-efficient memory access at a very high on-chip memory bandwidth of 1.64 Tb/s. The fabricated processor produces 512 levels of depth information for each pixel at full HD resolution with 30-frames/s performance, consuming 836 mW from a 0.75-V supply in TSMC 40-nm GP CMOS. We ported the design on a quadcopter MAV to demonstrate its performance in realistic real-time flight.

AB An integrated multiple autonomous underwater vehicles (multi-AUV) dynamic task assignment and path planning algorithm is proposed for three-dimensional underwater workspace with ocean current. The proposed algorithm in this paper combines biological inspired self-organizing map (BISOM) and a velocity synthesis algorithm (VS). The goal is to control a team of AUVs to visit all targets, while guaranteeing AUV's motion can offset the impact of ocean currents. First, the SOM neural network is developed to assign a team of AUVs to achieve multiple target locations in underwater environments. Then to avoid obstacle autonomously for each AUV to visit the corresponding target, the biological inspired neurodynamics model (BINM) is used to update weights of the winner of SOM, and realize AUVs path planning autonomously. Lastly, the velocity synthesis algorithm is applied to optimize a path for each AUV to visit the corresponding target in dynamic environment with the ocean current. To demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm, simulation results are given in this paper. Undoubtedly, the proposed algorithm is capable of dealing with task assignment and path planning in different environment. The path of the AUV is not affected by the effects of ocean currents and there are no great changes.

AB Volcanic seamount chains on the flanks of mid-ocean ridges record variability in magmatic processes associated with mantle melting over several millions of years. However, the relative timing of magmatism on individual seamounts along a chain can be difficult to estimate without in situ sampling and is further hampered by Ar-40/Ar-39 dating limitations. The 8 degrees 20'N seamount chain extends similar to 170 km west from the fast-spreading East Pacific Rise (EPR), north of and parallel to the western Siqueiros fracture zone. Here, we use multibeam bathymetric data to investigate relationships between abyssal hill formation and seamount volcanism, transform fault slip, and tectonic rotation. Near-bottom compressed high-intensity radiated pulse, bathymetric, and sidescan sonar data collected with the autonomous underwater vehicle Sentry are used to test the hypothesis that seamount volcanism is age-progressive along the seamount chain. Although sediment on seamount flanks is likely to be reworked by gravitational mass-wasting and current activity, bathymetric relief and Sentry vehicle heading analysis suggest that sedimentary accumulations on seamount summits are likely to be relatively pristine. Sediment thickness on the seamounts' summits does not increase linearly with nominal crustal age, as would be predicted if seamounts were constructed proximal to the EPR axis and then aged as the lithosphere cooled and subsided away from the ridge. The thickest sediments are found at the center of the chain, implying the most ancient volcanism there, rather than on seamounts furthest from the EPR. The nonlinear sediment thickness along the 8 degrees 20'N seamounts suggests that volcanism can persist off-axis for several million years.

AB Communication system design has been traditionally guided by task-agnostic principles, which aim at efficiently transmitting as many correct bits as possible through a given channel. However, in the era of cyber-physical systems, the effectiveness of communications is not dictated simply by the bit rate, but most importantly by the efficient completion of the task in hand, e.g., controlling remotely a robot, automating a production line or collaboratively sensing through a drone swarm. In parallel, it is projected that by 2023, half of the worldwide network connections will be among machines rather than humans. In this context, it is crucial to establish a new paradigm for designing communication strategies for multi-agent cyber-physical systems. This is a daunting task, since it requires a combination of principles from information, communication, control theories and computer science in order to formalize a general framework for task-oriented communication designs. In this direction, this paper reviews and structures the relevant theoretical work across a wide range of scientific communities. Subsequently, it proposes a general conceptual framework for task-oriented communication design, along with its specializations according to targeted use cases. Furthermore, it provides a survey of relevant contributions in dominant applications, such as industrial internet of things, multi-unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) systems, autonomous vehicles, distributed learning systems, smart manufacturing plants, 5G and beyond self-organizing networks, and tactile internet. Finally, this paper also highlights the most important open research topics from both the theoretical framework and application points of view.

AB Water is one of the most precious resources. However, industrial development has made water pollution a critical problem today and thus water quality monitoring and surface cleaning are essential for water resource protection. In this study, we have used the sensor fusion technology as a basis to develop a multi-function unmanned surface vehicle (MF-USV) for obstacle avoidance, water-quality monitoring, and water surface cleaning. The MF-USV comprises a USV control unit, a locomotion module, a positioning module, an obstacle avoidance module, a water quality monitoring system, a water surface cleaning system, a communication module, a power module, and a remote human-machine interface. We equip the MF-USV with the following functions: (1) autonomous obstacle detection, avoidance, and navigation positioning, (2) water quality monitoring, sampling, and positioning, (3) water surface detection and cleaning, and (4) remote navigation control and real-time information display. The experimental results verified that when the floating garbage located in the visual angle ranged from -30 degrees to 30 degrees on the front of the MF-USV and the distances between the floating garbage and the MF-USV were 40 and 70 cm, the success rates of floating garbage detection are all 100%. When the distance between the floating garbage and the MF-USV was 130 cm and the floating garbage was located on the left side (15 degrees similar to 30 degrees), left front side (0 degrees similar to 15 degrees), front side (0 degrees), right front side (0 degrees similar to 15 degrees), and the right side (15 degrees similar to 30 degrees), the success rates of the floating garbage collection were 70%, 92%, 95%, 95%, and 75%, respectively. Finally, the experimental results also verified that the applications of the MF-USV and relevant algorithms to obstacle avoidance, water quality monitoring, and water surface cleaning were effective.

AB In this article, we present a hybrid feedback approach to solve the navigation problem in the n-dimensional space containing an arbitrary number of ellipsoidal obstacles. The proposed algorithm guarantees both global asymptotic stabilization to a target position and avoidance of the obstacles. The controller, exploiting hysteresis regions, employs a Zeno-free switching between two modes of control: stabilization and avoidance. Simulation results illustrate the performance of the proposed approach for 2-D and 3-D scenarios.

AB The paper considers the distortion performance of mobile underwater acoustic networks. The network is composed of autonomous underwater vehicles (AUV's) that utilize multihop transmissions to route the information through the network. The mobility model is direction persistent. The distortion is evaluated in the context of an independent identically distributed (i.i.d.) Gaussian source and single description coding. Each AUV-to-AUV channel experiences frequency dependent path loss and Ricean fading, as well as interference from other network transmissions. Numerical examples illustrate the distortion performance. (C) 2018 Shanghai Jiaotong University. Published by Elsevier B.V.

AB Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) often rely on vast datasets for training. Given the large size of such datasets, it is conceivable that they contain specific samples that either do not contribute or negatively impact the DNNs optimization. Modifying the training distribution to exclude such samples could provide an effective solution to improve performance and reduce training time. This paper proposes to scale up ensemble Active Learning (AL) methods to perform acquisition at a large scale (10k to 500k samples at a time). We do this with ensembles of hundreds of models, obtained at a minimal computational cost by reusing intermediate training checkpoints. This allows us to automatically and efficiently perform a training data subset search for large labeled datasets. We observe that our approach obtains favorable subsets of training data, which can be used to train more accurate DNNs than training with the entire dataset. We perform an extensive experimental study of this phenomenon on three image classification benchmarks (CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and ImageNet), as well as an internal object detection benchmark for prototyping perception models for autonomous driving. Unlike existing studies, our experiments on object detection are at the scale required for production-ready autonomous driving systems. We provide insights on the impact of different initialization schemes, acquisition functions, and ensemble configurations at this scale. Our results provide strong empirical evidence that optimizing the training data distribution can significantly benefit large-scale vision tasks.

AB Federated Learning (FL) has been foundational in improving the performance of a wide range of applications since it was first introduced by Google. Some of the most prominent and commonly used FL-powered applications are Android's Gboard for predictive text and Google Assistant. FL can be defined as a setting that makes on-device, collaborative Machine Learning possible. A wide range of literature has studied FL technical considerations, frameworks, and limitations with several works presenting a survey of the prominent literature on FL. However, prior surveys have focused on technical considerations and challenges of FL, and there has been a limitation in more recent work that presents a comprehensive overview of the status and future trends of FL in applications and markets. In this survey, we introduce the basic fundamentals of FL, describing its underlying technologies, architectures, system challenges, and privacy-preserving methods. More importantly, the contribution of this work is in scoping a wide variety of FL current applications and future trends in technology and markets today. We present a classification and clustering of literature progress in FL in application to technologies including Artificial Intelligence, Internet of Things, blockchain, Natural Language Processing, autonomous vehicles, and resource allocation, as well as in application to market use cases in domains of Data Science, healthcare, education, and industry. We discuss future open directions and challenges in FL within recommendation engines, autonomous vehicles, IoT, battery management, privacy, fairness, personalization, and the role of FL for governments and public sectors. By presenting a comprehensive review of the status and prospects of FL, this work serves as a reference point for researchers and practitioners to explore FL applications under a wide range of domains.

AB This study applied the Theory of Planned Behaviour (TPB) to assess individuals' intentions to use fully automated shared passenger shuttles when they become publicly available. In addition, perceived trust was assessed to examine the extent to which this variable could account for additional variance in intentions above the TPB constructs of attitudes, subjective norms, and perceived behavioural control (PBC). Further, and also guided by the TPB, the study explored the differences in behavioural, normative, and control beliefs between individuals who reported high intentions to use automated passenger shuttles in the future (high intenders) and individuals who reported low intentions to use fully automated shared passenger shuttles in the future (low intenders). Participants (N = 438; 64% female) aged between 17 and 84 years (Mage = 35.42 years) were asked to complete an online questionnaire which took approximately 15 min. The findings revealed that attitudes, subjective norms, and PBC were significant positive predictors of intentions to use fully automated shared passenger shuttles when they become publicly available. When perceived trust was added to the hierarchical regression, this variable was shown to account for additional significant variance in intentions above the TPB constructs and was shown to be a significant positive predictor of intentions. Further, the results revealed significant differences in beliefs held by high and low intenders. Specifically, high intenders held significantly more positive beliefs towards fully automated shared passenger shuttles than low intenders. In turn, low intenders held significantly more negative beliefs towards these vehicles than high intenders. Overall, these findings provide support for the utility of the TPB in examining individuals' intentions to use fully automated shared passenger shuttles when they become publicly available.

AB This paper focuses on developing a data-driven trajectory tracking control approach for autonomous underwater vehicles (AUV) under uncertain external disturbance and time-delay. A novel model-free adaptive predictive control (MFAPC) approach based on a fuzzy state observer (FSO) was designed to achieve high precision. Concretely, the mathematical model of AUV motion was analyzed, and simplified via model decoupling, thus providing the model basis with an explicit physical explanation for the controller. Second, the MFAPC scheme for a multiple-inputs and multiple-outputs (MIMO) discrete time system was derived, that estimates system external disturbance. The controller can online estimate and predictive time-varying parameter pseudo-Jacobian matrix (PJM) to establish equivalent state space data-model for AUV motion system. Third, the Takagi-Sugeno (T-S) fuzzy model based state observer was designed to combine with the MFAPC scheme for the first time, which was used to online decline the state error generated by system uncertain time-delay. In addition, the stability of the proposed control scheme was analyzed. Finally, two trajectory tracking scenarios were designed to verify the effectiveness and robustness of the proposed FMFAPC scheme, and the simulations are implemented using the realistic parameters of T-SEA AUV.

AB Underwater acoustic sensor networks (UASNs) have been widely applied in marine monitoring, military reconnaissance, hydrology surveys, etc. Their location information is an important apriori knowledge when they are carried out underwater. However, the complex underwater environments impose great challenges on location acquisition, especially for autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs), because of their mobility and finite power. In UASNs, existing location and navigation methods can offer AUVs position information, but they may either need a doppler velocity log (DVL), which is inefficient due to the complex underwater environments, or they may require additional localization infrastructure to deploy underwater, which suffers from large communication latency among AUVs, and costs enormous power. In this article, an efficient velocity estimation and location prediction method (VELP) in UASNs is proposed to avoid the above restrictions. It only utilizes collaborations based on communication among AUVs to achieve higher precision location with lower cost. Specifically, we apply an AUV-assisted velocity estimation algorithm with Doppler shift estimation in the physical layer of UASNs to improve the velocity estimation accuracy instead of the DVL. Meanwhile, we build a belief propagation-neural network-based location prediction model, which decreases the communication requirements and obviates introducing modeling errors. Extensive experimental results show VELP achieves superior performance on both accuracy and efficiency, demonstrating its great advantage in offering AUVs' location information.

AB The capability of drones to perform autonomous missions has led retail companies to use them for deliveries, saving time and human resources. In these services, the delivery depends on the Global Positioning System (GPS) to define an approximate landing point. However, the landscape can interfere with the satellite signal (e.g., tall buildings), reducing the accuracy of this approach. Changes in the environment can also invalidate the security of a previously defined landing site (e.g., irregular terrain, swimming pool). Therefore, the main goal of this work is to improve the process of goods delivery using drones, focusing on the detection of the potential receiver. We developed a solution that has been improved along its iterative assessment composed of five test scenarios. The built prototype complements the GPS through Computer Vision (CV) algorithms, based on Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), running in a Raspberry Pi 3 with a Pi NoIR Camera (i.e., No InfraRed-without infrared filter). The experiments were performed with the models Single Shot Detector (SSD) MobileNet-V2, and SSDLite-MobileNet-V2. The best results were obtained in the afternoon, with the SSDLite architecture, for distances and heights between 2.5-10 m, with recalls from 59%-76%. The results confirm that a low computing power and cost-effective system can perform aerial human detection, estimating the landing position without an additional visual marker.

ID AUTONOMOUS UNDERWATER VEHICLE; ROBUST-CONTROL; DESIGN; IDENTIFICATION
AB In this paper, a predictive controller approach is proposed for depth and steer control of an Autonomous Underwater Vehicle (AUV). The predictive controller is an advanced control technique that performs control in form of online at any sampling time. AUV control has a lot of complexity due to the coupled nonlinear dynamics, parametric uncertainty and external disturbances due to underwater conditions. In addition, the AUV in this paper has constraints on actuators, which make its control more complicated. One of the challenges against implementing of predictive controller is their computational burden and the time consuming control operations at each time step. In this research, the Laguerre orthogonal functions are used for the predictive controller design to optimize and educe computational burden in time interval. The designed controller has several advantages such as being online and optimized, high accuracy, implementation capability, interaction with the constraints and robustness to disturbances. In order to demonstrate the efficiency of the method, the proposed controller is simulated for the AUV and the calculation time of the controllers with and without the Laguerre functions is compared with each other. Using Laguerre functions, the simulation results and their implementation on the board show the favorable efficiency and effectiveness of the proposed controller. Additionally, we have compared the proposed method with the LQR method. The obtained results confirm the superiority of various predictive controller methods.

AB This paper reports on a system for an autonomous underwater vehicle to perform in situ, multiple session hull inspection using long-term simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM). Our method assumes very little a priori knowledge, and it does not require the aid of acoustic beacons for navigation, which is a typical mode of navigation in this type of application. Our system combines recent techniques in underwater saliency-informed visual SLAM and a method for representing the ship hull surface as a collection of many locally planar surface features. This methodology produces accurate maps that can be constructed in real-time on consumer-grade computing hardware. A single-session SLAM result is initially used as a prior map for later sessions, where the robot automatically merges the multiple surveys into a common hull-relative reference frame. To perform the relocalization step, we use a particle filter that leverages the locally planar representation of the ship hull surface, and a fast visual descriptor matching algorithm. Finally, we apply the recently developed graph sparsification tool, generic linear constraints, as a way to manage the computational complexity of the SLAM system as the robot accumulates information across multiple sessions. We show results for 20 SLAM sessions for two large vessels over the course of days, months, and even up to three years, with a total path length of approximately 10.2 km.

AB An ODYSSEY autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) was deployed in Massachusetts and Cape Cod Bays in September 1998 to collect chlorophyll fluorescence, optical backscattering (880nm), and physical data. It sampled the region mainly in a sawtooth pattern with horizontal resolution between similar to 120 m at the middle of the water column and with vertical resolution of 0.1 m. The data were used to quantify various features in both physical and bio-optical properties in the Bays. In particular, an upwelling front with enhanced chlorophyll fluorescence was found off the coast of Race Point. Chlorophyll patches with along-track spatial scales less than 3.6 km were found southeast of Plymouth and southwest of Race Point. Southeast of Plymouth, strong sediment re-suspension was also evident. In the early fall, the water column was characterized. by three layers: warm and fresh surface water; cold and salty bottom water; and a transition (pycnocline) layer with sharp vertical temperature and salinity gradients. A relatively thin chlorophyll maximum layer was evident in the strong pycnocline. This work represents one of the first successful applications of AUVs for interdisciplinary coastal research. Our results demonstrate that AUVs can provide high-quality, concurrent measurements of physical and bio-optical properties in a very effective manner. Some future uses of AUVs are suggested.

SO JOURNAL OF GUIDANCE CONTROL AND DYNAMICS
LA English
DT Article
AB Algorithms for autonomous guidance of spacecraft to approach, to fly around, and to depart from a target vehicle in a circular orbit are presented. The algorithms are based on the closed-form solution of linear Clohessy-Wiltshire equations. The approach and departure algorithms are adaptations of the glideslope guidance used in the past for rendezvous and proximity operations of the space shuttle with other vehicles with astronauts in the guidance loop. The multipulse glideslope algorithms are general, capable of effecting a translation motion of spacecraft in any direction in space autonomously, decelerating while approaching a target or a nearby location, and accelerating while receding. The flyaround algorithm enables the spacecraft to circumnavigate a target spacecraft in any plane, the orbit plane and the local horizontal plane being two special cases thereof. The circumnavigation is performed in a specified period using a specified number of pulses; the larger the number of pulses, the smaller the deviation of flyaround from the specified radius of circumnavigation. The implementation of these algorithms requires estimates of position and velocity of the spacecraft relative to the target. This relative navigation is performed with an extended Kalman filter using range and angle measurements of the target relative to the spacecraft focal plane and the spacecraft attitude estimates from an inertial navigation system. The corresponding measurement models and process noise matrix are provided. Several scenarios are simulated to illustrate the guidance algorithms and relative navigation.

AB The development of agricultural farming has evolved from traditional agricultural machinery due to its efficiency and autonomy. Intelligent agricultural machinery is capable of autonomous driving and remote control, but due to its limited perception of farmland and field obstacles, the assistance of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) is required. Although existing intelligent systems have greater advantages than traditional agricultural machinery in improving the quality of operations and reducing labor costs, they also produce complex operational planning problems. Especially as agricultural products and fields become more diversified, it is necessary to develop an adaptive operation planning method that takes into account the efficiency and quality of work. However, the existing operation planning methods lack practicality and do not guarantee global optimization because traditional planners only consider the path commands and generate the path in the rectangular field without considering other factors. To overcome these drawbacks, this paper proposes a novel and practical collaborative path planning method for intelligent agricultural machinery based on unmanned aerial vehicles. First, we utilize UAVs for obstacle detection. With the field information and operation data preprocessed, automatic agricultural machinery could be assisted in avoiding obstacles in the field. Second, by considering both the historical state of the current operation and the statistics from previous operations, the real-time control of agricultural machinery is determined. Therefore, the K-means algorithm is used to extract key control parameters and discretize the state space of agricultural machinery. Finally, the dynamic operation plan is established based on the Markov chain. This plan can estimate the probability of agricultural machinery transitioning from one state to another by analyzing data, thereby dynamically determining real-time control strategies. The field test with an automatic tractor shows that the operation planner can achieve higher performance than the other two popular methods.

AB This paper presents a trajectory planning strategy for connected automated vehicles (CAVs) to cooperatively carry out mainline facilitating (i.e. gap development) and on-ramp merging maneuvers. The trajectory planning tasks of the mainline facilitating vehicle and the merging vehicle are formulated as two related optimal control problems. The motivation behind the proposed strategy is to restrain a facilitating maneuver's impact on following traffic. To this end, the proposed strategy bounds the speed of the facilitating maneuver from below and meanwhile ensures that the task of gap development can still be fulfilled. Because of the existence of the speed bound, the optimal control problem of the facilitating vehicle becomes constrained in state, in addition to the control constraints. A Pontryagin Maximum Principle (PMP) with state constraints is applied to rigorously derive the analytical solution. The main difficulty of the analytical procedure exists in the fact that the first-order necessary condition on the extremality of the Hamiltonian cannot yield useful information on the property of the optimal control history with regard to making the optimal speed trajectory to satisfy the speed constraint. As a result, additional conditions have to be explored, notably the so-called "jump conditions", among others. Taking advantage of the analytical solution, the proposed strategy is then implemented under a model predictive control framework.
   Simulation assessments of the proposed strategy are conducted at two levels - individual vehicle level and traffic flow level. At the individual vehicle level, the proposed strategy shows potential to reduce the risk of rear-end collision between the facilitating vehicle and the following vehicle, the most vulnerable pair of vehicles under the influence of gap development. At the traffic flow level, coupled with Aimsun, the proposed strategy is assessed under mixed traffic flow conditions, with various penetration rates of CAVs. The results show that it has potential to generate lower speed variations of traffic flow, a critical factor in traffic flow safety. Meanwhile it does not show negative impact on traffic efficiency in the simulation, and is likely to improve traffic efficiency in the real world. A sensitivity analysis of the effect of the facilitating maneuver's lower speed bound is also conducted. Although there exist several limitations with this study, it sheds some light on future research.

ID PARTICLE FILTER
AB In recent years, autonomous vehicles have attracted many researchers from academia and industry. Their efforts include object detection and tracking in the fields of computer vision, probabilistic-fusion and decision-making algorithms, etc. But most current methods that directly map from image pixels to steering behavior are not able to generate accurate results, especially under scenarios such as light and weather change drastically; this is largely due to the fact that these methods ignore the temporal relationship between frames. In this paper, we propose a novel end-to-end deep learning framework based on temporal and spatial attention mechanism, which aims to solve the problem of inaccurate vehicle steering angle prediction in complex environments and the difficulty of model interpretation. First, we use video sequence and historical steering angle sequence as inputs to the model, instead of just using a single frame as input. Second, we design a temporal attention mechanism to capture the long-and short-term memory in input visual information, and a spatial attention mechanism to capture key objects in the image and obtain their position information. This is achieved by inserting carefully-designed SE Net, ConvLSTM and CNN layers into the appropriate layers of the network framework. Finally, we demonstrate the feasibility of the proposed model with public Comma2k19, with comparison to current advanced methods. Experimental results show that compared with state-of-the-art methods, the average absolute error (MAE) values of our model on the training set and testing set are reduced by 10.2% and 6.3%, respectively, and has more accurate steering prediction performance. In addition, we explain the trigger mechanism of steering behavior prediction by visualizing the spatial attention map and temporal attention score on Comma2k19 and Udacity datasets, which further demonstrates that the proposed model can learn human-like driving behavior.(c) 2021 Elsevier B.V.

DE Autonomous vehicles; child safety; finite element modeling; human

ID PEDIATRIC HEAD; NECK RESPONSE
AB Objective Autonomous driving cars must be developed to ensure that children will have the highest level of protection in case of collision. Changes to the vehicle cabin design (different seat orientations, fully reclining seats, etc.) may significantly impact child occupant safety. Understanding child occupant responses under these new conditions is necessary to decrease risk and enhance child safety. In this study, child occupant response in different seating orientations exposed to frontal impacts with a focus on the head injuries and kinematics was analyzed. Methods Finite elements simulations were performed using the PIPER 6-year-old human body model (HBM). All simulations were carried out in a generic full vehicle environment. The child model was positioned in an adequate generic car restraint system (CRS) in the left rear vehicle seat in 4 seating orientations: 0 degrees (forward-facing position), 30 degrees, 60 degrees, and 90 degrees (living room position). Two scenarios were evaluated for all seating orientations according to the left front seat backrest position: reclined position nominal upright and rest position (55 degrees). All seat configurations were subjected to the mobile progressive deformable barrier frontal impact (European New Car Assessment Programme [Euro NCAP] frontal impact testing protocol). A total of 8 scenarios were simulated in LS-DYNA. Results Based on the Euro NCAP injury risk rate, 90 degrees seating orientation (living room position) was the safest among all selected scenarios independent of the left front seat backrest position. The worst case was found in 60 degrees seat rotation. The highest values for Head Injury Criterion (HIC) and head acceleration (Acc 3 ms) were noted for this case. Higher Brain Injury Criterion (BrIC) values were observed at higher seat rotation angles. Hence, a 90 degrees seating orientation showed the highest BrIC value. Attending to the skull stress, greater head injuries were caused principally by contact with the vehicle interior (seat headrest). Maximum stress values were reached at 30 degrees and 60 degrees seating orientations with the front seat in rest position. In 90 degrees seating orientation, high stress values were also identified. Conclusions These results show that attending to these new seating orientations, current child safety standards are not sufficient to ensure children the highest level of protection. Other additional criteria such as BrIC or skull stress that offer a way to capture brain injuries should be used.

AB This paper presents a review of the various control strategies that have been conducted to address and resolve several challenges for a particular category of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), the emphasis of which is on the rotorcraft or rotary-wing systems. Initially, a brief overview of the important relevant definitions, configurations, components, advantages/disadvantages, and applications of the UAVs is first introduced in general, encompassing a wide spectrum of the flying machines. Subsequently, the focus is more on the two most common and versatile rotorcraft UAVs, namely, the twin-rotor and quadrotor systems. Starting with a brief background on the dual-rotor helicopter and a quadcopter, the full detailed mathematical dynamic model of each system is derived based on the Euler-Lagrange and Newton-Euler methods, considering a number of assumptions and considerations. Then, a state-of-the-art review of the diverse control strategies for controlling the rotorcraft systems with conceivable solutions when the systems are subjected to the different impediments is demonstrated. To counter some of these limitations and adverse operating/loading conditions in the UAVs, several innovative control techniques are particularly highlighted, and their performance are duly analyzed, discussed, and compared. The applied control techniques are deemed to produce a useful contribution to their successful implementation in the wake of varied constraints and demanding environments that result in a degree of robustness and efficacy. Some of the off-the-shelf developments in the rotorcraft systems for research and commercial applications are also presented.

AB Unmanned miniature air vehicles (MAVs) have recently become a focus of much research, due to their potential utility in a number of information gathering applications. MAVs currently carry inertial sensor packages that allow them to perform basic flight maneuvers reliably in a completely autonomous manner. However, MAV navigation requires knowledge of location that is currently available only through GPS sensors, which depend on an external infrastructure and are thus prone to reliability issues. Vision-based methods such as Visual Odometry (VO) have been developed that are capable of estimating MAV pose purely from vision, and thus have the potential to provide an autonomous alternative to GPS for MAV navigation. Because VO estimates pose by combining relative pose estimates, constraining relative pose error is the key element of any Visual Odometry system. In this paper, we present a system that fuses measurements from an MAV inertial navigation system (INS) with a novel VO framework based on direct image registration. We use the inertial sensors in the measurement step of the Extended Kalman Filter to determine the direction of gravity, and hence provide error-bounded measurements of certain portions of the aircraft pose. Because of the relative nature of VO measurements, we use VO in the EKF prediction step. To allow VO to be used as a prediction, we develop a novel linear approximation to the direct image registration procedure that allows us to propagate the covariance matrix at each time step. We present offline results obtained from our pose estimation system using actual MAV flight data. We show that fusion of VO and INS measurements greatly improves the accuracy of pose estimation and reduces the drift compared to unaided VO during medium-length (tens of seconds) periods of GPS dropout.

AB A cooperative aircraft differential game where an Attacker missile pursues an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) herein called the Target is addressed. The Target UAV cooperates with up to two Defender missiles which are launched in order to intercept the Attacker before the latter reaches the Target. This is a scenario with important military applications where each one of the agents is an autonomous air vehicle. Each agent plans and corrects its course of action in order to defeat an opposing force while simultaneously optimizing an operational relevant cost/payoff performance measure. The Target and the Defenders cooperate to form a team against the Attacker. The results in this paper build on the solution of a three agent differential game, where the three players are the Target, the Attacker, and one Defender; in this paper, the benefits of firing a second Defender are considered. Indeed, launching two interceptor missiles is a standard procedure by providing redundant backup. Building on the solution of the one-Defender problem, it is possible to address a seemingly intractable problem, where the Target needs to decide which Defender(s) to cooperate with, in addition to obtaining the optimal headings of every player in the game. Given the initial positions of the players, we solve the problem of determining if a second Defender improves the Target/Defender(s) payoff and provide the optimal strategies for each of the agents involved. Finally, we address the game of kind (for the case of one Defender) which provides the safety regions to determine which side will win based on the initial state. These safety regions provides the Target's area of vulnerability, and using these results, we describe the reduction to the Target's vulnerability area brought by an additional Defender.

AB Drones, also known as Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs), are one of the highly emerging technologies of the modern day. Due to their small size, flying capabilities, and complex machinery, drones can be deployed in diverse fields, including agriculture, sports, entertainment, parcel delivery, disaster management, search and rescue, emergency medicine, and healthcare. In case of medical emergency, timely delivery of the required emergency kit is very important. This is often not possible in many underdeveloped countries due to lack of resources, traffic jams, congestion or challenging routes. Also, in times like today's when the world is hit with COVID-19 pandemic, the movement is very limited due to lockdowns and emergency. In such case, drones can be deployed to deliver the emergency kits and collect samples for tests. This may save someones life as well as time and financial resources. In third world countries, the COVID-19 has spread chaos because of very limited hospitals, resources and staff. Therefore, it is difficult for the government and health officials to accommodate every patient or give him/her the care that he/she needs. Amidst the fear of pandemic, everyone is trying to undergo tests for COVID-19 which is difficult to handle In our research, we have proposed a solution that comprises smartphone application with the help of a patient sending a call to a healthcare centre for delivering emergency kit. The kit contains equipment with the help of which a person can collect swab. The drone takes the swab samples back to the healthcare centre for tests. We have introduced an optimization factor as a baseline for future studies of this kind. We have further conducted field experiments to test our proposed scheme. The results have shown that drones can be quite efficient in collecting samples and delivering emergency kits. (C) 2021 Published by Elsevier B.V.

AB Three-dimensional path planning for autonomous robots is a prevalent problem in mobile robotics. This paper presents three novel versions of a hybrid method designed to assist in planning such paths for these robots. In this paper, an improvement on Rapidly exploring Random Tree (RRT) algorithm, namely Adapted-RRT, is presented that uses three well-known metaheuristic algorithms, namely Grey Wolf Optimization (GWO), Incremental Grey Wolf Optimization (I-GWO), and Expanded Grey Wolf Optimization (Ex-GWO)). RRT variants, using these algorithms, are named Adapted-RRTGWO, Adapted-RRTI-GWO, and Adapted-RRTEx-GWO. The most significant shortcoming of the methods in the original sampling-based algorithm is their inability in finding the optimal paths. On the other hand, the metaheuristic-based algorithms are disadvantaged as they demand a predetermined knowledge of intermediate stations. This study is novel in that it uses the advantages of sampling and metaheuristic methods while eliminating their shortcomings. In these methods, two important operations (length and direction of each movement) are defined that play an important role in selecting the next stations and generating an optimal path. They try to find solutions close to the optima without collision, while providing comparatively efficient execution time and space complexities. The proposed methods have been simulated employing four different maps for three unmanned aerial vehicles, with diverse sets of starting and ending points. The results have been compared among a total of 11 algorithms. The comparison of results shows that the proposed path planning methods generally outperform various algorithms, namely BPIB-RRT*, tGSRT, GWO, I-GWO, Ex-GWO, PSO, Improved BA, and WOA. The simulation results are analysed in terms of optimal path costs, execution time, and convergence rate.

AB Geomatics is important for agriculture 4.0; in fact, it uses different types of data (remote sensing from satellites, Unmanned Aerial Vehicles-UAVs, GNSS, photogrammetry, laser scanners and other types of data) and therefore it uses data fusion techniques depending on the different applications to be carried out. This work aims to present on a study area concerning the integration of data acquired (using data fusion techniques) from remote sensing techniques, UAVs, autonomous driving machines and data fusion, all reprocessed and visualised in terms of results obtained through GIS (Geographic Information System). In this work we emphasize the importance of the integration of different methodologies and data fusion techniques, managing data of a different nature acquired with different methodologies to optimise vineyard cultivation and production. In particular, in this note we applied (focusing on a vineyard) geomatics-type methodologies developed in other works and integrated here to be used and optimised in order to make a contribution to agriculture 4.0. More specifically, we used the NDVI (Normalized Difference Vegetation Index) applied to multispectral satellite images and drone images (suitably combined) to identify the vigour of the plants. We then used an autonomous guided vehicle (equipped with sensors and monitoring systems) which, by estimating the optimal path, allows us to optimise fertilisation, irrigation, etc., by data fusion techniques using various types of sensors. Everything is visualised on a GIS to improve the management of the field according to its potential, also using historical data on the environmental, climatic and socioeconomic characteristics of the area. For this purpose, experiments of different types of Geomatics carried out individually on other application cases have been integrated into this work and are coordinated and integrated here in order to provide research/application cues for Agriculture 4.0.

AB Thermal gradient energy-generation technologies for powering unmanned underwater vehicles (UUVs) or autonomous sensing systems in the ocean are mainly in the research development phase or commercially available at a limited scale, and salinity-gradient energy-generation technologies have not been adequately researched yet. The demand for self-powered UUVs suitable for long-term deployments has been growing, and further research related to small-scale ocean gradient energy systems is needed. In this study, we conducted a comprehensive review about harvesting energy from ocean thermal or salinity gradients for powering UUVs, focusing on gliders and profiling floats. Thermal gradient energy systems for UUVs based on phase change materials (PCM) cannot provide the energy required for powering autonomous sensing systems because of the systems' low energy conversion efficiency. Besides reducing energy consumption by developing more efficient electrical-mechanical systems, enhancing the thermal conductivity of the PCMs may help address this challenge by increasing the power generation rate of the UUVs. Several other emerging technologies, such as thermoelectric generators, shape memory alloys, and small-scale thermodynamic cycle systems, have shown potential for powering UUVs, but they are still only at the laboratory testing or conceptual design phase. The most advanced power generation technologies based on salinity gradients, reverse electrodialysis and pressure retarded osmosis, are still not economically viable for large-scale deployment, mainly because of the high cost of the components required to operate in harsh saline environments. Our feasibility evaluation showed that existing salinity gradient power generation technologies are not directly feasible for powering UUVs in the open ocean.

AB Agricultural robots, or agrobots, have been increasingly adopted in every aspect of fanning from surveillance to fruit harvesting in order to improve the overall productivity over the last few decades. Motivated by the compelling growth of the agricultural robots in modern farms, in this work, an autonomous quality inspection over rice farms is proposed by employing quadcopters. Real-time control of these vehicles, however, is still challenging as they exhibit a highly nonlinear behavior especially for agile maneuvers. What is more, these vehicles have to operate under uncertain working conditions such as wind and gust disturbances as well as positioning errors caused by inertial measurement units and global positioning system. To handle these difficulties, as a model-free and learning control algorithm, type-2 fuzzy neural networks (T2-FNNs) are designed for the control of a quadcopter. The novel particle swarm optimization-sliding mode control (PSO-SMC) theory-based hybrid algorithm is proposed for the training of the T2-FNNs. In particular, the continuous version of PSO is adopted for the identification of the antecedent part of the T2-FNNs while the SMC-based update rules are utilized for the online learning of the consequent part during control. In the virtual environment, the quadcopter is expected to perform an autonomous flight including agile maneuvers such as steep turning and sudden altitude changes over a rice terrace farm in Longsheng, China. The simulation results for the T2-FNNs are compared with the outcome of conventional proportional-derivative (PD) controllers for different case studies. The results show that our method decreases the trajectory tracking integral squared error by %26 over PD controllers in the ideal case, while this ratio goes up to %95 under uncertain working conditions.

AB There has been a growing interest in Autonomous Vehicle (AV) technology worldwide over the last decade. Nevertheless, various studies have noted some potential sociopsychological challenges to AV use and ownership. These challenges can be mitigated by designing AV that accounts for users' personalities, such as their perceived control and power. The complex relationship between personal control and automation, two concepts that intuitively sound contradictory to each other, is less explored. In this study, two dimensions of personal control, the desire for control and the driver locus of control, were hypothesized to influence the attitude toward AV. The relationships were moderated by power distance, a cultural factor related to one's sense of control. The hypotheses were tested using Structural Equation Modelling (SEM) approach via the Analysis of Moment Structures (AMOS) software. As many as 457 respondents from two sample groups, Hungarian and Indonesian drivers were gathered via an online questionnaire and compared. The results reveal that 1) the higher the desire for control, the more negative the attitude toward AV 2) the higher the external driver locus of control, the more positive the attitude toward AV 3) the more positive the attitude toward AV, the higher the intention to use AV and 4) power distance moderates the relationship between the desire for control and the attitude toward AV, such that the negative effect of the desire for control is strengthened in high power distance orientation. This study also provides theoretical contributions and managerial implications, especially to AV designers.

AB Emerging mobility technologies are changing the transportation system landscape. This is especially evident at airports, such as the Dallas-Fort Worth International Airport (DFW). Without careful analysis, these changes could lead to inefficient and costly airport operations. This paper presents a modeling framework that integrates travel mode encoding, demand projection, and microsimulation to enable airports to develop, simulate, and evaluate curbside traffic managements policies and measure their impact. The framework is utilized to analyze several traffic scenarios and policies for DFW: a baseline scenario which represents DFW traffic pattern as observed in 2018 and projected to 2045, a transit network company (TNC) electrification policy, a TNC queuing policy, a policy that increased transit ridership, a bus-only policy which considers the use of only buses inside DFW, an autonomous vehicle (AV) policy which investigates the impact of autonomous vehicle (AV) adoption on airport operations, and an example COVID-19 scenario which models the impact of the COVID19 pandemic. The simulations' results demonstrate that: increasing the DFW transit ridership postpones the need for airport curbside expansion the most; encouraging shared-mobility with the bus-only policy produces the most savings in curbside congestion delays; automation and electrification for all passenger vehicle trips to/from DFW generates the most saving in fuel consumption and emissions; and uncontrolled AV adoption incurs the highest increase in fuel consumption, delay, and emissions and could require immediate airport capacity extension. Without policy intervention or investment in additional infrastructure capacity, these results predict the current operations would face significant congestion on high demand days starting as early as 2028. While derived in close partnership with DFW, the methodology presented here can be generalized to any airport.

AB A survey of small-scale subsurface variability within the synoptic observational field of an ocean surface current radar (OSCR) using an autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) is described. The survey involved observation of a developing upper mixed layer in a littoral zone off southeast Florida, on the edge of a strong Florida current during the summer of 1999. Complimentary in situ observations from a bottom-mounted acoustic Doppler current profiler (ADCP), conductivity-temperature (CT) chain arrays, atmospheric measurements from a surface buoy, and CTD and ADCP observations from a surface ship provided the background to the survey. The AUV, the Ocean Explorer, equipped with a CTD, downward and upward looking ADCPs, and a small-scale turbulence package, was used to conduct a continuous 12-h survey of small-to-fine-scale variability within a few grid cells of the surface current radar field. The vehicle repeatedly sampled the same grid in a set pattern at a fixed mid-water depth. Maps of developing spatial distribution of current, salinity, temperature, and rate of dissipation have been developed using the AUV-based observations. The observed features in the current field compare well with the OSCR and the bottom-mounted ADCP measurements. The observations revealed a strong presence of a near-tidal period (10-h) oscillation in the current field accompanying a northward propagating shear wave along the edge of the Florida current and other features, including the presence of patches with relatively high dissipation rates during the survey. The data set acquired provides simultaneous maps of subsurface structure, including rate of dissipation of kinetic energy and synoptic field observations of high-resolution surface current. The application of the AUV in this oceanographic survey represents a step in the direction of developing a multivehicle ocean sampling system.

AB Multi-criteria group decision-making (MCGDM) approaches have a substantial effect on decision-making in a range of critical sectors, including science, business, and real-life research. These strategies also efficiently assist researchers in resolving challenges that may arise throughout their study activity. The current work's major purpose is to research and develop the combinative distance -based assessment (CODAS) approach by employing 2-tuple linguistic q-rung picture fuzzy sets (2TLq-RPFSs) as a background. The CODAS technique computes the distances from the negative ideal solutions and ranks the alternatives in increasing order. To compute the normal weights of attributes, the entropy weighting information process is used. Furthermore, two aggregation operators, namely the 2-tuple linguistic q-rung picture fuzzy Einstein weighted average and the 2-tuple linguistic q-rung picture fuzzy Einstein order weighted average, are introduced. Our inspiration for employing the notion of 2TLq-RPFSs is the ability of q-RPFSs to support a wide range of information and the significant qualities of 2-tuple linguistic term sets to handle qualitative data. Congested transportation networks may be made more efficient by leveraging digital transformation. Real-time traffic management is one solution to the problem of road congestion. As a result of connected autonomous vehicle (CAV) advances, the benefits of real-time traffic management systems have grown dramatically. CAVs can help manage traffic by acting as enforcers. To complement the extended approach, the proposed technique is used to select the best alternative for a real-time traffic management system. The performance of the suggested technique is validated using scenario analysis. The results show that the suggested strategy is efficient and relevant to real-world situations.

AB With the gradual commercialization of 5G, especially the widespread application of artificial intelligence (AI) technology, the Internet of Things (IoT) continues to expand and has integrated into every aspect of our lives. While enjoying the convenience brought by IoT, we also face unprecedented challenges, including ubiquitous and unpredictable demands for communication and computing resources. In consideration of their flexible deployment, low cost, and easy expansion, UAV edge computing IoT networks (UECINs), which adopt unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) to provide fast communication and computing services, have emerged as a promising solution. Note that there have been a number of studies focusing on UAV's position deployment and trajectory design, resource allocation in UECIN. However, most existing works proposed short-term service provisioning systems with a fixed number of UAVs, ignoring the problem of UAVs' limited battery power and the possible changes of ground users' number, locations, and resource requirements. To address these issues, we present a dynamic UECIN framework with autonomous prediction characteristics, aiming to stably provide mobile-edge computing services for ground users in a certain area over a long period of time. This framework can not only support UAV's dynamic entry and exit according to the real-time needs of ground users but also update their position deployment based on the distribution of ground users. As we know, we are the first to propose UECIN with a dynamic entry and exit mechanism. Besides, an efficient and load-balancing task allocation scheme is further given, and extensive analysis and numerical results corroborate the feasibility and superior performance of our framework.

AB BackgroundCurrent automated forest investigation is facing a dilemma over how to achieve high tree- and plot-level completeness while maintaining a high cost and labor efficiency. This study tackles the challenge by exploring a new concept that enables an efficient fusion of aerial and terrestrial perspectives for digitizing and characterizing individual trees in forests through an Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) that flies above and under canopies in a single operation. The advantage of such concept is that the aerial perspective from the above-canopy UAV and the terrestrial perspective from the under-canopy UAV can be seamlessly integrated in one flight, thus grants the access to simultaneous high completeness, high efficiency, and low cost.ResultsIn the experiment, an approximately 0.5ha forest was covered in ca. 10min from takeoff to landing. The GNSS-IMU based positioning supports a geometric accuracy of the produced point cloud that is equivalent to that of the mobile mapping systems, which leads to a 2-4cm RMSE of the diameter at the breast height estimates, and a 4-7cm RMSE of the stem curve estimates.ConclusionsResults of the experiment suggested that the integrated flight is capable of combining the high completeness of upper canopies from the above-canopy perspective and the high completeness of stems from the terrestrial perspective. Thus, it is a solution to combine the advantages of the terrestrial static, the mobile, and the above-canopy UAV observations, which is a promising step forward to achieve a fully autonomous in situ forest inventory. Future studies should be aimed to further improve the platform positioning, and to automatize the UAV operation.

AB Autonomous driving has attracted tremendous attention especially in the past few years. The key techniques for a self-driving car include solving tasks like 3D map construction, self-localization, parsing the driving road and understanding objects, which enable vehicles to reason and act. However, large scale data set for training and system evaluation is still a bottleneck for developing robust perception models. In this paper, we present the ApolloScape dataset [1] and its applications for autonomous driving. Compared with existing public datasets from real scenes, e.g., KITTI [2] or Cityscapes [3] , ApolloScape contains much large and richer labelling including holistic semantic dense point cloud for each site, stereo, per-pixel semantic labelling, lanemark labelling, instance segmentation, 3D car instance, high accurate location for every frame in various driving videos from multiple sites, cities and daytimes. For each task, it contains at lease 15x larger amount of images than SOTA datasets. To label such a complete dataset, we develop various tools and algorithms specified for each task to accelerate the labelling process, such as joint 3D-2D segment labeling, active labelling in videos etc. Depend on ApolloScape, we are able to develop algorithms jointly consider the learning and inference of multiple tasks. In this paper, we provide a sensor fusion scheme integrating camera videos, consumer-grade motion sensors (GPS/IMU), and a 3D semantic map in order to achieve robust self-localization and semantic segmentation for autonomous driving. We show that practically, sensor fusion and joint learning of multiple tasks are beneficial to achieve a more robust and accurate system. We expect our dataset and proposed relevant algorithms can support and motivate researchers for further development of multi-sensor fusion and multi-task learning in the field of computer vision.

AB The Intermediate eXperimental Vehicle (IXV) is an advanced re-entry demonstrator vehicle aimed to perform in-flight experimentation of atmospheric re-entry enabling systems and technologies. The IXV integrates key technologies at the system level, with significant advancements on Europe's previous flying test-beds. The project builds on previous achievements at system and technology levels, and provides a unique and concrete way of establishing and consolidating Europe's autonomous position in the strategic field of atmospheric re-entry.
   The IXV mission and system objectives are the design, development, manufacturing, assembling and on-ground to in-flight verification of an autonomous European lifting and aerodynamically controlled reentry system, integrating critical re-entry technologies at system level. Among such critical technologies of interest, special attention is paid to aerodynamic and aerothermodynamics experimentation, including advanced instrumentation for aerothermodynamics phenomena investigations, thermal protections and hot-structures, guidance, navigation and flight control through combined jets and aerodynamic surfaces (i.e. flaps), in particular focusing on the technologies integration at system level for flight.
   Following the extensive detailed design, manufacturing, qualification, integration and testing of the flight segment and ground segment elements, IXV has performed a full successful flight on February 11th 2015. After the launch with the VEGA launcher form the CSG spaceport in French Guyana, IXV has performed a full nominal mission ending with a successful splashdown in the Pacific Ocean. During Flight Phase, the IXV space and ground segments worked perfectly, implementing the whole flight program in line with the commanded maneuvers and trajectory prediction, performing an overall flight of 34.400 km including 7.600 km with hot atmospheric re-entry in automatic guidance, concluding with successful precision landing at a distance of similar to 1 km from the target, including the wind drift acting on the parachute from an altitude of 4.5 km.

AB In this paper, we present a novel 2D-3D pedestrian tracker designed for applications in autonomous vehicles. The system operates on a tracking by detection principle and can track multiple pedestrians in complex urban traffic situations. By using a behavioral motion model and a non-parametric distribution as state model, we are able to accurately track unpredictable pedestrian motion in the presence of heavy occlusion. Tracking is performed independently, on the image and ground plane, in global, motion compensated coordinates. We employ Camera and LiDAR data fusion to solve the association problem where the optimal solution is found by matching 2D and 3D detections to tracks using a joint log-likelihood observation model. Each 2D-3D particle filter then updates their state from associated observations and a behavioral motion model. Each particle moves independently following the pedestrian motion parameters which we learned offline from an annotated training dataset. Temporal stability of the state variables is achieved by modeling each track as a Markov Decision Process with probabilistic state transition properties. A novel track management system then handles high level actions such as track creation, deletion and interaction. Using a probabilistic track score the track manager can cull false and ambiguous detections while updating tracks with detections from actual pedestrians. Our system is implemented on a GPU and exploits the massively parallelizable nature of particle filters. Due to the Markovian nature of our track representation, the system achieves real-time performance operating with a minimal memory footprint. Exhaustive and independent evaluation of our tracker was performed by the KITTI benchmark server, where it was tested against a wide variety of unknown pedestrian tracking situations. On this realistic benchmark, we outperform all published pedestrian trackers in a multitude of tracking metrics.

AB Fronts influence the structure and function of coastal marine ecosystems. Due to the complexity and dynamic nature of coastal environments and the small scales of frontal gradient zones, frontal research is difficult. To advance this challenging research we developed a method enabling an autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) to detect and track fronts, thereby providing high-resolution observations in the moving reference frame of the front itself. This novel method was applied to studying the evolution of a frontal zone in the coastal upwelling environment of Monterey Bay, California, through a period of variability in upwelling intensity. Through 23 frontal crossings in four days, the AUV detected the front using real-time analysis of vertical thermal stratification to identify water types and the front between them, and the vehicle tracked the front as it moved more than 10 km offshore. The physical front coincided with a biological front between strongly stratified phytoplankton-enriched water inshore of the front, and weakly stratified phytoplankton-poor water offshore of the front. While stratification remained a consistent identifier, conditions on both sides of the front changed rapidly as regional circulation responded to relaxation of upwelling winds. The offshore water type transitioned from relatively cold and saline upwelled water to relatively warm and fresh coastal transition zone water. The inshore water type exhibited an order of magnitude increase in chlorophyll concentrations and an associated increase in oxygen and decrease in nitrate. It also warmed and freshened near the front, consistent with the cross-frontal exchange that was detected in the high-resolution AUV data. AUV-observed cross-frontal exchanges beneath the surface manifestation of the front emphasize the importance of AUV synoptic water column surveys in the frontal zone. (C) 2015 The Authors.

AB Background: Many modern cyber-physical systems incorporate computer vision technologies, complex sensors and advanced control software, allowing them to interact with the environment autonomously. Examples include drone swarms, self-driving vehicles, autonomous robots, etc. Testing such systems poses numerous challenges: not only should the system inputs be varied, but also the surrounding environment should be accounted for. A number of tools have been developed to test the system model for the possible inputs falsifying its requirements. However, they are not directly applicable to autonomous cyber-physical systems, as the inputs to their models are generated while operating in a virtual environment. Aims: In this paper, we aim to design a search-based framework, named AmbieGen, for generating diverse fault-revealing test scenarios for autonomous cyber-physical systems. The scenarios represent an environment in which an autonomous agent operates. The framework should be applicable to generating different types of environments. Methods: To generate the test scenarios, we leverage the NSGA-II algorithm with two objectives. The first objective evaluates the deviation of the observed system's behaviour from its expected behaviour. The second objective is the test case diversity, calculated as a Jaccard distance with a reference test case. To guide the first objective we are using a simplified system model rather than the full model. The full model is used to run the system in the simulation environment and can take substantial time to execute (several minutes for one scenario). The simplified system model is derived from the full model and can be used to get an approximation of the results obtained from the full model without running the simulation. Results: We evaluate AmbieGen on three scenario generation case studies, namely a smart-thermostat, a robot obstacle avoidance system, and a vehicle lane-keeping assist system. For all the case studies, our approach outperforms the available baselines in fault revealing and several other metrics such as the diversity of the revealed faults and the proportion of valid test scenarios. Conclusion: AmbieGen could find scenarios, revealing failures for all the three autonomous agents considered in our case studies. We compared three configurations of AmbieGen: based on a single objective genetic algorithm, multi-objective, and random search. Both single and multi objective configurations outperform the random search. Multi objective configuration can find the individuals of the same quality as the single objective, producing more unique test scenarios in the same time budget. Our framework can be used to generate virtual environments of different types and complexity and reveal the system's faults early in the design stage.

AB Traffic congestion is monotonically increasing, especially in large cities, due to rapid urbanization. Traffic congestion not only deteriorates traffic operation and degrades traffic safety, but also imposes costs to the road users. The concerns associated with traffic congestion increase when considering more complicated situations such as unsignalized intersections and driveways at which maneuvers are entirely dependent upon drivers' judgment. Urban arterials are characterized by closely spaced signalized and unsignalized intersections and high traffic volumes, which make them a priority while analyzing traffic safety and operation. Autonomous Vehicles (AV) provide ample opportunities to overcome the aforementioned challenges. In essence, this study evaluates the impact of various AV Market Penetration Rates (MPR) on the safety and operation of urban arterials in proximity of a driveway under different traffic levels of service (LOS). Twenty-four separate scenarios were developed using VISSIM, considering six AV MPRs of 0 %, 10 %, 25 %, 50 %, 75 %, and 100 %, and four LOS including A, B, C, and D. Various operational and safety measures were analyzed including traffic density, traffic speed, traffic conflict (rear-end and lane-changing), and driving volatility. The trajectory and lane-based analysis of the traffic density indicates that MPR significantly improves the overall traffic density for all the scenarios, especially under high traffic LOS. Additionally, by increasing the MPR and decreasing the traffic volume of the network, the mean speed increases significantly by up to 6 %. Exploring the safety of the scenarios indicates that by increasing the MPR from 0% to 100 % for all the LOS, the number of rear-end conflicts and lane-changing conflicts decreases 84 %-100 % and 42 %-100 %, respectively. Moreover, assessing the longitudinal driving volatility measures, which represent risky driving behaviors, showed that higher MPRs significantly reduce some of the driving volatility measures and enhance safety.

AB GNSS information is vulnerable to external interference and causes failure when unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) are in a fully autonomous flight in complex environments such as high-rise parks and dense forests. This paper presents a pan-tilt-based visual servoing (PBVS) method for obtaining world coordinate information. The system is equipped with an inertial measurement unit (IMU), an air pressure sensor, a magnetometer, and a pan-tilt-zoom (PTZ) camera. In this paper, we explain the physical model and the application method of the PBVS system, which can be briefly summarized as follows. We track the operation target with a UAV carrying a camera and output the information about the UAV's position and the angle between the PTZ and the anchor point. In this way, we can obtain the current absolute position information of the UAV with its absolute altitude collected by the height sensing unit and absolute geographic coordinate information and altitude information of the tracked target. We set up an actual UAV experimental environment. To meet the calculation requirements, some sensor data will be sent to the cloud through the network. Through the field tests, it can be concluded that the systematic deviation of the overall solution is less than the error of GNSS sensor equipment, and it can provide navigation coordinate information for the UAV in complex environments. Compared with traditional visual navigation systems, our scheme has the advantage of obtaining absolute, continuous, accurate, and efficient navigation information at a short distance (within 15 m from the target). This system can be used in scenarios that require autonomous cruise, such as self-powered inspections of UAVs, patrols in parks, etc.

AB Objective: This study investigated drivers' evaluation of a conventional autonomous emergency braking (AEB) system on high and reduced tire-road friction and compared these results to those of an AEB system adaptive to the reduced tire-road friction by earlier braking. Current automated systems such as the AEB do not adapt the vehicle control strategy to the road friction; for example, on snowy roads. Because winter precipitation is associated with a 19% increase in traffic crashes and a 13% increase in injuries compared to dry conditions, the potential of conventional AEB to prevent collisions could be significantly improved by including friction in the control algorithm. Whereas adaption is not legally required for a conventional AEB system, higher automated functions will have to adapt to the current tire-road friction because human drivers will not be required to monitor the driving environment at all times. For automated driving functions to be used, high levels of perceived safety and trust of occupants have to be reached with new systems. The application case of an AEB is used to investigate drivers' evaluation depending on the road condition in order to gain knowledge for the design of future driving functions.Methods: In a driving simulator, the conventional, nonadaptive AEB was evaluated on dry roads with high friction ( = 1) and on snowy roads with reduced friction ( = 0.3). In addition, an AEB system adapted to road friction was designed for this study and compared with the conventional AEB on snowy roads with reduced friction. Ninety-six drivers (48 males, 48 females) assigned to 5 age groups (20-29, 30-39, 40-49, 50-59, and 60-75years) drove with AEB in the simulator. The drivers observed and evaluated the AEB's braking actions in response to an imminent rear-end collision at an intersection.Results: The results show that drivers' safety and trust in the conventional AEB were significantly lower on snowy roads, and the nonadaptive autonomous braking strategy was considered less appropriate on snowy roads compared to dry roads. As expected, the adaptive AEB braking strategy was considered more appropriate for snowy roads than the nonadaptive strategy. In conditions of reduced friction, drivers' subjective safety and trust were significantly improved when driving with the adaptive AEB compared to the conventional AEB. Women felt less safe than men when AEB was braking. Differences between age groups were not of statistical significance.Conclusions: Drivers notice the adaptation of the autonomous braking strategy on snowy roads with reduced friction. On snowy roads, they feel safer and trust the adaptive system more than the nonadaptive automation.

AB Acoustic echo sounders designed to map and discriminate organisms in the water column have primarily been deployed on ships. Because of acoustic attenuation of higher frequencies used to detect and discriminate micronekton and nekton, this has effectively restricted the range of this information to the upper water column. In an effort to overcome these range limitations by reducing the distance between the transducer and the targets of interest, dual-frequency (38 and 120 kHz) split-beam echo sounders were integrated into a Remote Environmental Monitoring Units (REMUS) 600 autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV), effectively doubling the range of quantitative acoustic data into the mesopelagic zone (600-1200 m). Data from the first set of missions in a range of conditions revealed that the AUV provided a stable platform for the echo sounders and improved vertical and horizontal positional accuracy over echo sounders towed by ships. In comparison to hull-mounted echo sounders, elimination of ship noise and surface bubbles provided a 17- and 19-dBW decrease in the noise floor for the 38- and 120-kHz echo sounders, respectively, effectively increasing the sampling range by 30%-40%. The extended depth range also increased the resolution of the acoustic horizontal footprint from 37-40 to 0.6-3.7 m, enabling discrimination of individual targets at depth. Also developed here is novel onboard echo sounder data processing and autonomy to allow sampling not feasible in a surface ship or towed configuration. Taken together, these data demonstrate an effective new tool for examining the biology of animals in the mesopelagic zone (600-1200 m) in ways previously only possible in the upper ocean.

AB As the development of autonomous driving technology is now in full swing, the demand for miniaturized optical modules mounted on various sensors has increased. Particularly, the optical lens used for such autonomous driving must demonstrate stable performance and durability despite rapid changes in the external environment. In this regard, cubic zirconia (CZ) can be used as an optical lens due to its high refractive index, which is above 2.1 in visible and near-infrared wavelengths, along with its chemical and mechanical durability. Thus, in this paper, we investigated the temperature-dependent physical properties of CZ fabricated by the skull melting method. The temperature coefficient of the refractive index (dn/dT) of the fabricated CZ plate in the temperature range of 25-100 degrees C decreased from 9.76 x 10(-5)/K to 7.00 x 10(-5)/K as the wavelength increased from 447.0 nm to 785.0 nm. The estimated Abbe number decreased from 33.98 at 25 degrees C to 33.12 at 100 degrees C, while the measured coefficient of thermal expansion (CTE) was 9.91 x 10(-6)/K, which revealed that the dn/dT value of the CZ plate was more affected by the dispersion than by the CTE. In addition, the CZ samples with a high refractive index, coated with a dielectric multilayer showed a high average transmittance of 98.2% at the investigated wavelengths, making it suitable for miniaturization or wide-angle optical lens modules. To secure the durability required for automobile lenses, the variation in the surface profile of the CZ before and after the external impact was also analyzed, revealing much better performance than TAF glass. Therefore, the observed results demonstrate that the CZ material is suitable for use as an optical lens for autonomous vehicles.

TI An affordable modular mobile robotic platform with fuzzy logic control
   and evolutionary artificial neural networks
SO JOURNAL OF ROBOTIC SYSTEMS
LA English
DT Article
AB Autonomous robotics projects encompass the rich nature of integrated systems that includes mechanical, electrical, and computational software components. The availability of smaller and cheaper hardware components has helped make possible a new dimension in operational autonomy. This paper describes a mobile robotic platform consisting of several integrated modules including a laptop computer that serves as the main control module, microcontroller-based motion control module, a vision processing module, a sensor interface module, and a navigation module. The laptop computer module contains the main software development environment with a user interface to access and control all other modules. Programming language independence is achieved by using standard input/output computer interfaces including RS-232 serial port, USB, networking, audio input and output, and parallel port devices. However, with the same hardware technology available to all, the distinguishing factor in most cases for intelligent systems becomes the software design. The software for autonomous robots must intelligently control the hardware so that it functions in unstructured, dynamic, and uncertain environments while maintaining an autonomous adaptability. This paper describes how we introduced fuzzy logic control to one robot platform in order to solve the 2003 Intelligent Ground Vehicle Competition (IGVC) Autonomous Challenge problem. This paper also describes the introduction of hybrid software design that utilizes Fuzzy Evolutionary Artificial Neural Network techniques. In this design, rather than using a control program that is directly coded, the robot's artificial neural net is first trained with a training data set using evolutionary optimization techniques to adjust weight values between neurons. The trained neural network with a weight average defuzzification method was able to make correct decisions to unseen vision patterns for the IGVC Autonomous Challenge. A comparison of the Lawrence Technological University robot designs and the design of the other competing schools shows that our platforms were the most affordable robot systems to use as tools for computer science and engineering education.

TI Effect of Controlled Defoliant Application on Cotton Fiber Quality

AB Cotton (Gossypium hirsutum L.) is an important industrial crop. It is a perennial crop and has indeterminate growth habit, however, in most parts of the United States, it is grown as an annual crop with the application of growth regulators. Defoliation is a major production practice influencing harvester efficiency, fiber trash content, cotton yield, and fiber quality. Currently, defoliant application is done by using a conventional boom sprayer and aerial spraying in which both systems spray chemicals horizontally downwards from the top of the canopy, which causes minimal chemical to reach at bottom canopy. However, for successful defoliation, each leaf must receive the defoliant as chemicals do not move within the plant. Thus, a new autonomous ground sprayer was developed using robotics and pulse width modulation, which can be run in between two rows covering the whole canopy of the plant. Field research was conducted to study the effect of three duty cycles (20%,40%, and 60%) on cotton fiber quality using autonomous spraying system. The result indicated that the defoliants could be applied safely at either of the three duty cycles without compromising most of the fiber quality parameters except for nep/gm, length (Ln), L (5%), SFC, trash content in field 1 and micronaire, nep size, length (Ln), L (5%), SFC, and fiber fineness in field 2 which were significant. However, application of 20% duty cycle will significantly reduce the chemical use therefore, 20% duty cycle could be a good choice for the autonomous cotton defoliation. The development of autonomous spraying technology would encourage the development of new sprayer industries and the unmanned ground vehicle industries, together with the need for the global development of an agricultural system with broad market prospects and brings about huge economic, social, and ecological benefits.

AB UAVs have been contributing substantially to multi-disciplinary research and around 70% of the articles have been published in just about the last five years, with an exponential increase. Primarily, while exploring the literature from the scientific databases for various aspects within the autonomous UAV path planning, such as type and configuration of UAVs, the complexity of their environments or workspaces, choices of path generating algorithms, nature of solutions and efficacy of the generated paths, necessitates an increased number of search keywords as a prerequisite. However, the addition of more and more keywords might as well curtail some conducive and worthwhile search results in the same pursuit. This article presents a Systematic Literature Review (SLR) for 20 useful parameters, organized into six distinct categories that researchers and industry practitioners usually consider. In this work, Web of Science (WOS) was selected to search the primary studies based on three keywords: "Autonomous" + "Path Planning" + "UAV" and following the exclusion and inclusion criteria defined within the SLR methodology, 90 primary studies were considered. Through literature synthesis, a unique perspective to see through the literature is established in terms of characteristic research sectors for UAVs. Moreover, open research challenges from recent studies and state-of-the-art contributions to address them were highlighted. It was also discovered that the autonomy of UAVs and the extent of their mission complexities go hand-in-hand, and the benchmark to define a fully autonomous UAV is an arbitral goal yet to be achieved. To further this quest, the study cites two key models to measure a drone's autonomy and offers a novel complexity matrix to measure the extent of a drone's autonomy. Additionally, since preliminary-level researchers often look for technical means to assess their ideas, the technologies used in academic research are also tabulated with references.

AB Net community production (NCP), an analog of carbon export out of the surface ocean, is often estimated using budgets of dissolved oxygen. Accurate estimates of oxygen-based NCP, especially in dynamic coastal regions, require constraints on vertical transport of water with O-2 out of equilibrium with the atmosphere, nonsteady state change in the oxygen inventory, heating/cooling-driven O-2 disequilibrium, and the rate of bubble injection from wave activity. The latter two are typically evaluated by using discrete measurements of the O-2/Ar ratio in lieu of O-2 only. Because sophisticated sampling and measurement techniques are required to make these measurements, they are often limited in spatiotemporal resolution. However, high-resolution estimates of NCP may be useful in determining small-scale patchiness in export. In this study, we calculated high-resolution NCP in coastal Southern California using dissolved oxygen measurements made by an autonomous buoyancy-driven Slocum glider and an empirical relationship derived using discrete measurements of O-2/Ar in the surface mixed layer to remove the influence of bubble injection, which accounted for approximately one fourth of the O-2 supersaturation observed. Using estimates of vertical transport from wind speed-based parameterizations, previously validated using a Be-7 budget, we were able to correct for the physical biases to the signal, which are known to significantly influence dissolved oxygen budgets in this region. Our results agree well with previously published NCP estimates for the study area but also reveal higher-frequency variability that discrete sampling was unable to resolve, suggesting that this approach may be useful in other regions with well-constrained vertical transport rates.
   Plain Language Summary The ocean takes up carbon dioxide from the atmosphere through a process referred to as the biological pump. Carbon export refers to the amount of carbon removed by this process and is therefore an important quantity in determining the ocean's role as a sink for atmospheric carbon dioxide and significantly influences ocean chemistry. Carbon export is often estimated using budgets of oxygen in the surface ocean because oxygen is affected by the same processes. However, bubbles introduced through wave activity can bias oxygen budgets if not accounted for using precise measurements, which are often made in low spatiotemporal resolution and thus can miss patchy, high-productivity events believed to contribute significantly to carbon export. In this study, we use an autonomous underwater vehicle to estimate carbon export with high resolution in coastal California. The results agree with more precise but lower-resolution measurements, implying that the vehicle-based approach may be useful for estimating carbon export in similar regions that may be dominated by undersampled, high-productivity events.

AB Recent deep learning-based object detectors have shown compelling performance for the detection of large objects in autonomous driving applications. However, the detection of small objects like traffic signs and traffic lights is challenging owing to the complex nature of such objects. This article investigates how an existing object detector can be adjusted to address specific tasks and how these modifications can impact the detection of small objects. In particular, we explore and introduce architectural changes to the different components of the popular YOLOv5 model in order to improve its performance in the detection of small objects for autonomous driving. Initially, we propose group depthwise separable convolution as the improved convolution unit to replace standard convolution. We then integrate this unit to create the attention-based dilated CSP block. Lastly, this block is combined with several proposed modules, including the improved SPP, improved PANet, and improved information paths, to form our IS-YOLOv5 model. We also integrate kernel pruning on the network to accelerate the model deployment on vehicle-mounted mobile platform due to limited computing resources and real-time constraints. Specifically, we propose the versatile network pruning (VNP) technique based on Taylor criterion ranking to prune less-essential kernels in the network. We will show that our modifications barely increase the complexity but significantly improve the detection accuracy and speed. Compared to the conventional YOLOv5, the proposed IS-YOLOv5 model increases the mAP by 8.35% on the BDD100K dataset. Besides, our proposed model improves the detection speed in FPS by 3.10% compared to the YOLOv5 model. When using the VNP scheme, FPS is further increased by 52.14%, while the model size and complexity are reduced by 39.29% and 47.81%, with almost no change in mAP. Nevertheless, when compared to state-of-the-art models, IS-YOLOv5+VNP is found to be conducive to the deployment in autonomous driving systems.

AB During and after Hurricane Maria in 2017, the island of Puerto Rico faced an impossible situation: the transportation, power, and communication networks were all damaged, leading to numerous people being trapped. Humanitarian logistics service providers have the responsibility to reach as many affected populations as possible within short periods of time. Their extremely difficult operations are further hindered by these failures in our built environment. Failures in transportation mean that some routes cannot be used by conventional ground vehicles; failures in communication mean that demands are uncertain, and the locations of said demands may be difficult to pinpoint. In this work, we propose a novel two-echelon vehicle routing framework for performing many of the humanitarian logistics operations using aerial uncrewed autonomous vehicles (drones) to address the issues associated with these infrastructure failures. In our proposed framework, we assume that ground vehicles cannot always reach the trapped population directly, but they can transport drones from a depot to some intermediate satellite locations. The drones launched from these locations can serve to both identify demands for medical and other aids (e.g., epi-pens, medical supplies, dry food, water) and make deliveries to satisfy them. Specifically, we present an expert decision support system, in which the resulting optimization problem is formulated as a two-echelon vehicle routing problem with trucks as the first echelon vehicles and drones as the second echelon vehicles. Our framework utilizes two types of drones. Hotspot or communication providing drones have the capability of providing cell phone and internet reception, and hence, are used to capture demands and their locations. Delivery drones are subsequently employed to satisfy these obtained demands. To handle demand uncertainty, we decompose the decision problem into two stages: providing telecommunications capabilities in the first stage, thereby capturing demands precisely, and satisfying the resulting demands in the second stage. To solve the resulting models, we propose a matheuristic computational approach in the form of a decomposition algorithm inspired by column generation to identify optimal drone routes. To showcase the application of our proposed framework, we present results from numerical experiments on datasets created to simulate the demand for medical aid in Puerto Rico after Hurricane Maria.

AB Response efforts in emergency applications such as border protection, humanitarian relief and disaster monitoring have improved with the use of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs), which provide a flexibly deployed eye in the sky. These efforts have been further improved with advances in autonomous behaviours such as obstacle avoidance, take-off, landing, hovering and waypoint flight modes. However, most UAVs lack autonomous decision making for navigating in complex environments. This limitation creates a reliance on ground control stations to UAVs and, therefore, on their communication systems. The challenge is even more complex in indoor flight operations, where the strength of the Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) signals is absent or weak and compromises aircraft behaviour. This paper proposes a UAV framework for autonomous navigation to address uncertainty and partial observability from imperfect sensor readings in cluttered indoor scenarios. The framework design allocates the computing processes onboard the flight controller and companion computer of the UAV, allowing it to explore dangerous indoor areas without the supervision and physical presence of the human operator. The system is illustrated under a Search and Rescue (SAR) scenario to detect and locate victims inside a simulated office building. The navigation problem is modelled as a Partially Observable Markov Decision Process (POMDP) and solved in real time through the Augmented Belief Trees (ABT) algorithm. Data is collected using Hardware in the Loop (HIL) simulations and real flight tests. Experimental results show the robustness of the proposed framework to detect victims at various levels of location uncertainty. The proposed system ensures personal safety by letting the UAV to explore dangerous environments without the intervention of the human operator.

AB Forecasting vehicles' future motion is crucial for real-world applications such as the navigation of autonomous vehicles and feasibility of safety systems based on the Internet of Vehicles (IoV). Vehicular trajectory prediction at urban intersections remains challenging due to the difficulty in modeling temporal dependencies and spatial interactions among traffic agents. This paper proposes a dynamic-learning spatial-temporal Transformer network (DSTTN) with domain adaptation training methods based on two modules for two-dimensional vehicular trajectory prediction at urban intersections. The first module is trajectory maneuver characterization (TMC) which captures latent driving maneuver features and divides trajectory data into different categories with different distributions, which can be regarded as different domains in transfer learning (TL). The second module is trajectory distribution matching (TDM) which adopts a novel spatialtemporal Transformer network with distribution matching loss to dynamically learn domaininvariant maneuvers and achieve accurate trajectory prediction. Experiments and ablation studies collected at two unsignalized urban intersections of the inD dataset first validate the interpretability, transferability, and high prediction accuracy of the proposed DSTTN. The results show that the TMC module has maneuver-representational ability. The proposed STTN achieves good and stable prediction accuracy compared with other baselines, including the state-of-the-art deep learning model, while DSTTN with the TMC and TDM modules further improves accuracy. Additional experiments have been conducted under 70 randomly-selected urban intersection scenarios of the Waymo dataset to validate the good prediction accuracy of the proposed method. The formulation of DSTTN offers new ideas for dividing trajectory data into different domains and general domain adaptation to vehicle trajectory prediction under urban road environments.

AB The development of assessment methods for the performance of Automated Vehicles (AVs) is essential to enable the deployment of automated driving technologies, due to the complex operational domain of AVs. One candidate is scenario-based assessment, in which test cases are derived from real-world road traffic scenarios obtained from driving data. Because of the high variety of the possible scenarios, using only observed scenarios for the assessment is not sufficient. Therefore, methods for generating additional scenarios are necessary. Our contribution is twofold. First, we propose a method to determine the parameters that describe the scenarios to a sufficient degree while relying less on strong assumptions on the parameters that characterize the scenarios. By estimating the probability density function (pdf) of these parameters, realistic parameter values can be generated. Second, we present the Scenario Representativeness (SR) metric based on the Wasserstein distance, which quantifies to what extent the scenarios with the generated parameter values are representative of real-world scenarios while covering the actual variety found in the real-world scenarios. A comparison of our proposed method with methods relying on assumptions of the scenario parameterization and pdf estimation shows that the proposed method can automatically determine the optimal scenario parameterization and pdf estimation. Furthermore, it is demonstrated that our sr metric can be used to choose the (number of) parameters that best describe a scenario. The presented method is promising, because the parameterization and pdf estimation can directly be applied to already available importance sampling strategies for accelerating the evaluation of AVs.

TI Simulation-Based Evaluation of Variation in Left-Turn Paths in the
   Coordinated Intersection Management
SO JOURNAL OF ADVANCED TRANSPORTATION
LA English
DT Article
ID AUTOMATED VEHICLES; FORMULATION
AB Coordinated intersection management (CIM) has gained more attention with the advance of connected and autonomous vehicle technology. The optimization of passing schedules and conflict separation between conflicting vehicles are usually conducted based on the predefined travelling paths through the intersection area in the CIM. In real-world implementation, however, the diversity of turn paths exists due to multiple factors such as various vehicle sizes and automation control algorithms. The aim of this paper is to investigate how the variation in left-turn paths affects the feasibility and viability of optimal passing schedules, as well as the safety and efficiency of intersection operation. To do this, we start with identifying six typical left-turn paths to represent the variation. A scenario-based simulation is first conducted by using each of the paths as the nominal path. The optimal schedules and the corresponding alternative schedules are generated to calculate indicators for nominal performance, average performance, and robustness. The best path is selected in terms of schedule optimality and robustness. With schedules obtained by solving CIM models using the selected path, the left-turning CAVs are assumed to travel along one of the six paths randomly to simulate the path divergence. A surrogate safety measure, PET, is utilized to assess the safety of the intersection under CIM. The theoretical PET with the nominal path and the actual PET with the random path are calculated for each conflict event. Comparisons of two PET sets show the increase in conflict risk and vehicle delay. The conclusion can be drawn that the variation in left-turn paths causes the decline in safety level and travelling efficiency and should be considered in the CIM model to ensure safe and efficient implementation in the intersection.

AB Analysis of lane change is important for microsimulation and safety improvement, and can also provide reference for advanced driver assistance systems (ADAS) and connected and autonomous vehicles (CAVs). Yet little research has comprehensively explored lane changing, particularly in China, a site of current CAV testing. This study developed an automatic extraction algorithm to retrieve 5339 lane change events from the Shanghai Naturalistic Driving Study, and used the data to examine the core lane change components: gap acceptance, duration, and impact on the following vehicle (FV). Multilevel mixed-effects linear models were employed to develop relationships between gap acceptance and duration and the influencing factors; impact was then assessed using speed change rate, brake timestamping, and time-to-collision (TTC). Key results showed that (1) gap acceptance varied by roadway type and motivation, and lead and lag gaps were significantly affected by environmental variables, vehicle type, and kinematic parameters; (2) duration varied from 0.7 s to 16.1 s, significantly affected by variables similar to gap acceptance, but notably, not by motivation; (3) as many as 1 in 5 Chinese FV drivers responded to lane changes with acceleration exceeding 10%; (4) nearly half of FVs braked when they perceived a vehicle's lane-change intention, and 90% braked before TTC reached 4.7 s; (5) in over 70% of lane changes, the minimum TTC occurred between the initiation and cross-lane points. In addition to advancing the international development of lane-change theory, one of this study's important applications is that CAVs can be designed to brake during a safer TTC phase.

AB This paper analyzes the transient dynamics of one dimensional flocks, platoons, i.e., a finite collection of identical vehicles moving on the line, with a single leader with independent motion. We show for a class of platoon control laws that if the information flow is asymmetric then a motion change of the leader will cause system transients with amplitudes that grow at an exponential rate as the length of the platoon increases. With suitable choice of the control parameters the system is asymptotically stable and in steady state all vehicles move at the same velocity as the leader and at the required separation. When the leader changes velocity, over very long time scales the vehicles in the platoon tend to the steady state dictated by the leader's new velocity. The transient dynamics in the intermediary regime can however appear quite unstable, where the trailing vehicle can undergo oscillatory motion with amplitudes that grow exponentially large with the number of cars in the platoon, or may be irresponsive over an exponentially long time to the change in the motion of the leader. In this paper we prove that if the control law is asymmetric then such transient errors, measured in terms of displacement between the leader and the trailing car, grow at an exponential rate in, the length of the platoon. This contrasts sharply with the symmetric (bidirectional) case when such transient errors grow only linearly in the length of the platoon, the theoretical minimum for decentralized linear time-invariant platoon control systems with a constant vehicle spacing policy. These results suggest that symmetry of the information flow is an important design parameter for safe control laws for platoons.

AB Drivable area detection is an important component of various levels of autonomous driving starting from advanced driver assistance systems (ADAS) to fully automated vehicles. A drivable area detection system detects the road segment in front of the vehicle for it to drive freely and safely. Using LIght Detection And Ranging (LIDAR) or cameras, these systems need to identify areas free of vehicles, pedestrians and other objects constituting as obstacles for the vehicles movement. As such areas can vary from asphalt to dirt road with or without lane markings and with many obstacle configurations, learning-based approaches have provided effective algorithms using large training data. While accuracy is of high importance, training and runtime complexity of these methods also matter. In this work, we propose a deep learning-based method that detects the drivable area from a single image providing comparable performance with improved training and runtime performance. The model splits the given image in thin slices which are processed by a simple convolutional network regressor to model the drivable with a single parameter. The experiments on benchmark data shows comparable accuracy against the literature while showing improvement in runtime performance. It shows 237 fps operating speed and 92.55% detection performance on a Titan XP GPU while providing similar detection performance at above 30 fps on a low cost Jetson Nano module.

AB During the past few years, as Internet of Things develops rapidly, the applications of unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) technology have been increasingly widely used. Meanwhile, the efficiency and security issues of UAV communication have brought about widespread attention of many researchers in different fields. In an open wireless network, the attacks on UAV communication mainly include eavesdropping, tampering, interrupting, forgery, etc. Signcryption is an appropriate method to address these security problems. However, the existing signcryption schemes are not suitable for UAVs with limited resources and ground station (GS) that needs to process a large number of messages from UAVs. Moreover, in a certain area, UAVs and a GS may belong to different cryptosystems. Therefore, in this article, we came up with a heterogeneous signcryption scheme for UAVs to communicate to a GS (HSC-U2G) without bilinear pairing operation, where UAVs belong to identity-based cryptography (IBC) while the GS belongs to public-key infrastructure (PKI). Moreover, our scheme provides identity privacy for UAVs and supports batch verification for the GS. Using the random oracle model, we demonstrate HSC-U2G can achieve insider security for confidentiality as well as unforgeability. After that, HSC-U2G is compared with several important related works and we provide all experimental results to show the efficiency.

AB As populations around the world age, the challenge of ensuring that transport systems can contribute to the wellbeing of older adults becomes more pertinent. Maintaining wellbeing is particularly challenging for older adults in car-dependent societies who have to stop driving at some point in life. It is widely suggested that automated transport will provide a technological solution to the challenges of reduced accessibility and mobility faced by older adults who can no longer drive.
   In this position paper, we explore the potential wellbeing implications for an ageing population of a transition to automated vehicles and consequent social and spatial shifts in the context of Aotearoa New Zealand, which is a highly car dependent nation. We discuss the processes through which different levels of automation, and different models of vehicle access, could result in different wellbeing outcomes through changes to travel behaviours and urban form.
   We conclude by discussing the implications of our findings for transport policy and managerial practice, both in Aotearoa New Zealand and cities globally. Ultimately, we argue that the efficacy of emerging transport technologies for ageing populations depends on the extent to which new technologies are accessible and affordable for older people and how far they can support development of denser, less car reliant urban environments. Achieving this is a challenge for transport management.

AB Swarms of robots are starting to appear in aerial and ground robotics across multiple operational domains: be it for search-and-rescue mapping, or Olympic light shows, controlled groups of drones are able to be coordinated in groups. This capability does not currently extend to the underwater domain, for a reason of basic physics: the attenuation of light in water is 10 orders of magnitude greater than that in air, rendering ineffective the navigation and communication technologies used in terrestrial robotics. Autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) navigation is either expensive or unwieldy, requiring high-power sensors such as inertial navigation sensors (INS) that cost hundreds of thousands of dollars, frequent surfacing for GPS, or the deployment of geo-located acoustic beacons, limiting the operational area which is a severe constraint given the scale of oceanographic sensing. To do swarms of underwater vehicles will require a navigation and communication scheme that allows vehicles to remain together in an area while prosecuting a mission without these constraints. This paper suggests a system that would make underwater swarming possible by using single-transducer, Doppler-based and multi-frequency attenuation-based acoustic navigation without time-synchronization for multi-vehicle swarming. In this solution, a leader with good navigation carries a multi-frequency sound source. Scalable numbers of followers equipped with a custom low-cost acoustic package then adapt heading based on Doppler-shifted frequency and range using multi-frequency difference in absorption. In this paper, the theory behind this technique is presented and tested under different simulation conditions. Design of a prototype low-cost system is also described.

AB It is critical for autonomous vehicles to recognize traffic police gestures timely and accurately. During the movement of the vehicle, the collected traffic police scales change all the time, in addition, the frequency and amplitude of actions of different traffic police are different. First, we use gesture normalization to fix the traffic police actions at a unified scale and remove the influence of scale changes on traffic police gesture recognition. Meanwhile, a fully adaptive spatial-temporal graph convolution network (FA-STGCN) is proposed to recognize the actions with different amplitude and frequencies. The adaptive spatial graph network can dig the latent joints connection relation of the traffic police under different gestures, which weakens the amplitude impact on the action recognition. The adaptive temporal graph network is composed of the global temporal module and the local temporal module. The global temporal module can obtain the coarse-grained features of the traffic police gestures' speed and then naturally use the coarse-grained features to guide the local temporal module to adaptively learn the fine-grained temporal features of the traffic police action. The adaptive spatial graph network and the temporal graph network are alternately stacked to finally output accurate traffic police gestures. We thoroughly evaluated our method through intensive experiments, the result shows that our method achieved the best results on public datasets. What's more, we proofed the effectiveness of each module and verified our methods for moving vehicles for the first time, the performance present meets the vehicle's practical requirements.

ID MOTION SICKNESS; SIMULATOR; RISK
AB A prime concern for automated vehicles is motion comfort, as an uncomfortable ride may reduce acceptance of the technology amongst the general population. However, it is not clear how transient motions typical for travelling by car affect the experience of comfort. Here, we determine the relation between properties of vehicle motions (i.e., acceleration and jerk) and discomfort empirically, and we evaluate the ability of normative models to account for the data. 23 participants were placed in a moving-base driving simulator and presented sinusoidial and triangular motion pulses with various peak accelerations (A(max)0.4 - 2 ms(-2)) and jerks (J(max)0.5 - 15 ms(-3)), designed to recreate typical vehicle accelerations. Participants provided discomfort judgments on absolute 'Verbal Qualifiers' and relative 'Magnitude Estimates' associated with these motions. The data show that discomfort increases with acceleration amplitude, and that the strength of this effect depends on the direction of motion. We furthermore find that higher jerks (shorter duration pulses) are considered more comfortable, and that triangular pulses are more comfortable than sinusoidal pulses. ME responses decrease (i.e., reduced discomfort) with increasing pulse duration. Evaluations of normative models of vibration and shock (ISO 2631), and perceived motion intensity provide mixed results. The vibration model could not account for the data well. Reasonable agreement between predictions and observations were found for the shock model and perceived intensity model, which emphasize the role of acceleration. We present novel statistical models that describe motion comfort as a function of acceleration, jerk, and direction. The present findings are essential to develop motion planning algorithms aimed at maximizing comfort.

AB As the market penetration rate of automated vehicles (AVs) increases, there will be a transition period when the traffic stream is composed of both AVs and human-driven vehicles (MVs) in the near future. However, the interactions between MVs and AVs, especially whether MVs will behave differently when following AVs compared to following MVs, have not been fully understood. Previous studies in this field mainly conducted traffic/numerical simulations or field experiments to investigate human drivers' behavior changes, but these approaches all have critical drawbacks such as simplified driving environments and limited sample sizes. To fill in the knowledge gap, this study uses the high-resolution (10 Hz) Waymo Open Dataset to reveal differences in carfollowing behaviors between MV-following-AV and MV-following-MV cases. Driving volatility measures, time headways and time-to-collision (TTC) are adopted to quantify and compare MV-following-AV and MV-followingMV interactions. The principal component analysis (PCA) is applied on the high-dimensional feature space, followed by the hierarchical clustering on the dimension-reduced feature set to categorize MV driving styles when following AVs. The comparison results indicate that MV-following-AV events have lower driving volatility in terms of velocity and acceleration/deceleration, smaller time headways and higher TTC values. Furthermore, the clustering results reveal that human drivers when following AVs exhibit four different car-following styles: high-velocity-non-aggressive, high-velocity-aggressive, low-velocity-non-aggressive, and low-velocityaggressive. These findings highlight the vital importance of taking into account the heterogeneity of MVfollowing-AV behaviors when designing mixed traffic control algorithms and can be beneficial for AV fleet operators to improve their algorithms.

AB With the promising advances in the telecommunication and automotive industries, there are increasing concerns on the reliability of Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS) applications and standardization efforts. Nowadays, vehicles are empowered with innovative communications and sensing capabilities to accelerate next-generation Connected and Autonomous Vehicles (CAV) or Vehicle-to-Everything (V2X) communications. Furthermore, V2X is based on many radio access technologies including Dedicated Short-Range Communications (DSRC), Cellular-V2X, and millimeter-wave. It is expected that a single technology is incapable to support the diverse QoS and reliability requirements of vehicular safety and non-safety applications. Therefore, recent research works have investigated and developed different approaches to enable multi-radio access technologies (Multi-RAT) in V2X networks to support these multitudes of requirements. In addition, the heterogeneity of diverse radio access technologies and rigidity in their deployment increases the complexity of the network management. Complications may also arise from inefficient resource utilization due to the complexity of an optimum RAT selection or multi-link establishment through Multi-RATs. Therefore, a global monitoring paradigm such as Software-Defined Vehicular Network (SDVN) has been identified as a solution to reduce this bottleneck, by adding flexibility and agility to the vehicular network. This paper extensively reviews recent related works on Multi-RAT V2X networks focusing on the opportunistic selection mechanism of RAT, allocation of radio resources, and simultaneous establishment of multi-link over a heterogeneous network. Consequently, we have outlined the SDVN architecture, layers, features, and significance towards enhancing the performance of such Multi-RAT networks. Finally, several potential challenges with probable solutions and opportunities are discussed.

AB Previous research demonstrated that green light optimal speed advisory (GLOSA) affects driving behavior at signalized intersections: On the one hand, drivers assisted with GLOSA show more energy-efficient and eco-friendly driving. Following unequipped vehicles' drivers (UVDs) also adapt their driving behavior to the assisted one. On the other hand, safety issues can be found in encounters with UVDs who also perceive assisted driving behavior negatively. Therefore, in a multi-driver simulator study (N = 60 participants sorted in groups of n = 2 UVDs), we tested whether informing UVDs about the GLOSA of an assisted driver results in more behavioral adaptation of UVDs to the assisted driving behavior, less safety issues, and less frustration of UVDs. Two UVDs followed a lead vehicle driven by a confederate. The confederate was equipped with GLOSA and knew when traffic lights switched from green to red and, consequently, slowed down when approaching a green traffic light. The degree of information UVDs received was manipulated: The group "no information" did not receive any information. The group "information" knew about the equipment of the assisted confederate with GLOSA and the group "detailed information" received additional information about its functionality and benefit. Results show that UVDs of the group "detailed information" adapted their driving behavior to the assisted driver. However, these UVDs also showed smaller minimum time-to-collision (ITC) values indicating safety issues. Results are discussed and implications made with regard to providing information to UVDs and to further investigate these challenges in the context of autonomous vehicles. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

AB This field study aims at understanding the influence of direct experience of an automated vehicle (AV, Level 3) and explaining and predicting public acceptance of AVs through a psychological model. The model includes behavioral intention (BI) to use self-driving vehicles (SDVs, Level 5), willingness to re-ride (WTR) in our AV (Level 3), and their four potential determinants, namely perceived usefulness (PU), perceived ease of use (PEU), trust related to SDVs, and perceived safety (PS) while riding in our AV. The last two determinants are largely ignored, but we consider them critical in the context of AVs. Three-hundred students were invited as participants (passengers) to experience the AV. The trust, PU, PEU, and BI of the participants were recorded prior to their experiencing the AV; after this experience, all the constructs of the psychological model were recorded. The participants' experience with the AV was found to increase their trust, PU and PEU (but not BI), the consistency between PU/PEU and BI, and the explanatory power of BI. The model explained 55% of the variance in BI and 40% in WTR. PU, trust, and PS were found to be steady and direct predictors of both the acceptance measures; PEU predicted BI only after the participants' AV experience. Mediation analysis showed that trust also can indirectly affect AV acceptance through other determinants. Out-of-sample prediction confirmed the model's predictive capability for AV acceptance. The theoretical contributions and practical implications of the findings are discussed.

AB For civil applications of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) for search, and emergency, data transmission between UAVs and Ground Control Stations (GCS) is always suffered from long distance, undulating terrains or other interferences. Thus, relaying is a critical enhancing technology in wireless communications for better service quality. In this paper, a planning method for fixed-wing relay UAV (RU) serving to sequential tasks of UAV swarm is proposed. Firstly, considering characteristics of signal propagation, antenna, environment and UAV, the UAV-to-GCS and UAV-to-UAV communication models are designed. And the limits of communication are investigated, which are crucial issues to provide a guarantee for swarm mission. Meanwhile, based on the analysis of relay UAVs requirements during the spatial distribution of tasks, a mixed integer nonlinear programming problem (MINLP) is constructed to solve the approximate number of relay nodes and access locations. Then aiming for the minimum number of relay UAVs, a continuous time-sharing relay UAVs reward model is constructed, and the consensus-based bundle algorithm (CBBA) is adopted to obtain the maximum rewards, including the number of relay nodes, mission sequences and route planning. Finally, the numerical simulation for a typical scenario is conducted to show the performance of the proposed approach.

AB Techniques for high accuracy tracking of the 3-D velocity, position, and cellular carrier frequency bias of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) that communicate using a cellular network are presented. The tracking algorithm does only rely on asynchronous measurements of Doppler shift in a minimum of four base station sites. This number can be reduced to three, by combination with a round-trip time measurement from one site. The tracking is therefore independent of any capability of the UAV transceiver, like the global positioning system that may be disabled in the UAV by the pilot. Another significant advantage is that high precision time synchronization between base stations is not needed. The algorithm exploits interacting multiple model filtering, with the nonlinear measurement equations handled by extended Kalman filters. The low computational complexity, low sampling rate, and the uplink Doppler shift measurement resources enable joint tracking of several UAVs per cell. This makes the tracking technique relevant for supervision of UAV traffic using cellular connectivity, for example for border surveillance and surveillance of sensitive areas like airports where illegal flying may be extremely dangerous and costly. Theoretically, an observability analysis treats measurement configurations based on different combinations of Doppler shift and round-trip time. Simulations are used to illustrate the performance and to assess the initialization properties.

AB Rear end collisions are deadliest in nature and result in life losses and severe injuries. Many of the proposed rear-end collision avoidance schemes focus only on specific aspects without considering several non-direct factors, such as driver inattention or distraction, tailgating, panic stops, street surface circumstances, driver response time, person on foot stream and vehicle elements. Henceforth presenting greater challenges in proposing a precise numerical model of the vehicle control framework. Moreover, most collision avoidance schemes incorporate fuzzy logic for formulating human inspired collision avoidance controllers. But the problem with a fuzzy based controller is that their efficiency is greatly affected by the number of rules being deployed. Furthermore, no such agent-based modeling has been utilized, which can effectively model the human-inspired behavior. Literature is full of vehicle control frameworks that work in a connected and homogeneous environment, again critics have raised several questions for such frameworks working in a connected environment. This study aims not only to identify these key issues but also propose a human-inspired physics based Spiral Spring based Simple Reflex Agent for rear end collision avoidance. Our scheme will not only work in the non-connected and heterogeneous environment but will also consider the distraction causing road factors and effectively handle them. Extensive experimentations and presentation for the proof of concept have supported our claims and worthiness of proposed agent-based scheme.

AB This paper presents a method to design a path tracking controller with four-wheel independent braking (4WIB), drive (4WID) and steering (4WIS) systems equipped in in-wheel motor-driven electric vehicles (IWM-EVs). Generally, it is difficult to calculate the steering angles of 4WIS and the braking/traction torques of 4WIB/4WID for path tracking control. Moreover, there have been limitations of an error dynamics-based path tracking controller, which requires assumptions on a target path. To cope with these problems, the path tracking problem on a target path is converted into the yaw rate tracking one with a reference yaw rate in this paper. Two methods are adopted for the purpose of calculating a reference yaw rate. The first is to use a pure pursuit method, which generates a steering angle for path tracking. From the steering angle, a reference yaw rate is calculated. The second is to derive a reference yaw rate from a target path and a current vehicle position. For yaw rate tracking, direct yaw moment control is adopted to generate a control yaw moment. A control allocation method is adopted to distribute a control yaw moment into tire forces, generated by 4WIS, 4WID and 4WIB. Several actuator combinations are represented by various sets of virtual weights in the control allocation method. A simulation with a vehicle simulation program, CarSim (R), shows that the proposed path tracking controller is effective in enhancing the path tracking performance with 4WIS, 4WID and 4WIB. From the simulation, effects of actuator combinations on path tracking performance are analyzed.

ID DISSEMINATION
AB Sharing perceptual data (e.g., camera and LiDAR data) with other vehicles enhances the traffic safety of autonomous vehicles because it helps vehicles locate other vehicles and pedestrians in their blind spots. Such safety applications require high throughput and short delay, which cannot be achieved by conventional microwave vehicular communication systems. Therefore, millimeter-wave (mmWave) communications are considered to be a key technology for sharing perceptual data because of their wide bandwidth. One of the challenges of data sharing in mmWave communications is broadcasting because narrow-beam directional antennas are used to obtain high gain. Because many vehicles should share their perceptual data to others within a short time frame in order to enlarge the areas that can be perceived based on shared perceptual data, an efficient scheduling for concurrent transmission that improves spatial reuse is required for perceptual data sharing. This paper proposes a data sharing algorithm that employs a graph-based concurrent transmission scheduling. The proposed algorithm realizes concurrent transmission to improve spatial reuse by designing a rule that is utilized to determine if the two pairs of transmitters and receivers interfere with each other by considering the radio propagation characteristics of narrow-beam antennas. A prioritization method that considers the geographical information in perceptual data is also designed to enlarge perceivable areas in situations where data sharing time is limited and not all data can be shared. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm doubles the area of the cooperatively perceivable region compared with a conventional algorithm that does not consider mmWave communications because the proposed algorithm achieves high-throughput transmission by improving spatial reuse. The prioritization also enlarges the perceivable region by a maximum of 20%.

AB Additional signaling devices for highly automated vehicles (AVs) that can communicate their driving state to other road users can simplify the integration process in existing road traffic. This paper presents the results of an international, virtual reality-based study conducted in China, South Korea and the USA in which subjects assume the role of a pedestrian and are placed in direct encounter situations with an AV in a parking lot. A novel communication interface consisting of three displays is attached to the AV's front and used to show additional information about its driving state. In total, three encounter scenarios are investigated: the AV approaches from the left, front and right outside of the pedestrian's line of sight. The influence of different symbol types on the subject's moving behavior, recognition of intention and perceived safety is investigated. The results show that additional signals ensure a better perception of the AV's intention and increase the perceived safety. The moving behavior of subjects is significantly changed when additional signals are used during driving tasks compared to the same tasks without such signals. The change of moving behaviour is similar in encounter situations where the AV approaches from the left and front but differs in encounter situations from the right. These results could equally he proven for all nationalities, which shows that a uniform, international solution for additional signaling devices of highly automated vehicles is possible.

Numerous reports from around the world present significant benefits of platooning for the environment due to reduced emissions, reduced fuel costs, and improved logistics in the transport industry. This paper presents original aerodynamic and aeroacoustic studies of identical truck column models. They are divided into four main stages. In the first, a truck model and three columns of identical trucks with different distances between the vehicles was made and tested using computational fluid dynamics (CFD). Two turbulence models were used in the study: k-omega shear stress transport (SST) and large eddy simulation (LES). The aim of the work was to determine the drag coefficients for each set of vehicles. The second stage of work included determination of sound field distributions generated by moving vehicles. Using the Ffowcs Williams-Hawkings (FW-H) analogy, the sound pressure levels were determined, followed by the sound pressure levels A. In order to verify the correctness of the work carried out, field tests were also performed and additional acoustic calculations were carried out using the NMPB-Routes-2008 and ISO 9613-2 models. Calculations were performed using SoundPlan software. The performed tests showed good quality of the built aerodynamic and aeroacoustic models. The results presented in this paper have a universal character and can be used to build intelligent transport systems (ITSs) and intelligent environmental management systems (IEMSs) for municipalities, counties, cities, and urban agglomerations by taking into account the platooning process.

AB Path planning is a significant and challenging task in the domain of automatic driving. Many applications, such as autonomous driving, robotic navigation and aircraft object tracking in complex and changing urban road scenes, need accurate and robust path planning by detecting obstacles in the forward direction. The traditional methods only rely on the path search method without considering the environmental factors, the vehicle path planning method cannot deal with the complex and changeable environment. To deal with above problems, we propose a perception-aware based multi-modal feature fusion approach that combines visual-inertial odometer (VIO) poses and semantic obstacles in the forward scene of vehicles to plan driving paths. The proposed method takes environment awareness as the guide and combines path search algorithm to realize path optimization task in complex environment. The proposed approach first uses a long short memory network (LSTM) to build a VIO that fuses visual and inertial data for pose estimation. To detect obstacles, the proposed method uses a segmentation model with a lightweight structure to extract semantic 3D landmarks. Finally, a path search strategy combining an A* algorithm and visual information is proposed to plan driving paths for intelligent vehicles. We estimate the proposed path planning method on assimilated scenes and public datasets (KITTI and Cityscapes) by using a micro controller (Jetson Xavier NX) installed on a small vehicle. We also show comparable results with path planning that only uses the greedy algorithm or heuristic algorithm without using visual information and show that our method is adequate in coping with different complex scenes.

AB Internet of Vehicles (IoV) is a typical application of Internet-of-Things (IoT) technology in the field of intelligent transportation systems. In the actual IoV, such as the autonomous vehicle fleet, there exists the problem of heterogeneous multivehicle coordination based on IoT communication. How to ensure the synchronization of multiple vehicles is a hot issue. In particular, when the system can only obtain a partial state of the vehicle, and does not know the dynamic model, including the vehicle itself and the companion model. To overcome these deficiencies, this article deals with the model-free output consensus control problem for a class of partially observable heterogeneous multivehicle systems (MVSs). Using measurable input/output data without any system knowledge, this article develops a Q-function-based adaptive dynamic programming (ADP). First, an adaptive distributed observer is designed to estimate the output of the leader. The augmented state representation is built using historical measurable input/output data instead of the unmeasurable inner system state. Then, a Q-function-based ADP method using measurable input/output data was introduced. The method is used to solve this distributed tracking control problem without the requirement for the MVSs dynamics. The convergence analysis of the proposed method is also given. To facilitate the implementation of the proposed method, an actor-critic framework is adopted to approximate the optimal Q-functions and the optimal control policies. It shows that the approximated control policies achieve the distributed optimal tracking control. Finally, the simulation results verify the effectiveness of the developed method for solving multivehicle formation control problems.

AB A robust adaptive fuzzy neural network control (RAFNNC) algorithm is proposed based on a generalized dynamic fuzzy neural network (GDFNN), proportion-integral-differential (PID), and improved bacterial foraging optimization (BFO) algorithm, for heading the control of the unmanned marine vehicle (UMV) in the presence of a complex environment disturbance. First, the inverse dynamic model of the motion control of UMV is established based on the GDFNN for the uncertain disturbance caused by the complex environment disturbance. Then, the adaptive rate of the fuzzy neural network is designed based on the error between the real UMV heading angle and designed reference heading angle, so as to further adjust the weight parameter of the GDFNN, and then, the output control value of the neural network is obtained. In order to further reduce the computation amount and computation time of the RAFNNC, the parameters of the PID control algorithm were optimized in advance by using the improved BFO algorithm. The fractal dimension step size and the intelligent probe operation are integrated into the BFO algorithm, in order to optimize the operation time and accuracy of the algorithm. Stability of the designed RAFNNC algorithm for the heading control of the UMV in the presence of complex marine environment disturbance is proved by the Lyapunov stability theory, and the effectiveness and accuracy of the control algorithm proposed are verified by semi-physical simulation experiment carried out in our laboratory.

AB This article investigates the tracking-oriented robust leaderless time-varying formation (TVF) control problem for unmanned aerial vehicle swarm systems (UAVSSs) with Lipschitz nonlinear dynamics under directed topology, where external disturbances are random and bounded, and communication delays (CDs) are bounded. In this article, a state-feedback control approach is adopted to make sure that a UAVSS forms a desired TVF and follows a specified trajectory when CDs and external disturbances occur. First, a novel PD-like formation control protocol with several unknown parameters and CDs is designed. The protocol contains the information of the local neighborhood status and its differential quantities. Second, the tracking-oriented robust leaderless TVF control problem with Lipschitz dynamics, external disturbances, and CDs is transformed into a problem about asymptotic stability of a lower dimensional closed-loop control system through a special matrix decomposition. Third, a theorem is proposed to determine the unknown parameters of the control protocol and the upper bound of CDs. In the theorem, sufficient conditions for a UAVSS to attain the anticipated TVF and trajectory tracking are obtained. A Lyapunov-Krasovskii (LK) functional is constructed to verify that the error among the practical flight state of UAVs, the anticipant TVF configuration, and tracking trajectory can asymptotically converge to 0. Finally, with the presentation of a simulation case, the effectiveness of the theoretical results is illustrated.

AB Multiaccess edge computing (MEC) enables autonomous vehicles to handle time-critical and data-intensive computational tasks for emerging Internet-of-Vehicles (IoV) applications via computation offloading. However, a massive amount of data generated by colocated vehicles is typically redundant, introducing a critical issue due to limited network bandwidth. Moreover, on the edge server side, these computation-intensive tasks further impose severe pressure on the resource-finite MEC server, resulting in low-performance efficiency of applications. To solve these challenges, we model the data redundancy and collaborative task computing scheme to efficiently reduce the redundant data and utilize the idle resources in nearby MEC servers. First, the data redundancy problem is formulated as a set-covering problem according to the spatiotemporal coverage of captured images. Next, we exploit the submodular optimization technique to design an efficient algorithm to minimize the number of images transferred to the MEC servers without degrading the quality of IoV applications. To facilitate the task execution in the MEC server, we then propose a collaborative task computing scheme, where an MEC server intentionally encourages nearby resource-rich MEC servers to participate in a collaborative computing group. Accordingly, a cost model is formulated as an optimization problem, the objective of which is to prompt the MEC server to judiciously allocate computing tasks to nearby MEC servers with the goal of achieving the minimal cost while the latency of tasks is guaranteed. Experimental results show that the proposed scheme can efficiently mitigate data redundancy, conserve network bandwidth consumption, and achieve the lowest cost for processing tasks.

AB The recent development of autonomous driving technologies has led to the proliferation of research on sensors and electronic equipment inside a vehicle. To deal with security concerns of in-vehicle networks, various deep learning (DL) and reinforcement learning (RL) have been developed to enhance in-vehicle security. However, the DL/RL agents are vulnerable to adversarial perturbation, where an attacker can perform a manipulation attack to interfere with the agent's operation. In this work, we aim to develop two key mechanisms to build secure in-vehicle networks: (1) RL-based proactive defense mechanism to achieve multiple objectives of minimizing system security vulnerabilities while maximizing service availability; and (2) a resilient RL method that allows an agent to operate in the presence of adversarial disturbances that neutralize the system security. To this end, we propose, DESOLATER (Drl-based rESOurce aLlocation And mTd dEployment fRamework), which is a multi-agent deep reinforcement learning (mDRL)-based network slicing technique that can help determine two key network management decisions: (1) link bandwidth allocation to meet quality-of-service (QoS) requirements; and (2) the frequency of triggering IP shuffling as a proactive defense mechanism not to hinder service availability by maintaining normal system operations. We also introduce an anomaly detection mechanism with a memory-based RL technique to enhance the resiliency of the RL agents in a partially observable environment under the situation that adversarial attackers manipulating observation information. Through extensive simulation experiments, we validate that the proposed robust mDRL algorithm can help the deployed proactive security mechanism achieve both security and network performance improvement in the presence of adversarial attacks.

AB The goal of this study is to verify the applicability of fuel cells for powering surface vessels by developing a small catamaran-type unmanned surface vehicle (USV) powered by a hydrogen fuel cell. This study encompasses the entire process of designing a fuel-cell-powered USV, as well as sea trial tests with a 1.487-m full-scale prototype. To improve the performance and system efficiency of the USV, a simulation-based hull form design and integrated control systems were implemented during the design process. First, the optimum hull form of the catamaran, with the optimum separation, was determined based on hydrodynamic optimization using parametric models to achieve good fuel economy. Second, an automatic control system integrated with the global positioning and inertial navigation systems was implemented in the designed catamaran so that it had the ability to perform waypoint, departure, station keeping, and turning circle maneuvers. Next, the gain parameters of the fuzzy proportional-integral-derivative (PID) controller were adjusted to assure reliable tracking control. Automatically controlled trial tests were then conducted to validate the performance of the autonomous surface vehicle with respect to the fuel cell power requirements and its dynamic motion. Based on the results of the trial tests and the transient response of the fuel cell, a hybrid power control algorithm for the fuel cell and the batteries was implemented for more efficient power utilization. This catamaran-type unmanned surface vehicle powered with a fuel cell can be utilized for ocean environment monitoring and multifunctional missions.

AB Fixed-wing unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) provide a practical means for data collection in many Internet-of-Things (IoT) applications. Secrecy and energy efficiency are crucial to the data collection, but have never been well addressed in the lack of appropriate propulsion energy models for three-dimensional (3D) flights of fixed-wing UAVs. This paper delivers a new approach to the joint optimization of the 3D flight trajectory and data collection schedule of a fixed-wing UAV for secure and energy-efficient data collection under an eavesdropping attack. A critical aspect is that we derive a new propulsion energy model for fixed-wing UAVs flying 3D trajectories. By using equivalent transformation, difference-of-convex techniques, and successive convex approximation, we convexify the model and demonstrate its viability to the design of energy-efficient 3D trajectories. Another key aspect is that we further optimize the trajectory and schedule of the UAV for secure and energy-efficient collection of secret data from sensor nodes on the ground. This is non-trivial due to the convexification of the non-smooth secrecy constraints in addition to the new 3D propulsion energy model. Simulations validate the new model and demonstrate considerable energy saving of 3D trajectories, compared to two-dimensional (2D) trajectories optimized based on the state-of-the-art 2D propulsion energy model.

ID DESIGN
AB Long-range backscatter communication has the potential to provide enough time and space for vehicles to detect traffic information, which is an attractive solution for Vehicle-to-Infrastructure (V2I) communication. However, existing backscatter studies either require the tag to be close to the carrier source (ambient backscatter) or have poor receiver sensitivity (RFID), making it challenging to satisfy the high range requirements of V2I communication. In this article, we develop AllSpark to investigate the feasibility of long-range communication enabling backscatter to be applied to V2I. Specifically, to increase RSS to compensate for the enormous dual-path loss in backscatter systems, we first redesign the tag's radio frequency (RF) front-end to amplify the incident signals, and then we design high-gain directional antennas for the tag and reader. Second, we present EC-Net, an end-to-end demodulator that selectively enhances signal features (denoising) and is tuned to lower classification (demodulation) error to maximize demodulation accuracy. Furthermore, we adopt convolutional encoding for tag data and use the output probability of EC-Net to design an effective soft decoder to resist occasional interference and noise, improving communication robustness. Our prototype and experiments outdoors verify the effectiveness of AllSpark which can provide a communication range of 700 m. Even in a moving scene, it can achieve a communication range of 600 m, demonstrating that AllSpark has the potential to be applied for autonomous driving and low-flying drones to detect traffic conditions.

AB Automated Vehicles (AVs) need to be thoroughly evaluated in order to ensure their driving capabilities. However, comprehensive evaluations are intractable due to both time and monetary costs. To address this problem, we propose an Adaptive Design of Experiments (ADOE) method to evaluate the safety of AVs. Using this method, a Surrogate Model (SM) is established and updated iteratively. SM in ADOE is used to approximate the results of AV testing and help to select the next concrete scenario to be tested in each iteration. Two different ADOE approaches are proposed in this study for different testing purposes. Since the choice of the surrogate model has a profound impact on the performance of the ADOE method, 6 surrogate models were compared with two logical scenarios at different scales - a car following logical scenario and a cut-in logical scenario. Results show that Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGB) is suitable for both ADOE approaches. And both proposed ADOE approaches achieved desired performance. Scenario-oriented ADOE made full use of each concrete scenario, capturing one collision case for every 1.12 test runs in the car following logical scenario, while SM-oriented ADOE successfully depicted the boundary between safety and danger. Using 0.46% test resources compared to enumeration, the SM-oriented ADOE found 93.9% dangerous scenarios with 90.9% precision. ADOE approaches have great potential in accelerating the evaluation of AV safety.

AB Excellent braking performance is the premise of safe driving, and improve the braking performance by upgrading structures and optimizing parameters of braking systems has become the pursuit of engineers. With the development of autonomous driving and intelligent connected vehicle, new structural schemes such as electro-mechanical brakes (EMBs) have become the future of vehicle braking systems. Meanwhile, many scholars have dedicated to the research on the parameters optimization of braking systems. While, most of the studies focus on reducing the brake size and weight, improving the brake responses by optimizing the parameters, almost not involving the braking performance, and the optimization variables are relatively single. On these foundations, a multi-objective optimal design of EMB parameters is proposed to enhance the vehicle's braking performance. Its objectives and constraints were defined based on relevant standards and regulations. Subsequently, the decision variables were set, and optimal math model was established. Furthermore, the co-simulation platform was constructed, and the optimal design and simulation analyses factoring in the crucial structural and control parameters were performed. The results confirmed that the maximum braking pressure response time of the EMB is decreased by approximately 0.3 s, the stopping distance (SD) of 90 km/h-0 is shortened by about 3.44 m. Moreover, the mean fully developed deceleration (MFDD) is increased by 0.002 g, and the lateral displacement of the body (LD) is reduced by about 0.037 m. Hence, the vehicle braking performance is improved.

AB This paper proposes a stochastic model for mixed traffic flow with human-driven vehicles (HVs) and automated vehicles (AVs). The model is formulated in Lagrangian coordinates considering the heterogeneous behavior of human drivers. We further derive a first and second order approximation of the stochastic model describing the mean and the covariance dynamics, respectively, under different combinations of HVs and AVs in the traffic stream (e.g., randomly distributed in the stream, at the front of the stream, in the middle of the stream and in the rear of the stream). The proposed model allows us to explicitly investigate the interaction between AVs and HVs considering the uncertainty of human driving behavior. Six performance metrics are proposed to measure the impact of AVs on the uncertainty of HVs' behavior, as well as on the stability of the system. The numerical experiment results show that AVs have significant impact on the uncertainty and stability of the mixed traffic flow system. Larger AV penetration rates can reduce the uncertainty inherent in HV behavior and improve the stability of the mixed flow substantially. Whereas AVs' reaction time only has subtle impact on the uncertainty of the mixed stream; as well as the position of AVs in the traffic stream has marginal influence in terms of reducing uncertainty and improving stability.

AB Trajectory optimization for connected automated vehicles (CAVs) is an effective method to improve the overall performance of urban traffic. At the same time, the emergence of deep reinforcement learning (DRL) enables agents to learn the optimal strategy in a complex environment by constantly interacting with the environment. In a connected environment with signalized intersections, the optimal control of CAV can significantly reduce fuel consumption and improve driving comfort under the premise of ensuring both traffic efficiency and travel safety. Thus, a DRL-based longitudinal trajectory control approach is proposed to optimize the motion of the CAV in a mixed traffic flow with signalized intersections. By designing a reasonable reward function comprising fuel consumption reward, safety reward, traffic light reward, and travel time reward, the CAV can learn the optimal policy and reach the destination adhering to traffic light and safety. Moreover, the potential-based reward is carefully designed to provide prior knowledge for agents. Eventually, the performances of the CAV with the proposed strategy are testified under different scenarios. Simulation results show that our proposed DRL-based optimization method can effectively save fuel consumption of the CAV and the whole platoon, as well as improve driving comfort in all scenarios while satisfying the rules of traffic lights and travel safety.(c) 2023 Elsevier B.V.

AB The overtaking process on two-lane rural roads is a critical task for drivers and directly impacts safety. This paper investigates the vehicle's passing path from the road-engineering point of view, consisting of a series of successive parametric spiral arcs, based on a real driving experiment with respect to the roadway's posted speed. Passing maneuvers were recorded utilizing global navigation satellite system (GNSS) receivers. The curved paths were determined for two different and mostly typical posted speed values (90 and 110 km/h), where the impeding (passed) vehicle was assumed to travel under steady-state conditions (20 km/h below the respective posted speed values). The authors, by examining these curved paths, intend to quantify their trajectories and respective critical parameters, such as overtaking distance, headway distance, and acceleration performance. Four predictive lognormal models for each speed scenario were developed to estimate the radius of each overtaking curved section with high accuracy. Headway distance observed in this study is very close, while total overtaking distance is greater than those reported in the published literature. The present research is a source for road authorities to assess overtaking sight distance with critical overtaking parameters such as posted speed and vehicle speed differences as well as an opening paradigm of how the passing process can be standardized and therefore deployed in future advanced driver assistance systems.

AB More and more people live in urban areas in general and in "megacities", with 10 million inhabitants and more, in particular. One innovative instrument to reduce surface traffic and its negative impact on health, congestion, environment, and safety when supplying these urban inhabitants with goods is a cargo tunnel. Within the cargo tunnel concept, autonomous rail-bound, maglev, or automated guided vehicles deliver goods underground toward small inner-city hubs, from where the final leg toward customer homes can be executed with environmentally-friendly vehicles such as cargo bikes or electric vans. In addition to the huge investment costs for tunnel boring, this last-mile delivery option faces a challenging operational problem, which is the synchronization of goods arrivals at a capacity-restricted inner-city hub with the delivery tours. We formulate a basic two-echelon optimization problem that captures all main operational challenges of this synchronization task, derive suitable optimization procedures, and apply them in a computational study. The latter explores the interdependence between tunnel throughput, storage capacity at the hub, and vehicle capacity of the delivery person and their impact on delivery performance. An additional benchmark test with conventional truck-based deliveries shows that the reductions of carbon dioxide emissions promised by a cargo tunnel come for the price of excessive cargo bike traffic, especially if large urban regions are to be serviced from a micro hub.

AB After years of hypothetical surveys and simulator studies, automated vehicles (AVs) are now being tested in realistic traffic environments adding validity to knowledge about their acceptance. We present data from a pilot test with participants (n = 125) after experiencing a ride in an electric AV on a large clinic area in Berlin, Germany. As a first contribution, we bridge the gap between missing definitions of key constructs, confusion about their operationalisations, and a rigorous test of their statistical properties and data structure by examining scales on acceptance, trust, perceived safety, intention to use, and-for the first time applied to AVs-the emotions amusement, fear, surprise, and boredom. Tests of reliability and normality were satisfying for almost all constructs (Cronbach's alphas >= .69; six of eight scales normally distributed). The vehicles were accepted (M = 1.22; SD = 0.70; range -2 to 2), trusted (M = 3.29; SD = 0.81; range 1 to 5), and perceived as safe (M = 3.29; SD = 1.03; range 1 to 5). However, factor analyses did not reflect the hypothesised data structure, and validity concerns question the suitability of some constructs for attitude assessment of electric AVs. Our open item for comments added valuable insights in qualitative aspects of user attitudes towards electric AVs regarding driving style, technical features, and (unsettling) audio-visual feedback. We thus argue for broader conceptualisations of key constructs based on interdisciplinary exchange and multi-methodical study designs.

AB A new approach is introduced for modeling the estimation and networking processes of networked crash/collision avoidance systems (NCAS) in a single framework. An NCAS relies on real-time situation awareness, which is acquired through cooperation with neighboring vehicles in a wireless network, to predict and respond to hazards. The subsystem that provides situation awareness consists of an estimation process and a networking/communication process. The estimation process is the source of vehicle data that is broadcast through the underlying vehicular network (communication process). The performance of vehicle tracking (estimation process) is significantly affected by the performance of the communication network because any issues in sending or receiving the information could result in erroneous position estimates and possibly crashes. It is therefore essential to produce models that allow a clear view into the dynamics of these two components. We employ probabilistic timed automata to model the networking component; a hybrid automata is then used to combine and model both networking and estimation components in a single framework. We extend the presented hybrid automata to model the broadcast network of NCAS in presence of heavy hidden node interference. We verify model accuracy by comparison with proven network simulator 3 (NS-3) simulation models; model checking for the purpose of studying some features of NCAS is also presented.

ID RECOGNITION
AB Most state-of-the-art works in trajectory forecasting for automotive target predicting the pose and orientation of the agents in the scene. This represents a particularly useful problem, for instance in autonomous driving, but it does not cover a spectrum of applications in control and simulation that require information on vehicle dynamics features other than pose and orientation. Also, multi-step dynamic simulation of complex multibody models does not seem to be a viable solution for real-time long-term prediction, due to the high computational time required. To bridge this gap, we present a deep-learning framework to model and predict the evolution of the coupled driver-vehicle system dynamics jointly on a complex road geometry. It consists of two components. The first, a neural network predictor, is based on Long Short -Term Memory autoencoders and fuses the information on the road geometry and the past driver-vehicle system dynamics to produce context-aware predictions. The second, a Bayesian optimiser, is proposed to tune some significant hyperparameters of the network. These govern the network complexity, as well as the features importance. The result is a self-tunable framework with real-time applicability, which allows the user to specify the features of interest. The approach has been validated with a case study centred on motion cueing algorithms, using a dataset collected during test sessions of a non-professional driver on a dynamic driving simulator. A 3D track with complex geometry has been employed as driving environment to render the prediction task challenging. Finally, the robustness of the neural network to changes in the driver and track was investigated to set guidelines for future works.

AB Background: There is limited research on older drivers' perspectives on advanced vehicle technologies (AVTs). This study investigates what older drivers know and understand about AVTs in the current vehicle market, and identifies what motivates older drivers to use or not use AVTs. Method: Older drivers (& GE;65 years) living in New South Wales, Australia completed semi structured telephone interviews guided by the Car Technology Acceptance Model. All interviews were audio-recorded and transcribed verbatim. Content analysis and deductive inductive thematic analysis were completed on each transcript independently by two researchers, with all themes presented to the investigative team, discussed until consensus was reached. Participant recruitment were ceased after thematic saturation. Results: 24 participants (mean age: 74.5 years; 13 males, 11 females) were interviewed. Eleven different AVTs were mentioned by participants. Attitudes towards these AVTs impacted how much participants understood how these technologies worked. These attitudes and motivation of technology usage could be explained by four major themes; (1) AVTs help with safety but overall responsibility remains with the driver, (2) Lack of clear information and instructions make AVTs look confusing, (3) AVTs need to be more user-friendly for older adults, and (4) Expensive out-ofpocket costs stop AVT usage. Conclusions: Despite understanding the safety benefits of simple, standard AVTs, older drivers perceive barriers that hinder their use of more complicated technologies. Increased consultations to make AVTs more acceptable to older adults are needed. In conjunction, more resources and options aimed at helping older adults better understand and access AVTs need to be developed.

AB Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) are getting more popular for deployment in surveillance related operations owing to their flexibility and ability to reach hazardous areas. Moreover, the quality of digital cameras is getting better, and they can capture and store more visual information in high-resolution images. Unfortunately, due to the resource-constrained nature of UAVs, storing such large images can exhaust memory and related resources; whereas, the transmission of these images over the public link can pose several security threats. Securing these critical images during transmission from unauthorized access can be achieved through the use of efficient encryption techniques. This article proposes a novel encryption scheme incorporating both confusion and diffusion for encrypting both grey-scale and color images. In the proposed- encryption scheme, the image blocks are rearranged using a combination of random permutation, rotation, DNA encoding and zigzag pattern. Next, a bit-plane extraction method is used to obtain eight different bit-planes, including the most and least significant ones, from the scrambled image. These extracted bit-planes are then processed using confusion and diffusion techniques with a secret key, which is created using a hyper-chaotic map. The proposed method for encrypting the images taken by unmanned ariel vehicles is evaluated by examining its security level and time complexity using evaluation metrics such as correlation, entropy, energy, histogram analysis, keyspace and key sensitivity. The results and analysis demonstrated that the proposed encryption algorithm is able to effectively secure digital images. Additionally, the proposed work is also found to be superior to existing methods when compared using statistical security metrics.

AB Digital Twin (DT) and Intelligent Reflective Surface (IRS), the most two promising technologies of 6G make the Internet of Vehicles (IoV) more adaptive. However, future autonomous driving needs powerful networking resources and high-quality wireless communications to guarantee the Quality of Service (QoS). Especially considering the time-varying physical operating environments of IoV, it is extremely urgent to improve resource utilization and wireless channel quality. In this work, we propose a Digital Twin-Driven Vehicular Task Offloading and IRS Configuration Framework (DTVIF) to efficiently monitor, learn, and manage the IoV. Specifically, we adopt Mobile Edge Computing (MEC) and IRS to provide augmented computing capacities for vehicles and improve transmission performance when vehicles communicate to MEC servers. DT is employed to achieve real-time data collection and digital representation of physical operating environments of IoV to better support decisions making. In order to reduce the overall delay and energy consumption of DTVIF, we propose a Two-Stage Optimization for Jointly Optimizing Task Offloading and IRS Configuration (TSJTI) algorithm based on Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) and Transfer Learning (TFL). In the first stage, we introduce Double Deep Q-learning Networks (DDQN) to find the optimal offloading decision. In the second stage, based on the parameters learned from the first stage, we migrate the parameters from the first stage to find the optimal IRS configuration based on the Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (DDPG) method. The simulations demonstrate that the proposed algorithm can effectively reduce the processing latency of task offloading and reduce the average energy consumption in DTVIF.

AB The revolution of technologically advanced vehicles with a high level of automation involves a profound transformation. The focus of most research in this area has been on the use of travel time for different use cases. Sleeping is one of the most time-consuming activities in everyone's life; therefore, this has been described as one of the most desired use cases for fully automated vehicles. In order to identify the best conditions to allow sleep and improve sleep quality while travelling in such vehicles, two studies were performed: a sleep study and a pressure distribution study, the results of which are included in this document. The focus of both studies was on two seat positions: reclined (60 degrees backrest recline) and flat (87 degrees backrest recline). In the sleep study, forty par-ticipants had the opportunity to sleep during a 90-min drive in order to evaluate long-term comfort and subjective sleep quantity and quality. Although both positions resulted in generally similar results in terms of sleep and comfort, some significant differences were identified. Karolinska Sleepiness Scale results showed that sleepiness increased in the reclined position, whereas it decreased in the flat position. Moreover, the self-reported parameter Wake After Sleep Onset was higher in the reclined position. In the pressure distribution study, it was possible to identify specific seat prototype limitations indicating inadequate support, which was related to discomfort detected during the sleep study. As a conclusion, the comparison between the reclined and flat positions showed indications that, in moving fully automated vehicles, the flat seat position is the most comfortable and effective for sleeping.

AB The positioning accuracy of the existing vehicular Global Positioning System (GPS) is far from sufficient to support autonomous driving and ITS applications. To remedy that, leading methods such as ranging and cooperation have improved the positioning accuracy to varying degrees, but they are still full of challenges in practical applications. Especially for cooperative positioning, in addition to the performance of methods, cooperators may provide false data due to attacks or selfishness, which can seriously affect the positioning accuracy. By fully exploiting the characteristics of blockchain and edge computing, this paper proposes a vehicular blockchain-based secure and efficient GPS positioning error evolution sharing framework, which improves vehicle positioning accuracy from ensuring security and credibility of cooperators and data. First, by analyzing the GPS error, a bridge can be established between the sensor-rich vehicles and the common vehicles to achieve cooperation by sharing the positioning error evolution at a specific time and location. Particularly, the positioning error evolution is obtained by a deep neural network (DNN)-based prediction algorithm running on the edge server. We further propose to use blockchain technology for storage and sharing the evolution of positioning errors, mainly to guarantee the security of cooperative vehicles and mobile edge computing nodes (MECNs). In addition, the corresponding smart contracts are designed to automate and efficiently perform storage and sharing tasks as well as solve inconsistencies in time scales. Extensive simulations based on actual data indicate the accuracy and security of our proposal in terms of positioning error correction and data sharing.

AB Connected and automated vehicles (CAVs) will potentially improve transportation system performance. Guidance on the capacity impact of CAVs at different market penetration rates (MPRs) will help agencies to incorporate the effects of CAVs when planning and designing roadways. Traditionally, practitioners have used the Highway Capacity Manual (HCM) to assess capacity and evaluate the quality of service for various facilities and systems. Although several studies have provided insight into the capacity benefits of CAVs, there is a need for quantified CAV effects that can be used to develop HCM guidance. In this study, the capacity benefits of CAVs at signalized intersections were estimated, and capacity adjustment factors (CAFs) were developed for the HCM. The researchers considered variations in CAV gap/headway settings, platoon lengths, turning movement types (through and left), and left-turn phasing modes (protected versus permitted). Microscopic traffic simulation was used to model CAVs. The results showed that performance indicators such as saturation headway gradually improved with increases in CAV MPR, resulting in up to 40% capacity increase at 100% MPR for the protected movements. For permitted left turns, up to 45% capacity increase could be achieved at 100% MPR. This increase in permitted left-turn capacity can be attributed to vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) communication, which provides advanced information on available gaps in conflicting traffic and reduced follow-up headway time both for permitted left turns and the opposing through movement. Based on the capacity results, this study provides CAF tables for CAVs that can be easily integrated into the HCM and used for planning-level guidance by practitioners.

AB Road vehicle accidents are mostly due to human errors, and many such accidents could be avoided by continuously monitoring the driver. Driver monitoring (DM) is a topic of growing interest in the automotive industry, and it will remain relevant for all vehicles that are not fully autonomous, and thus for decades for the average vehicle owner. The present paper focuses on the first step of DM, which consists of characterizing the state of the driver. Since DM will be increasingly linked to driving automation (DA), this paper presents a clear view of the role of DM at each of the six SAE levels of DA. This paper surveys the state of the art of DM, and then synthesizes it, providing a unique, structured, polychotomous view of the many characterization techniques of DM. Informed by the survey, the paper characterizes the driver state along the five main dimensions-called here "(sub)states"-of drowsiness, mental workload, distraction, emotions, and under the influence. The polychotomous view of DM is presented through a pair of interlocked tables that relate these states to their indicators (e.g., the eye-blink rate) and the sensors that can access each of these indicators (e.g., a camera). The tables factor in not only the effects linked directly to the driver, but also those linked to the (driven) vehicle and the (driving) environment. They show, at a glance, to concerned researchers, equipment providers, and vehicle manufacturers (1) most of the options they have to implement various forms of advanced DM systems, and (2) fruitful areas for further research and innovation.

AB Introduction Travel demand and travel satisfaction of a transport service are affected by user perceptions of the service quality attributes, and such perceptions should be included in studying user willingness-to-pay (WTP) for automated vehicle (AV) services. This study applied structural equation modelling with service quality attribute perceptions as latent variables affecting WTP. Objectives We investigated how WTP AV services are affected by socio-demographic characteristics, knowledge and experiences with AV, existing travel modes and particularly, perceptions of the associated service quality attributes. The AV services are: 1) on-demand personalised AV (PAV) service, 2) demand responsive shared AV (SAV) service, and 3) first-/last-mile automated bus (AB) service. Methods The data were collected from 584 potential users of a first-/last-mile AB service trial operated in Kista, Stockholm. Results Results show people hold different expectations towards each type of AV service. These expectations act as the minimum requirements for people to pay for the AV services. Respondents are found to be willing to pay more for PAV service if it is safe, provides good ride comfort, and is competitively priced relative to the price travelling by metro and train over a same distance. Other than service quality attribute perceptions, income level, existing travel modes for daily trips, familiarity with automated driving technology and AB ride experience are important factors affecting WTP for the AV services. Conclusion The developed model can be applied to understand expectations of potential users towards a new AV service, and to identify user groups who are willing to pay the service. New AV services can thus be designed sensibly according to users' actual needs.

AB In the near future, vehicles will gradually gain more autonomous functionalities. Drivers' activity will be less about driving than about monitoring intelligent systems to which driving action will be delegated. Road safety, therefore, remains dependent on the human factor and we should identify the limits beyond which driver's functional state (DFS) may no longer be able to ensure safety. Depending on the level of automation, estimating the DFS may have different targets, e.g., assessing driver's situation awareness in lower levels of automation and his ability to respond to emerging hazard or assessing driver's ability to monitor the vehicle performing operational tasks in higher levels of automation. Unfitted DFS (e.g., drowsiness) may impact the driver ability respond to taking over abilities. This paper reviews the most appropriate psychophysiological indices in naturalistic driving while considering the DFS through exogenous sensors, providing the more efficient trade-off between reliability and intrusiveness. The DFS also originates from kinematic data of the vehicle, thus providing information that indirectly relates to drivers behavior. The whole data should be synchronously processed, providing a diagnosis on the DFS, and bringing it to the attention of the decision maker in real time. Next, making the information available can be permanent or intermittent (or even undelivered), and may also depend on the automation level. Such interface can include recommendations for decision support or simply give neutral instruction. Mapping of relevant psychophysiological and behavioral indicators for DFS will enable practitioners and researchers provide reliable estimates, fitted to the level of automation.

TI A control algorithm for reentry of a rescue space vehicle into the

SO COSMIC RESEARCH
LA English
DT Article
AB The basic principles of the construction of an algorithm of control for reentry of a rescue space vehicle with a moderate value of lift-to-drag ratio (about 0.5) are discussed. The rescue space vehicle should perform its mission in a short time interval. Therefore, the algorithm of control of the reentry should provide high accuracy (about 1 km), which would allow one to make use of not just one to two landing regions, but an order of magnitude more. Since actions during the flight should be highly expeditious, this necessitates an autonomous guidance, which includes the onboard solution of a two-point boundary value problem in order to choose a reference (command) dependence of the angle of roll. The initial reference dependence is a piecewise constant with three overturns with respect to the roll. This allows one to simultaneously control the downrange miss and crossrange miss. However, such a control can have a singularity in a specific state of a disturbed atmosphere. The proposed modification of the reference dependence with a small angle of roll at the initial segment of descent allows one to build up an energy "reserve" and to retain the possibility of a two-parameter control up to the end. The developed methods allow one to quickly find a solution inside the zone of the vehicle maneuver. It is possible to take into account the constraint with respect to the overload, which is also important for a rescue vehicle. Mathematical simulation of reentry trajectories in a disturbed atmosphere for different locations of the landing points confirms the high accuracy of the proposed algorithm.

AB Automated vehicles (AVs) have the potential to dramatically disrupt current transportation patterns and practices. One particular area of concern is AVs' impacts on public transit systems. If vehicle automation enables significant price decreases or performance improvements for ride-hailing services, some fear that it could undercut public transit, which could have significant implications for the environment and transportation equity. The extent to which individuals adopt automated transportation modes will drive many system-level outcomes, and research on public preferences for AVs is immature and inconclusive. In this study, we used responses from an online choice-based conjoint survey fielded in the Washington, D.C. metropolitan region (N = 1,694) in October 2021 to estimate discrete choice models of public preferences for different automated (ride-hailing, shared ride-hailing, bus) and nonautomated (ride-hailing, shared ride-hailing, bus, rail) modes. We used the estimated models to simulate future marketplace competition across a range of trip scenarios. Respondents on average were only willing to pay a premium for automated modes when a vehicle attendant was also present, limiting the potential cost-savings that AV operators might achieve by removing the driver. Scenario analysis additionally revealed that for trips where good transit options were available, transit remained competitive with automated ride-hailing modes. These results suggest that fears of a mass transition away from transit to AVs may be limited by people's willingness to use AVs, at least in the short term. Future AV operators should also recognize the presence of an AV attendant as a critical feature for early AV adoption.

TI Evaluation of the Risk of Truck Platoon under Crosswind regarding the
   Lateral Displacement on Horizontal Curves
SO JOURNAL OF ADVANCED TRANSPORTATION
LA English
DT Article
ID RESPONSE-SURFACE APPROACH; RELIABILITY-ANALYSIS; VEHICLE SAFETY;
   FRAMEWORK
AB Driving safety on horizontal curves under crosswinds has always been a concern for researchers. However, previous studies focused on single vehicles, especially single trucks. The safety of the truck platoon under crosswinds on horizontal curves was rarely examined. To fill such a gap, this study establishes a model for evaluating the safety of truck platoons under crosswinds on curves. After obtaining aerodynamic coefficients, a cosimulation model of a three-truck platoon is established with Trucksim and Simulink. The influencing factors on the lateral displacement of the truck platoon were analyzed, and the safety of the truck platoon under crosswinds on horizontal curves was then quantified with the response surface method. The results show that the fully autonomous platoon is safer than the human-led platoon. In a three-vehicle platoon, the smaller the lateral displacement of the truck, the further back the truck, and the lateral displacement of the vehicle increases with the loading of the truck. The safety index is computed to quantify the reliability of the truck platoon. The results indicate that the safety index increases with a decrease in the mean wind velocity and mean vehicle velocity and increases with an increase in the mean radius. When crosswinds come from the inside of the curve, the safety index increases with an increase in the mean superelevation; for crosswinds from the outside of the curve, the safety index rises with the drop of superelevation. The proposed approach can quantify the safety level of truck platoons under crosswinds on horizontal curves, and the results provide guidance to support the decision-making of transportation management agencies.

AB The lane-changing drivers are typical heterogeneous groups, and risky mandatory merging behavior greatly affects road traffic safety and disturbs the normal flow of traffic. This study focuses on the mandatory merging decision behavior at the on-ramp of the interweaving area of a freeway, aiming to build a merging decision assist model which can consider the potential heterogeneity, has strong interpretability, and good model performance. The merging decision data are extracted from the Federal Highway Administration's Next Generation Simulation dataset. Spearman rank correlation test and step regression method are used to eliminate the multicollinearity among candidate explanatory variables and select the best combination of explanatory variables. A grouped random parameter logit model with heterogeneity in means and variances (GRPMV) and its baseline models are established in this study. The model estimation results show that these selected explanatory variables significantly affect the merging decision behavior, and compared with the baseline model, the GRMPV model has the best model performance and can better capture the unobserved heterogeneity. In the GRMPV model, two random parameters were found. The speed difference between the putative leading vehicle and the merging vehicle significantly affected the random parameter's mean of the space headway between vehicle M and vehicle PL and the random parameter's variance of the lateral position of vehicle PF. The research results of this paper can be applied to the autonomous driving assistance system and traffic flow simulation software and can shed light on the mechanism of mandatory merging behaviors.(c) 2023 Elsevier B.V.

AB The introduction of automated vehicles (AVs) is a virtual certainty. Much less certain is the timing of their introduction and how rapid the transition to full automation will be. Various governments are already working to facilitate this shift by, for example, amending and elaborating regulations to support the introduction of AVs, or supporting tests in different urban environments. Meanwhile, urban and regional planners and decision. makers are still grappling with the uncertainties and differing opinions about the possible impacts of AVs on land-use changes and location choices, particularly in relation to the space available for vehicles, both moving (i.e. roadspace) and stationary (i.e. parking space). This paper uses a backcasting approach to identify critical policy decisions and measures to be taken before the implementation of AVs, so as to achieve a more desirable, attractive and high-quality city. These policy measures primarily relate to the reuse and reallocation of parking and roadspace. Two strategic decisions are found to be essential to meet the major goals of sustainable and liveable cities: a clear commitment to a shared mobility and the delimitation of Core Attractive Mixed-use Spaces (CAMS). In order to deliver these desired urbanisation patterns, a set of three policy paths, involving eight policy packages, is proposed for the next 20-30 years. This article provides urban and regional decision-makers with examples of interventions that can be implemented beyond and during the implementation of AVs.

AB This study evaluates different proposed merging solutions that reduce the conflict between merging vehicles and mainline traffic within a mixed traffic environment using a safety measure to see which strategy might work better than others under specific traffic conditions. The mixed traffic includes various percentages of driver-operated vehicles (DVs) and connected autonomous vehicles (CAVs). The probability of noncompliance (PNC) is selected as a surrogate safety measure to assess the strategies. A MATLAB program is developed to simulate various traffic conditions at a merging area and to calculate the PNC merging for the different merging strategies. In addition, to examine the relationship between PNC and collision frequency at the merging area, the collision data at 15 merging ramps in Ottawa were collected to examine the relationship between PNC values obtained from the simulation for the case of a full-DV vehicle fleet and no management strategy (current conditions) and actual safety performance. The results confirmed the validity of PNC as a surrogate safety measure that is correlated to expected collision frequency at merge areas. By simulating all proposed merging management strategies, the results of this study showed a general trend of decreasing PNC and, hence, improved safety performance since the CAV penetration rate increases even when no management strategy is used or under the do-nothing option. However, most merging strategies had better expected safety performance than the do-nothing option, which indicates the value of implementing a merging management strategy, especially during the period of transition from a full-DV to a full-CAV fleet.

AB Contrary to reliability analysis in power systems with the main mission on safely and securely withstanding credible contingencies in day-to-day operations, resilience assessments are centered on high-impact low probability (HILP) events in the grid. This paper proposes an autonomous load restoration architecture founded on IEC 61850-8-1 GOOSE communication protocol to engender an enhanced feeder-level resilience in active power distribution grids. Different from the past research on outage management solutions, most of which 1) are not resilience-driven; 2) are reactive solutions to local single-fault events; and 3) do not address both network built-in flexibilities and flexible resources. The proposed solution harnesses 1) the imported power and flexibility from the neighboring networks; 2) distributed energy resources; and 3) vehicle to grid capacity of electric vehicles aggregations to enhance the feeder-level resourcefulness for agile response and recovery. Through real-time self-reconfiguration strategies, the suggested solution is capable of coping both single and subsequent outage events, and will engender a heightened resilience before and during the contingency period. Moreover, a resilience evaluation framework, which quantifies the contribution of all resources involved in service restoration, is developed. Real-time performance of the designed architecture is evaluated on a real-world power distribution grid using a real-time hardware-in-the-loop platform. Numerical case studies through a number of diverse scenarios demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed restoration solution in practicing an enhanced resilience in power distribution systems in response to HILP scenarios.

AB Due to the rapid progress in the development of automated vehicles over the last decade, their market entry is getting closer. One of the remaining challenges is the safety assessment and type approval of automated vehicles, as conventional testing in the real world would involve an unmanageable mileage. Scenario-based testing using simulation is a promising candidate for overcoming this approval trap. Although the research community has recognized the importance of safeguarding in recent years, the quality of simulation models is rarely taken into account. Without investigating the errors and uncertainties of models, virtual statements about vehicle safety are meaningless. This paper describes a whole process combining model validation and safety assessment. It is demonstrated by means of an actual type-approval regulation that deals with the safety assessment of lane-keeping systems. Based on a thorough analysis of the current state-of-the-art, this paper introduces two approaches for selecting test scenarios. While the model validation scenarios are planned from scratch and focus on scenario coverage, the type-approval scenarios are extracted from measurement data based on a data-driven pipeline. The deviations between lane-keeping behavior in the real and virtual world are quantified using a statistical validation metric. They are then modeled using a regression technique and inferred from the validation experiments to the unseen virtual type-approval scenarios. Finally, this paper examines safety-critical lane crossings, taking into account the modeling errors. It demonstrates the potential of the virtual-based safeguarding process using exemplary simulations and real driving tests.

AB Using drones for communications and transportation is drawing great attention in many practical scenarios, such as package delivery and providing additional wireless coverage. However, the increasing demand for unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) from industry and academia will cause aerial traffic conflicts in the future. This, in turn, motivates the idea of this article: multipurpose UAVs, acting as aerial wireless data relays and means of aerial transportation simultaneously, to deliver packages and data at the same time. This article aims to analyze the feasibility of using drones to collect and deliver data from the Internet of Things (IoT) devices to terrestrial base stations (TBSs) while delivering packages from warehouses to residential areas. We propose an algorithm to optimize the trajectory of UAVs to maximize the size of collected/delivered data while minimizing the total round trip time subject to the limited onboard battery of UAVs. Specifically, we use tools from stochastic geometry to model the locations of the IoT clusters and the TBSs and study the system performance with respect to energy efficiency, average size of collected/delivered data, and package delivery time. Our numerical results reveal that multifunctional UAVs have great potential to enhance the efficiency of both communication and transportation networks.

AB In this paper, the safe autonomous motion control of a quadrotor Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) is considered, in the presence of disturbance, stationary and moving obstacles. In this regard, we directly combine an analytical control design approach, within the backstepping framework, with obstacle avoidance to solve the navigation problem. A Barrier Lyapunov Function (BLF) is incorporated into the translational control to keep the vehicle out of a safety sphere, constructed around the obstacles, while steering it toward a desired position. BLF allows the direct inclusion of the obstacle position in the control design. This is achieved for both cases of known and unknown obstacle velocities. Furthermore, the issue of arbitrary initial conditions is analytically addressed, with a preassigned exit time from the safety sphere. We also consider the case of chance-constrained collision avoidance. The proposed approach leads to a computationally efficient design, since a closed-form of the control is obtained with no need for real-time optimization. More importantly, the analytical stability of closed-loop system is guaranteed. A hierarchical control structure is designed with an adaptive model-free control for unknown attitude dynamics in the presence of disturbances. A number of numerical simulations are performed to evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed approach.(c) 2022 Elsevier Masson SAS. All rights reserved.

AB The concept of fixed infrastructures capable of fulfilling the requirements of moving devices in terms of connectivity and reliability has been the optimal solution for the past few decades. Today, such a solution is no longer feasible in the Internet of Things (IoT) era. All things are now connected, and a significant number of them are mobile, hence leading to connectivity and reliability issues. Connected and autonomous vehicles, in addition to more contemporary flying and moving devices such as unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) and IoT devices, will play a significant role in next-generation networks (NGNs). Node-to-node communication will also play a key role in NGNs and will provide alternative solutions toward connectivity in many complex environments for applications such as smart transportation. With that said, today's wide availability of smart moving devices provides a wider set of alternatives to autonomy for NGNs. In this article, we discuss some of the existing solutions that use connected vehicles, UAVs, and other moving intelligent devices to not only provide connectivity support, but also perform on-location data collection, anal-ysis, and decision making to enable the management of moving NGNs for intelligent services and applications. We envision a solution that is capa-ble of adapting generalized and decentralized learning on mobile devices, such as federated learning, with the advances in deep learning to support the autonomy and configurability aspects of moving NGNs.

ID DIAGNOSIS
AB With the development of unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) technology, a UAV is gradually applied to a variety of civil fields, such as photography, power line inspection, and environmental monitoring. At the same time, the safety and reliability of a UAV also attract wide attention. Anomaly detection is one of the key technologies to improve the safety of an UAV. The structure of the UAV system is complex, and there are complex spatio-temporal correlations among the high-dimensional flight data with many parameters. However, the existing methods often ignore the spatio-temporal correlation of data and lack parameter selection, which is used to abandon the parameters without a positive impact on anomaly detection results. This article proposes a spatio-temporal correlation based long short-term memory (LSTM) method for anomaly detection and recovery prediction of UAV flight data. First, an artificial neural network correlation analysis is proposed to preliminarily mine the spatio-temporal correlation in flight data and to obtain the correlation parameter sets. Second, the LSTM model is established, and the mapping among different parameters is realized. Finally, anomaly detection and recovery prediction are carried out based on parameter sets mapping model. The effectiveness of the proposed method is verified by generating sample sets with anomaly injection on real UAV flight data.

AB The energy issue of unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) has received unprecedented attention recently. UAV-to-UAV multicast technology reduces transmit power through neighbor transmission, which is critical for saving energy and reducing information redundancy. This article investigates an energy efficiency optimization problem of the base station-UAVs system with the heterogeneous requirements of UAVs. The optimization problem is modelled as a weighted directed hypergraph matching game based on group preference, which is proven to achieve stable results. To address the topological change problem of UAV networks, a fast convergence algorithm is proposed in this article, which exhibits high stability when small fluctuations appear in the UAV topology. The proposed algorithm integrates the potential matching algorithm and local search, by which no-quota deferred acceptance can be realized. Compared with existing algorithms, the proposed algorithm improves throughput per energy consumption by more than 20%.

TI Multiagent Unmanned Vehicle Trajectories With Rolling-Horizon Games
SO MILITARY OPERATIONS RESEARCH

DT Article
AB Autonomy in unmanned vehicle navigation is critical for most applications due to the inability of human operators to control, monitor, or intervene in harsh environments and/or long ranges. To ensure safe autonomous navigation, verification and validation (V&V) procedures are needed for various applications. This paper proposes a game theory-based benchmark validation technique for trajectory optimization for noncooperative players. A quadratically constrained nonlinear multiple program formulation is presented, and a perfect-information reality validation framework is derived by finding a Nash equilibrium to various multiplayer pursuit-evasion games. A Karush-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT) point to such a game represents a best-case equilibrium solution, given perfect information available to noncooperative agents. Rolling-horizon foresight with robust obstacle avoidance is incorporated to demonstrate incomplete information and stochastic environmental conditions. A MATLAB-GAMS interface is developed to model the rolling-horizon game, and is solved via a mixed complementarity problem, and illustrative examples show how equilibrium trajectories can serve as benchmarks for more practical real-time trajectory planners.

AB The significant achievements have been made in crowd detection and tracking due to the advancement of artificial intelligence in the autonomous driving. However, the image-based methods have strict requirements for the collection conditions of video, and the development of the new generation of flexible fabrics has become potential sensors to perceive context. In this paper, an intelligent fabric space enabled by multi-sensing sensors is established to track the motion objects. We propose a behavior analysis pipeline including the modules of data preparation, trajectory coupling, motion scenario segmentation, and motion pattern measurement to capture the crowd information from micro-level and macro-level over the intelligent fabric space. After making preprocess for the multi-sensing data, a coupling mechanism is formulated to fuse the video-based trajectory and fabric-based trajectory. And an automatic motion scenario segmentation model divides the surrounding scenario into main-crowd, sub-crowd, and background according to the motion behavior. Further, we define measurement metrics to analyze the motion pattern for the different crowds. Extensive experiments prove that our proposed methods effectively fuse multiple trajectories and realize the crowd segmentation and the motion description. This will greatly help autonomous vehicles and control system perceive the surrounding pedestrians and the environment to make precise driving decisions.

AB This letter presents the design of a control strategy for an autonomous buoyancy-driven underwater vehicle, called the Driftcam, tasked with estimating and tracking the pelagic acoustic-scattering layer at depths of up to 700 meters. This reference-tracking control design is an alternative to the onboard control currently implemented on the Driftcam, as the existing control architecture is not designed for time-varying setpoint tracking. Tracking a known reference is presented using state-feedback control for continuous- and discrete-time command inputs. The known reference signal is chosen to represent the pelagic scattering layer vertical migration dynamics, modeled as a simple harmonic oscillator and estimated with a dynamic observer. We define a measurement function for the depth-varying density of organisms observable in the scattering layer. Time-varying reference tracking control is presented using output feedback for continuous- and discrete-time command inputs, where the reference is the online position estimate of the scattering layer. We also present an offboard trajectory motion planning algorithm using the existing onboard controller to emulate the response of the proposed reference tracking strategy. Experimental results from laboratory and field testing of the trajectory motion planner demonstrate that the buoyancy engine can feasibly achieve the desired behavior of the reference-tracking control strategy.

AB This article addresses a joint path planning and communication scheduling problem for a team of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) equipped with central processing units and performing computing tasks for Internet of Things (IoT) devices located on uneven terrain. On such terrains, the Line of Sight (LoS) between a UAV and a ground IoT device may be blocked by buildings or mountains. In this article, reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RISs) are deployed on the ground to improve wireless communication between UAVs and IoT devices. Computing tasks and their results can be sent to and from UAVs either directly or via RIS-reflected paths. The objective is to develop a joint multi-UAV path planning/transmission scheduling algorithm that maximizes the number of computing tasks successfully and timely performed by the UAVs and transmitted back to the IoT ground devices and minimizes the total energy consumption of the UAVs. An effective path planning algorithm for this optimization problem is proposed. A mathematically rigorous proof of its asymptotic optimality is given. The developed algorithm is computationally effective and easily implementable in real time. Computer simulations and comparisons with other effective methods prove the effectiveness of the developed approach.

AB Advances in automotive engineering have brought about a range of new vehicle technologies, such as auto-mation, connectivity and electrification, which are expected to have multiple effects on different aspects of people's lives and have the potential of radically transforming the transportation status quo. This paper explores the effects that such new technologies can have on land use by employing a Land Use and Transportation Interaction (LUTI) modelling approach. A new methodology is developed to simulate the effects of automation, connectivity and electrification on accessibility and to conduct a sensitivity analysis. The analysis is carried out on a regional scale to determine the effects of the new technologies on multiple cities that form a region. The case study for this application is the region of the West Midlands (UK). The results suggest that new vehicle tech-nologies can affect accessibility, population and employment in the cities of the region, the region itself, as well as the peripheral zones beyond the boundary of the region in a 15-year modelling period. Most notably, the two main urban cores of the region are found to not lose their financial power, despite increases in employment opportunities and population density in more rural outskirts. The increased accessibility also results in the relocation of lower-income households to places with lower housing rent. The sensitivity analysis shows that these findings are mostly impacted by changes in road capacity (which is expected to be generally higher as a result of these new technologies), as well as different penetration levels in the fleet.

AB We envision a multimodal transportation system where Mobility-on-Demand (MoD) service is used to serve the first mile and last mile of transit trips. For this purpose, the current research formulates an optimization model for designing an integrated MoD and urban transit system. The proposed model is a mixed-integer non-linear programming model that captures the strategic behavior of passengers in a multimodal network through a passenger assignment model. It determines which transit routes to operate, the frequency of the operating routes, the fleet size of vehicles required in each transportation analysis zone to serve the demand, and the passenger flow on both road and transit networks. A Benders decomposition approach with several enhancements is proposed to solve the given optimization program. Computational experiments are presented for the Sioux Falls multimodal network. The results show a significant improvement in the congestion in the city center with the introduction and optimization of an integrated transportation system. The proposed design allocates more vehicles to the outskirt zones in the network (to serve the first mile and last mile of transit trips) and more frequency to the transit routes in the city center. The integrated system significantly improves the share of transit passengers and their level of service in comparison to the base optimized transit system. The sensitivity analysis of the bus and vehicle fleet shows that increasing the number of buses has more impact on improving the level of service of passengers compared to increasing the number of MoD vehicles. The article also offers managerial insights on deploying such multimodal service.

AB Practical vision-based technology is essential for the autonomous driving of intelligent hybrid electric vehicles. In this article, a hierarchical control structure is proposed, which combines you only look once-based object detection and learning-based intelligent control by deep reinforcement learning. After modeling a typical car-following scene, the leading car is detected in the driving image, and the real-time distance between two cars is evaluated by vision-based distance measurement. Then, a deep Q-network is adopted to learn the car-following control strategy and energy management strategy, which achieves multiobjective control of the hybrid powertrain while maintaining a reasonable distance for the following car. When completing off-line training, the online processor-in-the-loop test by the edge computing device NVIDIA Jetson AGX Xavier is performed. Results show that the hierarchical control strategy gets a fuel economy of 5.76 L/100 km while keeping a safe following distance. Moreover, the time consumed to run a driving cycle of 1797 s in the embedded device is 476.87 s, which means that a control loop, including target recognition, distance measurement, car-following control, and energy management, takes 0.26 s. This study proves that vehicle vision can lay the technical foundation for intelligent driving, and the results illustrate that the hierarchical control structure is capable of achieving considerable computing efficiency on embedded devices and has the potential for real vehicle control.

AB Swarms composed of multiple unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) are emerging as a key tool in various application fields including aerial surveillance, urban search and rescue, and package delivery. In this context, trajectory planning remains one of the principal concerns regarding complex robotic applications. This paper proposes a 4D path planning algorithm based on the Fast Marching Square (FM2) method for multi-UAV teams in high-dimensional 3D environments with multiple obstacles. The 4D-FM2 algorithm integrates a time-dependent speed function within the Fast Marching (FM) framework. The proposed algorithm was tested in a simulated urban scenario and results demonstrate that the algorithm effectively plans safe, optimal solutions to the shortest path problem for UAVs while avoiding obstacles and other drones, even in complex situations. Additionally, the algorithm excels in providing smooth speed profiles for the vehicles. Furthermore, the study also successfully evaluated the effect of various implementation parameters on the algorithm's outcome, such as the number of concurrent missions and the velocity of the vehicles. Moreover, computational time was kept within acceptable limits, and the method demonstrated overall good performance in terms of air traffic flow. The main contribution of this work is the introduction of a novel 4D trajectory planning algorithm that implicitly incorporates UAV movement and speed and hence the spatio-temporal realization of the path during the planning phase, leveraging the light propagation phenomenon. This approach efficiently addresses the presence of other UAVs and environmental obstacles, thereby preventing collisions and avoiding unnecessary airspace blockages.

AB In this study, a motion control algorithm based on deep imitation reinforcement learning is proposed for the unmanned underwater vehicles (UUVs). The algorithm is called imitation learning (IL) twin delay deep deterministic policy gradient (DDPG) (TD3). It combines IL with DDPG (TD3). In order to accelerate the training process of reinforcement learning, the supervised learning method is used in IL for behaviour cloning from the closed-loop control data. The deep reinforcement learning employs actor-critic architecture. The actor part executes the control strategy and the critic part evaluates current control strategy. The training efficiency of IL-TD3 is compared with DDPG and TD3. The simulation results show that the training results of IL-TD3 converge faster and the training process is more stable than both of them, the convergence rate of IL-TD3 algorithm during training is about double that of DDPG and TD3. The control performance via IL-TD3 is superior to PID in UUVs motion control tasks. The average track error of IL-TD3 is reduced by$70\percnt $70%than PID control. The average tracking error under thruster fault is almost the same as under normal condition.

AB The aim of this paper is to study the dynamic behaviour of hydrogen technology in a company in which material handling and transportation is used as part of the production cycle at a business in the logistics sector, located in Madrid, Spain. The company owns a fleet of 38 vehicles of four different types powered by fuel cells, which are sufficient to handle and transport 36,000 pallets a week. Using the number of vehicles, the energy consumption and the work cycles for each type of vehicle as the main input variables, TRNSYS software was used to simulate this type of system to ascertain the dimensions of the hydrogen infrastructure. By simulating numerous configurations, we obtained the infrastructure that was most suitable for supplying the fleet and guaranteeing its autonomous operation for a five-day period. The results of the simulation are expressed in terms of the time variation of the energy consumed by the electrolysis system and the compressor, as well as the pressure and volume of the gas in the storage tank. From this it can be deduced that establishing the dimensions of the component elements means the entire system reaches a stable dynamic operation in a timeframe equivalent to 17% of the simulation horizon, with the operational and financial advantages that this entails. This is because the electrolysis system that is required operates continuously during that time, and the power consumed by the electrolysers is the system's main operational variable. The procedure employed for this study can be replicated in other similar situations by adjusting the input variables and any specific requirements.

AB When driving on a curved lane with varying curvature, human drivers usually make a small range of longitudinal speed adjustments to maintain a yaw response that feels more stable. Taking this type of response as a reference, intelligent vehicles must also make adjustments to their longitudinal speed within a small range during the path tracking process with curvature changes. The current variable curvature path tracking algorithm using model predictive control (MPC) basically assumes that the vehicle moves at a constant speed, which does not match the small-range adjustment of the longitudinal speed and thereby affects the accuracy of path tracking. In this paper, considering the small range of speed variation in the path tracking process, the path and speed decoupling control in Frenet coordinates are used to replace the longitudinal-lateral-yaw complex coupling dynamics control. Meanwhile, considering the problem that the steady-state error of the MPC controller caused by curvature variation in the path tracking process cannot be eliminated, the adaptive weight control (AWC) and adaptive feedforward (AFF) models based on BP neural network (BPNN) data learning are designed to dynamically adjust the lateral error weight and feedforward factors of the MPC controller. As a result, a more accurate path tracking effect is achieved. Simulation results in the joint CarSim-Simulink environment show that the proposed algorithm significantly improves the adaptive capability of the linear MPC controller in response to time-varying conditions and has a higher tracking accuracy.

AB Driving automation is happening at a rapid pace, with different driver assistance systems already available in mass-market cars. However, this rapid development in driving automation leads to concerns and questions about their impact on safety. While previous studies have been restricted to incident reports and simulation tools, the safety of automated vehicles (AVs) has not been clearly demonstrated independently from their developers and proponents. Instead of crashes, which are extremely rare events, this study uses surrogate measures of safety (SMoS) to analyze the interactions between road users and low-speed automated shuttles that circulated in Montreal and Candiac, in Canada, during two pilot projects in mid and late 2019. Cameras were placed at seven intersections along the routes of the shuttles. More than 70 hours of footage were processed to extract the road user trajectories using computer vision techniques and compute various safety indicators: speed and acceleration at the road user level, time headway, time-to-collision (TTC), post-encroachment time (PET) and the speed difference at the interaction level. The Kolmogorov-Smirnov test was used to compare the distributions of these indicators for interactions involving automated shuttles or motorized vehicles following similar paths. Multivariate regression was used to identify the relationship between the safety indicators and various factors. The results indicate that these automated shuttles behave generally more safely: their speeds and accelerations are lower and their interactions are characterized by higher TTC and PET values, and lower speed differences. However, small headway times at one site with high-speed differences between the shuttles and other following vehicles raise concerns that warrant further research into the suitable context for these vehicles.

AB It is widely expected that automated vehicles (AVs) will revolutionise travel experience by better facilitating various on-board activities. While these activities could make travel more pleasant, as is often supposed, they could also affect daily schedules, the related travel choices, and finally, the aggregate travel patterns - possible influences that are still insufficiently studied. For example, a morning commuter deciding to perform some home or work activities during travel, instead of at home or work, could also reconsider his departure time to work. More such travellers together could reshape traffic congestion. This paper models exactly this scenario. It formulates new scheduling preferences, which account for home and/or work activities during morning commute, and uses these (1) to analyse the optimal departure times when there is no congestion, and (2) to obtain the equilibrium congestion patterns in a bottleneck setting. If there is no congestion, it is predicted that AV users would depart earlier (later), if the on-board environment supports their home (work) activities. If there is congestion, AV users that perform home (work) activities during travel skew the congestion to earlier (later) times, and AV users that perform both activities increase both early and late congestion. Engaging in any activity during travel worsens congestion, at least when assuming that AVs do not increase bottleneck capacity. If future AVs would be specialised to support only home, only work, or both home and work activities, and would do so to a similar extent, then 'Work AVs' would increase the congestion the least.

AB In this study, we investigated a novel method for high-accuracy autonomous alignment of a strapdown inertial navigation system assisted by Doppler radar on a vehicle-borne moving base, which effectively avoids the measurement errors caused by wheel-slip or vehicle-sliding. Using the gyroscopes in a strapdown inertial navigation system and Doppler radar, we calculated the dead reckoning, analyzed the error sources of the dead reckoning system, and established an error model. Then the errors of the strapdown inertial navigation system and dead reckoning system were treated as the states. Besides velocity information, attitude information was cleverly introduced into the alignment measurement to improve alignment accuracy and reduce alignment time. Therefore, the first measurement was the difference between the output attitude and velocity of the strapdown inertial navigation system and the corresponding signals from the dead reckoning system. In order to further improve the alignment accuracy, more measurement information was introduced by using the vehicle motion constraint, that is, the velocity output projection of strapdown inertial navigation system along the transverse and vertical direction of the vehicle body was also used as the second measurement. Then the corresponding state and measurement equations were established, and the Kalman filter algorithm was used for assisted alignment filtering. The simulation results showed that, with a moving base, the misalignment angle estimation accuracy was better than 0.5' in the east direction, 0.4' in the north direction, and 3.2' in the vertical direction.

AB Automated vehicles (AVs) have left the laboratories and can be experienced in several projects, e.g. at the premises of a clinic in Germany. With this transition, research on AV attitudes no longer needs to rely on questionnaires with hypothetical scenarios and simulations. Previous research - limited by the unavailability of AVs - has provided ambivalent results regarding age and gender differences in attitudes towards AVs. We present research results about the role of age and gender in connection with attitudes such as acceptance, perceived safety, and trust, as well as intention to use. We additionally demonstrate relationships between those constructs and emotions such as amusement, fear, and surprise. Data were collected from participants (n = 125) after having experienced an AV ride with level 4 automation on two campuses of a clinic in Berlin, Germany. Results reveal strong correlations between all attitudes (0.55 <= r <= 0.71; p < 0.01) and show acceptance and perceived safety to be solid predictors of intention to use AVs. We also found age to be a significant predictor for usage intention even when other attitudes are considered (beta = -0.22; p < 0.01). MANOVA results point to gender differences in all constructs, but with limited confidence (5.40 <= F <= 18.34; p <= 0.02). However, we reject our hypothesis that young men are highly accepting, trusting, and intending to use AVs compared to other combinations of age and gender. We recommend using a mix of attitude, emotion, and behavioural (intention) measures in future research on AVs together with more transparency regarding construct definitions and study materials.

ID LIMITS; CAR
AB The problem of maneuvering a vehicle through a race course in minimum time requires computation of both longitudinal (brake and throttle) and lateral (steering wheel) control inputs. Unfortunately, solving the resulting nonlinear optimal control problem is typically computationally expensive and infeasible for real-time trajectory planning. This paper presents an iterative algorithm that divides the path generation task into two sequential subproblems that are significantly easier to solve. Given an initial path through the race track, the algorithm runs a forward-backward integration scheme to determine the minimum-time longitudinal speed profile, subject to tire friction constraints. With this fixed speed profile, the algorithm updates the vehicle's path by solving a convex optimization problem that minimizes the resulting path curvature while staying within track boundaries and obeying affine, time-varying vehicle dynamics constraints. This two-step process is repeated iteratively until the predicted lap time no longer improves. While providing no guarantees of convergence or a globally optimal solution, the approach performs very well when validated on the Thunderhill Raceway course in Willows, CA. The predicted lap time converges after four to five iterations, with each iteration over the full 4.5 km race course requiring only 30 s of computation time on a laptop computer. The resulting trajectory is experimentally driven at the race circuit with an autonomous Audi TTS test vehicle, and the resulting lap time and racing line are comparable to both a nonlinear gradient descent solution and a trajectory recorded from a professional racecar driver. The experimental results indicate that the proposed method is a viable option for online trajectory planning in the near future.

AB Tracking control is one of the important working conditions of unmanned driving and can help vehicles keep distances and run in an orderly manner to improve traffic utilization, ensure clear roads and avoid rear-end collisions. This paper constructs the motion trend of obstacles within the predictive step length of model predictive control (MPC), designs the danger level indicator between vehicles and obstacles, and formulates dynamic planning for the original reference path based on MPC. This paper proposes an integrated collision avoidance control strategy based on dynamic nonlinear MPC (DNMPC), and predicts the locations of moving obstacles within the predictive step length of DNMPC. The proposed method can perform initial planning for the collision-avoidance path according to the road environment information and based on the activation function. It builds the function for the tendency of obstacles within the predictive step length of MPC, introduces it into the objective function for optimization, designs dynamic path planning control based on the theories of MPC, and performs local optimization to the initial reference path under the obstacles in motion with a mass model. In addition, it defines varying discrete step lengths within the predictive step length and achieves the long-distance prediction and high-precision control of collision avoidance controllers. The experimental results show that the dynamic, nonlinear, and integrated collision avoidance control proposed in this paper can ensure excellent collision avoidance and steady vehicle driving and has very good practical value.

AB As a promising new form in mobile edge computing network, Vehicular Edge Computing (VEC) can further improve the Quality of Service (QoS) of users. However, when edge servers are damaged or overloaded, the requirements of users are difficult met by VEC servers owing to incomplete connectivity and time-varying channel conditions in dynamic and resource-limited vehicular networks. In this paper, we introduce Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) to enhance the connectivity and total resources in the vehicular networks. Added to that, we focus on the problem of computation-intensive graph jobs scheduling, where the information interactions among the traditional vehicles, autonomous vehicles and UAV are integrated. And the above scheduling problem is modeled as a binary nonlinear programming problem aiming at minimizing average completion delay of jobs. Then, we develop an effective multiple jobs scheduling scheme by considering the scheduling order of multiple jobs, the remaining processing delay of servers, and the available resources of vehicular networks, which consists of two stages: (1) the multiple jobs priority scheduling algorithm for optimizing the jobs scheduling order; (2) the task offloading decision algorithm for optimizing average completion delay of jobs. Finally, the effectiveness of proposed scheme is proved by extensive simulation experiments. Compared with the other schemes, the proposed scheme can effectively reduce average completion delay of jobs.& COPY; 2023 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Micro air vehicles' (MAVs) movements can be significantly affected by physical contact with unknown moving objects (UMOs) from a random direction. To address this problem, low-latency sensors (cameras or radars) and high-speed processors are installed in six directions of aerial vehicles. However, this method is limited by hardware costs, load, and energy. In this article, a fast recovery strategy for MAVs is proposed, which is inspired by the recovery manoeuvre of mosquitoes hit by raindrops. When hit by falling raindrops, mosquitoes will descend along the falling direction of raindrops to gradually counteract the kinetic energy of the impact induced by the raindrops. During the descent, mosquitoes will gradually tilt to one side but move in the opposite direction, and finally deviate from the falling route of raindrops. To simulate the recovery strategy, a micro aerial robot called RobMos is designed. The RobMos is an overactuated system that can decouple the position control from the attitude control. Using the recovery strategy, the robot can quickly recover to a stable attitude after being impacted by UMOs. An onboard inertial measurement unit is used to estimate the impact location. Finally, the prototype can bear the impact of objects that are two times its own weight. Moreover, the generalizability of this strategy is also discussed, and it is proved that the RobMos can even recover attitude after being hit by the UMO in a lateral direction.

AB Accurate pedestrian trajectory prediction is significant and challenging for traffic-actor protection and intelligent driving. However, most of the existing methods focus on pedestrian-pedestrian interaction ignoring the pedestrian-vehicle interaction and containing much ineffective interaction. To tackle the problem, this paper proposes a spatiotemporal LSTM attention network (STLAN) for pedestrian trajectory prediction based on a spatiotemporal dual attention module (STDAM). First, a pedestrian social force model is established to analyze the effective pedestrian-pedestrian interaction and pedestrian-vehicle interaction in mixed traffic scene. Second, a pedestrian trajectory prediction network architecture is constructed to integrate temporal and spatial information. By temporal attention STDAM captures underlying dependencies between time steps in individual pedestrian, assigning different weights to the input sequence of it. By spatial attention STDAM extracts latent interaction between traffic actors, assigning different weights to every traffic actor. In addition, random noise is introduced to simulate the uncertainty of pedestrian trajectory. Experimental results on a real-world traffic actors dataset show that STLAN outperforms several mainstream methods. Specifically, STLAN achieves 0.17/0.11 ADE/FDE and 3.79/0.38 AMD/AMV in the representative pedestrian-pedestrian interaction scene, with 0.15/0.17 ADE/FDE and 2.36/0.21 AMD/AMV in pedestrian-vehicle interaction scene. Furthermore, ablation experiments validate the effectiveness of STDAM in improving trajectory prediction accuracy.

TI Differentiated Toll Optimization on Goods Vehicles Based on Prediction

SO JOURNAL OF ADVANCED TRANSPORTATION
LA English
DT Article
AB The area rate of the toll road network is designed to influence the regional road network traffic flow configuration and an important factor of goods vehicle path selection, transportation, and other related departments in formulating the related standard. The toll rate is usually combined with the local passenger and cargo loading conditions. Adjusting and optimizing the charge policy, optimization of processes and methods is still facing many difficulties. In this paper, the model parameters and toll status of various goods vehicles are considered, and an optimization algorithm of toll rates for different vehicles in a large-scale road network is proposed. By constructing a traffic demand prediction model based on multiple truck classification, this paper analyzes the distribution status of network trucks and the final charging under the influence of different rates. At the bottom of the algorithm is an analytical model composed of nonlinear equations whose dimensions scale linearly with the scale of the road network. The scale of the road network is independent of the path set and link attribute. The model is verified and the parameters are calibrated by a small network. Finally, the Road network is selected for empirical analysis in Xinjiang Autonomous Region. A case study shows that the analytical structure information provided by the analytic network model enables the algorithm to quickly identify high quality solutions, and the algorithm has better simulation accuracy and premium rate design advantages.

AB This paper investigates the finite-time coordinated path following (CPF) control of underactuated surface vehicles (USVs) based on event-triggered mechanism. Initially, an event-triggered extended state observer (ET-FTESO) is designed, which can not only estimate the compound disturbances and the unmeasured velocities simultaneously in finite time, but also reduce the sensor-to-observer communication cost. Furthermore, a finite -time line-of-sight (FTLOS) guidance law is proposed for each USV to track the reference path. Then, under the condition of one-way communication, the coordinated update law of path variable is designed so that all USVs keep the same distance from each other along one curve. Specifically, finite-time CPF controllers via fast terminal sliding mode control (FTSMC) technique are proposed for each USV. On this basis, by combining with the relative threshold event-triggered mechanism, the controllers will be updated if and only if event-triggered conditions are satisfied. Therefore, it can greatly reduce the update rate of controller and mechanical loss of actuator. Subsequently, the stability analysis demonstrates that the closed-loop system is uniformly globally finite-time stable. And, it is proved by theory that the Zeno behavior can be avoided. Finally, numerical simulation results illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed control scheme.

AB Obstacle detection using semantic segmentation has become an established approach in autonomous vehicles. However, existing segmentation methods, primarily developed for ground vehicles, are inadequate in an aquatic environment as they produce many false positive (FP) detections in the presence of water reflections and wakes. We propose a novel deep encoder-decoder architecture, a water segmentation and refinement (WaSR) network, specifically designed for the marine environment to address these issues. A deep encoder based on ResNet101 with atrous convolutions enables the extraction of rich visual features, while a novel decoder gradually fuses them with inertial information from the inertial measurement unit (IMU). The inertial information greatly improves the segmentation accuracy of the water component in the presence of visual ambiguities, such as fog on the horizon. Furthermore, a novel loss function for semantic separation is proposed to enforce the separation of different semantic components to increase the robustness of the segmentation. We investigate different loss variants and observe a significant reduction in FPs and an increase in true positives (TPs). Experimental results show that WaSR outperforms the current state of the art by approximately 4% in F1 score on a challenging unmanned surface vehicle dataset. WaSR shows remarkable generalization capabilities and outperforms the state of the art by over 24% in F1 score on a strict domain generalization experiment.

AB Advances in communications technology have made the development of connected and automated vehicle (CAV) applications that may potentially replace traditional, gantry operated lane control signals (LCSs) possible. This paper develops the concept of a prototype CAV-enabled LCS application and provides a preliminary assessment of the potential improvement it offers over traditional LCS. Real-world data obtained from an LCS on 1-66 in Northern Virginia was used to calibrate and validate a baseline simulation model. Further, the current lane control scenarios utilized in the Northern Virginia LCS were identified and relevant data resulting from implementation of those scenarios were collected to model the LCS in a simulation environment. The performance of real-world LCS was then compared to a prototype CAV-enabled LCS application developed in this research. The CAV-enabled LCS application consistently outperformed the traditional LCS with increased throughput and speeds. On average, an increase of 18.4%, 9.6% and 12.8% in throughput was observed for three selected scenarios under the best case of a 1 sec headway. Furthermore, the CAV-enabled LCS application was also found to reduce volatility, represented by variation in acceleration and deceleration regimes, by an average of 25.6% and 49.6%. The reduction in turbulence in the traffic stream may indicate potential improved safety with the CAV system.

AB Modern vehicles are equipped with numerous electric control units which exchange vehicular status data, providing drivers with convenience, efficiency, and safety. In addition, the autonomous vehicles adopt various sensors that produce high volumes of high-speed data to process and assess internal and external situations. This data is particularly useful to automotive service providers such as car insurers, rental companies, and manufacturers. One way to understand how this data is used is to imagine the scenario in which an automobile insurer would provide a discount to a customer with an accident-free or near accident-free driving record. However, it is still possible that a less than the honest customer could manipulate their driving data in order to receive premium insurance services at preferential rates. To prevent this and similar scenarios, it is then critical to ensure that all data generated in a vehicle upholds integrity, continuity, and non-repudiation. Unfortunately, no such trustworthy data recording system of this caliber exists in any manufactured vehicle to date. This paper attempts to respond to this need, and we present a reliable automotive data recording system that satisfies these requirements and detects malicious manipulations from data deletion, replacement, replaying, and truncation. The proposed method additionally satisfies forward integrity of message authentication keys and is designed to utilize recorded data as automotive forensic evidence. Finally, the evaluation results demonstrate that our system can manage bandwidths of up to 64 MB/s.

AB Object tracking is an important basis for the autonomous navigation of unmanned surface vehicles. However, several problems still must be addressed for a wide applicating of object tracking in unmanned surface vehicles. First, if multiple objects of the same classification exist in the same field of view, then stable extraction of an object is difficult. Second, in an environment with a complex background and large changes in object shape, the tracking accuracy is low, and object tracking errors and tracking loss can easily occur. Third, much time is required to detect a high-resolution real-time video stream, not meeting the delay requirement of the photoelectric servo stable tracking. To resolve these problems, this paper proposes an object detection-tracking algorithm based on a radar-photoelectric system. The algorithm combines an object detection algorithm with an object tracking algorithm and involves the following steps. First, a first-frame object extraction algorithm is used to extract the tracking object from the first frame. Second, a region of interest (ROI)-prediction algorithm is used to predict ROIs and detect objects in these ROIs. This algorithm can effectively solve the above problems in marine tests. When multiple objects of the same classification exist in the same field of view, the algorithm can extract the radar-guided object stably. When faced with a complex background and a large change in object shape, the algorithm substantially improves the accuracy and robustness of object tracking. Compared with the conventional object detection algorithm, the time consumption of this algorithm is reduced by 25.8%.

AB Purpose The purpose of this paper is to present a new approach for finding a minimum-length trajectory for an autonomous unmanned air vehicle or a long-range missile from a release point with specified release conditions to a destination with specified approach conditions. The trajectory has to avoid obstacles and no-fly zones and must take into account the kinematic constraints of the air vehicle.
   Design/methodology/approach A discrete routing model is proposed that represents the airspace by a sophisticated network. The problem is then solved by applying standard shortest-path algorithms.
   Findings In contrast to the most widely used grids, the generated networks allow arbitrary flight directions and turn angles, as well as maneuvers of different strengths, thus fully exploiting the flight capabilities of the aircraft. Moreover, the networks are resolution-independent and provide high flexibility by the option to adapt density.
   Practical implications As an application, a concept for in-flight replanning of flight paths to changing destinations is proposed. All computationally intensive tasks are performed in a pre-flight planning prior to the launch of the mission. The in-flight planning is based entirely on precalculated data, which are stored in the onboard computer of the air vehicle. In particular, no path finding algorithms with high or unpredictable running time and uncertain outcome have to be applied during flight.
   Originality/value The paper presents a new network-based algorithm for flight path optimization that overcomes weaknesses of grid-based approaches and allows high-quality solutions. The method can be applied for quick in-flight replanning of flight paths.

DT Article
ID AUTONOMOUS VEHICLES; OPPORTUNITIES; POLICY
AB The ethical implications for the engineering profession of the development and deployment of automated vehicles (AVs) can be explored by analyzing the implications of AVs across three major socio-technical systems-technology, transportation systems, and policy. Mapping the ethical canons of professional engineering societies to these domains provides a lens to investigating existing ethical issues and uncovering issues that still need attention. The codes of ethics for five engineering societies direct engineers to consider, identify, mitigate, and manage how their work affects the public. AV ethics literature in the technology domain has focused mainly on crashes, AV software capabilities, and hardware. This narrow focus signifies that engineers in the technology domain can do more to understand potential impacts beyond AV crash behavior. in the transportation systems domain, among the many ethical issues affected by AVs, how engineers design and deploy surface transportation infrastructure is an example of an ethical system-level problem yet to be addressed. Lastly, the policy domain has begun addressing primary effects like protecting the public from physical harm, but other ethical aspects remain unaddressed. All three domains could benefit from more holistic system-level assessments of the ethical implications of AVs. Engineers can use their professional engineering organization ethical canons to evaluate their contribution to managing ethical issues in these AV domains and improve how automated vehicles serve and safeguard the public.

AB Dynamic Wireless Power Transfer (DWPT) has high potential to overcome electric vehicles' battery issues of size and range and to achieve fully autonomous driving. Accurately extracting the self- and mutual-inductance of the coils is essential for controlling and optimizing the overall performance of the DWPT system under real driving conditions. Due to the limited space for coil installation at the bottom of the vehicles, multi-turn, multi-layer square coils are proposed to maximize the space utilization of the DWPT system. For the first time, this paper presents a theoretical model for calculating the self- and mutual-inductance and the coupling coefficients of multi-turn, multi-layer square coils. Taking a four-turn, four-layer square coil as an example, the model is cross-validated by 3D coil modelling and simulation, as well as practical measurements. A theoretical-experimental verification is further conducted to indirectly corroborate the cross-validated coupling coefficients of the two coils. On average, the normalized root mean square errors of the resultant self-inductance and coupling coefficients of two identical coils are 1.04% and 4.29%, respectively. Specifically, for the selected case, normalized root mean square errors of the zero-phase angle frequencies of the system under different misalignment situations average out at 1.32%.

AB Wheel odometry is a simple and low-cost localization technique that can be used for localization in GNSS-deprived environments; however, its measurement accuracy is affected by many factors, such as wheel slip, wear, and tire pressure changes, resulting in unpredictable and variable errors, which in turn affect positioning performance. To improve the localization performance of wheel odometry, this study developed a wheel odometry error prediction model based on a transformer neural network to learn the measurement uncertainty of wheel odometry and accurately predict the odometry error. Driving condition characteristics including features describing road types, road conditions, and vehicle driving operations were considered, and models both with and without driving condition characteristics were compared and analyzed. Tests were performed on a public dataset and an experimental vehicle. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed model can predict the odometry error with higher accuracy, stability, and reliability than the LSTM and WhONet models under multiple challenging and longer GNSS outage driving conditions. At the same time, the transformer model's overall performance can be improved in longer GNSS outage driving conditions by considering the driving condition characteristics. Tests on the experimental vehicle demonstrate the model's generalization capability and the improved positioning performance of dead reckoning when using the proposed model. This study explored the possibility of applying a transformer model to wheel odometry and provides a new solution for using deep learning in localization.

AB The automotive industry is undergoing a profound digital transformation to create autonomous vehicles. Vehicle-to-Everything (V2X) communications enable the provisioning of transportation use cases for road traffic and safety management. At the same time, during the past decade, Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML) have been in the spotlight because of their outstanding performance in various domains, including natural language processing, and computer vision. Considering also current standardization efforts, towards incorporating AI and ML as integral sub-systems of beyond 5G and 6G networks, these technologies are considered very promising to optimize user, control, and management network functions, but also to support road safety and even entertainment applications. This survey systematically reviews existing research at the intersection of AI/ML and V2X communications, focusing on handover management, proactive caching, physical and computation resources allocation, beam selection optimization, packet routing, and QoS prediction in vehicular environments. We extract the underlying AI/ML techniques, the training features, their architecture and discuss several aspects regarding the intricacies of vehicular environments and ML. These aspects include time complexity of the algorithms, quality of real-world vehicle traces, suitability of AI/ML techniques in relevance to the designated network operation and the underlying automotive use case, as well as velocity and positioning accuracy requirements towards the creation of more realistic and representative synthetic data.

The proposed system provides a design and optimization algorithm of in-vehicle networking technologies related Ethernet Audio Video Bridge (AVB) technology. We present a design of in-vehicle network system as well as the optimization of AVB for automotive. A proposal of Reduced Latency of Machin to Machine (RLMM) plays a significant role in reducing the latency between devices. The approach of RLMM on realistic test cases indicated that there was a latency reduction about 30.41% It is expected that the optimized settings for the actual automotive network environment can greatly shorten the time period in the development and design process. The results achieved from the experiments on the latency present in each function are trustworthy since average values are obtained via repeated tests for several months. It would considerably benefit the industry because analyzing the delay between each function in a short period of time is tremendously significant. In addition, through the proposed real-time camera and video streaming via optimized settings of AVB system, it is expected that AI (Artificial Intelligence) algorithms in autonomous driving will be of great help in understanding and analyzing images in real time.

AB As a promising computing paradigm driven by 5G, mobile edge computing (MEC) empowers smart vehicles to offload computation-intensive tasks to edge devices in the Internet of Vehicles (IoV), thereby providing a plethora of exciting applications (e.g. on-board AR/VR, autonomous driving, etc.) with the unique quality of service (QoS) guarantees. However, a key challenge of MEC is howto keep the delay and energy consumption to aminimum in the computation offloading process, while ensuring the privacy security of offloaded data and the load balancing of edge resources. Namely, howto simultaneously optimize multiple indicators that affect computation offloading, which creates a challenging multi-objective optimization (MOO) problem. Aiming at the MOO problem, we propose a novel multi-objective reinforcement learning (MORL) algorithm based on double deep Q-network (DDQN). Each DDQN agent obtains rewards on different objectives according to different reward functions, and dynamically approximates the optimal offloading decision on multiple objectives. To conquer the trade-off problem among multiple conflicting objectives, we propose a weight-learning network based on radial basis function (RBF) networks, which dynamically adjusts the weights by learning the value changes among the objectives. Interestingly, we discovered encouraging potential ofMORLfor solving computation offloading problems in IoV, and numerical results show that the proposed algorithm outperforms traditional reinforcement learning methods by 30.24% in terms of overall energy consumption.

AB The success of unmanned car, an emerging tool of transportation with so many advantages, depends to a large extent on its user acceptability. Potential designers are both the decision makers of driverless car design and the users of driverless cars. This study aims to explore the influencing factors of the potential designers' intention to use unmanned cars. Based on the theory of Technology Acceptance Model (TAM), this study further expanded the TAM by incorporating perceived trust, perceived enjoyment and self-efficacy, so as to explain and predict potential designers' intention to use unmanned cars. The questionnaire is determined through theoretical literature, pre-tests, etc., and the Structural Equation Model is used to analyze the data of 202 valid survey samples to investigate the influencing factors of the willingness to use unmanned vehicles. The results show that potential designers' intention to use unmanned cars is positively affected by perceived trust, perceived enjoyment, perceived usefulness and perceived ease of use, and perceived trust has a positive effect on perceived ease of use, self-efficacy and perceived ease of use also have a positive effect on perceived usefulness. The findings of this study can provide designers and developers of unmanned cars, policy makers and implementers with guidance in the follow-up design, policy formulation and advertising of unmanned cars.

ID VEHICLES; SAFETY; TIME
AB Highway safety has attracted significant research interest in recent years, especially as innovative technologies such as connected and autonomous vehicles (CAVs) are fast becoming a reality. Identification and prediction of driving intention are fundamental for avoiding collisions as it can provide useful information to drivers and vehicles in their vicinity. However, the state-of-the-art in maneuver prediction requires the utilization of large labeled datasets, which demand a significant amount of processing and might hinder real-time applications. In this paper, an end-to-end machine learning model for predicting lane-change maneuvers from unlabeled data using a limited number of features is developed and presented. The model is built on a novel comprehensive dataset (i.e., highD) obtained from German highways with camera-equipped drones. Density-based clustering is used to identify lane-changing and lane-keeping maneuvers and a support vector machine (SVM) model is then trained to learn the boundaries of the clustered labels and automatically label the new raw data. The labeled data are then input to a long short-term memory (LSTM) model which is used to predict maneuver class. The classification results show that lane changes can efficiently be predicted in real-time, with an average detection time of at least 3 s with a small percentage of false alarms. The utilization of unlabeled data and vehicle characteristics as features increases the prospects of transferability of the approach and its practical application for highway safety.

TI Optimization of Transmission Signal Power through Observation of
   Congestion in VANets Using the <i>Fuzzy</i> Logic Approach: A Case Study
   in Highway and Urban Layout
SO WIRELESS COMMUNICATIONS & MOBILE COMPUTING
LA English
DT Article
AB Vehicular ad hoc networks (VANETs) have unique features and rely on vehicle-to-vehicle (v2v) communication to mitigate adversities in traffic dynamicsmanagement and to support drivers providing safety alerts. Congestions, originating froman incident, frequently endanger traffic and, consequently, cause all kinds of losses. In this scenario, the paper herein proposes eFIRST, a robust solution to autonomous detection of the current congestion condition in order to disseminate safety alerts and to reduce problems with the interruption of traffic in a section of the highway. The approach is supported only by v2v communication and the local neighborhood identification records, which are brought together in a fuzzy strategy and in the adaptive adjustment of the transmission signal power. The estimate of local traffic conditions establishes the dynamic reach of transmission for the vehicle, supporting the connective maintenance. In these circumstances, the drivers receive an alert emitted soon enough for the proper response action. The results during simulations show how the elaborated solution leads to minimized delays, with low communication overload, besides relevantly mapping the congest levels and efficiently providing the event coverage to satisfactory propagation distances inside the area of interest for the dissemination. Promptly, the alert finds vehicles far from the traffic accident located at nearly 1/6 fromthe evaluated extension. In accordance with the intelligent protocols, this evaluation contributes providing grants for the ratification of fuzzy approximation as an adaptive strategy to fluctuations in vehicular density in different traffic basis.

AB Cold seep habitats with authigenic carbonates and associated chemosynthetic communities in glacially influenced terrains constitute an important part of the benthic ecosystems, but they are difficult to detect in large-scale seabed surveys. The areas they occupy are normally small, and survey platforms and sensors allowing high-resolution spatial characterization are necessary. We have developed a cold seep habitat mapping strategy that involves both ship and autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) as platforms for multibeam echosounder, synthetic aperture sonar (SAS) and a digital photo system. Water column data from the shipborne multibeam echosounder data are initially used to detect gas flares resulting from fluid flow from the seabed. The next phase involves mapping of flare areas by SAS, mounted on an AUV. This yields an acoustic image with a resolution up to 2 cm over a swath of c. 350 m, allowing detection of seep-related features on the seabed. The last phase involves digital photographing of the seabed, with the AUV moving close to the seabed, allowing recognition of bubble streams, seep-related features and giving a first order documentation of the fauna. The strategy was applied to a 3775 km(2) large area on the continental shelf, northern Norway. This is a passive continental margin, with thick deposits of oil- and gas-bearing sedimentary rocks. Extensive faulting and tilting of layers provide potential conduits for fluid flow. The seabed is glacially influenced with a highly variable backscatter reflectivity. More than 200 gas flares have been identified, and a similar number of cold seep habitats have been characterized in high spatial detail. Two case studies are shown. In the first area, there is a close spatial relation between active gas seepage and carbonate crust fields. The second case study shows that carbonate crust fields are not necessarily spatially associated with currently active seeps, but represent dormant or formerly active gas expulsion. An important finding is that the bathymetric resolution of shipborne multibeam echosounders will often be too low to detect cold seep habitats. This means that a nested multi-resolution approach involving a multitude of platforms and sensors is required to provide the full picture.

AB Safety is a critical aspect of transportation design and operations. Practitioners utilize various references to ensure that roadways meet safety, operational, and sustainability requirements. Despite this, human error remains as a contributing factor toward unsafe driving behavior and potential crashes. Connected and autonomous vehicles (CAVs) have the potential to enhance traffic safety and operations. Although sensor perception ranges and capabilities pose challenges, the sharing of information via Vehicle-to-Everything (V2X) communication provides CAVs with a potential solution for overcoming sensor limitations. The objective of this study is to use the Simulation of Urban Mobility software to assess safety impacts when using V2X to share sensor-obtained roadway information with a CAV. To this end, this study proposes a novel method for simulating driver behavior that combines car following with consideration of the roadway's geometric configuration. Several scenarios are utilized to observe the behavior of simulated drivers on a straight tangent approaching a sharp horizontal curve. This study evaluates driver performance using the measured values for longitudinal jerk, lateral jerk, and speed variance. The results of this study indicate that V2X sensor sharing can provide significant benefits to CAV performance and can reduce the safety risk. CAVs receiving sensor-obtained information behave in a manner more akin to their human-driven counterparts in comparison to those receiving basic safety messages. CAVs using sensor-obtained information maintain braking and lateral jerk values within safety thresholds. In addition, speed variance was at its lowest when CAVs utilized V2X sensor information.

AB Infrastructure-to-vehicle (I2V) communication is an essential part of an intelligent transportation system. Bluetooth low energy (BLE) is one of the emerging Internet of Things (IoT) technologies that can enable the exchange of data at low-energy consumption. This study evaluated the application of IoT technologies, in particular BLE beacons-I2V communication devices to support autonomous vehicle (AV) operation in a real-world setting. An AV development platform built on a Lexus RX450h car was used to perform the evaluation. The testing program included two controlled-environment experiments and two real-world validation experiments. The controlled-environment experiments were used to select the BLE beacon settings to be considered. The validation experiments were performed in two different settings: a city street and an interstate highway in the City of Cincinnati in Ohio. To this end, beacons were attached to 10 different traffic signs in a city street as well as to a side barrier of an interstate highway. The ability of the AV to detect the traffic signs and the beacons attached to the side barrier was evaluated at different speeds. The study revealed promising results and indicated that the BLE beacon technology could potentially be a reliable solution to develop I2V communication systems that can be easily deployed to modify existing transportation infrastructure.

AB The collision avoidance system (CAS) is an essential system for safe driving that alerts the driver or automatically applies the brakes in an expected situation of a vehicle collision. To realize this, an autonomous system that can quickly and precisely detect brake-lights of preceding vehicle is essential and this should works well in various environments for safety reason. Our proposed vision algorithm solves these objectives focusing on simple color features rather than a learning algorithm with a high computational cost, since our target system is a real-time embedded device, i.e., forward-facing dashboard camera. However, the existing feature-based algorithms are vulnerable to the ambient noise (noise problem), and cannot be flexibly applied to various environments (applicability problem). Therefore, our method is divided into two stages: rear-lights region detection using gamma correction for noise problem, and brake-lights detection using HSV color space for applicability problem, respectively. (i) Rear-lights region detection: we confirm the presence of the vehicle in front and derive the rear-lights region, and used non-linear mapping of gamma correction to make the detected region robust to noise. (ii) Brake-lights detection: from the detected rear-lights region, we extract color features using the HSV color range so that we can classify brake on and off in various conditions. Experimental results show that our algorithm overcomes the noise problem and applicability problem in various environments.

AB Video-based vibration measurement technology offers the benefits of noncontact measurement and high automation. By mounting a camera on an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV), it enables the assessment of vibrations in objects that are inaccessible with traditional fixed camera systems, including large buildings and elevated mechanical equipment. However, existing video-based vibration measurement methods are challenging with UAV-mounted airborne cameras. In this article, we present an anti-disturbance video-based vibration measurement method that enables an airborne camera to accurately measure the vibrations of a target structure despite the presence of airflow-induced shaking. To address the global nature of UAV disturbances and the localized nature of target vibrations in the spatial domain, we propose a vibration extraction framework that leverages regional adjacent-frame phase differences (PDs). Furthermore, we design a baseline correction algorithm named piecewise empirical mode decomposition (PEMD) to suppress disturbances in the temporal domain by utilizing the trend characteristics of UAV disturbances in the PD sequence. Experiments are conducted in laboratory and outdoor settings, revealing that the correlation coefficient between the spectrums measured by the proposed method and the ground truth can reach 0.97. The results demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms existing state-of-the-art approaches with higher accuracy.

ID OPTIMIZATION; CONVERSION
AB There is a large amount of thermal energy wasted during the driving cycle of all kinds of vehicles. In this paper, a pyroelectric harvester system, based on temperature change, is designed for low-powered sensors for the reliable electronic/electric architecture development of autonomous vehicles. In fact, this harvester was designed, specifically, in order to capture the temperature of the braking system and convert the wasted heat energy during the contact process to electrical energy. This conversion process occurs due to the temperature variation through the pyroelectric material, given the cooling phenomena of the ambient air. The energy potentially available in the form of heat produced by the friction involved in braking was evaluated using finite element analysis in the multiphysics software environment. Therefore, we present simulations of disc heating and cooling during the braking process at different speeds. Moreover, the potential for energy harvesting in multiple rolling conditions is discussed, such as the braking cycles and the effect of the material thickness used in the conversion module. The proposed system has undergone simulation analysis, which shows that the system can generate a voltage of 10.8 V and a power of 7.0 mW for a cycle of one braking process and around 9.5 mW for a cycle containing two successive braking's. The results of the simulation study verify the feasibility of the system and demonstrate its pertinence, especially for low-power sensors for new vehicle generations.

AB With the rapid development of artificial intelligent technology, the deep learning method is widely applied to predict human driving intentions due to its relative accuracy of prediction, which is one of critical links for security guarantee in the distributed, mixed driving scenario. In order to sense the intention of human-driven vehicles and reduce the self-driving collision avoidance rate, an improved intention prediction method for human-driving vehicles based on unsupervised, deep inverse reinforcement learning is proposed. Firstly, a contrast discriminator module was proposed to extract richer features. Then, the residual module was created to overcome the drawbacks of gradient disappearance and network degradation with the increase in network layers. Furthermore, the dropout layer was generated to prevent the over-fitting phenomenon in the whole training process of the GRU network, so as to improve the generalization ability of the network model. Finally, abundant experiments were conducted on datasets to evaluate our proposed method. The pass rate of self-driving vehicles with conservative driver probabilities of p = 0.25, p = 0.4, and p = 0.6 improved by a maximum of 8%, 10%, and 3%, compared with the classical method LSTM and VAE + RNN. It indicates that the prediction results of our proposed method fit more with the basic structure of the given traffic scenario in a long-term prediction range, which verifies the effectiveness of our proposed method.

AB To optimize performances such as continuous curvature, safety, and satisfying curvature constraints of the initial planning path for driverless vehicles in parallel parking, a novel method is proposed to train control points of the Bezier curve using the radial basis function neural network method. Firstly, the composition and working process of an autonomous parking system are analyzed. An experiment concerning parking space detection is conducted using an Arduino intelligent minicar with ultrasonic sensor. Based on the analysis of the parallel parking process of experienced drivers and the idea of simulating a human driver, the initial path is planned via an arc-line-arc three segment composite curve and fitted by a quintic Bezier curve to make up for the discontinuity of curvature. Then, the radial basis function neural network is established, and slopes of points of the initial path are used as input to train and obtain horizontal ordinates of four control points in the middle of the Bezier curve. Finally, simulation experiments are carried out by MATLAB, whereby parallel parking of driverless vehicle is simulated, and the effects of the proposed method are verified. Results show the trained and optimized Bezier curve as a planning path meets the requirements of continuous curvature, safety, and curvature constraints, thus improving the abilities for parallel parking in small parking spaces.

AB In order to ensure reliable autonomous driving, the system must he able to detect future dangers in sufficient time to avoid or mitigate collisions. In this paper, we propose a collision risk assessment algorithm that can quantitatively assess collision risks for a set of local path candidates via the lane-based probabilistic motion prediction of surrounding vehicles. First, we compute target lane probabilities, which represent how likely a driver is to drive or move toward each lane, based on lateral position and lateral velocity in curvilinear coordinates. And then, collision risks are computed by incorporating both model probability distribution of lanes and a time-to-collision between a pair of predicted trajectories. Finally, collision risks are plotted on a trajectory plane that represents each set of the tangential acceleration and the final lateral offset of local path candidates. This collision risk map provides intuitive risk measures, and can also be utilized to determine a control strategy for a collision avoidance maneuver. Validation of the model is conducted by comparing the model probabilities with the maneuver probabilities derived from the next generation simulation database. Furthermore, the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm is verified in two driving scenarios, preceding vehicle braking and cut-in, on a curved highway with multiple vehicles.

AB This paper presents an improved positioning method for a Magnetic Encoder type Guided Vehicle (MEGV) using the Extended Kalman Filter and Encoder Compensation Method. The magnetic encoder system is one of several available guidance systems for autonomous guided vehicles using magnetic sticks that are buried at regular intervals (such as near landmarks, turning points, and work places) on designated paths. The system guides MEGVs on a pre-defined path using either of two types of devices: encoders or magnetic positioning devices. The encoder information is used in a range of positions between the magnetic sticks, and the magnetic positioning device is used to correct positioning of MEGV using global positioning of a magnetic stick. However, calculating the exact position of a MEGV is challenging because of errors (cumulative error of the encoder and disturbances in the general magnetic field). Therefore, this study proposes a method, which is a combination of EKF and ECM, for positioning MEGVs.' In the proposed method, EKF first estimates the position of the MEGV; then, ECM corrects the error of the encoders. To analyze the performance of the proposed method, a MEGV was designed and developed. The proposed method was compared with three other positioning methods (that use encoders, magnetic encoders, or EKF), and experiments were performed under similar working conditions. The experimental results demonstrated that the proposed method is superior to the other methods.

AB It can be a daunting task for human drivers to merge into highways because of the intricate vehicle negotiations and potential risk within limited time and space. Connected vehicle (CV) technologies could be a solution to this problem and offer many benefits to the road safety, traffic mobility, and energy efficiency. However, real-time optimal control of CVs is still an open challenge, due to the nonlinear vehicle dynamics, non-convex fuel consumption model, and highly dynamic uncertain intervehicle interactions. To tackle these issues, a novel real-time optimal control approach that balances the computational efficiency and solution optimality is proposed for the purpose of onboard application. To this end, the pseudospectral collocation method is integrated with a sequential convex programming approach to develop two new optimization algorithms, which are implemented within a model predictive control (MPC) framework to allow for real-time generation of optimal merging speed profiles. One algorithm leverages the line search technique to improve convergence, and the other benefits from the trust region method for better computational efficiency. The optimality and convergence process of both proposed algorithms are investigated by comparing their solutions with a popular non-linear solver.Simulation results show that the proposed methods outperform the benchmark in terms of computational cost, fuel consumption , traffic efficiency. In particular, the proposed fuel-economy merging rule can save 57.1% fuel consumption on average on four different traffic volumes. Meanwhile, the proposed optimal control algorithms can reduce 2.2% travel time on average comparing to the "first-in-first-out" merging rule.(c) 2023 The Franklin Institute.

AB Parking choice models have been developed in previous works with certain limitations, such as fixed demand, lack of real-time knowledge of parking availability at the parking facilities, and fixed parking duration, to name a few. Furthermore, such models when developed using mathematical optimization approaches, suffer from computational complexity that limits their practical applicability. This paper proposes a machine learning and simulation-based dynamic parking choice model for airport parking. It considers real-time variable parking demand, which influences access time and parking cost to various parking lots. Drivers ultimately decide to seek a parking lot depending on: (1) their value of time; (2) parking duration, and (3) availability of a parking lot. The model uses a Random Forest classifier to predict a driver's choice of a parking lot. The results, based on some empirical data, show that parking demand is highly correlated with a driver's decision to choose a parking lot, followed by parking duration and the driver's value of time. The model's accuracy in predicting a driver's parking choice is found to be 99.6%. The model provides real-time parking occupancy and can be very useful for managing airport parking. The model can be used for seeking a parking space by connected vehicles enabled with real-time information on parking availability at various parking locations (or garages). Future works may include extending the method for autonomous vehicles parking allocation and building a user-friendly dashboard with real-time traffic information for automated ground vehicle systems.

AB Vehicle pose estimation with LIDAR plays a crucial role in autonomous driving systems. It serves as the fundamental basis for functions such as tracking, path planning, and decision-making. However, the majority of current vehicle pose estimation techniques struggle to produce satisfactory results when faced with incomplete observation measurements, such as L-shaped point cloud clusters without side contours or those including side-view mirrors. In addition, the requirement for real-time results further increases the difficulty of the pose estimation task. In this paper, we present a vehicle Pose Estimation method with Heuristic L-shape fitting and grid-based Particle Filter (PE-HL-PF). We design a geometric shape classifier module to divide clusters into symmetrical and asymmetrical ones according to their shape features. Furthermore, a contour-based heuristic L-shape fitting module is introduced for asymmetrical clusters, and a structure-aware grid-based particle filter is used to estimate the pose of symmetrical clusters. PE-HL-PF first utilizes a heuristic asymmetrical module that selects dominant contours fitting orientation in a heuristic manner, thereby avoiding the need for a complex traversal search. Additionally, a symmetrical module based on particle filtering is incorporated to enhance the stability of orientation estimation. This method achieves significant improvements in both the runtime efficiency and pose estimation accuracy of incomplete point clouds. Compared with state-of-the-art pose estimation methods, our PE-HL-PF demonstrates a notable performance improvement. Our method can estimate the pose of thousands of objects in less than 1 millisecond, a significant improvement over previous methods. The results of experiments performed on the KITTI dataset validate the effectiveness of our approach.

AB Managed lanes (MLs) have been implemented as a vital strategy for traffic safety and management improvements. Previous studies involving MLs didn't examine the impact of connected vehicles' (CVs) lane configuration on freeway facilities with managed toll lanes. CVs are quickly expanding in the transportation industry and are among the most recent promising developments in traffic and safety engineering. In this study, several scenarios were tested using microscopic traffic simulation to determine the optimal CV lane configuration strategies while taking into consideration the market penetration rate (MPR%) of CVs and traffic conditions (i.e., peak, off-peak). Both safety (i.e., conflict frequency, conflict reduction) and operational (i.e., average speed, average delay) performance measures were included in the analyses. A Negative Binomial model was developed for investigating the factors that affect the safety measures. Tobit models were used to evaluate traffic operation. The results of the safety and operational analyses suggested that an MPR% between 10 % and 30 % was recommended when the CVs were only allowed in MLs. By converting one of the general-purpose lanes (GPLs) to a managed lane, the MPR% could reach 60 %. It was also concluded that restricting CVs to only the CV lane was not recommended. Lastly, the findings suggested that by allowing CVs to use all the lanes in the network (MLs, GPLs and CV lane), the optimal MPR% could reach between 70 % and 100 %. This study has major implications for improving MLs by recommending the optimal CV lane configuration and market penetration rate for each design.

TI Delayed Monocular SLAM Approach Applied to Unmanned Aerial Vehicles
SO PLOS ONE

DT Article
ID SIMULTANEOUS LOCALIZATION; SOUND SOURCE; CAMERA; VISION; NAVIGATION; IMU
AB In recent years, many researchers have addressed the issue of making Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) more and more autonomous. In this context, the state estimation of the vehicle position is a fundamental necessity for any application involving autonomy. However, the problem of position estimation could not be solved in some scenarios, even when a GPS signal is available, for instance, an application requiring performing precision manoeuvres in a complex environment. Therefore, some additional sensory information should be integrated into the system in order to improve accuracy and robustness. In this work, a novel vision-based simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) method with application to unmanned aerial vehicles is proposed. One of the contributions of this work is to design and develop a novel technique for estimating features depth which is based on a stochastic technique of triangulation. In the proposed method the camera is mounted over a servo-controlled gimbal that counteracts the changes in attitude of the quadcopter. Due to the above assumption, the overall problem is simplified and it is focused on the position estimation of the aerial vehicle. Also, the tracking process of visual features is made easier due to the stabilized video. Another contribution of this work is to demonstrate that the integration of very noisy GPS measurements into the system for an initial short period of time is enough to initialize the metric scale. The performance of this proposed method is validated by means of experiments with real data carried out in unstructured outdoor environments. A comparative study shows that, when compared with related methods, the proposed approach performs better in terms of accuracy and computational time.

ID MECHANISM; DESIGN
AB Multimodal unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) are rarely capable of more than two modalities, i.e., flying and walking or flying and perching. However, being able to fly, perch, and walk could further improve their usefulness by expanding their operating envelope. For instance, an aerial robot could fly a long distance, perch in a high place to survey the surroundings, and then walk to avoid obstacles that could potentially inhibit flight. Birds are capable of these three tasks, and so offer a practical example of how a robot might be developed to do the same. In this article, we present a specialized avian-inspired claw design to enable UAVs to perch passively or walk. The key innovation is the combination of a Hoberman linkage leg with Fin Ray claw that uses the weight of the UAV to wrap the claw around a perch, or hyperextend it in the opposite direction to form a curved-up shape for stable terrestrial locomotion. Because the design uses the weight of the vehicle, the underactuated design is lightweight and low power. With the inclusion of talons, the 45-g claws are capable of holding a 700-g UAV to an almost 20 degrees angle on a perch. In scenarios where cluttered environments impede flight and long mission times are required, such a combination of flying, perching, and walking is critical.

AB Electric vehicle (EV) transition and low-cost renewable energy generation are putting power grid under a challenging transformation. Number of power electronics actuators connected to the grid is increasing, and the legacy control methods employed on the grid are not responsive to this growing demand. Thus, the grid integration of EVs and their charging management requires a system-wide solution that is scalable, autonomous, and stable. In this article, we investigate two very complex networks: Internet and power grid in the context of controlling mass-scale EV charging problem. We adapt the well-known additive increase-multiplicative decrease (AIMD) algorithm used in the Internet congestion control to EV charging in a distributed fashion. We develop an adaptation of the Internet's congestion control method for power grid considering the unique grid constraints using a decentralized concept. The advantage of the proposed method lies in its low-cost (memory-less) congestion detection mechanism based on only local voltage measurements. Results show that decentralized AIMD can successfully help flatten the peak loading caused by high EV penetration. To test the algorithm, a distribution grid model is designed based on IEEE 37-node test feeder with realistic load modeling. Finally, the results are presented in comparison with two other control architectures.

AB Path planning is one of the key technologies for autonomous flight of Unmanned Aerial Vehicle. Traditional path planning algorithms have some limitations and deficiencies in the complex and dynamic environment. In this article, we propose a deep reinforcement learning approach for three-dimensional path planning by utilizing the local information and relative distance without global information. UAV can obtain the limited environmental information nearby in the actual scenario with limited sensor capabilities. Therefore, path planning can be formulated as a Partially Observable Markov Decision Process. The recurrent neural network with temporal memory is constructed to address the partial observability problem by extracting crucial information from historical state-action sequences. We develop an action selection strategy that combines the current reward value and the state-action value to reduce the meaningless exploration. In addition, we construct two sample memory pools and propose an adaptive experience replay mechanism based on the frequency of failure. The simulation experiment results show that our method has significant improvements over Deep Q-Network and Deep Recurrent Q-Network in terms of stability and learning efficiency. Our approach successfully plans a reasonable three-dimensional path in the large-scale and complex environment, and has the perfect ability to avoid obstacles.in the unknown environment.

AB This article addresses the design of an optimization-based cooperative path-following control law for multiple robotic vehicles that optimally balances the transient tradeoff between coordination and path-following errors. To this end, we formulate a more general multi-agent framework where each agent is associated with a continuous-time dynamical model, which governs the evolution of its state, and an output equation that is a function of both the state of the agent and a coordination vector. According to a given network topology, each agent can access its state and coordination vector, as well as the coordination vectors of the neighboring agents. In this setup, the goal is to design a distributed control law that steers the output signals to the origin, while simultaneously driving the coordination vectors of the agents of the network to consensus. To solve this, we propose a model predictive control scheme that builds on a pre-existing auxiliary consensus control law to design a performance index that combines the output regulation objective with the consensus objective. Convergence guarantees under which one can solve this coordinated output regulation problem are provided. Numerical simulations display the effectiveness of the proposed scheme applied to a cooperative path following the control problem of a network of 3-D nonholonomic robotic vehicles.

AB Currently traffic management is becoming more important to achieve the goal of sustainable transport, and a good traffic model can describe the traffic behavior efficiently. The traffic models can be classified based on level of details as submicroscopic-, microscopic-, mesoscopic-, and macroscopic-level models. In this paper, we provide a review of the four types of models (submicro, micro, meso, and macro) and then propose a multilevel model of traffic, which combines submicroscopic, microscopic, and macroscopic levels of traffic model. In this work, we do not consider the mesoscopic-level model. At the submicroscopic level, we develop a bond graph model of a four-wheeled vehicle considering the longitudinal, lateral, yaw, and actuator dynamics. At the microscopic level, we develop a car-following model based on virtual interconnections between the submicroscopic bond graph models of vehicles. Then, at the macroscopic level, we deduce macroscopic variables (average speed, density, and flow) from the submicroscopic and microscopic models. Having a multilevel model of traffic allows combining two properties of modeling simulation, one in real-time mode at microscopic and submicroscopic levels and the other at offline mode at macroscopic level. Thus, the whole supervision of the road traffic can be performed. Finally, the multilevel model of traffic is validated on a real-time simulator of vehicle dynamics, based on experimental measurements acquired from intelligent autonomous vehicles (IAVs). In addition, real experiments on IAVs are performed to validate the model.

AB As the concurrent use of multiple autonomous vehicles ill ocean missions grows, systematic control for their coordinated operation is becoming a necessity. Many ocean vehicles, especially those used in longer-range missions, possess limited operating speeds and are thus sensitive to ocean currents. Yet, the effect of currents on their trajectories is ignored by many coordination techniques. To address this issue, we first derive a rigorous level-set methodology for distance-based coordination of vehicles operating in minimum time within strong and dynamic ocean currents. The new methodology integrates ocean modeling, time-optimal level-sets and optimization schemes to predict the ocean currents, the short-term reachability sets, and the optimal headings for the desired coordination. Schemes are developed for dynamic formation control, where multiple vehicles achieve and maintain a given geometric pattern as they carry out theft missions. To do so, a new score function that is suitable for regular polygon formations is obtained. Secondly, we obtain an efficient, non-intrusive technique for level-set-based time-optimal path planning in the presence of moving obstacles. The results are time-optimal path forecasts that rigorously avoid moving obstacles and sustain the desired coordination. They are exemplified and investigated for a variety of simulated ocean flows. A wind-driven double-gyre flow is used to study time-optimal dynamic formation control. Currents exiting an idealized strait or estuary are employed to explore dynamic obstacle avoidance. Finally, results are analyzed for the complex geometry and multi-scale ocean flows of the Philippine Archipelago. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB As transport automation technology continues to emerge, there is a need to engage in the questions of its governing-to find a balance between unreflective enablement and rigid control. An increasing body of literature has begun to address the topic, but only a few studies have examined discourse and culture as central components of the related governance processes. This article aims to analyse the discourse surrounding self-driving vehicles in the Finnish context by drawing from the concept of sociotechnical imaginaries. The critical discourse analysis framework is applied to study a comprehensive set of documents published by Finnish national-level governmental bodies from 2013 to 2020. The analysis identifies four imagined ways of implementing self-driving vehicles into the Finnish transport system and a large set of mostly positive anticipated implications. Moreover, the analysis illustrates the transport automation imaginary's cultural and spatial detachment, most obvious in the lack of detail and the disconnection between the imagined implementations and the anticipated implications. The findings are convergent with findings from other governance contexts, where discourse has been largely characterised by an unjustified optimism and strong determinism related to the wedlock with the automobility regime. If left unaddressed, such lack of reflectivity will not just lead to a plethora of undesired implications for Finnish society at large but will also signify a failure in developing an adaptive governance culture needed to face challenges of the 21st century.

AB Time-to-collision (TTC) index has been extensively utilized to evaluate rear-end collision risks, but few studies have focused on the special transition process that vehicles change from a safe to a dangerous situation. This study conducts an in-depth analysis of the transition condition of rear-end collisions. Realistic vehicle trajectory data were extracted from the Federal Highway Administration's Next Generation Simulation (NGSIM) datasets. The TTC index was utilized to pinpoint dangerous and transition conditions. A total of 13 types of transition conditions were categorized and a novel indicator, the derivative of TTC (TTCD), is proposed to evaluate changing rate of TTCs. Three types of TTCDs, corresponding to different time point or interval, were further analyzed based on developed regression models. The results indicate that: (1) although theoretically there are a total of 13 types of transition conditions, three types are dominant in practice; (2) the TTCD (t(0)) values at transition start points are significantly smaller than the TTCD (t(1)) at end points and the average TTCD (t(0), t(1)), which indicates the quickest change of TTC values, while the TTCD (t(1)) has the slowest changes of TTC values; and (3) the following vehicle's speed and acceleration rate, and speed difference and acceleration difference between two vehicles have significant effects on TTCDs. The influences are more remarkable of TTCD (t(0)) than those of TTCD (t(1)), and the TTCD (t(0), t(1)) always shows the average characteristic. Lastly, corresponding countermeasures are discussed based on findings above.

AB We performed a simultaneous survey of self-potential and plume turbidity using an autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) above the Sunrise deposit in the Myojin Knoll caldera of the Izu-Ogasawara arc. A 10-m-long electrode rod, on which five electrodes referenced with a common electrode were mounted, was connected at the tail of an AUV. The survey was conducted at a typical speed of 2 knots, covering the 1500 m x 1500 m area with a typical spacing of survey lines of 100 m. With AUV altitude of 100 m above the seafloor, a negative self-potential anomaly of a few millivolts was observed. The self-potential anomaly was found to spread 300 m x 300 m. The self-potential is probably attributable to the geo-battery mechanism: electric current is generated by redox reactions occurring around an ore body crossing a redox contrast. Assuming that the source of the self-potential is an electric current dipole, we can image a southward-dipping dipole with the moment of approximately 10(3 )A m, approx. 30 m below the southern part of the ore deposit. Anomalies of turbidity, which are correlated to ambient temperature and which are signatures of discharged hydrothermal fluids, were distributed more broadly than the self-potential. Some turbidity anomalies were found without self-potential anomalies. They were probably transported by the ocean current. Spatial decoupling between the self-potential and turbidity anomalies suggests that the direct contribution of hydrothermal fluids to the self-potential anomalies is probably a secondary effect. The survey altitude of 100 m and the survey speed of 2 knots in the present study represent practical limitations for the self-potential survey when active hydrothermal fields are targeted. We have observed that the self-potential method responds exclusively to the presence of hydrothermal ore deposits. This behavior differs from other methods for exploring seafloor hydrothermal ore deposits: The geomagnetic method responds not only to ore deposits but also to volcanic bodies. The plume method can detect remote hydrothermal activities, but the source locations are not necessarily specified. The self-potential method is useful as an excellent exploration tool, particularly for initial surveys.

AB Achieving accurate path tracking and vehicle stability control for four-wheel independent drive electric trucks under complex driving conditions, such as high speed and low adhesion, remains a major challenge in current research. Poor coordination control may cause the vehicle to deviate from its intended path and become unstable. To address this issue, this article proposes a coordinated control strategy consisting of a three-layer control framework. In the upper layer controller design, establish a linear quadratic regulator (LQR) path tracking controller to ensure precise steering control by eliminating steady-state errors through feedforward control. The middle layer controller utilizes the fractional order sliding mode control (FOSMC) yaw moment controller to calculate the additional yaw moment based on the steering angle of the upper input, utilizing the error of yaw rate and sideslip angle as the state variable. To collectively optimize the control system, establish a coordinated optimization objective function and utilize the hybrid genetic-particle swarm optimization algorithm (GA-PSO) to optimize the weight coefficient of LQR and sliding mode parameters of FOSMC, effectively improving the performance of the controller. In the lower layer torque distribution controller, use the quadratic programming method to achieve real-time optimal torque distribution based on tire utilization, which improves vehicle stability control. Through simulations conducted under four different working conditions, the proposed control scheme demonstrates a 15.54% to 23.17% improvement in tracking performance and a 10.83% to 23.88% optimization in vehicle driving stability compared to other control methods. This scheme provides a theoretical reference for path tracking and stability control in four-wheel independent drive electric trucks.

AB This paper describes and evaluates a concurrent mapping and localization (CML) algorithm suitable for localizing an autonomous underwater vehicle. The proposed CML algorithm uses a sidescan sonar to sense the environment. The returns from the sonar are used to detect landmarks in the vehicle's vicinity. These landmarks are used, in conjunction with a vehicle model, by the CML algorithm to concurrently build an absolute map of the environment and to localize the vehicle in absolute coordinates. As the vehicle moves forward, the areas covered by a forward-look sonar overlap, whereas little or no overlap occurs when using sidescan sonar. It has been demonstrated that numerous reobservations by a forward-look sonar of the landmarks can be used to perform CML. Multipass missions, such as sets of parallel and regularly spaced linear tracks, allow a few reobservations of each landmark with sidescan sonar. An evaluation of the CML algorithm using sidescan sonar is made on this type of trajectory. The estimated trajectory provided by the CML algorithm shows significant jerks in the positions and heading brought about by the corrections that occur when a landmark is reobserved. Thus, this trajectory is not useful to mosaic the sea bed. This paper proposes the implementation of an optimal smoother on the CML solution. A forward stochastic map is used in conjunction with a backward Rauch-Tting-Striebel filter to provide the smoothed trajectory. This paper presents simulation and real results and shows that the smoothed CML solution helps to produce a more accurate navigation solution and a smooth navigation trajectory. This paper also shows that the qualitative value of the mosaics produced using CML is far superior to those that do not use it.

AB With the pioneering introduction of autonomous vehicles, system failures while driving from A to B are more likely to occur. In such scenarios one option is to hand back the control to the human driver, if someone suitable is inside the vehicle. Teleoperated Driving, the remote control of vehicles by human operators, can be a solution to scenarios without suitable drivers inside. A video stream is used to provide operators with an overview of the vehicle's environment and support for a safe remote control. By utilizing cellular networks as wireless communication medium for Teleoperated Driving, the available bandwidth is a limiting factor. This paper introduces a multi-step approach to lower the bandwidth requirements, which is achieved by initially splitting the single video stream into two parts: One part conveying the original video information restricted to important objects and the remainder, to which various filters are applied. Results show that this approach can lead to a decreased bandwidth consumption. These results are validated with a user study, where participants had to rate the perceived video quality and the driveability for the different combinations. This user study shows that, for every investigated scenario, at least one combination of parameters (applied filters) was rated driveable. Finally, the results are used to sketch a system that infers specific combinations of parameters based on the environmental conditions and the available bitrate.

AB In this article, we aim to address the problem of cooperative learning from adaptive neural formation control for a group of underactuated unmanned surface vehicles (USVs) with modeling uncertainties, where the formation errors are subject to prescribed performance constraints. A coordinate transformation is introduced to overcome the difficulties caused by off-diagonal system matrix. Under limited communication range, the connectivity preservation as well as collision avoidance among the initial connected vehicles are achieved by guaranteeing the intervehicle distances converge to small neighborhoods of the desired distance. Meanwhile, the convergence of bearing angles to small neighborhoods of desired bearing angles avoids the possible controller singularity problem arising from underactuation and achieves the predefined formation shape. The prescribed performance constraints are imposed on the formation errors to improve the transient and steady-state performances. Using the deterministic learning theory, the modeling uncertainties are locally accurately identified/learned by the localized radial basis function (RBF) neural networks (NNs) along the union of all vehicles' state orbits in a cooperative way. The learned knowledge is stored in constant RBF networks and is reutilized to develop experience-based formation control protocol to improve the control performance including reduction of the computational burden. Simulations are carried out to verify the effectiveness of the proposed formation controllers.

AB The Blended winged-body (BWB) shape of underwater glider (UG) has its unique advantages and gained remarkable attention in recent research. As BWB UG is autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV), the assessment of external disturbances and their effect on UG motion characteristics is of significant importance in order to accurately predict UG dynamics and navigation along the glide path. Being buoyancy driven slow speed vehicles, Waves play dominant role in disturbing UG dynamics near ocean surface, therefore better control systems and vehicle design can be achieved by studying of influence of wave parameters on the motion dynamics of the UG. Present work evaluates the underwater effects of wave forces on motion characteristics of BWB UG. The Wave forces acting on BWB UG are calculated in time domain by panel method. Series of simulations were performed considering Airy wave theory and head sea conditions. MATLAB curve fitting technique is used to derive analytical formulations for wave forces and moments on BWB UG obtained by panel method. The BWB hydrodynamics coefficients are calculated using Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD). The fourth order Runge-Kutta method is used to solve motion dynamics model coupled with wave force analytical formulation in time domain. It is observed that the results of numerical simulations are reasonable and the wave force of different frequencies and amplitudes affect the UG stability and navigation along the glide path.

AB This paper presents elite group-based evolutionary algorithms (EGEA) for adaptive ocean sampling using multiple unmanned marine vehicles (UMVs). The EGEA integrate a group-based framework and elitist selection methods into evolutionary path planner, which combine main advantages of these two techniques.The group-based framework allows each offspring individual of evolutionary algorithm to generate its own group of new solutions with a certain probability. Two elitist selection methods, herein referred to as group individual elitist selection (GIES) and whole population elitist selection (WPES), are proposed to facilitate selecting preferable solutions to be passed on to the next generation in the procedure of evolutionary algorithms. The EGEA path planners based on simulated annealing algorithm (SA) and particle swarm optimization (PSO) are tested to find trajectories for multiple UMVs to collect maximum interested ocean information from regions under investigation. The mixed integer linear programming (MILP) is also described and evaluated with the proposed EGEA for solving the adaptive sampling problem. Simulation results show that the whole elite group-based simulated annealing algorithm (WEGSA) is able to generate trajectories with more information gain from regions of high scientific interest with constrained energy of multiple UMVs than other techniques. Monte Carlo simulations demonstrate the inherent robustness and superiority of the proposed planner based on the EGEA in comparison with other techniques.

DE Acoustic communication mixed integer nonlinear programming (MINPL);

ID ROBOTS
AB Mixed integer nonlinear programming (MINLP) techniques are increasingly used to address challenging problems in robotics, especially multivehicle motion planning (MVMP). The main contribution of this paper is a discrete time, distributed receding horizon mixed integer nonlinear programming (RH-MINLP) formulation of the underwater multivehicle path coordination problem with constraints on vehicle kinematics, dynamics, collision avoidance, and acoustic communication connectivity, and the application of state-of-the-art MINLP solution techniques. Each vehicle robot starts from a fixed start point and moves toward a goal point along a fixed path, so as to avoid collisions and remain in communication connectivity with other robots. Acoustic communication connectivity constraints account for the attenuation due to signal propagation and delays arising from multipath propagation in noisy communication environments, and specify intervehicle connectivity in terms of a signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) threshold. Scenarios including up to four robots are simulated to demonstrate: 1) the effect of communication connectivity requirements on robot velocity profiles; and 2) the dependence of the solution computation time on the communication connectivity requirement. Typically the optimization improved connectivity at no appreciable cost in journey time (as measured by the arrival time of the last arriving robot). Results also demonstrate the responsive nature of robot trajectories to safety requirements with collision avoidance being achieved at all times despite overlapping and intersecting paths.

AB The performance of four automatically-generated path planning behaviors is evaluated through field-testing. Experiments were conducted using a model-referenced trajectory planner, which was implemented on unmanned surface vehicles (USVs) of different size, thrust, and maneuverability characteristics. The planner combines a local search based on the Velocity Obstacles (VO) concept with a global, lattice-based search for a dynamically feasible trajectory (determined using models of the nonlinear dynamics, nonholonomic constraints, and low-level control of each system). Multiple low-level USV heading and speed controllers, varying in complexity from proportional control to nonlinear backstepping control, were tested with the planner. High planning performance is achieved by searching within a resolution-adaptive space of the USV's candidate motion goals. Sampling is constrained to ensure that the International Regulations for the Prevention of Collisions at Sea (COLREGs) are followed. Prior to on-water implementation, the system was fine-tuned in simulation. Four automatically-generated USV behaviors were demonstrated in on-water tests within a complex, static obstacle field: 1) Approach (USV approaches a fixed target); 2) Follow (USV approaches a moving target); 3) Single COLREGs-Compliant Crossing (USV approaches a fixed target while avoiding another vessel); and 4) Multiple COLREGs-Compliant Crossings (USV approaches a fixed target while avoiding an interference vessel multiple times).

DE Eddy current sensors (ECSs); hidden Markov models (HMMs); sequential
   Monte Carlo (SMC); train localization
AB Precise localization of rail vehicles is a key element toward the development and deployment of novel train control systems that offer enhanced security and efficiency. Typically, research on train navigation systems approaches this task either by data fusion of an increasing number of onboard sensors or by additional infrastructure installations that are combined with the localization of a global navigation satellite system (GNSS). The former approach is cost intensive and only gradually improves reliability and availability of localization information, whereas the latter approach suffers from the absence of satellite signals in places that are important for railroad applications such as tunnels or railway stations. In contrast, this paper employs a novel single eddy current sensor (ECS) mounted on the rail vehicle that directly pursues observations of the rail on a topological map. The localization task is formulated in a model-based probabilistic framework that enables us to derive signal processing techniques for board-autonomous speed estimation and recognition of particular events such as railroad switches by pattern recognition. In particular, turnouts are detected by Bayesian inference based on hidden Markov models (HMMs). In the final step, position on a topological map is estimated by sequential Monte Carlo sampling that combines speed and event information acquired from the ECS signal. Experiments with simulated and real-world data from an experimental rail vehicle indicate that the proposed system yields position and speed information of high reliability in real time.

AB With the current advances in unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) technologies, aerial vehicles are becoming very attractive for many purposes. However, currently the bottleneck in their adoption is no longer due to architectural and protocol challenges and constraints, but rather to the limited energy that they can rely on. In this article, we design two power resupply schemes under the assumption of a fleet of homogeneous UAVs. Such schemes are designed to minimize the size of the fleet to be devoted to a persistent service (i.e., carried out at all times) of a set of aerial locations. First, we consider the case where the aerial locations to be served are equidistant from an energy supply station. In that scenario, we design a simple scheduling scheme, that we name homogeneous rotating resupply (HoRR), which we prove to be feasible and exact in the sense that it uses the minimum possible number of UAVs to guarantee the permanent coverage of the aerial service locations. Then, we extend that work for the case of nonevenly distributed aerial locations. In this new scenario, we demonstrate that the problem becomes NP-hard, and design a lightweight scheduling scheme, partitioned heterogeneous rotating resupply (PHeRR), which extends the operation of HoRR to the heterogeneous case. Through numerical analysis, we show that PHeRR provides near-exact resupply schedules.

AB Common vulnerabilities in typical intelligent cyber-physical systems such as unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) can be easily exploited by cyber attackers to cause serious accidents and harm. For successful UAV operations, security against cyber attacks is imperative. In this paper, we propose a modified sliding innovation sequences (MSIS) detector, based on the extended Kalman filter optimal state estimation, for a dynamic quadrotor system to detect cyber attacks inflicted on both its actuators and sensors in real time. These cyber attacks include random attacks, false data injection (FDI) attacks and denial-of-service (DoS) attacks. The MSIS detector computes the operator norm of the normalized innovation (residual) sequence within a sliding time window and triggers the alarm if the value is above the preset threshold. For a quadrotor undergoing rapid turns in a complex trajectory, the detector observes a reduced false alarm rate as compared to other state estimation-based detectors. To address the initial estimation error problem, we implement an iteration procedure to initiate and calibrate the detector. By evaluating the sample covariance of the normalized innovation sequence, the MSIS detector has the capability to isolate cyber attacks. Finally, simulation results of a quadrotor in a periodic, complex trajectory flight are provided to verify the effectiveness of the MSIS detection and isolation method.

AB Traffic congestion is one of the biggest challenges around the world, resulting in multiple harmful consequences such as air pollution, road fatalities, and traffic jams. Thus, it is a vital need to develop preventive mechanisms that allow better traffic management and alleviate the burden put on the transport network. Vehicle-to-anything (V2X) communication is gaining massive research interest as a promising solution to mobility challenges. This technology will enable vehicles and the infrastructure to form a distributed network constantly exchanging traffic information in real-time. The availability of timely information can help road users make optimal choices and enable effective autonomous traffic control. Therefore, to avoid traffic congestion, mobility models need to be established to study vehicular dynamics and to forecast future traffic conditions. The main goal of this study is to develop a traffic model based on Markov chain to tackle the congestion issue in a highway environment. Based on traffic data collected from vehicles through V2X technology, the model studies the evolution of traffic flow along a multiple lane divided highway and locally calculates estimates of the expected number of vehicles traveling on a highway segment. Performance measures are then inferred to detect possible congestion and then prevent it from happening. The numerical results presented in this study validate the model accuracy and show its ability to reproduce the fundamental mobility aspects in a highway environment.

AB In this study, the time-varying formation control problem for the second-order discrete-time multi-agent systems is investigated, where both the non-uniform communication time-delays and switching topology are taken into account. A linear discrete-time formation protocol is developed based on the neighbouring relative position and velocity information. Using the state transformation method and properties of the stochastic matrix, the formation feasibility condition is given and sufficient conditions for the discrete-time multi-agent systems to accomplish the time-varying formation are established. An unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) formation experiment platform is constructed. Using four quadrotor UAVs, UAV formation flying experiments are performed to verify the effectiveness and reliability of the discrete-time formation protocol. The experimental results show that the theoretical results can be used to deal with the time-varying formation control problem for multiple UAVs system with communication delays and switching topology.

AB Manganese crusts (Mn-crusts) are a type of mineral deposit that exists on the surface of seamounts and guyots at depths of >800 m. We have developed a method to efficiently map their distribution using data collected by autonomous underwater vehicles and remotely operated vehicles. Volumetric measurements of Mn-crusts are made using a high-frequency subsurface sonar and a 3-D visual mapping instrument mounted on these vehicles. We developed an algorithm to estimate Mn-crust distribution by combining continuous subsurface thickness measurements with the exposed surface area identified in 3-D maps. This is applied to data collected from three expeditions at Takuyo Daigo seamount at depths of similar to 1400 m. The transects add to similar to 11 km in length with 12 510 m(2) mapped. The results show that 52% of the surveyed area is covered by Mn-crusts with a mean thickness of 69.6 mm. The mean Mn-crust occurrence is 69.6 kg/m(2) with a maximum of 204 kg/m(2) in the mapped region. The results are consistent with estimates made from samples retrieved from the area, showing more detailed distribution patterns and having significantly lower uncertainty bounds for regional-scale Mn-crust inventory estimation.

AB In this paper, the problem of control and fault recovery for a team of autonomous underwater vehicles in the presence of loss of effectiveness (LOE) actuator faults is addressed. Towards this end, two different fault recovery control strategies based on the model predictive control technique as well as the dynamic game theory are proposed and developed. Given the allowable information that can be exchanged among the agents, both centralised and semi-decentralised recovery control schemes are considered and their associated corresponding fault recovery strategies are developed. The proposed active fault recovery control strategies incorporate both the online inaccurate as well as delayed actuator fault estimates to reconfigure the nominal (healthy state) controllers. The effectiveness of the proposed semi-decentralised fault recovery control schemes is quantitatively investigated through extensive simulation case studies considering various LOE actuator fault severities in one or more unmanned vehicles as well as fault detection and isolation module imperfections such as fault estimation error and time delays in detecting the faults. The simulation results demonstrate and illustrate that our proposed semi-decentralised recovery control scheme can maintain acceptable degraded tracking and formation keeping performance of both the faulty and healthy agents in the team with lower computational and communication bandwidth requirements as well as lower or fairly close control effort cost as compared to the centralised control recovery scheme.

AB In this paper, a curvature-based control method capable of both forward and backward path following is developed for off-axle hitching trailers. Compared with earlier methods, this controller handles varying path curvature better while also being easy to implement and tune. The controller also addresses two major issues that deteriorate tracking accuracy: limited steering actuation and sideslip. An active speed limiter brakes the vehicle when the steering angle error is too high and therefore allows the same set of control gains to work across a relatively large range of reference speeds without significantly increasing lateral error or losing stability, which further simplifies controller tuning. An extended Kalman filter (EKF) sideslip estimator is designed to allow sideslip compensation, which considers the varying noise magnitude in GPS measurements caused by varying vehicle speeds so that the braking maneuver will not significantly deteriorate the estimations. To our knowledge, this paper presents the first publication of these two algorithms with trailer control. This method is compared with results from two earlier hitch-angle-based control methods in simulation and experiment. The active speed limiter and the EKF are also implemented on these control methods for fair comparison, during which it is found that the two algorithms can directly work with other control methods and benefit their performance. The results show the curvature- based controller provides better maneuverability and reduced tracking error.

AB The routing and scheduling for trucks and vans in an urban road network depends critically on the state of the road network. Trucks and vans impose significant costs on other road users and the environment, so improved routing and scheduling benefits more than just the logistics industry. However, small and medium size enterprises (SMEs) in the logistics business cannot justify investment in planning systems. In this paper, an autonomous routing and scheduling system which is available to SMEs is proposed and the efficiency of the system is investigated. The proposed system accumulates vehicle location data in a central server and uses it to generate traffic information. Test simulations using a grid network demonstrate the effects of utilizing and sharing vehicle location data on delivery efficiency. The simulation results show that the improvement of delivery efficiency is mainly due to the reduction of penalty cost for early and late arrival at the customer location. It is also shown that the system leads to the buffer effect from variations in traffic conditions on delivery cost and this effect is enhanced by taking travel time uncertainty into consideration. It is further shown that the presence of measurement periods with insufficient data results in unreliable routing and scheduling. For a reliable system, data collection over a wider area is required rather than dense data in a subset of links.

AB In this paper we propose a novel reduced-order car model and show how it can be used for parameter fitting and dynamic analysis of complex car vehicles. The proposed two-track model consists of a rigid body interacting with the ground at four contact points and including tire models and load transfer. The model does not include suspension models, thus keeping a reasonable level of complexity. Load transfer (both longitudinal and lateral) is taken into account by explicitly imposing the holonomic constraints (for contact) and computing the reaction forces of the ground at the four contact points. Since the vehicle interacts with the ground at four contact points, it results in a hyper-static structure so that the reaction forces are not uniquely determined. Using the Principle of Least Work, we obtain a compatibility equation, providing for a unique resolution of the forces. The compatibility equation is parametrized by four strain parameters, one for each contact point. These parameters are related to those of the suspension, and provide a means for accounting for some dynamic aspects of the suspension without introducing additional states (and parameters) into the dynamics. We provide numerical computations validating the proposed model with respect to a multi-body virtual prototype on aggressive maneuvers. (C) 2014 European Control Association.

AB Predicting the future states of surrounding traffic participants and planning a safe, smooth, and socially compliant trajectory accordingly are crucial for autonomous vehicles (AVs). There are two major issues with the current autonomous driving system: the prediction module is often separated from the planning module, and the cost function for planning is hard to specify and tune. To tackle these issues, we propose a differentiable integrated prediction and planning (DIPP) framework that can also learn the cost function from data. Specifically, our framework uses a differentiable nonlinear optimizer as the motion planner, which takes as input the predicted trajectories of surrounding agents given by the neural network and optimizes the trajectory for the AV, enabling all operations to be differentiable, including the cost function weights. The proposed framework is trained on a large-scale real-world driving dataset to imitate human driving trajectories in the entire driving scene and validated in both open-loop and closed-loop manners. The open-loop testing results reveal that the proposed method outperforms the baseline methods across a variety of metrics and delivers planning-centric prediction results, allowing the planning module to output trajectories close to those of human drivers. In closed-loop testing, the proposed method outperforms various baseline methods, showing the ability to handle complex urban driving scenarios and robustness against the distributional shift. Importantly, we find that joint training of planning and prediction modules achieves better performance than planning with a separate trained prediction module in both open-loop and closed-loop tests. Moreover, the ablation study indicates that the learnable components in the framework are essential to ensure planning stability and performance.

AB Power consumption and data processing speed of integrated circuits (ICs) is an increasing concern in many emerging Artificial Intelligence (AI) applications, such as autonomous vehicles and Internet of Things (IoT). Existing state-of-the-art SRAM architectures for AI computing are highly accurate and can provide high throughput. However, these SRAMs have problems that they consume high power and occupy a large area to accommodate complex AI models. A carbon nanotube field-effect transistors (CNFET) device has been reported as a potential candidates for AI devices requiring ultra-low power and high-throughput due to their satisfactory carrier mobility and symmetrical, good subthreshold electrical performance. Based on the CNFET and FinFET device's electrical performance, we propose novel ultra-low power and high-throughput 8T SRAMs to circumvent the power and the throughput issues in Artificial Intelligent (AI) computation for autonomous vehicles. We propose two types of novel 8T SRAMs, P-Latch N-Access (PLNA) 8T SRAM structure and single-ended (SE) 8T SRAM structure, and compare the performance with existing state-of-the-art 8T SRAM architectures in terms of power consumption and speed. In the SRAM circuits of the FinFET and CNFET, higher tube and fin numbers lead to higher operating speed. However, the large number of tubes and fins can lead to larger area and more power consumption. Therefore, we optimize the area by reducing the number of tubes and fins without compromising the memory circuit speed and power. Most importantly, the decoupled reading and writing of our new SRAMs cell offers better low-power operation due to the stacking of device in the reading part, as well as achieving better readability and writability, while offering read Static Noise Margin (SNM) free because of isolated reading path, writing path, and greater pull up ratio. In addition, the proposed 8T SRAMs show even better performance in delay and power when we combine them with the collaborated voltage sense amplifier and independent read component. The proposed PLNA 8T SRAM can save 96%, while the proposed SE 8T SRAM saves around 99% in writing power consumption compared with the existing state-of-the-art 8T SRAM in FinFET model, as well as 99% for writing operation in CNFET model.

AB Concerning autonomous driving, lane-changing (LC) is essential, particularly within complicated dynamic settings. It is a challenging task to model LC since driving behavior is complicated and uncertain. The present study adopts a dual-layer feed-forward backpropagation neural network involving sigmoid hidden neurons and linear output neurons for evaluating intrinsic LC complexity. Furthermore, the estimation and validation of the model were performed by large-scale trajectory data. Empirical LC data were obtained from the Next Generation Simulation (NGSIM) project for training and testing the neural network-based LC model. The findings revealed that the introduced model could make precise LC predictions of vehicles under small trajectory errors and satisfactory accuracy. The present work assessed LC beginning/endpoints and velocity estimates by analyzing the vehicles around. It was observed that the neural network model yielded almost the same predictions as the observational LC trajectories as well as following vehicle trajectories on the original and target lanes. Furthermore, for LC behavior characteristic validation, the neural network-produced LC gap distributions underwent comparisons to real-life data, demonstrating the characteristics of LC gap distributions not to differ from the real-life LC behavior substantially. Eventually, the introduced neural network-based LC model was compared to a support vector regression-based LC model. It was found that the trajectory predictions of both models were adequately consistent with the observational data and could capture both lateral and longitudinal vehicle movements. In turn, this demonstrates that the neural network and support vector regression models had satisfactory performance. Also, the proposed models were evaluated using new inputs such as speed, gap, and position of the subject vehicle. The analysis findings indicated that the performance of the proposed NN and SVR models was higher than the model with new inputs.

AB The advent of advanced in-vehicle sensors and communication technologies have facilitated the collection of large volume and almost real-time data on vehicles and drivers. Processing and analyzing this data provides unprecedented opportunities to offer remarkable insights and solutions for driving behavior detection. Characterizing driving behavior plays a key role in a variety of research areas such as traffic safety, the development of autonomous driving, and risk assessment. In this research, a novel framework, Multi-scale Space-time TRansformer (MSTR) is proposed for driving behavior detection using multi-modal data, i.e. front view video frames and vehicle signals. In particular, a multi-patch architecture is explored to capture driving scene features generated from different scales. Meanwhile, a Multi-patch Space-time Attention (MSA) module is designed for MSTR to model multi-scale features and capture spatial-temporal correlation simultaneously. Moreover, the extracted vehicle dynamics features are used as auxiliary to improve the robustness of detection, and a customized Cross-Modal Fusion (CMF) module is introduced to integrate these two different modality features efficiently. Finally, we experimentally validate the efficiency of our approach on a naturalistic driving data set containing over 2800 maneuvers recorded. The MSTR achieves state-of-the-art results with a low inference cost when compared to 3D convolutional networks, and it performs superior to a number of Transformer-based models and other advanced detection methods.

DE CAMERA MOVEMENT ERROR ANALYSIS; OPTIMUM IMAGING GEOMETRY; VISION-BASED
   VEHICLE TRACKING
ID NAVIGATION
AB When a camera is used to provide the navigational parameters in autonomous vehicle operations, it is subjected to unexpected movements or vibrations of the mounting platform. This paper presents a framework for analyzing the effect of uncontrollable camera movements on the navigational parameters, in particular on the range and heading angle in vision-based vehicle tracking. The noise introduced by the platform movements is modeled in two ways: camera noise approach and image noise approach. The parameter space of the camera is divided into a controllable subspace consisting of its height and depression angle, and an uncontrollable subspace consisting of the tracked object coordinates and rotation angle errors. A consistent detectable region is then obtained such that the tracked object is always seen by the camera. Based on this region, a reliable region consisting of no singularity points is established so that the range error does not become infinity. The optimum parameters of the controllable subspace with respect to the uncontrollable subspace are found by employing two estimation schemes: (a) The mini-max estimator to provide the worst case effect, and (b) the minimum-mean-square estimator to provide the average or overall effect. From the results obtained, it is shown how an optimum imaging geometry of a monocular vision-based tracking system can be designed in order to satisfy prescribed levels of range and heading angle errors.

AB Currently, research on automated vehicles is strongly related to technological advances to achieve a safe, more comfortable driving process in different circumstances. The main achievements are focused mainly on highway and interurban scenarios. The urban environment remains a complex scenario due to the number of decisions to be made in a restrictive context. In this context, one of the main challenges is the automation of the relocation process of car-sharing in urban areas, where the management of the platooning and automatic parking and de-parking maneuvers needs a solution from the decision point of view. In this work, a novel behavioral planner framework based on a Finite State Machine (FSM) is proposed for car-sharing applications in urban environments. The approach considers four basic maneuvers: platoon following, parking, de-parking, and platoon joining. In addition, a basic V2V communication protocol is proposed to manage the platoon. Maneuver execution is achieved by implementing both classical (i.e., PID) and Model-based Predictive Control (i.e., MPC) for the longitudinal and lateral control problems. The proposed behavioral planner was implemented in an urban scenario with several vehicles using the Carla Simulator, demonstrating that the proposed planner can be helpful to solve the car-sharing fleet relocation problem in cities.

AB In this study, virtual inertia control-based vehicle-to-grid (V2G) concept for the secondary load frequency control of AC islanded microgrids (MGs) is presented. Since autonomous modern power grids typically have much smaller inertia in comparison to conventional grids, a very fast and high-performance control plant is necessitated for controlling reserved power plants (e.g., batteries) to overcome any voltage and frequency instability. This issue can be solved by the short-term battery energy storage system, inverter, and proper inertia control technique. Because of the high cost of the battery energy storage system, utilization of controllable loads like electric vehicle (EV) to low-inertia modern power grids is presented for the decreasing of the needed capacity of the energy storage system. Hence, an optimal non-integer model predictive control is applied for the secondary frequency regulation in low-inertia stand-alone MGs with the V2G technology. Since the performance and accuracy of the applied non-integer controller are depended on its parameters' value, a modified heuristic optimization algorithm is proposed for tuning the controller's parameters. In the end, the validity and feasibility of the proposed method are investigated by the model-in-the-loop experimental results.

DT Article
AB In recent years, a series of traffic problems have emerged with continuously increasing traffic. Connected and autonomous vehicles (CAV) technology is considered to be an effective way to relieve these problems. It is believed that buses, trucks, and other special vehicles could be among of the first application areas to promote the development of CAV technology. Because of their features of high emissions of pollutants and high energy consumption, the improvement of environmental benefits for such heavy vehicles as buses is the focus in this research. Therefore, this paper aims to evaluate the impact of automated buses on emissions and energy consumption on urban expressways. To achieve the research objectives in this paper, the established automated buses model is embedded into the simulation platform with VISSIM dynamic link library. Models are developed for emissions and energy consumption calculations based on vehicle-specific power to quantify the environmental impact of automated buses. Two improvement strategies: dedicated managed lane and dedicated bus lane, are designed. Finally, a VISSIM simulation platform based on the Fourth Ring Road in Beijing (Xueyuan Bridge to Haidian Bridge) is built to conduct case studies. The results show that CAV technology in buses can reduce exhaust emissions and save energy. Moreover, the managed lane strategy brings a significant reduction in the emissions and energy consumption of automated buses. These findings can be used for the development of automated bus operational strategies focused on environmental benefits.

AB Mobile edge computing (MEC) is to process, analyse, store and calculate the network data at the edge of the network. When the ground infrastructure is damaged in an emergency, the unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) formation can be rapidly deployed to undertake the task of MEC. However, there are some potential problems to be considered in UAV-enabled MEC, such as the trust among UAVs from different sources and the stability of UAV formation network. In view of the problems existing, this study proposes a blockchain-based architecture to build a system of mutual trust, fairness, openness, and stability in this scenario. Through the implementation of blockchain technology, key data such as device computing capacity, task allocation, and task execution process are recorded openly, transparently, and irrevocably. As multi-party trust is built to reduce the occurrence of fraud, system participants can get a reasonable reward. On this basis, the smart contract is used to ensure that algorithms are accessible to the public, and the sub-blockchain technology improves the stability of the system. In the case study, the simulation results show that the resource consumption and time cost of the proposed scheme is reasonable and feasible.

AB A hybrid systems framework is presented for the analysis and optimal control of an electric vehicle equipped with a seamless dual stage planetary transmission. A feature of special interest is that, due to the perpetual connectedness of the motor to the wheels via the seamless transmission, the mechanical degree of freedom changes during the transition period. These circumstances where autonomous and controlled state jumps at the switching instants are accompanied by changes in the dimension of the state space are reflected in the definition of hybrid systems and the corresponding statement of the Hybrid Minimum Principle (HMP). Furthermore, the state-dependent motor torque constraints which impose mixed input-state constraints are converted to state independent input constraints via a change of variables and the introduction of auxiliary discrete states. Optimal control problems for the minimization of acceleration duration and the minimization of energy consumption for the acceleration task are formulated within the presented framework and simulation results are presented for the optimal control inputs and the optimal gear changing instants for reaching the speed of 100 km/hr from the stationary initial condition. A phenomenon of note that appears in the dynamical evolution of the vehicle is the presence of power regeneration as a part of the acceleration task for the minimization of the energy consumption.

ID OPTIMIZATION
AB Vertical take-off and landing (VTOL) aircraft have become important aerial vehicles for various sectors, such as security, health, and commercial sectors. These vehicles are capable of operating in different flight modes, allowing for the covering of most flight requirements in most environments. A tail-sitter aircraft is a type of VTOL vehicle that has the ability to take off and land vertically on it elevators (its tail) or on some rigid support element that extends behind the trailing edge. Most of the tail-sitter aircraft are designed with a fixed-wing adaptation rather than having their own design. The design of the tail-sitter carried out in this work had the particularity of not being an adaptation of a quad-rotor system in a commercial swept-wing aircraft, but, rather, was made from its own geometry in a twin-rotor configuration. The design was performed using ANSYS SpaceClaim CAD software, and a numerical analysis of the performance was carried out in ANSYS Fluent CFD software. The numerical results were satisfactorily validated with empirical correlations for the calculation of the polar curve, and the performance of the proposed tail-sitter was satisfactory compared to those found in the literature. The results of velocity and pressure contours were obtained for various angles of attack. The force and moment coefficients obtained showed trends similar to those reported in the literature.

   pose estimation
AB Visual odometry plays a crucial role in addressing the challenge of relative localization for autonomous vehicles. However, achieving rapid and accurate pose estimation in complex dynamic driving environments remains a difficult task due to safety requirements. Existing visual odometry algorithms often rely on a pipeline structure with separate modules for feature detection, matching, motion estimation, and bundle adjustment. These algorithms require individual design and fine-tuning, resulting in acceptable but suboptimal results. In this study, we propose a novel measurement system, monocular visual odometry based on a neural network, which extracts features and performs feature matching to estimate poses directly from video sequences. By leveraging the power of neural networks, the proposed system learns effective feature representations automatically, eliminating the need for explicit module adoption. Efficient pose estimation is critical in automated driving systems to meet safety requirements in complex environments. To address this, we employ an optimized model instead of a traditional convolutional neural network, making it suitable for embedded platforms with limited hardware resources. Furthermore, the integration of camera-light detection and ranging (LiDAR) fusion enhances the accuracy of the proposed model while significantly reducing computational costs. Our experimental results demonstrate the improved efficiency and accuracy of the proposed system, highlighting its potential for applications in robotics, autonomous driving, and other domains where low-latency, optimized network models are required.

AB Road user categorization is essential for autonomous driving perception. In challenging traffic situations including unfavorable weather (such as fog, snow, and rain) and dim lighting. There are several kinds of sensors that need to be researched in order to achieve the precision and resilience that autonomous systems demand. Currently, to create a depiction of the environment surrounding the vehicle, principally cameras and laser scanners (LiDAR) are commissioned. Despite their enticing qualities, Radar sensors are currently underutilized for autonomous driving, even though, they have been employed in the automobile industry for a long time. Radar's ability to measure the relative speed of obstacles and to operate even in adverse weather conditions makes it a front line contender for road user detection. This study proposes F-ROADNET, a multi-object classification method for vulnerable road users based on raw Radar data. The model is trained on Range Angle and Range Doppler maps based on a late fusion architecture. F-ROADNET has a detection accuracy of 99.01%, precision of 99.3% and recall of 99% on the CARRADA dataset and detection accuracy of 91.62%, precision of 87.2% and recall of 90.2% on the RADDet dataset. The findings exhibit that F-ROADNET outperforms established methods in terms of average precision.

AB Lunar exploration has become increasingly popular, and lunar habitation research must be a core focus during the exploration of the Moon. The lunar habitation research must mainly include architectural and structural designs built using suitable material-forming technology and construction equipment. To address these issues, Chinese Super Mason (CSM) was proposed. This technology is an autonomous robotic construction system that is capable of automated assembling on-site prefabricated multistructural bricks and arched segments, The compound fabrication system was composed of a six-axis robotic manipulator and a dry mixed autoclaving fabricator carried on an autonomous-limbed vehicle platform. The Xuanwu Station for the lunar habitation conceptual design was developed and intended for erection by the CSM. A case study was conducted in a 2.8 m-long, 0.8 m-wide, and 1.1 m-high open arched-formwork structure fabricated within 8.5 h on the Earth. In addition, the Xuanwu Station was evaluated using finite element analysis software considering the temperature, air pressure, and other special environments on the Moon. The reliabilities and limitations of the CSM method were analyzed. Finally, the applications of the CSM in the extreme environment of the Earth and several improvements of the experimental equipment were discussed along with the proposed future applications for autonomous construction.

ID LAST-MILE DELIVERIES; VEHICLES; IMPACT
AB Self-driving technology is on the verge of commercialization and is expected to be utilized in delivery services. At the same time, low efficiency and physical limitations of last mile robots (especially for non-standardized cargo, stairs, etc.) are being pointed out. In addition, as leading overseas companies design robots to complete delivery through interaction with the recipient, it may be difficult to implement the robots in delivery environments like South Korea, where most parcels are not delivered face-to-face. Therefore, this study considers a parcel delivery model in which a person, not a robot, is on-board an autonomous truck for door-to-door deliveries. This study takes three expected effects of a self-driving vehicle into consideration: (i) reduced travel time, owing to alleviation of traffic congestion; (ii) reduced service time, owing to relaxed parking restrictions; and (iii) benefits from en route preparation (planning and collecting in advance of arrival) that can be realized when a person is not required in the driver's seat. The findings from a case study conducted in Seoul indicate that advanced self-driving capabilities and en route preparation can potentially lead to a doubling of the delivery capacity at a terminal, along with a reduction of over 40% in operating costs per box. As suggested in this study, the en route preparation activities are verified to bring benefits.

ID MODEL-PREDICTIVE CONTROL
AB Active co-optimization of future speed profiles together with powertrain control is the optimal solution to further exploiting the energy benefit of electric vehicles (EVs) in real-world operation. However, with uncertainties in driving conditions and concerns about driving safety, speed planning results are cautious and with frequent speed variations, which deteriorates the energy economy of EVs in turn. To comprehensively optimize the energy economy and driving safety of EVs in a stochastic driving environment, this article develops a chance constraint model predictive control (CC-MPC) for co-optimizing the speed planning and powertrain control, which forms an advanced energy management method. To handle the instantaneous disturbance, a coordinated hierarchical method (CHM) is engineered for solving the CC-MPC. As suggested by simulation, the driving safety (measured by success rate) can be increased to 81% with the CC-MPC, which realizes a 62% improvement compared with situations without CC-MPC. Moreover, the proposed CC-MPC significantly mitigates the conflict between driving safety and the energy economy, and the worst deterioration of the energy economy is only 9.3%. Sacrificing merely 2.1% sub-optimality, CHM removes 86% computation loads, and the median of CPU time ismerely 0.58s at each computation step (control interval 1s), which makes the CC-MPC promising for online implementation.

AB In this paper, we investigate the performance of a mixed radio-frequency-underwater wireless optical communication (RF-UWOC) system where an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV), as a low-altitude mobile aerial base station, transmits information to an autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) through a fixed-gain amplify-and-forward (AF) or decode-and-forward (DF) relay. The analysis accounts for the main factors that affect the system performance, such as the UAV height, air bubbles, temperature gradient, water salinity variations, detection techniques, and pointing errors. Employing the fixed-gain AF and DF relays, expressions for some key performance metrics are derived, e.g., outage probability (OP), average bit error rate (ABER), and average channel capacity. Moreover, in order to get further insights, asymptotic analyses for the OP and ABER are also carried out. Additionally, for the two relaying systems, we derive analytical expressions for the optimal UAV altitude that minimizes the OP. Simulation results show that the UAV altitude influences the system performance and there is an optimal altitude which ensures a minimum OP. Furthermore, it is demonstrated that the diversity order of the fixed-gain AF relaying depends on the RF link and pointing errors, while the diversity order of the DF relaying depends on the detection techniques and pointing errors.

AB Unmanned Surface Vehicles (USVs) are increasingly used for ocean missions, which typically require long duration of operations under strict energy constraints. Consequently, there is an increased interest in energy efficient path planning for USVs. This work proposes a novel energy efficient path planning algorithm to address the challenges with the presence of spatially-temporally variant sea current and complex geographic map data, by integrating the following algorithms, namely Voronoi roadmap, Dijkstra's searching, coastline expanding and genetic algorithm (GA). The selection, crossover and mutation operators are employed as part of the GA algorithm. The dividing, smoothing and exchanging operators are proposed to improve the quality of the path and adapt to the Voronoi-Visibility roadmap. The Global Self-Consistent Hierarchical High-Resolution Shorelines dataset and historical sea current dataset are applied to demonstrate the flexibility and practicability of the proposed algorithm. To evaluate the performance, the Voronoi-GA energy efficient algorithm and Voronoi-Visibility energy efficient path re-planning algorithm are also implemented to provide the baseline for comparison. The proposed algorithm generates the most energy efficient paths in ten USV missions, while keeping a configurable clearance from the coastlines. The practicability and scalability of this algorithm is also demonstrated by analysing the computational time in these ten missions.

TI Drivers' Speeding Behavior on Expressway Curves: Exploring the Effect of
   Curve Radius and Desired Speed
SO TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH RECORD
LA English
DT Article
ID OPERATING SPEED; LOCOMOTION; VEHICLE
AB Speed profiles can be considered as a key input for assessing safety, comfort and efficiency of highway or expressway segments. Therefore, understanding drivers' speeding behavior, particularly on expressway curve sections, is important. Most previous studies have modeled the speed on highway curve sections mainly as constant or a piecewise linear profile. Such approaches may not realistically represent the properties of speed and acceleration behavior. Furthermore, mechanisms underlying the speeding behavior through curve sections have not been comprehensively studied. In this study, the minimum-jerk concept, which was originally applied in neuroscience and robotics domains, is utilized to explore drivers' speeding behavior on expressway curve sections. GPS-based naturalistic driving data of vehicles travelling on the Tomei expressway in Japan under free-flow conditions were used to explore the applicability and validity of the proposed approach. How the proposed approach can be used to evaluate the effect of horizontal geometry and desired driving speed on drivers' speeding and acceleration behavior on expressway curve sections is also discussed. The findings of this study could be useful in modeling speed and acceleration choice behaviors on highway curve sections which could potentially be applied in highway design consistency evaluations. Furthermore, the outputs of this study may be useful in other advanced applications, such as modeling and visualizing realistic vehicle movements in driving simulators and virtual reality applications and trajectory planning of autonomous vehicles.

TI Can Data Generated by Connected Vehicles Enhance Safety? Proactive
   Approach to Intersection Safety Management
SO TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH RECORD
LA English
DT Article
AB Traditionally, evaluation of intersection safety has been largely reactive and based on historical crash frequency data. However. the emerging data from connected and autonomous vehicles can complement historical data and help in proactively identifying intersections with high levels of variability in instantaneous driving behaviors before the occurrence of crashes. On the basis of data from the Safety Pilot Model Deployment in Ann Arbor, Michigan, this study developed a unique database that integrated intersection crash and inventory data with more than 65 million real-world basic safety messages logged by 3,000 connected vehicles; this database provided a more complete picture of operations and safely performance at intersections. As a proactive safety measure and a leading indicator of safety, location-based volatility was introduced; this quantified variability in instantaneous driving decisions at intersections. Location-based volatility represented the driving performance of connected-vehicle drivers traveling through a specific intersection. As such, with the use of the coefficient of variation as a standardized measure of relative dispersion, location-based volatility was calculated for 116 intersections in Ann Arbor. Rigorous fixed- and random-parameter Poisson regression models were estimated to quantify relationships between intersection-specific volatilities and crash frequencies. Although exposure-related factors were controlled for, the results provided evidence of a statistically significant (at the 5% level) positive association between intersection-specific volatility and crash frequencies for signalized intersections. The implications of these findings for proactive intersection safety management are discussed.

AB This paper presents the modeling of a four rotor vertical take-off and landing (VTOL) unmanned air vehicle known as the quad rotor aircraft. The paper presents a new model design method for the flight control of an autonomous quad rotor. The paper describes the controller architecture for the quad rotor as well. The dynamic model of the quad-rotor, which is an under actuated aircraft with fixed four pitch angle rotors was described. The Modeling of a quad rotor vehicle is not an easy task because of its complex structure. The aim is to develop a model of the vehicle as realistic as possible. The model is used to design a stable and accurate controller. This paper explains the developments of a PID (proportional-integral-derivative) control method to obtain stability in flying the Quad-rotor flying object. The model has four input forces which are basically the thrust provided by each propeller connected to each rotor with fixed angle. Forward (backward) motion is maintained by increasing (decreasing) speed of front (rear) rotor speed while decreasing (increasing) rear (front) rotor speed simultaneously which means changing the pitch angle. Left and right motion is accomplished by changing roll angle by the same way. The front and rear motors rotate counter-clockwise while other motors rotate clockwise so that the yaw command is derived by increasing (decreasing) counter-clockwise motors speed while decreasing (increasing) clockwise motor speeds.

AB Transportation network companies (TNCs), such as Uber and Lyft, have pledged to fully electrify their ridesourcing vehicle fleets by 2030 in the United States. In this paper, we introduce AgentX, a novel agent-based model built in Julia for simulating ridesourcing services with high geospatial and temporal resolution. We then instantiate this model to estimate the life cycle air pollution, greenhouse gas, and traffic externality benefits and costs of serving rides based on Chicago TNC trip data from 2019 to 2022 with fully electric vehicles. We estimate that electrification reduces life cycle greenhouse gas emissions by 40-45% (9-10 cent per trip) but increases life cycle externalities from criteria air pollutants by 6-11% (1-2 cent per trip) on average across our simulations, which represent demand patterns on weekdays and weekends across seasons during prepandemic, pandemic, and post-vaccination periods. A novel finding of our work, enabled by our high resolution simulation, is that electrification may increase deadheading for TNCs due to additional travel to and from charging stations. This extra vehicle travel increases estimated congestion, crash risk, and noise externalities by 2-3% (2-3 cent per trip). Overall, electrification reduces net external costs to society by 3-11% (5-24 cent per trip), depending on the assumed social cost of carbon.

AB Fog computing has been advocated as an enabling technology for computationally intensive services in smart connected vehicles. Most existing works focus on analyzing the queueing and workload processing latencies associated with fog computing, ignoring the fact that wireless access latency can sometimes dominate the overall latency. This motivates the work in this paper, where we report on a five-month measurement study of the wireless access latency between connected vehicles and a fog/cloud computing system supported by commercially available LTE networks. We propose AdaptiveFog, a novel framework for autonomous and dynamic switching between different LTE networks that implement a fog/cloud infrastructure. AdaptiveFog's main objective is to maximize the service confidence level, defined as the probability that the latency of a given service type is below some threshold. To quantify the performance gap between different LTE networks, we introduce a novel statistical distance metric, called weighted Kantorovich-Rubinstein (K-R) distance. Two scenarios based on finite- and infinite-horizon optimization of short-term and long-term confidence are investigated. For each scenario, a simple threshold policy based on weighted K-R distance is proposed and proved to maximize the latency confidence for smart vehicles. Extensive analysis and simulations are performed based on our latency measurements. Our results show that AdaptiveFog achieves around 30 to 50 percent improvement in the confidence levels of fog and cloud latencies, respectively.

AB Trajectory planning for automated parking has been widely known as more challenging than that for on-road driving due to the nonconvex kinematics, high-dimensional collision-avoidance constraints, and difficulty to determine the global optimum among many local optima. Changes in a dynamic environment easily make a previously planned parking trajectory invalid. Compared with the on-road planners which evade newly emerged obstacles via a nudge or side pass, a parking planner has to replan a completely different trajectory for evasion. A qualified online trajectory replanner should run fast, ensure trajectory continuity, and avoid extra halfway stops. This paper proposes a parallel stitching strategy to fulfill these demands. When the ego vehicle tracks an originally planned parking trajectory online, an evasive trajectory begins to be replanned once a new obstacle is found to block the way. Thereafter, a connective trajectory is planned, the two ends of which are future poses along the original trajectory and the evasive trajectory, respectively. The two ends of the connective trajectory are chosen by greedily evaluating various candidates via parallel computation, which ensures that our replanner runs fast with high solution quality. According to our real-world experiments and simulations, the proposed replanner outperforms the existing ones w.r.t. solution speed and quality. As an interesting feature, our proposed replanner also supports switching to a better homotopy class online.

ID UNMANNED AERIAL VEHICLE; OPTIMIZATION; METHODOLOGY
AB Uncrewed Aerial Vehicles (UAV) constitute a rapidly evolving technology field that is becoming more accessible and capable of supplementing, expanding, and even replacing some traditionally manual bridge inspections. Given the classification of the bridge inspection types as initial, routine, in-depth, damage, special, and fracture critical members, specific UAV mission requirements can be developed, and their suitability for UAV application examined. Results of a review of 23 applications of UAVs in bridge inspections indicate that mission sensor and payload needs dictate the UAV configuration and size, resulting in quadcopter configurations being most suitable for visual camera inspections (43% of visual inspections use quadcopters), and hexa- and octocopter configurations being more suitable for higher payload hyperspectral, multispectral, and Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) inspections (13%). In addition, the number of motors and size of the aircraft are the primary drivers in the cost of the vehicle. 75% of vehicles rely on GPS for navigation, and none of them are capable of contact inspections. Factors that limit the use of UAVs in bridge inspections include the UAV endurance, the capability of navigation in GPS deprived environments, the stability in confined spaces in close proximity to structural elements, and the cost. Current research trends in UAV technologies address some of these limitations, such as obstacle detection and avoidance methods, autonomous flight path planning and optimization, and UAV hardware optimization for specific mission requirements.

AB This paper investigates the safety guaranteed formation control problem for marine surface vehicles (MSVs) with unknown environment disturbances, model uncertainties and output constraints. Initially, by employing the prescribed performance method to ensure that the position tracking errors are converged to the specified range. Then, a new barrier Lyapunov function (BLF) is incorporated into the formation control algorithm to guarantee that the states satisfy the constraints. Furthermore, by using an adaptive radial basis function neural network (RBFNN) to approximate the unknown nonlinear function, an adaptive RBFNN finite-time output constrained formation control law is proposed based on the backstepping design method. On this basis, in order to greatly reduce the update rate of the controller and mechanical loss of the actuator, the relative threshold event-triggered mechanism is introduced into the design of formation controller, the formation controller will be updated if and only if event-triggered conditions are satisfied. Subsequently, the stability analysis demonstrates that all error signals of the closed-loop system can converge into a small neighborhood around zero in finite time under the proposed method, meanwhile the prescribed bounds on the tracking errors will never be violated. And, it is proved by theory that the Zeno behavior can be avoided. Finally, numerical simulation results illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed formation controller.

AB Onboard virtual assistants with the ability to converse with users are gaining favour in supporting effective human-machine interaction to meet safe standards of operation in automated vehicles (AVs). Previous studies have highlighted the need to communicate situation information to effectively support the transfer of control and responsibility of the driving task. This study explores 'interaction types' used for this complex human-machine transaction, by analysing how situation information is conveyed and reciprocated during a transfer of control scenario. Two human drivers alternated control in a bespoke, dual controlled driving simulator with the transfer of control being entirely reliant on verbal communication. Handover dialogues were coded based on speech-act classifications, and a cluster analysis was conducted. Four interaction types were identified for both virtual as-sistants (i.e., agent handing over control) -Supervisor, Information Desk, Interrogator and Converser, and drivers (i.e., agent taking control) -Coordinator, Perceiver, Inquirer and Silent Receiver. Each interaction type provides a framework of characteristics that can be used to define driver requirements and implemented in the design of future virtual assistants to support the driver in maintaining and rebuilding timely situation awareness, whilst ensuring a positive user experience. This study also provides additional insight into the role of dialogue turns and takeover time and provides recommendations for future virtual assistant designs in AVs.

AB Hybrid vehicles (HVs) that equip at least two different energy sources have been proven to be one of effective and promising solutions to mitigate the issues of energy crisis and environmental pollution. For HVs, one of the core supervisory control problems is the power distribution among multiple power sources, and for this problem, energy management strategies (EMSs) have been studied to save energy and extend the service life of HVs. In recent years, with the rapid development of artificial intelligence and computer technologies, learning algorithms have been gradually applied to the EMS field and shortly become a novel research hotspot. Although there are some brief reviews on the learning-based (LB) EMSs for HVs in recent years, a state-of-the-art and thorough review related to the applications of learning algorithms in HV EMSs still lacks. In this paper, learning algorithms applied in HV EMSs are categorized and reviewed in terms of the reinforcement learning algorithms and deep reinforcement learning algorithms. Apart from presenting the recent progress of learning algorithms applied in HV EMSs, advantages and disadvantages of different learning algorithms and LB EMSs are also discussed. Finally, a brief outlook related to the further applications of learning algorithms in HV EMSs, such as the integration towards autonomous driving and intelligent transportation system, is presented.

AB Under the umbrella concept of smart mobility, new transport innovations such as peer-to-peer transport, shared autonomous vehicles, and mobility-as-a-service have been identified for their potential to improve accessibility and bridge the first/last-mile gap between origin, destination, and good quality public transport. Any future mobility plan, nevertheless, will need to appeal to a population reluctant to break habits. This study explores quantitative data collected from major Australian cities to provide a geographic context between attitudes to-wards smart mobility with a particular focus on eight attitudinal factors-i.e., technology, public transport, sharing, multimodality, peer-to-peer transport, smart phones and apps, environmental consciousness, and reducing private vehicle use. The quantitative analysis disclosed that regardless of location, overcoming private vehicle use, user aversion to multimodality, and reluctance to share rides with strangers' presence significant barriers to some smart mobility options. Furthermore, respondents in inner ring areas of cities have more positive views towards public transport, the environment, and smart phones, while the middle/outer ring residents on the contrary have more positive views towards private vehicles. The study findings offer policy insights and potential opportunities and challenges associated with the implementation of smart mobility in urban areas.

AB The gradual development of remote sensing object tracking technology based on unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV) videos has become one of the main research directions in the field of visual tracking. However, due to characteristics of the UAV platform, typical visual tracking algorithms currently applied to natural scenes cannot be used directly. Small-scale objects in UAV remote sensing videos are difficult to detect and have the problem of tracking identity switching. In order to solve these problems, we designed the Swin transformer neck-YOLOX (STN-YOLOX) object detection algorithm as the detection module, and the G-Byte data association method as the tracking module. We then combined the two into a new multiobject tracking algorithm named STN-Track. We used STN-Track to conduct experiments on the UAVDT and VisDrone MOT datasets. The experimental results show that compared with the current state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods, our STN-Track has improved detection and tracking accuracy of small-scale objects and greatly improved identification capabilities for object tracking. Compared with the SOTA ByteTrack algorithm, MOTA of STN-Track can be improved by up to 3.2%, AP(S) can be improved by up to 4.4%, MT can be improved by up to 6.8%, and IDSW can be reduced by up to 28.0%.

However, prior research reveals that several network-level attacks can be performed due to the lack of defense mechanisms in the CAN bus. In this work, we propose CAN Bus Message Attack Detection Framework (CAN-ADF) - a comprehensive anomaly generation, detection, and evaluation system for a CAN bus. In CAN-ADF, not only various anomalies and attack characteristics can be configured but also different detection methods, and visualization frameworks are provided to effectively detect those attacks and anomalies. For the detector, we employ both a rule-based approach crafted from dynamic network traffic characteristics and Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN). For evaluation, we use 7,875,791 in-vehicle CAN packets collected from real cars, KIA Soul and Hyundai Sonata. Our detection algorithm achieves accurate intrusion detection performance, with an average accuracy of 99.45% on CAN datasets, outperforming prior approach. Furthermore, we developed a visualization tool to validate the detection of anomalies by CAN-ADF and to find new patterns in the dataset. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB To ensure better facilitation of vehicular services and improve driving safety in the Internet of Vehicles (IoV), context prediction among vehicles plays a very crucial role. However, as more malicious IoV devices get involved in the network, the context prediction accuracy shared among various servers may degrade severely. Existing schemes have used cryptographic mechanisms to securely and accurately identify malicious devices. However, time and the subsequent delay in identifying and rating the legitimate communicating IoV devices emerge as a crucial issue. Hence, to solve this critical problem, we put forth an efficient and reliable trust framework where trust and context prediction is achieved by Tidal Trust Mechanism (TTM) and Contract Theory (CT). TTM can successfully rate the degree of trust between the devices with a high level of accuracy, whereas CT can verify the context prediction reliably. The proposed mechanism based on TTM and CT ensures that trusted IoV devices are identified with high accuracy and verified reliably. The proposed framework is simulated over real-world data set in MATLAB for various performance metrics, such as altered records, accuracy prediction, response time, and utilities of IoV devices. Simulation results show that the proposed framework provides a significant improvement of approximately 87% in comparison to existing (baseline) approaches while analyzing the accuracy, record alteration, and resource utility among the devices in the network.

AB This brief presents a novel nonlinear adaptive line-of-sight (ALOS) guidance law for path following, compensating for drift forces due to wind, waves, and ocean currents. The ALOS guidance law is proven to have uniform semiglobal exponential stability (USGES) properties during straight-line path following at constant speed. The ALOS guidance law performs similar to the classical integral line-of-sight (ILOS) and adaptive ILOS guidance laws when the sideslip angle is nearly constant. The ALOS guidance law, however, has better tracking capabilities when compensating for rapidly varying sideslip caused by a time-varying disturbance. This is because the integral state of the ALOS guidance law is additive to the unknown sideslip angle (disturbance matching). In contrast, the ILOS guidance laws must compensate sideslip through a saturating arctangent function. The study also includes an input-to-state stable (ISS) reduced-order extended state observer for estimation of the line-of-sight (LOS) crab angle, known as the ELOS guidance law. The performance of the ALOS, ILOS, and ELOS guidance laws is compared by simulating rapid changes in the sideslip angle to stress the critical assumptions of the algorithms. Finally, a case study of the Remus 100 autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) exposed to stochastic ocean currents is used to compare the performance of the ILOS, ALOS, and ELOS algorithms during normal operation.

AB Despite the wide utilization of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), UAV communications are susceptible to eavesdropping due to air-ground line-of-sight channels. Intelligent reflecting surface (IRS) is capable of reconfiguring the propagation environment, and thus is an attractive solution for integrating with UAV to facilitate the security in wireless networks. In this paper, we investigate the secure transmission design for an IRS-assisted UAV network in the presence of an eavesdropper. With the aim at maximizing the average secrecy rate, the trajectory of UAV, the transmit beamforming, and the phase shift of IRS are jointly optimized. To address this sophisticated problem, we decompose it into three sub-problems and resort to an iterative algorithm to solve them alternately. First, we derive the closed-form solution to the active beamforming. Then, with the optimal transmit beamforming, the passive beamforming optimization problem of fractional programming is transformed into corresponding parametric sub-problems. Moreover, the successive convex approximation is applied to deal with the non-convex UAV trajectory optimization problem by reformulating a convex problem which serves as a lower bound for the original one. Simulation results validate the effectiveness of the proposed scheme and the performance improvement achieved by the joint trajectory and beamforming design.

AB Airborne target tracking with vision sensors is one of the indispensable and critical components in unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs). It is critical to calibrate the misalignment angles between the onboard camera and inertial measurement unit (IMU) to improve the accuracy of target tracking. In this article, the observability of boresight misalignment angle estimation using a cooperative target is first analyzed. Based on the observability Gramian, an optimization criterion for maximizing the degree of observability is determined, and the optimal geometries between the UAV and the target are derived. Taking the physical constraints of the UAV into consideration, an online trajectory optimization approach for a UAV with a vision sensor is proposed to achieve in-flight calibration of the misalignment angles. Both numerical simulations and experiments are conducted to validate the proposed method.

AB In recent years, the constraint based correlation filter has shown good performance in unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) tracking, which gains a lot popularity in many intelligence transportation applications. In this work, a distribution-based temporal knowledge driven method is proposed to leverage the temporal translation property in UAV tracking. Instead of focusing on the traditional issues in the correlation filter, we provide a new method of learning parametric distribution on temporal knowledge by Wasserstein distance which is successfully embedded to solve the problem of temporal degeneration in learning process of tracking. Furthermore, we approximate optimal response reasoning with low-rank constraint over response consistency. Furthermore, the proposed method is solved by a simple iterative scheme with alternating direction multiplication ADMM algorithm. We demonstrate the superior tracking performance in several public standard UAV tracking benchmarks compared with state-of-the-art algorithms.

AB Intelligent reflecting surface (IRS) is a promising technology for future communication systems because of its ability to intelligently configure the wireless environment. In this letter, an IRS is equipped on an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) as a passive relay system, in which the UAV serves as a flexible airborne platform. Our aim is to maximize the minimum average transmission rate by jointly optimizing the communication scheduling, phase shift of the IRS, and trajectory of the UAV. The coupling of the optimization variables and non-convexity make this problem hard to solve directly. Therefore, we divide the problem into three subproblems and apply the successive convex approximation (SCA) technique to solve this problem iteratively. Numerical results demonstrate that the minimum transmission rate can be greatly improved by adopting the proposed iterative algorithm, and also confirm the effectiveness of the algorithm.

SO CHINA ECONOMIC REVIEW
LA English
DT Article
DE Gasoline price; Housing price; Transportation cost
ID FUEL PRICES
AB By raising road transportation costs, an increase in gasoline prices should be expected to reduce housing demand in locations further from the central business district (CBD) relative to inner-city locations. This study uses a monthly real estate area dataset for 19 large cities in China over 2010-2018 to investigate the impact of gasoline prices on intra-city spatial differentials in housing prices. The findings suggest that higher gasoline prices on average lead to a relative decline in housing prices in outer suburbs, with a 1% increase in gasoline prices on average leading to a 0.004% relative reduction in home values for every additional kilometer from the CBD. The effect is larger in cities that have higher automobile ownership rates and that are less densely populated. The results are consistent with a conclusion that the rise of electric vehicles, autonomous vehicles, and working from home is likely to contribute to a lowering of geographical price differentials within Chinese cities over time.

AB Wireless communication with unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) has appeared as a promising technique for many application scenarios in future communication networks. In this article, we provide a vision of four UAV-enabled aerial computing (AC) architectures. Specifically, these architectures have attracted growing attention in recent years for decreasing data processing delay and enhancing computation performance via integrating UAVs into AC systems. We first study the benefits and application scenarios of UAV-enabled AC networks. Then we emphasize the efficient computation and communication design of UAV-enabled AC networks by discussing the potential research issues and key design considerations in a comprehensive manner. In addition, extensive case study simulations show the performance superiority of UAV-enabled AC networks over conventional infrastructure-based mobile edge computing networks. To provide an instructive guide for future research work, we discuss the technical challenges and open issues.

AB This paper proposes a new car-following model by considering driver memory and derives a corresponding macroscopic continuum traffic flow model, in which the wrong-way travel phenomenon is not going to occur. We reveal that considering driver memory expressed in term of past traffic condition and headway leads to viscosity parameter in macroscopic traffic flow equation. The viscosity parameter is proportional to a unique quantity, which is featured with two parameters: the delay time of vehicle motion and the kinematic wave velocity at jam density. Linear and nonlinear stability analysis using the method of perturbation is carried out to study traffic characteristics. We showed that macroscopic models derived from microscopic models are more realistic and meaningful than those coming directly from an analogy of Navier-Stokes equations. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V.

AB Transportation electrification is one of the main research areas for the past decade. Electric vehicles (EVs) are taking over the market share of conventional internal combustion engine vehicles. The increasing popularity of EVs results in higher number of charging stations, which have significant effects on the electricity grid. Different charging strat2egies, as well as grid integration methods, are being developed to minimize the adverse effects of EV charging and to strengthen the benefits of EV grid integration. In this paper, a comprehensive review of the current situation of the EV market, standards, charging infrastructure, and the impact of EV charging on the grid is presented. The paper introduces the current EV status, and provides a comprehensive review on important international EV charging and grid interconnection standards. Different infrastructure configurations in terms of control and communication architectures for EV charging are studied and evaluated. The electric power market is studied by considering the participation roles of EV aggregators and individual EV owners, and different optimization and game based algorithms for EV grid integration management are reviewed. The paper specially presents an evaluation on how the future EV development, such as connected vehicles, autonomous driving, and shared mobility, would affect EV grid integration as well as the development of the power grid moves toward future energy Internet and how EVs would affect and benefit the development of the future energy Internet. Finally, the challenges and suggestions for the future development of the EV charging and grid integration infrastructure are evaluated and summarized.

TI A Comparative Study of JASO TP15002-Based Security Risk Assessment
   Methods for Connected Vehicle System Design

DT Article
ID CHALLENGES; PRIVACY
AB In recent years, much attention has been paid to autonomous vehicles and security threats on such vehicles have become an important issue. One of these examples is a command injection issue on a gateway ECU, which was reported in 2016. In order to mitigate these threats, the secure design of connected vehicle systems, which is done at the concept phase during development, has become increasingly important in industry. From this perspective, a security guideline such as JASO TP15002 which specifies two concrete methods, CRSS (CVSS Based Risk Scoring System) and RSMA (Risk Scoring Methodology for Automotive System), was made public in 2015. The latest work on the application of TP15002 to the ITU-T X.1373 standard was published in 2017. However, the risk assessment in this publication seems limited. It is not clear from this publication how systematically the risk assessment task in TP15002 can be performed at the implementation level. Another interesting question is how different methods affect the risk scores of connected vehicle systems. In this paper, we focus on the risk assessment phase in JASO TP15002. For a systematic risk assessment, we introduce an idea of asset container and propose to extend CRSS to a novel RSS (Risk Scoring System), RSS-CVSSv3, by appropriately replacing CVSSv2 vulnerability scoring system on which CRSS is based with CVSSv3. To address the above questions, we perform a comparative study on CRSS, RSMA, and RSS-CVSSv3 for multiple use cases such as a CGW (Central Gateway) and a drone, to examine the efficiency and usefulness of our methods. For this comparative purpose, we devise an interesting approach for the refinement of RSMA to the obstacles in comparing CRSS with RSMA.

AB This study proposes a vision-based motion estimation and target tracking algorithm for a quadrotor unmanned aerial vehicle circumnavigation around a moving mobile target whose velocity is unknown and time varying. In this study, the authors assume that the quadrotor is equipped with onboard downward-looking camera, as a means to determine position of the quadrotor relative to the target. The proposed circumnavigation control algorithm relies essentially on two distinct phases, namely the virtual target tracking and the circumnavigation phase. To prepare for these phases, a predefined sphere, with a desired radius having the moving target position as its centre, is constructed along with a virtual target point that can move on its surface. During the whole tracking procedure, the quadrotor is first commanded to reach the virtual target point located at the projection of the ground vehicle's position onto the surface area of the sphere. When the quadrotor's position and velocity approaches the virtual target point with a given accuracy, the second phase is initiated to provide the quadrotor with more precise guidance to start orbiting at a specific height from level ground around the moving target. In this manner, the virtual target point is given the ability to manoeuvre itself in a circular motion above the moving target. The developed orbit manoeuvre uses an estimate of the moving target's velocity, obtained from a predictor scheme able to achieve velocity estimation as fast as possible.

AB Underwater gliders are winged autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) that can be deployed for months at a time and travel thousands of kilometers. As with any vehicle, different applications impose different mission requirements that impact vehicle design. We investigate the relationship between a glider's geometry and its performance and stability characteristics. Because our aim is to indentify general trends rather that perform a detailed design optimization, we consider a generic glider shape a cylindrical hull with trapezoidal wings. Geometric parameters of interest include the fineness ration of the hull, the wing position and shape, and the position and size of the vertical stabilizer. We describe the reslts of parametric studies for steady wings-level flight, both at minimum glide angle and at maximum horizontal speed, as well as for steady turning flight. We describe the variation in required lung capacity and maximum lift-to-drag ration corresponding to a given vehicle size and speed; we also consider range and endurance, given some initial supply of energy for propulsion. We investigatge how the turning performance vairds with wing and vertical stabilizer configuration. To support this analysis, we consider the glider as an 8-degree-of-freedom mltibody system (a rigid body with a cylindrically actuated internal moving mass) and develop approximate expressions for turning flight in terms of geometry and control parameters. Moving from performance to stability and recognizing that a glider's motion is well described in terms of small perturbations from wings-level equilibrium, we study stability as an eigenvalue problem for a rigid (actuators-fixed) flight vehicle. We present a number of root locus plots in terms of various geometric parameters that illuminate the deisgn tradeoff between stability and control authority.

AB Communication and sensing are two important features of connected and autonomous vehicles (CAVs). In traditional vehicle-mounted devices, communication and sensing modules exist but in an isolated way, resulting in a waste of hardware resources and wireless spectrum. In this paper, to cope with the above inefficiency, we propose a vehicular behavior-aware integrated sensing and communication (VBA-ISAC) beamforming design for the vehicle-mounted transmitter with multiple antennas. In this work, beams are steered based on vehicular behaviors to assist driving and meanwhile provide spectral-efficient uplink data services with the help of a roadside unit (RSU). Specifically, we first predict the area of interest (AoI) to be sensed based on the vehicles' trajectories. Then, we formulate a VBA-ISAC beamforming design problem to sense the AoI while maximizing the spectral efficiency of uplink communications, where a trade-off factor is introduced to balance the communication and sensing performance. A semi-definite relaxation-based beampattern mismatch minimization (SDR-BMM) algorithm is proposed to solve the formulated problem. To reduce the hardware cost and power consumption, we further improve the proposed VBA-ISAC beamforming design by introducing the hybrid analog-digital (HAD) structure. Numerical results verify the effectiveness of VBA-ISAC scheme and show that the proposed beamforming design outperforms the benchmarks in both spectral efficiency and radar beampattern.

AB Connectivity and automation have expanded with the development of autonomous vehicle technology. One of several automotive serial protocols that can be used in a wide range of vehicles is the controller area network (CAN). The growing functionality and connectivity of modern vehicles make them more vulnerable to cyberattacks aimed at vehicular networks. The CAN bus protocol is vulnerable to numerous attacks, as it is lacking security mechanisms by design. It is crucial to design intrusion detection systems (IDS) with high accuracy to detect attacks on the CAN bus. In this paper, we design an effective machine learning-based IDS scheme for binary classification that utilizes eight supervised ML algorithms, along with ensemble classifiers. The scheme achieved a higher effectiveness score in detecting normal and abnormal activities when trained with normal and malicious CAN traffic datasets. Random Forest, Decision Tree, and Xtreme Gradient Boosting classifiers provided the most accurate results. Then we evaluated three ensemble methods, voting, stacking, and bagging, for this classification task. The ensemble classifiers achieved better accuracy than the individual models, since ensemble learning strategies have superior performance through a combination of multiple learning mechanisms. These mechanisms have a varied range of capabilities that improve the prediction reliability while lowering the possibility of classification errors. Our model outperformed the most recent study that used the same dataset, with an accuracy of 0.984.

AB The transport requirements hi modem society are becoming more and more important. Thus, offered transport services need to be more and more advanced mid better designed to meet, users demands. Important cost factors of many goods are transport costs. Therefore, a reduction of costs, a better adjustment of strategies to the demand as well as a better Planning and scheduling of available resources are important for the transport companies. This paper is aimed at modelling and simulation of transport systems, involving a dynamic Pickup mid Delivery problem with Time Windows and capacity constraints (PDPTW). PDPTW is defined by a set of transport requests while should be performed while minimising costs expressed by the number of vehicles, total distance and total travel time. Each request is described by two locations: pickup mid delivery, periods of time when the operations of pickup or delivery can be performed and a load to be transported. The nature of this problem, its distribution mid the possibility of using a lot of autonomous planning modules, lead us to rise a multi-agent, approach. Our approach allows the modeling of entities which do not appear in the classical PDPTW such as company organisation, communication among vehicles, interactions between vehicles and company dispatcher or different strategies of requests acceptation by different vehicles. This paper presents also a software environment and experimentations to validate the proposed approach.

AB We present the design and preliminary results from ocean deployments of Zooglider, a new autonomous zooplankton-sensing glider. Zooglider is a modified Spray glider that includes a low-power camera (Zoocam) with telecentric lens and a custom dual frequency Zonar (200 and 1000 kHz). The Zoocam quantifies zooplankton and marine snow as they flow through a defined volume inside a sampling tunnel. Images are acquired on average every 5 cm from a maximum operating depth of similar to 400 m to the sea surface. Biofouling is mitigated using a dual approach: an ultraviolet light-emitting diode and a mechanical wiper. The Zonar permits differentiation of large and small acoustic backscatterers in larger volumes than can be sampled optically. Other sensors include a pumped conductivity, temperature, and depth unit and chlorophyll a fluorometer. Zooglider enables fully autonomous in situ measurements of mesozooplankton distributions, together with the three-dimensional orientation of organisms and marine snow in relation to other biotic and physical properties of the ocean water column. It is well suited to resolve thin layers and microscale ocean patchiness. Battery capacity supports 50 d of operations. Zooglider includes two-way communications via Iridium, permitting near-real-time transmission of data from each dive profile, as well as interactive instrument control from remote locations for adaptive sampling.

ID POSITION ESTIMATION; RECONSTRUCTION
AB Vision navigation based on scene matching between real-time images and a reference image has many advantages over the commonly used inertial navigation system (INS), such as no cumulative measurement errors for long-endurance flight. Recent developments in vision navigation are mainly used for partial navigation parameters measurements, such as the position and the relative velocity, which cannot meet the requirements of completely autonomous navigation. We present the concept, principle and method of full-parameter vision navigation (FPVN) based on scene matching. The proposed method can obtain the three-dimensional (3D) position and attitude angles of an aircraft by the scene matching for multiple feature points instead of a single point in existing vision navigations. Thus, FPVN can achieve the geodetic position coordinates and attitude angles of the aircraft and then the velocity vector, attitude angular velocity and acceleration can be derived by the time differentials, which provide a full set of navigation parameters for aircrafts and unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs). The method can be combined with the INS and the cumulative errors of the INS can be corrected using the measurements of FPVN rather than satellite navigation systems. The approach provides a completely autonomous and accurate navigation method for long-endurance flight without the help of satellites.

AB Connected and automated vehicles (CAVs) promise to significantly improve road traffic. To a certain extent, this situation is similar to the expectations at the end of the last century about the positive effects that the introduction of Adaptive Cruise Control (ACC) systems would have had on motorway traffic. The parallelism is interesting because ACC equipped vehicles represent the first level of vehicle automation and are now widely available on the market. In this light, studying ACC impacts can help to anticipate potential problems related to its widespread application and to avoid that AVs and CAVs will lead to the same problems.
   Only a few test-campaigns had been carried out studying the ACC impacts under real-world driving conditions in quantitative terms. To bridge this gap, the Joint Research Centre of the European Commission has organized a number of experimental campaigns involving several ACC-equipped vehicles to study different implications of their widespread. In this context, the present paper summarizes the outcomes of a test campaign involving 10 commercially available ACC-equipped vehicles. The test campaign has been executed in two different test-tracks of the ZalaZONE proving ground, in Hungary. The tests have been carried out at low-speeds (30-60 km/h) and have involved platoons of vehicles of different brands and different powertrains, which were tested in a variety of vehicle orders and with different settings of their ACC systems. Test results have been used to derive information about the properties of the different ACC systems, to study their string stability, to study the effect of ACC systems on traffic flow, and to draw inference about the possible implications on energy consumption and traffic safety.
   Results confirm the previous findings in terms of string instability of the ACC and highlight that in the present form, ACC systems will possibly lead to higher energy consumption and introduce new safety risks when their penetration in the fleet increases. However, they also highlight that the materialization of the above findings for AVs depends on the operational logic that manufacturers will adopt during the implementation phase. Therefore, results suggest that functional requirements to guarantee string stability and in general to not disrupt the normal flow of traffic should be introduced both for ACC and for any automated system that will be placed on the market in the future.

AB In the background of autonomous driving at level 3 to level 4, an automated vehicle should own smarter driving brain to face complicated transportation situations. In order to construct a safe automated driving brain under highway conditions, this paper focused on driving motion decision in order to generate the control target parameters in the time domain. The coordinate transformation was proposed to convert the complicated curving road to local straight coordinate or inverse, then a receding horizon programming based on mixed logic dynamic constraints was established to formulate a safe-guaranteed optimization model, where the objectives were assigned by driver's steering wheel and speed control, as well as the lateral lane tracking performance. Based on the motion optimization model, the links to the driver characteristics were analyzed, and the weight for each objective in optimization model was tuned by driver statistical features, in which the entropy weights, variance weights, and unique weights are compared. The simulation based on the simulating driving scenario was developed and the optimization results validated the safety and feasibility of motion decision and with the help of k-nearest neighbors (KNN) classifier, the clustering prediction results qualitatively revealed the proposed weights tuning methods for objectives in optimization model could better determine a human-like driving decision, furthermore, this paper gave a basis to compromise multi-objectives in driving decision.

AB The Automated Transfer Vehicle (ATV) is an intelligent and autonomous element of the future European Manned Space Transportation Programme (MSTP). Its main task will be the unmanned logistic support of the orbital infrastructure.
   Since 1987 the European industry under leadership of ESA has performed concept and system studies of such a vehicle. Two contracts were run in parallel, based on different ESA requirements. This paper relates to one of the two concepts, based on the use of the ARIANE 5 Upper Stage EPS and presents the corresponding ATV concept. This Phase A has now concluded mid-1994 by a final Rider 7.
   As the ministerial conference in Granada in November 1992 had approved the ATV Phase B within the frame of the then reoriented HERMES programme for the time period until 1995, this project phase has meanwhile now been started.
   This paper presents the results of the ATV Phase A system studies. It shows the technical design of the vehicle at the end of the Rider 7, for which various new mission and system aspects were taken into account. These requirements are results of external developments in the definition of the Space Station, ARIANE 5 and the European Space Programme. The dimensioning reference mission of the ATV (logistic support of the International Space Station ALPHA) is described in detail.
   Furthermore, the actual project status is given and the future project planning is outlined. The paper also shows the capabilities of the ATV and gives examples of potential applications.

AB Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) possess fast-moving abilities and have been used in various tasks in the past decades. However, their performances are still restricted by insufficient endurance and confined environments. Intuitively, combining other locomotion modes with UAVs, such as diving and driving, would be an appropriate idea to improve the robot's adaptability and solve the endurance problem. Recently, the terrestrial/aerial hybrid robots have drawn the researchers' eyes for their outstanding performances, which can deploy flight mode to traverse insurmountable terrains and ground mode to increase endurance and realize detailed searches. Therefore, this paper developed the autonomous quadrotor tilting hybrid robot (AQT-HR) to achieve terrestrial/aerial dual-modal mobility and verified that the robot delivers high energy efficiency. The AQT-HR can achieve flying and driving through a quadrotor tilting mechanism, which can alter one single driving force into different directions. Furthermore, the dynamic models of the hybrid robot's aerial and ground locomotion are derived and introduced into the model-feedforward PID control algorithm for improving the robot's flying stability. Finally, we conducted some mobility tests and experiments about traversing obstacles to demonstrate that the proposed hybrid robot can realize autonomous mode switching and perform a low energy consumption in ground movement mode.

AB With the development of autonomous driving and computer vision, the importance of high-quality images is increasingly prominent. However, in practical applications, due to lighting, device response speed, distance, and other factors, the image captured by the onboard camera has a variety of degradations. One of the most common degradations is the combination of defocus blur and low resolution. But current image reconstruction methods are almost always used for images with single-form degradation; none of them can handle the low-resolution (LR) defocused image well. Therefore, we propose a new task for the defocus blur and LR composite situation and give a novel model: Joint Learning of Defocus Deblurring with Super-Resolution Network (J-(DSR)-S-2). This model includes two subnetworks: an auxiliary network, HR Defocus Map Estimation Network (HRDME-Net), and a main network, Super-Resolution Reconstruction Network (SRR-Net). The auxiliary net is used to predict the high-resolution (HR) defocus map and let the model understand the global defocus blur distribution, and then, the defocus map and the features of the auxiliary net are sent to the main net to assist the image reconstruction task. We verify the performance of our model on defocus blur and superresolution (SR) datasets and achieve state-of-the-art performance both quantitatively and qualitatively; the experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our method.

AB Autonomous underwater glider (AUG) equips with limited battery capacity, and needs to optimize the shape of AUG to reduce power consumption and improve voyage. This paper presents a new method of the multi-objective optimization of AUG shape based on the fast elitist non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm (NSGA - II). The slender ellipsoid line is chosen as the reference model and the volume of the model is constrained to keep 100 L. The hull drag and the hull surface pressure are two key technical performance indicators. Variables are used for sensitivity analysis based on One-At-a-time (OAT) method. Comparisons between towing tank experiments and numerical simulation method is conducted to prove that this method is used for hydrodynamic analysis. The original shape, the NSGA-II optimization shape, the Spray shape and the multi-island genetic algorithm (MIGA) optimization shape are analyzed to verify the validity of the optimization method in this paper by comparing hydrodynamic performance and power conversion efficiency. The simulation results indicate that the NSGA-II shape obtains a better hydrodynamic performance than the others. At the same wing configuration and gliding depth, the voyage of the NSGA-II shape is more than the original shape 12%, which has great significance for reducing power consumption.

ID AUTONOMOUS EMERGENCY BRAKING; SYSTEMS
AB Automated Vehicles (AVs) are attracting attention as a safer mobility option thanks to the recent advancement of various sensing technologies that realize a much quicker Perception-Reaction Time than Human-Driven Vehicles (HVs). However, AVs are not entirely free from the risk of accidents, and we currently lack a systematic and reliable method to improve AV safety functions. The manual composition of accident scenarios does not scale. Simulation-based methods do not fully cover the peculiar AV accident patterns that can occur in the real world. Artificial Intelligence (AI) techniques are employed to identify the moments of accidents from ego-vehicle videos. However, most AI-based approaches fall short in accounting for the probable causes of the accidents. Neither of these AI-driven methods offer details for authoring accident scenarios used for AV safety testing. In this paper, we present a customized Vision Transformer (named ViT-TA) that accurately classifies the critical situations around traffic accidents and automatically points out the objects as probable causes based on an Attention map. Using 24,740 frames from Dashcam Accident Dataset (DAD) as training data, ViT-TA detected critical moments at Time-To-Collision (TTC) <= 1 s with 34.92 higher accuracy than the state-of-the-art approach. ViT-TA's Attention map highlighting the critical objects helped us understand how the situations unfold to put the hypothetical ego vehicles with AV functions at risk. Based on the ViT-TA-assisted interpretation, we systematized the composition of Functional scenarios conceptualized by the PEGASUS project for describing a high-level plan to improve AVs' capability of evading critical situations. We propose a novel framework for automatically deriving Logical and Concrete scenarios specified with 6-Layer situational variables defined by the PEGASUS project. We believe our work is vital towards systematically generating highly reliable and trustworthy safety improvement plans for AVs in a scalable manner.

AB Stability and energy saving are essential issues for traditional and autonomous vehicles and can be ensured through optimization and control of steering, braking, and torque distribution in electric motors. While these three control mechanisms can be optimized separately using two-stage sequential optimization, the results are often suboptimal. As such, this study proposes simultaneous optimization and control of all three control units for the first time through bilevel quadratic programming (BQP) with neurodynamic optimization. First, a BQP technique is developed by assuming the lower optimization problem to be a feasible region for the upper optimization problem. Second, the upper and lower optimization problems are integrated into a QP task to achieve simultaneous optimization and control by removing separate steps required for two-stage sequential optimization. As the formulated QP problem is more generalized, including an irreversible positive semidefinite Hessian matrix and a switching subsystem, a novel neurodynamic optimization with a unique 2-norm energy function is established. It is then applied to solve the generalized BQP problem with high computational efficiency. Finally, hardware-in-the-loop experimental results confirmed the real-time effectiveness of the proposed control technique, which decreased the optimization time by 43.3%, and improved control performance while reducing the braking and motor torque required by 54.6% and 33.3%, respectively (compared with existing techniques).

AB The study is concerned with the problem of online planning low-cost cooperative paths; those are energy-efficient, easy-to-execute, and low collision probability for unmanned surface vehicles (USVs) based on the artificial vector field and environmental heuristics. First, we propose an artificial vector field method by following the global optimally path and the current to maximize the known environmental information. Then, to improve the optimal rapidly exploring random tree (RRT*) based planner by the environment heuristics, a Gaussian sampling scheme is adopted to seek for the likely samples that locate near obstacles. Meanwhile, a multisampling strategy is proposed to choose low-cost path tree extensions locally. The vector field guidance, the Gaussian sampling scheme, and the multisampling strategy are used to improve the efficiency of RRT* to obtain a low-cost path for the virtual leader of USVs. To promote the accuracy of collision detection during the execution process of RRT*, an ellipse function-based bounding box for USVs is proposed with the consideration of the current. Finally, an information consensus scheme is employed to quickly calculate cooperative paths for a fleet of USVs guided by the virtual leader. Simulation results show that our online cooperative path planning method is performed well in the practical marine environment.

AB This paper considers using unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) to survey important sites across a city. When the sites are relatively far from the UAVs' depot, the UAVs may not be able to reach many of the sites. Suppose that a UAV can take public transportation vehicles (PTVs) like a passenger. Then, it may reach a site that is unreachable by flying only. Based on this UAV-PTV scheme, we investigate a task-UAV assignment problem, which assigns a set of surveillance tasks to UAVs. We formulate a mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) problem that minimizes the overall energy consumption of UAVs, subject to that every site is surveyed by a certain number of UAVs during a given time window, and all UAVs successfully return to the depot. Considering that this problem is NP-hard, we present two sub-optimal solutions. The first solution orders the surveillance tasks according to the starting times of their time windows. Then, starting from the earliest one, it assigns the tasks one by one to UAVs. The second solution breaks the tasks into small non-overlapping groups. It then assigns tasks to UAVs group by group. The former solution quickly addresses the assignment problem, but it lacks the overall management of UAV resources. The latter improves this by assigning a group of tasks simultaneously, and it can control the computation complexity by limiting the group size. The comparison with the brute force method shows that the proposed solutions can achieve competitive performance in a reasonable time. Note to Practitioners-Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) have been widely used in surveillance missions. However, one challenge practitioners often meet is the limited flight duration. Commercial UAVs are in general powered by the onboard battery. Due to the restriction of payload, the battery capacity is constrained, which limits the UAVs' operation time. In this paper, we present the approach exploiting public transportation vehicles (PTVs). In our design, a UAV can take a public transportation vehicles such as buses, trams and trains on the roof and transfer between vehicles when necessary. With this UAV-PTV collaboration scheme, we consider how to efficiently assign surveillance tasks to UAVs. Due to the NP-hardness of the considered problem, two suboptimal algorithms are presented.

AB Accurate lane-change prediction information in real time is essential to safely operate Autonomous Vehicles (AVs) on the roadways, especially at the early stage of AVs deployment, where there will be an interaction between AVs and human-driven vehicles. This study proposed reliable lane-change prediction models considering features from vehicle kinematics, machine vision, driver, and roadway geometric characteristics using the trajectory-level SHRP2 Naturalistic Driving Study and Roadway Information Database. Several machine learning algorithms were trained, validated, tested, and comparatively analyzed including, Classification And Regression Trees (CART), Random Forest (RF), eXtreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost), Adaptive Boosting (AdaBoost), Support Vector Machine (SVM), K Nearest Neighbor (KNN), and Naive Bayes (NB) based on six different sets of features. In each feature set, relevant features were extracted through a wrapper-based algorithm named Boruta. The results showed that the XGBoost model outperformed all other models in relation to its highest overall prediction accuracy (97%) and F1-score (95.5%) considering all features. However, the highest overall prediction accuracy of 97.3% and F1-score of 95.9% were observed in the XGBoost model based on vehicle kinematics features. Moreover, it was found that XGBoost was the only model that achieved a reliable and balanced prediction performance across all six feature sets. Furthermore, a simplified XGBoost model was developed for each feature set considering the practical implementation of the model. The proposed prediction model could help in trajectory planning for AVs and could be used to develop more reliable advanced driver assistance systems (ADAS) in a cooperative connected and automated vehicle environment.

AB Platooning is considered to be a very effective method for improving traffic efficiency, traffic safety and fuel economy under the connected and automated environment. The prerequisite for realizing these advantages is how to form a platoon without any collisions and how to maintain and optimize the car-following behavior after platoon formation. However, most of the existing studies focus on the platoon configuration and information transmission method, while only a few attempt to address the issue of platoon formation and optimization methods. To this end, this study proposes a novel platoon formation and optimization model combining graph theory and safety potential field (G-SPF) theory for connected and automated vehicles (CAVs) under different vehicle distributions. Compared to previous studies, we innovatively incorporate the concept of the safety potential field to better describe the actual driving risk of vehicles and ensure their absolute safety. A four-step platoon formation and optimization strategy is developed to achieve platoon preliminary formation and platoon driving optimization control. Three traffic scenarios with different CAVs distributions are designed to verify the effectiveness of our proposed platoon formation method based on G-SPF theory, and the simulation results indicate that a collision-free platoon can be formed in a short time. Additionally, the G-SPF-based platoon driving optimization control method is demonstrated by comparing it with two typical control strategies. Compared with the constant spacing and constant time headway control strategies, the simulation results show that our proposed method can improve the traffic capacity by approximately 48.8% and 26.6%, respectively.

AB The accurate and prompt recognition of a driver's cognitive distraction state is of great significance to intelligent driving systems (IDSs) and human-autonomous collaboration systems (HACSs). Once the driver's distraction status has been accurately identified, the IDS or HACS can actively intervene or take control of the vehicle, thereby avoiding the safety hazards caused by distracted driving. However, few studies have considered the time-frequency characteristics of the driving behavior and vehicle status during distracted driving for the establishment of a recognition model. This study seeks to exploit a recognition model of cognitive distraction driving according to the time-frequency analysis of the characteristic parameters. Therefore, an on-road experiment was implemented to measure the relative parameters under both normal and distracted driving via a test vehicle equipped with multiple sensors. Wavelet packet analysis was used to extract the time-frequency characteristics, and 21 pivotal features were determined as the input of the training model. Finally, a bidirectional long short-term memory network (Bi-LSTM) combined with an attention mechanism (Atten-BiLSTM) was proposed and trained. The results indicate that, compared with the support vector machine (SVM) model and the long short-term memory network (LSTM) model, the proposed model achieved the highest recognition accuracy (90.64%) for cognitive distraction under the time window setting of 5 s. The determination of time-frequency characteristic parameters and the more accurate recognition of cognitive distraction driving achieved in this work provide a foundation for human-centered intelligent vehicles.

AB Currently, one of the main challenges faced in large metropolitan areas is traffic congestion. To address this problem, adequate traffic control could produce many benefits, including reduced pollutant emissions and reduced travel times. If it were possible to characterize the state of traffic by predicting future traffic conditions for optimizing the route of automated vehicles, and if these measures could be taken to preventively mitigate the effects of congestion with its related problems, the overall traffic flow could be improved. This paper performs an experimental study of the traffic distribution in the city of Valencia, Spain, characterizing the different streets of the city in terms of vehicle load with respect to the travel time during rush hour traffic conditions. Experimental results based on realistic vehicular traffic traces from the city of Valencia show that only some street segments fall under the general theory of vehicular flow, offering a good fit using quadratic regression, while a great number of street segments fall under other categories. Although in some cases such discrepancies are related to lack of traffic, injecting additional vehicles shows that significant mismatches still persist. Thus, in this paper we propose an equation to characterize travel times over a segment belonging to the sigmoid family; specifically, we apply logistic regression, being able to significantly improve the curve fitting results for most of the street segments under analysis. Based on our regression results, we performed a clustering analysis of the different street segments, showing that they can be classified into three well-defined categories, which evidences a predictable traffic distribution using the logistic regression throughout the city during rush hours, and allows optimizing the traffic for automated vehicles.

AB Insulator is one of the most critical components of power transmission lines and its timely and accurate defect detection is considered important to ensure reliable and safe operation of transmission grids. This paper proposes an efficient augmentation method of aerial images captured using the unmanned aerial vehicle for the accurate detection of insulators with self-detonation defects. Through the adoption of the improved Resnet-18 model with the insulator edge features and the Grad-CAM based saliency map generation, the proposed solution can well maintain the vital regions for fine-grained classification in the augmentation process. The proposed solution is extensively assessed in comparison with the CNN-based benchmark methods through experiments. The numerical results indicate that the improved ResNet-18 model with the augmented images outperform the existing solutions and can identify the self-detonation defects with an accuracy of 95.1%.

DE Aerial systems: mechanics and control; robot safety; force control
AB As the performance of autonomous systems increases, safety concerns arise, especially when operating in non-structured environments. To deal with these concerns, this work presents a safety layer for mechanical systems that detects and responds to unstable dynamics caused by external disturbances. The safety layer is implemented independently and on top of already present nominal controllers, like pose or wrench tracking, and limits power flow when the system's response would lead to instability. This approach is based on the computation of the Largest Lyapunov Exponent (LLE) of the system's error dynamics, which represent a measure of the dynamics' divergence or convergence rate. By actively computing this metric, divergent and possibly dangerous system behaviors can be promptly detected. The LIE is then used in combination with Control Barrier Functions (CBFs) to impose power limit constraints on a jerk controlled system. The proposed architecture is experimentally validated on an Omnidirectional Micro Aerial Vehicle (OMAV) both in free flight and interaction tasks.

AB Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) offer a viable alternative to conventional platforms for acquiring high-resolution remote-sensing data at lower cost and increased operational flexibility. UAVs include various configurations of unmanned aircraft, multirotor helicopters (e.g., quadcopters), and balloons/blimps of different sizes and shapes. Quadcopters and balloons fill a gap between satellites and aircraft when a stationary monitoring platform is needed for relatively long-term observation of an area. UAVs have advanced designs to carry small payloads and integrated flight control systems, giving them semiautonomous or fully autonomous flight capabilities. Miniaturized sensors are being developed/adapted for UAV payloads, including hyperspectral imagers, LIDAR, synthetic aperture radar, and thermal infrared sensors. UAVs are now used for a wide range of environmental applications, such as coastal wetland mapping, LIDAR bathymetry, flood and wildfire surveillance, tracking oil spills, urban studies, and Arctic ice investigations.

ID DESIGN
AB This paper presents the concept and design of a new reconfigurable magnetic-coupling thruster (RMCT). Mechanical models, as well as digital and real-world experiments, are proposed to understand the fundamental aspects of such technology. The principle of RMCT is to reorient the propeller, and therefore the thrust vector, to the desired direction without adding or moving any motors. The focus of this study is to propose a new design to solve the problems raised in a previous work on RMCT and to understand how the transmitted coupling torque behaves with regard to the new kinematics of the propeller shaft. After introducing the models underlying this thruster design, we build a numerical simulation and validate it through experimental results. The performance of this design is then discussed based on open-loop trials and its potential integration and control. The conclusion proposes guidelines for developing an underwater prototype that will be designed and tested on real autonomous underwater vehicles.

AB Fully automatic driving is emerging as the approach to dramatically improve efficiency (throughput per unit of space) while at the same time leading to the goal of zero accidents. This approach, based on fully automated vehicles, might improve the efficiency of road travel in terms of space and energy used, and in terms of set-vice provided as well. For such automated operation, trajectory planning methods that produce smooth trajectories, with low level associated accelerations and jerk for providing human comfort, are required. This paper addresses this problem proposing a new approach that consists of introducing a velocity planning stage in the trajectory planner. Moreover, this paper presents the design and simulation evaluation of trajectory-tracking and path-following controllers for autonomous vehicles based on sliding mode control. A new design of sliding surface is proposed, such that lateral and angular errors are internally coupled with each other (in cartesian space) in a sliding surface leading to convergence of both variables.

AB A real-time multiprocessor system is proposed for the solution of the tracking problem of mobile robots operating in a real context with environmental disturbances and parameter uncertainties. The proposed control scheme utilizes multiple models of the robot for its identification in an adaptive and learning control framework. Radial Basis Function Networks (RBFNs) are considered for the multiple models in order to exploit the net non-linear approximation capabilities for modeling the kinematic behavior of the vehicle and for reducing unmodeled contributions to tracking errors. The training of the nets and the tests of the achieved control performance have been done in a real experimental setup.

ID DATA GOVERNANCE
AB The current regulatory landscape that applies to maritime service robotics, aptly termed as robotics and autonomous systems (RAS), is quite complex. When it comes to patents, there are multifarious considerations in relation to vessel survey, inspection, and maintenance processes under national and international law. Adherence is challenging, given that the traditional delivery methods are viewed as unsafe, strenuous, and laborious. Service robotics, namely micro aerial vehicles (MAVs) or drones, magnetic-wheeled crawlers (crawlers), and remotely operated vehicles (ROVs), function by relying on the architecture of the Internet of Robotic Things. The aforementioned are being introduced as time-saving apparatuses, accompanied by the promise to acquire concrete and sufficient data for the identification of vessel structural weaknesses with the highest level of accuracy to facilitate decision-making processes upon which temporary and permanent measures are contingent. Nonetheless, a noticeable critical issue associated with RAS effective deployment revolves around non-personal data governance, which comprises the main analytical focus of this research effort. The impetus behind this study stems from the need to enquire whether "data" provisions within the realm of international technological regulatory (techno-regulatory) framework is sufficient, well organized, and harmonized so that there are no current or future conflicts with promulgated theoretical dimensions of data that drive all subject matter-oriented actions. As is noted from the relevant expository research, the challenges are many. Engineering RAS to perfection is not the end-all and be-all. Collateral impediments must be avoided. A safety net needs to be devised to protect non-personal data. The results here indicate that established data decision dimensions call for data security and protection, as well as a consideration of ownership and liability details. An analysis of the state-of-the-art and the comparative results assert that the abovementioned remain neglected in the current international setting. The findings reveal specific data barriers within the existing international framework. The ways forward include strategic actions to remove data barriers towards overall efficacy of maritime RAS operations. The overall findings indicate that an effective transition to RAS operations requires optimizing the international regulatory framework for opening the pathways for effective RAS operations. Conclusions were drawn based on the premise that policy reform is inevitable in order to push the RAS agenda forward before the emanation of 6G and the era of the Internet of Everything, with harmonization and further standardization being very high priority issues.

AB Harmful algal blooms of cyanobacteria are increasing in magnitude and frequency globally, degrading inland and coastal aquatic ecosystems and adversely affecting public health. Efforts to understand the structure and natural variability of these blooms range from point sampling methods to a wide array of remote sensing tools. This study aims to provide a comprehensive view of cyanobacterial blooms in Clear Lake, California - a shallow, polymictic, naturally eutrophic lake with a long record of episodic cyanobacteria blooms. To understand the spatial heterogeneity and temporal dynamics of cyanobacterial blooms, we evaluated a satellite remote sensing tool for estimating coarse cyanobacteria distribution with coincident, in situ measurements at varying scales and resolutions. The Cyanobacteria Index (CI) remote sensing algorithm was used to estimate cyanobacterial abundance in the top portion of the water column from data acquired from the Ocean and Land Color Instrument (OLCI) sensor on the Sentinel-3a satellite. We collected hyperspectral data from a handheld spectroradiometer; discrete 1 m integrated surface samples for chlorophyll-a and phycocyanin; multispectral imagery from small Unmanned Aerial System (sUAS) flights (similar to 12 cm resolution); Autonomous Underwater Vehicle (AUV) measurements of chlorophyll-a, turbidity, and colored dissolved organic matter (similar to 10 cm horizontal spacing, 1 m below the water surface); and meteorological forcing and lake temperature data to provide context to our cyanobacteria measurements. A semivariogram analysis of the high resolution AUV and sUAS data found the Critical Scale of Variability for cyanobacterial blooms to range from 70 to 175 m, which is finer than what is resolvable by the satellite data. We thus observed high spatial variability within each 300 m satellite pixel. Finally, we used the field spectroscopy data to evaluate the accuracy of both the original and revised CI algorithm. We found the revised CI algorithm was not effective in estimating cyanobacterial abundance for our study site. Satellite-based remote sensing tools are vital to researchers and water managers as they provide consistent, high-coverage data at a low cost and sampling effort. The findings of this research support continued development and refinement of remote sensing tools, which are essential for satellite monitoring of harmful algal blooms in lakes and reservoirs.

AB Unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) assisted air-to-ground (A2G) communication is vulnerable to malicious jamming due to the broadcast nature of wireless communications. In this letter, an anti-jamming power control framework with an unknown jamming model and unknown transmission power is proposed. In particular, the probability density function (PDF) of the effective jamming signal strength (EJSS) is first estimated via kernel density estimation (KDE). Then, utilizing the EJSS, a deep deterministic policy gradient (DDPG) based framework is proposed to acquire the power control strategy in real time. Moreover, a trajectory design scheme based on K-means++ is proposed to track the location of users. The simulation results show that the proposed framework yields an improved sum rate and energy efficiency over the reference schemes.

AB UAV remote identification is an emerging technology that allows ground observers to identify a drone in the airspace and obtain information about it and its operator. The goal is to enhance safe operation over people and at night and protect public privacy. Two modes are known for remote identification: broadcast-based and network-based. Although both modes' technical implementation seems straightforward, remote identification is challenging because it includes multiple agents that follow different interests, such as safety, security, privacy, and businesses. Currently, enormous efforts for regulation, standardization, design, implementation, and testing are being made to put this technology forward. This paper aims to outline the landscape of these activities as a survey and tutorial to inform regulators, standardization organizations, industry, and researchers about the state of the art in this technology and to highlight its opportunities and challenges.

AB The extensive use of vehicles nowadays and the emergency of autonomous driving urge the improvement of traffic safety. Prevalent approaches competent at preventing road accidents are inseparable from the trustworthy data acquisition. But in vehicular ad hoc networks (VANETs), data transmission and storage are unreliable due to constrained resource and unsteady topology. Currently, distribution is widely applied into VANETs for multifold data protection and blockchain becomes preferred with its distributed consensus and ledger for data trust protection. Therefore, we propose a system in this paper, which employs blockchain technology to secure the sharing of visual traffic information. As proposed, the sequence of frames is used for their integrity consensus, the transaction capacity is adjusted according to the frame types, and transcoding frames is defined via smart contracts; thus, traffic information gains more in-depth protection. With the proposed system, vehicles can confidently use the information for safety guidance.

ID DYNAMIC TASK ASSIGNMENT; UNDERWATER VEHICLES
AB Multi-AUV cooperative target search problem in unknown 3D underwater environment is not only a research hot spot but also a challenging task. To complete this task, each autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) needs to move quickly without collision and cooperate with other AUVs to find the target. In this paper, an improved dolphin swarm algorithm- (DSA-) based approach is proposed, and the search problem is divided into three stages, namely, random cruise, dynamic alliance, and team search. In the proposed approach, the Levy flight method is used to provide a random walk for AUV to detect the target information in the random cruise stage. Then the self-organizing map (SOM) neural network is used to build dynamic alliances in real time. Finally, an improved DSA algorithm is presented to realize the team search. Furthermore, some simulations are conducted, and the results show that the proposed approach is capable of guiding multi-AUVs to achieve the target search task in unknown 3D underwater environment efficiently.

AB Self-driving systems are expected to become increasingly popular in the foreseeable future. However, a driver who is out of the control loop might reduce overall situation awareness by overly trusting automated driving systems. Alternatively, the introduction of automated driving systems could lead to misuse or disuse. For these reasons, an automated driving system should encourage appropriate driver reliance to achieve social acceptance. Imperfect information of the system sensing range might adversely affect trust. This study used a vibrotactile display with an automated driving system to provide situation awareness. The display contributes to driver trust by enabling a driver to predict or perceive actions selected by the system. The display provides spatial information related to traffic objects by haptic stimulus. The driving scenario of passing a motorbike with vehicles approaching from behind was considered. The results of this driving simulator study demonstrated that the spatial information and the behavior of the system affected trust.

Therefore, fusing the Inertial Navigation System (INS) and Global Positioning System (GPS) is important. Various methods have been applied to smooth and predict the INS and GPS errors. Recently, wavelet de-noising methodologies have been applied to improve the accuracy and reliability of the GPS/INS system. In this work, analysis of real data to identify the optimal wavelet filter for each GPS and INS component for high quality error estimation is presented. A comprehensive comparison of various wavelet thresholding selections with different level of decomposition is conducted to study the effect on GPS/INS error estimation while maintaining the original features of the signal. Results show that while some wavelet filters and thresholding selection algorithms perform better than others on each of the GPS and INS components, no specific parameter selection perform uniformly better than others.

AB This paper undertakes a deep dive into the kinds of activities that individuals are likely to pursue when freed from the task of driving in the fully automated vehicle (AV) era. We refer to such activities as travel-based activities (TBAs) and examine the potential effects of TBA participation on activity-based travel (ABT). Two aggregate ABT characteristics are considered: additional local area travel (ALT) and additional long distance travel (ALDT). TBAs and the two ABTs are jointly modeled in a parsimonious fashion using psycho-social latent constructs, individual characteristics, and built environment (BE) attributes. The data used in this study is drawn from a 2019 "emerging mobility" survey administered in the Austin, Texas metropolitan area by the research group. Our study indicates that "productive use of time" is not necessarily always tied with activities such as work and study; rather, being able to partake in relatively chill activities (such as sleeping, relaxing, and gazing out the window) is also considered as good use of time. This suggests caution in the interpretation of what are traditionally referred to as "productive" activities and also a need for scholarly restraint in the use of the label "multitasking" to exclusively refer to non-passive activities. We suggest that the field move away from subjective/ambiguous terms such as multitasking and "productive" activities, and adopt the more neutral label of "travel-based activity". The results also support the notion that the option of opening up travel to pursue work/study activities may itself be engendering stress in individuals; that is, as the option to pursue "non-chill" activities increases in an AV environment, that itself may produce angst in individuals and lead to less enjoyment in travel. This also highlights a need to examine TBAs in the broader context of emotional well-being and quality of life. Indeed, AVs may further erode into our time of tuning-out from the "chatter" of routine life and make it less possible to partake in "calm and mindless" activities. Finally, our study cautions against the use of simple and uniform (across individuals) value of travel time savings (VTTS) factor modifications to study AV impacts on ABT.

AB Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) are widely used for surveillance and monitoring to complete target search tasks. However, the short battery life and moderate computational capability hinder UAVs to process computation-intensive tasks. The emerging edge computing technologies can alleviate this problem by offloading tasks to the ground edge servers. How to evaluate the search process so as to make optimal offloading decisions and make optimal flying trajectories represent fundamental research challenges. In this paper, we propose to utilize the concept of uncertainty to evaluate the search process, which reflects the reliability of the target search results. Thereafter, we propose a deep reinforcement learning (DRL) technique to jointly make optimal computation offloading decisions and flying orientation choices for multi-UAV cooperative target search. Specifically, we first formulate an uncertainty minimization problem based on the established system model. By introducing a reward function, we prove that the uncertainty minimization problem is equivalent to a reward maximization problem, which is further analyzed by a Markov decision process (MDP). To obtain the optimal task offloading decisions and flying orientation choices, a deep Q-network (DQN) based DRL architecture with a separated Q-network is then proposed. Finally, extensive simulations validate the effectiveness of the proposed techniques, and comprehensive discussions on how different parameters affect the search performance are given.

AB To solve the problems of when to set up connected automated vehicles (CAVs) dedicated lanes and how many CAVs dedicated lanes to set up under different penetration rates of CAVs, this work focuses on modeling the fundamental diagram of mixed traffic flow with dedicated lanes for CAVs. Firstly, the car-following modes and their proportion of mixed traffic flow without and with CAVs dedicated lanes are analyzed. Secondly, the fundamental diagram of mixed traffic flow is derived based on car-following models to analyze the traffic capacity with and without CAVs dedicated lanes. Then, the relevant properties of the fundamental diagram with CAVs dedicated lanes are proposed and proved. Finally, the sensitivity of related parameters (e.g., CAVs penetration rate, time headway, and free-flow speed) in the fundamental diagram is discussed. Results show that (1) the increase of CAVs penetration rate and free-flow speed can improve the traffic capacity; (2) the design of smaller CAVs time headway benefits traffic capacity. Moreover, one and two CAVs dedicated lanes of three manual lanes are set to improve the traffic capacity to the greatest extent when the penetration rate of CAVs reaches 0.6 and 0.86, respectively. It is noteworthy that developing CAVs dedicated lanes under a reasonable CAVs penetration rate does not waste resources and increases traffic congestion while improving traffic capacity.

AB Unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) videos have received active research attention in the remote sensing field by taking full advantage of the bird's eye view offered by UAVs. At the same time, visual tracking approaches based on discriminative correlation filters (DCFs) have recently achieved increasing popularity and success. Despite their success, the tracking robustness and accuracy of existing DCF-based trackers are hard to promote in challenging tracking scenarios of aerial videos due to excessive reliance on the response map and fixed linear model update strategy. To resolve these issues, we propose a robust DCF-based tracking framework via an effective pretrained rectification network for UAV-based remote sensing. Specifically, the target-specific rectification network is offline trained to discriminately classify the target and background. During the online tracking stage, the DCF module performs fast inference to obtain the potential locations of the target. After that, the deep rectification network evaluates the correlation-specific proposals offered by the DCF module and provides precise tracking results. Besides, to achieve a robust and adaptive model update strategy, we propose to finetune both the DCF module and rectification network according to the classification confidence of the estimated result. Extensive experimental results on recent UAV benchmarks demonstrate that our method achieves better performance than other competing algorithms.

AB Global localization in 3D point clouds is a challenging task for mobile vehicles in outdoor scenarios, which requires the vehicle to localize itself correctly in a given map without prior knowledge of its pose. This is a critical component of autonomous vehicles or robots on the road for handling localization failures. In this paper, based on reduced dimension scan representations learned from neural networks, a solution to global localization is proposed by achieving place recognition first and then metric pose estimation in the global prior map. Specifically, we present a semi-handcrafted feature learning method for 3D Light detection and ranging (LiDAR) point clouds using artificial statistics and siamese network, which transforms the place recognition problem into a similarity modeling problem. Additionally, the sensor data using dimension reduced representations require less storage space and make the searching easier. With the learned representations by networks and the global poses, a prior map is built and used in the localization framework. In the localization step, position only observations obtained by place recognition are used in a particle filter algorithm to achieve precise pose estimation. To demonstrate the effectiveness of our place recognition and localization approach, KITTI benchmark and our multi-session datasets are employed for comparison with other geometric-based algorithms. The results show that our system can achieve both high accuracy and efficiency for long-term autonomy.

AB With excellent air-ground multi-mode movements, the vertical take-off and landing (VTOL) air-ground integrated vehicle can easily traverse complex terrains and maintain high energy efficiency. During movement, path planning plays an important role in achieving the autonomous operation of the vehicle, which faces the following difficulty. A short air-ground multi-mode path requires efficient planning, with proper judgment of the timing and position for mode switching. To address this difficulty, we propose a new path planning algorithm, named Dynamically Directed Graph Algorithm (DDGA). It can realize short path search in limited search nodes via dynamically extracting key search nodes in maps and forming a dynamically directed graph. To be specific, adjacent nodes of the first obstacle traversed by the connection line from the current search node to the destination are defined as key search nodes. As the current node changes, key search nodes are dynamically updated. The above key search nodes and the directed paths between them form a dynamically directed graph. Considering the air-ground movement capability, obstacle areas below maximum flight altitudes in maps are defined as pending flight areas. The directed paths traversing these areas are considered in the above graph. Besides the two-dimensional distance cost, flight altitude cost is added to the cost values of different directed paths. This cost contributes to judging the proper switching timing and position. Compared to other algorithms, DDGA can find short paths with fewer search nodes in multiple obstacle maps. It efficiently plans a short air-ground multi-mode path for the VTOL air-ground integrated vehicle.

AB Automated vehicles (AVs) aim to dramatically improve traffic safety by reducing or eliminating human error, which remains the leading cause of road crashes. However, commonly accepted standards for the 'safe driving behaviour of machines' are pending and urgently needed. Unless a common understanding of safety as a design value is achieved, different manufacturers' driving styles may emerge, resulting in inconsistent, unpredictable and potentially unsafe 'behaviour' of AVs in certain situations. This paper aims to explore the main gaps and challenges towards establishing shared safety standards for the 'behaviour' of AVs, and contribute to their responsible traffic integration, by reviewing the state-of-the-art on AV safety in the core relevant disciplines: ethics of technology, safety science (engineering & human factors), and standardisation. The ethical and safety aspects investigated include the users' perception of AV safety, the ethical trade-offs in critical decision-making contexts, the pertinence of data-driven approaches for AVs to mimic human behaviour, and the responsibilities of various actors. Moreover, the paper reviews the current safety patterns, metrics (surrogate measures of safety - SMoS) and their thresholds introduced in existing research for three use cases: mixed traffic of AV and conventional vehicles, AV interaction with pedestrians and cyclists, and transition of control from machine to human driver. The results reveal several knowledge gaps within each discipline and highlights the lack of common understanding of safety across disciplines. On the basis of the results, the paper proposes a framework for further research on AV safety, identifying concrete opportunities for interdisciplinary research, with common goals and methodologies, and explicitly indicating the path for transfer of knowledge between sectors.

AB This paper develops a novel homography-based visual servo control method for the vertical take-off and landing (VTOL) unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) tracking the trajectory of a 6 degrees of freedom (6-DOF) moving ship. Different from the classical homography-based visual servoing which is only suitable for the trajectory tracking of a planar moving target, an extended homography-based visual servoing framework is proposed to track the trajectory of a 6-DOF moving target regardless of its time-varying rotational motion. Taking entries in the homography matrix as feedback, the visual dynamics of UAV is established and decoupled into a translational motion sub-dynamics and an attitude sub-dynamics based on the hierarchical control strategy. In the translational motion subsystem, the robust controller is designed by embedding the nonlinear differentiator, the adaptive method, and a smooth saturation model in the backstepping control scheme. The saturation model is introduced to generate the constrained control inputs to ensure the nonsingular attitude extraction and help the visual points remain in the camera's field of view (FoV) simultaneously. In the attitude subsystem, a robust state-constrained control method is proposed by utilizing a robust control barrier function (RCBF), the quadratic programming (QP) and a saturation model to guarantee the visibility, where RCBF can accommodate unknown dynamics. The theoretical analysis demonstrates the asymptotic stability of the closed-loop system. Simulations are carried out to further validate the controller performance.

AB Purpose The goal of this study is to explore the effect of two-sided lateral gap with uncertain velocity on the stability of traffic flow on a curved road. Design/methodology/approach In this paper, an extended car-following model considering the effect of two-sided lateral gap with uncertain velocity on a curved road is proposed. The effects of different lateral positions and radius of different sizes can be considered as control signals. The stability condition of the new model is obtained by the control theory. The numerical simulations are carried out to analyze how the control signal and lateral positions and radius of curved road affect traffic flow stability. The results show that driving between two lanes and inaccurate speed estimates both have a negative effect on traffic flow stability, and the stability also decreases with the increase in the radius of curved road. Findings (1) Simulation of influencing factors of vehicle lateral position indicates that if the driver drives between two lanes, it would have a negative impact on traffic flow. (2) When the speed is fixed, the traffic flow becomes more and more unstable with the increase in the radius of the curve. (3) The stability of traffic flow will be affected when the driver estimates the speed of the vehicle ahead. Therefore, whether it is manual driving or future intelligent vehicle driving, it is necessary to accurately judge the speed of the front vehicle. Originality/value There is little research on two-sided lateral gap with uncertain velocity for the stability of traffic flow on a curved road. The enhanced model constructed in this study can better reflect the real traffic, which can also give some theoretical reference for the development of connected and autonomous vehicles (CAVs).

AB Inferring the depth of images is a fundamental inverse problem within the field of Computer Vision since depth information is obtained through 2D images, which can be generated from infinite possibilities of observed real scenes. Benefiting from the progress of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to explore structural features and spatial image information, Single Image Depth Estimation (SIDE) is often highlighted in scopes of scientific and technological innovation, as this concept provides advantages related to its low implementation cost and robustness to environmental conditions. In the context of autonomous vehicles, state-of-the-art CNNs optimize the SIDE task by producing high-quality depth maps, which are essential during the autonomous navigation process in different locations. However, such networks are usually supervised by sparse and noisy depth data, from Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) laser scans, and are carried out at high computational cost, requiring high-performance Graphic Processing Units (GPUs). Therefore, we propose a new lightweight and fast supervised CNN architecture combined with novel feature extraction models which are designed for real-world autonomous navigation. We also introduce an efficient surface normals module, jointly with a simple geometric 2.5D loss function, to solve SIDE problems. We also innovate by incorporating multiple Deep Learning techniques, such as the use of densification algorithms and additional semantic, surface normals and depth information to train our framework. The method introduced in this work focuses on robotic applications in indoor and outdoor environments and its results are evaluated on the competitive and publicly available NYU Depth V2 and KITTI Depth datasets.

AB In recent years, the focus of the smart transportation industry has been shifting towards the research and development of smart cars with autonomous control. Smart cars are considered to be a smart investment, as they promote safe driving while focusing on an alternate transportation fuel resource, making them eco-friendly too. Safe driving is one of the crucial concerns in autonomous smart cars. The major issue for the better provision of safe driving is real time tasks management and an efficient inference system for autonomous control. Real time task management is of huge significance in smart cars control systems. An optimal control system consists of a knowledge base and a control unit; where the knowledge base contains the data and thresholds for rules and the control unit contains the functionality for smart vehicle autonomous control. In this work, we propose a hybrid of an inference engine and a real time task scheduler for an efficient task management and resource consumption. Our proposed hybrid inference engine and task scheduler mechanism provides an efficient way of controlling smart cars in different scenarios such as heavy rainfall, obstacle detection, driver's focus diversion etc., while ensuring the practices of safe driving. For the performance analysis of our proposed hybrid inference based scheduling mechanism, we have simulated a non-hybrid version with the same system constraints and a basic implementation of inference engine. For performance evaluation, CPU time utilization, tasks' missing rate, average response time are used as performance metrics.

AB This study addressed the autonomous planning of three-dimensional (3D) underwater inspection paths for autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) in marine ranching by integrating differential evolution and particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithms. First, a modified PSO algorithm incorporating swap operators, mutation, and crossover strategies was employed to enable autonomous obstacle avoidance during the inspection of offshore net cages in fish farms situated within a 3D marine environment. This approach addresses the problem of planning full-traversal paths for multiple inspection points. Second, the performance of the proposed algorithm was assessed through comparative tests with other algorithms. The proposed algorithm demonstrated significant improvements in convergence speed, accuracy, and stability under complex scenarios involving multiple optima and intense oscillations. To validate the superiority and overall planning proficiency of the modified method, an experimental setup comprising of two distinct 3D marine cage environments with a series of checkpoints was utilized. The experimental results demonstrated the ability of the proposed algorithm to generate an optimal path while traversing all inspection points of fish farm offshore net cages. By ensuring the safety of AUVs and closely adhering to the surfaces of offshore net cages during the inspection process, the algorithm exhibits remarkable adaptability to specific application scenarios, effectively mitigating concerns related to local optima and premature convergence.

AB The present study extends the discussion on product manufacturers' digital servitization toward smart solutions by outlining and reviewing the existing literature on digital servitization and smart solutions. We focus on potential configurations based on technologies, business models, and ecosystems to understand how this transition can be managed through the process of reconfiguration. We define smart solutions as an advanced state of product-service-software systems, and we use moving vehicles as a case in point. We base our discussion on a configurational research approach, examining the role of advanced technologies (e.g., artificial intelligence), novel business models, and modern ecosystems (e.g., platforms and innovation ecosystems) in shaping digital servitization toward smart and autonomous solutions. We identify gaps in the literature, offer an analytical framework, suggest avenues for future research, and contribute by laying the theoretical foundations and proposing managerial directions for a digital servitization journey toward smart solutions. By so doing, we present the papers accepted to the current IMM special issue on "Moving toward autonomous solutions: The role of Product-Service-Software Systems", which this review article introduces.

AB Light detection and ranging (LiDAR) systems are becoming crucial for measuring the distance and creating a point cloud of the local environment, critical data for artificial intelligence to enable collision-avoidance mechanisms. However, LiDAR utilizes radiation in the near-infrared (NIR) region of the electromagnetic spectrum, which is prone to complete absorption by typical dark (such as painted by carbon black) colored objects, leading to loss of timely data points. Till date a very limited number of solutions have been put forward to address this. Herein, nanocrystallites of copper (II) oxide with specific prevalence of crystal facets that create nearly perfect black material at visible wavelengths are proposed. The sharp transition of absorbance near 700 nm wavelength light is attributed to the near-unity ratio of (-111)/(111) the crystal facets and a crystal size of around 100 angstrom for the (-111) plane. Although indistinguishable from carbon black and with the same degree of measured blackness (M-y value 135.5), the nanocrystalline CuO shows 1500% better detectability by LiDAR. The study paves the way for the unconstrained use of dark objects in future society and infrastructure, moving a step closer toward fully autonomous operation of vehicles and robots.

AB For the autonomous driving system, accurately recognizing the actions of different roles in the traffic scene is the prerequisite for realizing this kind of human-vehicle information interaction. In this paper, we propose a complete framework based on 3D human pose estimation to recognize the actions of different roles on the road. The main objects recognized include traffic police, cyclists, and some passersby in need. We perform action recognition based on a dynamic adaptive graph convolutional network, which can realize the action recognition of objects based on 3D human pose. In addition to the action recognition module, we have optimized both the object detection module and the human pose estimation module in the framework so that the framework can handle multiple objects at the same time, which can be closer to the real traffic scene. To realize complex and changeable human action recognition, we built a multi-view camera system to collect responsible 3D human pose datasets containing traffic police gestures, cyclist gestures, and pedestrians' body movements. In the experiments, compared to other state-of-the-art researches, the proposed framework can achieve comparable results with the same dataset. Satisfactory performance has also been obtained on the real data we collected, which can handle a variety of different action recognition tasks at the same time.

AB Autonomous Mobile Robots (AMRs) have become extremely popular in the manufacturing domain, especially for processes involving large factory floors where these robots are used for transporting materials from one location to another. In an environment where there are multiple prioritized tasks to be completed by a school of AMRs, the overall planning problem can be broken down into three sequential steps: task allocation for the school of AMRs, task scheduling for each AMR, and trajectory planning for each individual AMR. This paper focuses on the trajectory generation procedure for each AMR. Unlike traditional approaches that only consider the location an AMR has to travel to during path planning, here, energy efficiency of the AMR is also considered. We present the physics-based model of the AMR as well as an optimal control formulation for energy-conscientious trajectory generation for the AMR. Methods to numerically solve this problem are discussed, and results are presented for each proposed algorithm on approximately 100 test cases, comparing both performance and computational efficiency. The results show that the presented energy-conscientious methods perform better in terms of energy usage (5-10%) compared to commonly-used shortest path techniques while maintaining similar computational and operational efficiency.

AB We propose a trust and self-confidence-based autonomy allocation strategy to automatically choose between manual and autonomous control of (semi)autonomous mobile robots in guidance and navigation tasks. We utilize a performance-centric, computational trust and self-confidence model and automated autonomy allocation strategy, developed in our earlier work (H. Saeidi and Y. Wang, "Trust and self-confidence based autonomy allocation for robotic systems," in Proc. 54th IEEE Conf. Decis. Control, 2015, pp. 6052-6057.), based on objective and unbiased performance measures for the human and the robot. A set of robot simulations with a human-in-the-loop is conducted for a teleoperated unmanned aerial vehicle tracking task. The results demonstrate that our allocation strategy can capture human autonomy allocation pattern with an accuracy of 64.05%. We also show that the strategy can improve the overall robot performance by 11.76% and reduce operator's workload by 10.07% compared to a manual allocation. Moreover, compared to a performance maximization strategy, our strategy is 23.42% more likely to he accepted and generally preferred and trusted by the participants. Furthermore, we design a decision pattern correction algorithm based on nonlinear model predictive control to help a human operator gradually adapt to a modified allocation pattern for improved overall performance.

AB This letter focuses on an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)-based covert visible light communication system. In the system, the UAV (Alice) sends information to a legitimate user (Bob) covertly while avoiding being detected by a warden (Willie). We analyze the mutual information of the communication channel and the covertness constraint of the detection channel. To improve system performance, we optimize the UAV's height by maximizing the mutual information between Alice and Bob under the UAV's height constraint. Without considering the covertness constraint, we first obtain the optimal height of the UAV, and prove the existence and uniqueness of such an optimal height. Moreover, considering the covertness constraint, we obtain the covert optimal heights under different conditions according to the relationship between the UAV's height and the covertness constraint, and verify the existence of the solutions. Finally, we verify the theoretical analysis by numerical results.

AB In this work, we present the design, implementation, and simulation of a topology-based navigation system for the UX-series robots, a spherical underwater vehicle designed to explore and map flooded underground mines. The objective of the robot is to navigate autonomously in the 3D network of tunnels of a semi-structured but unknown environment in order to gather geoscientific data. We start from the assumption that a topological map has been generated by a low-level perception and SLAM module in the form of a labeled graph. However, the map is subject to uncertainties and reconstruction errors that the navigation system must address. First, a distance metric is defined to compute node-matching operations. This metric is then used to enable the robot to find its position on the map and navigate it. To assess the effectiveness of the proposed approach, extensive simulations have been carried out with different randomly generated topologies and various noise rates.

AB This letter describes and validates the robotic platform of an atmospheric plume monitoring system. The platform consists of a networked flock of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) equipped with environmental sensors. The sensor flock forms an integral component of a dynamic data-driven application system (DDDAS) for plume monitoring. The goal of DDDAS is to dynamically incorporate data into a running simulation while simultaneously using the simulation to steer the measurement process. This letter takes a model-based approach to plume monitoring. From concentration measurements provided by the UAVs, a nonlinear online parameter estimator determines the model parameters. Based on the current knowledge of the model parameters, a hotspot identification routine directs the UAVs to information rich locations, or hotspots. The feasibility of deploying the testbed in uncontrolled outdoor environments is demonstrated with a flight test where three autonomous vehicles trace a simulated plume using simulated sensors.

AB This article presents a novel docking system developed for miniature underwater robots. Recent years have seen an increased diffusion of robots for ocean monitoring, exploration and maintenance of underwater infrastructures. The versatility of those vehicles is extremely affected and limited by energetic constraints and difficulties in updating their mission parameters. Submerged docking stations are a promising solution for providing energy sources and data exchange, thus extending autonomy and mission duration of underwater robots. Furthermore, the docking capability is a novel, but promising approach to enable modularity and reconfigurability in underwater robotics. The authors here propose a hybrid docking system composed of a magnetic alignment unit and a mechanical connection. The former passively aligns and guides the underwater vehicle facilitating a subsequent mechanical connection. The reliability of the system is both analytically investigated and experimentally validated. Finally, the mechanical design of the docking system of two miniature underwater robots is described in detail.

AB Aiming at the problems of strong nonlinearity, strong coupling, and unknown interference encountered in the flight control process of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) in a complex dynamic environment and reinforcement-learning-based algorithm generalization, this study presents an innovative incremental reinforcement-learning-based algorithm for UAV tracking control in a dynamic environment. The main goal is to make a UAV able to adjust its control policy in a dynamic environment. The UAV tracking control task is transformed into a Markov decision process (MDP) and further investigated using an incremental reinforcement-learning-based method. First, a policy relief (PR) method is used to make UAVs capable of performing an appropriate exploration in a new environment. In this way, a UAV controller can mitigate the conflict between a new environment and the current knowledge to ensure better adaptability to a dynamic environment. In addition, a significance weighting (SW) method is developed to improve the utilization of episodes with higher importance and richer information. In the proposed method, learning episodes that include more useful information are assigned with higher importance weights. The numerical simulation, hardware-in-the-loop (HITL) experiments, and real-world flight experiments are conducted to evaluate the performance of the proposed method. The results demonstrate high accuracy and effectiveness and good robustness of the proposed control algorithm in a dynamic flight environment.

AB The COVID-19 pandemic has accelerated the growth of e commerce and automated warehouses, vehicles, and robots and has created new options for grocery supply chains. We report and compare the greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions for a 36-item grocery basket transported along 72 unique paths from a centralized warehouse to the customer, including impacts of micro fulfillment centers, refrigeration, vehicle automation, and last-mile transportation. Our base case is in-store shopping with last-mile transportation using an internal combustion engine (ICE) SUV (6.0 kg CO(2)e). The results indicate that emissions reductions could be achieved by e-commerce with micro-fulfillment centers (16-54%), customer vehicle electrification (18-42%), or grocery delivery (22-65%) compared to the base case. In-store shopping with an ICE pick-up truck has the highest emissions of all paths investigated (6.9 kg CO(2)e) while delivery using a sidewalk automated robot has the least (1.0 kg CO(2)e). Shopping frequency is an important factor for households to consider, e.g. halving shopping frequency can reduce GHG emissions by 44%. Trip chaining also offers an opportunity to reduce emissions with approximately 50% savings compared to the base case. Opportunities for grocers and households to reduce grocery supply chain carbon footprints are identified and discussed.

AB This study presents a computer vision-based approach for representing time evolution of structural damages leveraging a database of inspection images. Spatially incoherent but temporally sorted archival images captured by robotic cameras are exploited to represent the damage evolution over a long period of time. An access to a sequence of time-stamped inspection data recording the damage growth dynamics is premised to this end. Identification of a structural defect in the most recent inspection data set triggers an exhaustive search into the images collected during the previous inspections looking for correspondences based on spatial proximity. This is followed by a view synthesis from multiple candidate images resulting in a single reconstruction for each inspection round. Cracks on concrete surface are used as a case study to demonstrate the feasibility of this approach. Once the chronology is established, the damage severity is quantified at various levels of time scale documenting its progression through time. The proposed scheme enables the prediction of damage severity at a future point in time providing a scope for preemptive measures against imminent structural failure. On the whole, it is believed that the present study will immensely benefit the structural inspectors by introducing the time dimension into the autonomous condition assessment pipeline.

AB Autonomous aerial refueling (AAR) has always been a hot research area due to its significant application and complicated control problem. In order to improve the docking precision of AAR, a novel docking controller with probe direct control and learning-based preview method is proposed. Firstly, the controlled object is transformed from receiver barycenter to probe tactfully. Then, a suitable probe direct controller designed via the combination of reference-observer-based tracking control method and the high order sliding mode control method is proposed for the probe direct control. Furthermore, a learning-based preview method is introduced to solve the tracking lag problem. The prediction of drogue motion is considered in the reference signal. Then, a novel learning algorithm, named deep learning and reinforcement learning (DLRL), which combines deep learning (DL) and reinforcement learning (RL) spatially rather than structurally like deep reinforcement learning (DRL) is proposed to generate the preview time adaptively. And a novel preview index is proposed to adapt for it. Through the combination of probe direct controller and learning-based preview method, the proposed docking controller could improve the tracking precision largely. Effectiveness of the proposed method is demonstrated by the simulations. (C) 2019 Elsevier Masson SAS. All rights reserved.

AB Demand-responsive transit systems are seen as a solution to improve the level of service and decrease the costs of providing transit to rural or low-demand areas. There are great expectations on the impact that driverless demand-responsive transit (DDRT) systems can have on a regional setting. Nevertheless, the application of DDRT in such type of setting has not been widely studied, in particular for scenarios where the system is an addition to the existing alternatives (as characteristic of the early diffusion stage of an innovation). This study provides an assessment of the early-stage operation of a regional DDRT system used by a small portion of the entire potential adopters. A methodological approach is built upon an agent-based model through which the daily operation of a DDRT system is simulated in detail. This approach is applied to a case study in Portugal considering scenarios varying in terms of several operational parameters, adoption rates (from 1 to 20%), and types of services (private versus shared rides). Results show that each vehicle in the DDRT system with shared rides could replace up to 13 private vehicles with a decrease in the vehicle-kilometers traveled of 1%. The DDRT system operation is profitable even with low adoption rates (starting from 2% for the system with shared rides). When considering the adoption rate of 5%, the system with shared rides is 54% more profitable than the one with private rides, but, from the perspective of travelers, shared rides lead to longer waiting times and detours.

AB The media continues to be a prominent and widely embraced channel for obtaining information on various topics, exerting considerable influence in shaping public opinions. This holds particularly true for the realm of automated vehicles (AVs), as the media consistently covers developments in this field, encompassing both positive aspects such as technological advancements, as well as negative occurrences like incidents involving selfdriving cars colliding with pedestrians. The objective of this study was to utilize sentiment analysis techniques to evaluate the portrayal of AV technology in media news coverage. Data was retrieved from Sprinklr using keywords that are often associated with AVs. Over 1.7 million articles were collected on the keywords for relevant articles published between May 1, 2015 to May 24, 2021. Sentiment analysis was carried out on the cleaned data using three different models - VADER, TextBlob, and NRCLex. The sentiment analysis was separately conducted on the title and text of the articles. 2018 recorded the highest number of news articles on the AV technology. The number of negative sentiments in the title of articles published on the web in 2018 increased 12 times compared to the previous year. The negativity induced in 2018 in the news media did not continue in the next year, which explains that the technology experienced short term effects from the negative incidents associated with its early development. The news articles were also found to have subjectivity from the authors in the article text. The findings are expected to stimulate debates among industry players on how to bring the media along the journey of the development and eventual full deployment of AVs.

AB The main objective of this study is to evaluate the safety and operational impacts of an innovative infrastructure solution for safe and efficient integration of Automated Vehicle (AV) as an emerging technology into an existing transportation system. Filling the gap in the limited research on the effect of AV technology on infrastructure standards, this study investigates implications of adding a narrow reversible AV-exclusive lane to the existing configuration of I-15 expressway in San Diego, resulting in a 9 ft AV reversible lane and, in both directions, two 12-feet lanes for HOV and FasTrak vehicles. Given the difference between the operation of AVs and human-driven vehicles and reliance of AVs on sensors as opposed to human capabilities, the question is should we provide narrower AV-exclusive roadways assuming AVs are more precise in lateral and longitudinal lane keeping behaviour? To accomplish the goal of the project, a historical crash data analysis and a traffic simulation analysis were conducted. Crash data analysis revealed that unsafe speed, improper turning, and unsafe lane change are the most recurring primary collision factors on I-15 ELs. AVs' automated longitudinal and lateral control systems could potentially reduce these types of collisions on an AV-exclusive lane with proper infrastructure features for AV sensor operation (e.g., distinct lane marking). Microsimulation findings indicated an AV-exclusive lane may increase traffic flow and density by up to 14% and 24%, respectively. It also showed that average speed is reduced. However, this could lead to the speed differential increase between the exclusive lane and adjacent lane requiring careful consideration if additional treatments or barriers are needed. The results of this study contribute to infrastructure adaptation to AV technology and future AV-exclusive lanes implementations.

AB The world is embracing the presence of connected autonomous vehicles which are expected to play a major role in the future of intelligent transport systems. Given such connectivity, vehicles in the networks are vulnerable to making incorrect decisions due to anomalous data. No sophisticated attacks are required; just a vehicle reporting anomalous speeds would be enough to disrupt the entire traffic flow. Detection of such anomalies is vital to ensure the security of a vehicular network. We propose the use of traffic flow theory for anomalous data detection in vehicular networks, by evaluating the consistency of microscopic parameters which are derived by traffic flow theory (i.e. speed and space-headway) with macroscopic views of traffic under different traffic conditions. Though a little attention has been given to using traffic flow properties to determine anomalous basic safety message (BSM) data, the fundamental nature of traffic flow properties makes it a robust assessment tool. Usually, traffic flow data are determined through roadside units (RSUs) such as cameras and loop detectors; they are financially impractical to roll out on an entire network. Therefore, the method proposed in this study establishes traffic flow data that are used as "ground truth" through RSUs if available, or by the vehicles' own sensor systems. The numerical results indicate that the proposed method provides extremely reliable and consistent predictions of anomalous BSM data. The more the road segment is congested, the higher the accuracy of the anomalous space-headway detection. The anomalous speed detection performs robustly well across all the traffic conditions. The study also finds that both global and local ground truths provide consistent results. (C) 2020 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

ID VEHICULAR NETWORKS
AB Network-based localization plays a key role on the introduction of emerging road applications, such as connected autonomous driving. These applications demand unprecedented precise, reliable and secure positioning, with localization requirements below 1m. This stringent demand is pushing for the use of road-side units (RSUs) from fifth generation and vehicular networks for accurate vehicle localization. However, these networks are not typically designed for positioning but for data communication purposes, which follow a different paradigm for the network deployment and operation. This paper provides design guidelines on dedicated network deployments with the aim of achieving accurate vehicle-to-infrastructure positioning in road scenarios. First, the network layout or site placement is assessed with a geometrical metric. Then, the minimum density of RSUs along the road is bounded with line-of-sight probability models for urban street and highway scenarios. Finally, the Cramer-Rao bound for joint time-of-arrival (ToA) and angle-of-arrival (AoA) localization is used to maximize the distance between RSUs along the road, by exploiting multi-antenna deployments. According to the simulation results, the network sites are recommended to be located at alternate sides of the road, with a maximum distance between RSUs of 40 and 230 m for urban and rural environments, respectively. Following these design guidelines, there is also the need to exploit antenna arrays to combine uplink ToA and AoA estimates, in order to ensure a vehicle location accuracy below one meter on the 95% of the cases. The use of eight antenna elements at the RSUs is found to reduce nearly one and a half times the minimum network density in highway localization deployments.

AB Autonomous navigation of micro-UAVs is typically based on the integration of low cost Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) receivers and Micro-Electro-Mechanical Systems (MEMS)-based inertial and magnetic sensors to stabilize and control the flight. The resulting navigation performance in terms of position and attitude accuracy may not suffice for other mission needs, such as the ones relevant to fine sensor pointing. In this framework, this paper presents a cooperative UAV navigation algorithm that allows a chief vehicle, equipped with inertial and magnetic sensors, a Global Positioning System (GPS) receiver, and a vision system, to improve its navigation performance (in real time or in the post processing phase) exploiting formation flying deputy vehicles equipped with GPS receivers. The focus is set on outdoor environments and the key concept is to exploit differential GPS among vehicles and vision-based tracking (DGPS/Vision) to build a virtual additional navigation sensor whose information is then integrated in a sensor fusion algorithm based on an Extended Kalman Filter. The developed concept and processing architecture are described, with a focus on DGPS/Vision attitude determination algorithm. Performance assessment is carried out on the basis of both numerical simulations and flight tests. In the latter ones, navigation estimates derived from the DGPS/Vision approach are compared with those provided by the onboard autopilot system of a customized quadrotor. The analysis shows the potential of the developed approach, mainly deriving from the possibility to exploit magnetic-and inertial-independent accurate attitude information.

ID AUTONOMOUS VEHICLES; PERFORMANCE; SIMULATION; BENEFITS; POLICY
AB The possible implementation of Automated Vehicles (AVs) in the traffic flow implies that future safety conditions should be assessed by considering promiscuous traffic scenarios (composed of traditional vehicles and AVs). However, real safety performance data related to AVs are still scarce and unreliable. Thus, road safety assessments of future scenarios should necessarily be based on traffic simulations and surrogate safety measures (i.e., related to traffic conflicts, which are different from observed crashes). In the context of traffic simulation, the first step consists in assessing the currently available traffic models to match their characteristics with the possibility of reliably simulating AVs and their behavior in traffic, according to the specific variables of the investigated site (i.e., road type, road geometric design, number of intersections). After the model selection stage, a sensitivity analysis is necessary to identify the most crucial model parameters and their influence on the simulation output, with particular regard to those affecting safety performances. The sensitivity analysis paves the way for making traffic modelers aware of the effects of possible modifications to the simulation parameters in case of AV scenarios. In this research, this procedure was tested on a two-way two-lane rural road network. Among the analyzed traffic models, the Gipps model was highlighted as the most suitable to account for AVs in this specific context. The sensitivity analysis revealed that the most influencing parameters of the Gipps model in the context of safety assessments are: clearance, safety margin factor and sensitivity factor, which were revealed to be greatly influential on all types of traffic conflicts. Two other control tests with different simulated vehicle types were run to highlight the stability of the results coming from the sensitivity analysis in other scenarios.

AB Vehicular Named Data Networking (VNDN) is one of the potential and future networking architectures that allow Connected and Autonomous Vehicles (CAV) to exchange data by simply disseminating the content over the network. VNDN only supports a pull-based data forwarding model, where the content information is forwarded upon request. However, in critical situations, it is essential to design a push-based data forwarding model in order to broadcast the critical data packets without any requests. One of the challenges of push-based data forwarding in VNDN is the broadcasting effect, which occurs when every vehicle broadcasts critical information over the network. For instance, in emergency situations such as accidents, road hazards, and bad weather conditions, the producer generates a critical data packet and broadcasts it to all the nearby vehicles. Subsequently, all vehicles broadcast the same critical data packet to each other, which leads to a broadcast storm on the network. Therefore, this paper proposes a Fuzzy Logic-based Push Data Forwarding (FLPDF) scheme to mitigate the broadcast storm effect. The novelty of this paper is the suggestion and application of a fuzzy logic approach to mitigate the critical data broadcast storm effect in VNDN. In the proposed scheme, vehicles are grouped into clusters using the K-means clustering algorithm, and then Cluster Heads (CHs) are selected using a fuzzy logic approach. A CH is uniquely responsible for broadcasting the critical data packets to all other vehicles in a cluster. A Gateway (GW) has the role of forwarding the critical data packets to the nearest clusters via their GWs. The simulation results show that the proposed scheme outperforms the naive method in terms of transmitted data packets and efficiency. The proposed scheme generates five times fewer data packets and achieves six times higher efficiency than the naive scheme.

AB Introduction: The increased popularity of powered two wheelers (PTWs) in Australia, combined with their vulnerability in the event of a crash, necessitates new strategies to prevent serious injury crashes. The purpose of this study was to use case-series data collected from a recent motorcycle case-control study to analyse contributing factors to crashes using a safe systems approach.
   Methods: A total of 235 injured riders were recruited and completed a questionnaire-based interview, each followed by a detailed inspection of the case motorcycle and crash site by a trained crash investigator. Primary and secondary contributors to the crash were judged based on all available information sources. Analysis of the most frequent contributing factors included separation of cases into single and multi-vehicle crashes. A stepwise logistic regression was used to test for factors associated with human error for multi-vehicle crashes.
   Results: Two thirds of crashes investigated involved another vehicle or read user(s). For multi-vehicle crashes the most common crash scenario involved another vehicle failing to give way to the rider, and the primary contributor was a perception failure or traffic scan error on the part of the other road user. A number of secondary factors were found to be significantly associated with human error type (other road user or rider error), including rider age, traffic density, inappropriate speed of the PTW, and a road design issue. For single vehicle crashes, the most common primary contributor was a misjudgenfent or control error on the part of the rider, with inappropriate speed as the most frequent secondary contributor.
   Conclusions: Despite the complexity of factors involved in PTW crashes resulting in injury, a number of significant associations exist between road users as the primary contributing factor (rider or other road user) and secondary factors, including rider age, traffic density, speed and road design issues.(C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

AB Advanced Driver Assistance Systems (ADAS) are advanced technologies that assist drivers with vehicle operation and navigation. Recent improvements and brisk expansion in the ADAS market, as well as an increase in the frequency of incidents such as sensor spoofing, communication interruption etc., in autonomous vehicles (AVs), have raised the need to research ADAS security technology. The security issues raised by incorporating these technologies into automobiles must be addressed to protect the privacy and safety of passengers and other road users. As a result, the purpose of this research is to investigate the security issues that arise from the integration of ADAS technologies. Addressing these challenges holds the potential to establish a foundation for enhanced safety and dependability within transportation networks amidst the ongoing advancements in vehicle technology. This paper starts by describing the vulnerabilities, threats, assaults, and defense mechanisms of the ADAS. It then delves into the attacks and countermeasures in three categories, namely VANET, Hardware, and Adversarial attacks. VANET attacks encompass threats targeting Vehicular Ad Hoc Networks, aiming to disrupt communication among vehicles or between vehicles and infrastructure. Hardware attacks focus on vulnerabilities within the physical components of ADAS, including sensors, processors, or communication modules. Adversarial attacks involve deliberate manipulations or perturbations introduced into machine learning models or algorithms utilized within ADAS. These attacks aim to deceive or undermine the functionality of AI-based systems, causing misclassification, compromising system integrity, and posing risks to user safety by exploiting vulnerabilities in the AI decision-making process. Finally, this study highlights potential areas for future research, such as the utilization of artificial intelligence (AI), the necessity of industry-wide standardization, and recommends specific future work tailored to each attack described in the corresponding sections.

AB The design of the traditional vehicle human-machine interfaces (HMIs) is undergoing major change as we move towards fully connected and automated vehicles (CAVs). Given the diversity of user requirements and preferences, it is vital for designers to gain a deeper understanding of any underlying factors that could impact usability. The current study employs a range of carefully selected psychological measures to investigate the relationship with self-report usability of an in-CAV HMI integrated into a fully automated Level 5 simulator, during simulated journeys. Twenty-five older adults (65-years+) participated and were exposed to four journeys in a virtual reality fully automated CAV simulator (with video recorded journeys) into which our HMI was integrated. Participants completed a range of scales and questionnaires, as well as computerized cognitive tests. Key measures were: perceived usability of the HMI, cognitive performance, personality, attitudes towards computers, trust in technology, simulator sickness, presence and emotion. HMI perceived usability correlated positively with cognitive performance (e.g., working memory) and some individual characteristics such as trust in technology and negatively with neuroticism anxiety. Simulator sickness was associated negatively with CAV HMI perceived usability. Positive emotions correlated positively with reported usability across all four journeys, while negative emotions were negatively associated with usability only in the case of the last two journeys. Increased sense of presence in the virtual CAV simulator was not associated with usability. Implications for design are critically discussed. Our research is highly relevant in the design of high-fully automated vehicle HMIs, particularly for older adults, and in informing policy-makers and automated mobility providers of how to improve older people's uptake of this technology.

AB The advancement of electrical power steering system (EPSS) in a vehicle system has moved forward for decades. However, before the era of the complete autonomous vehicles comes, many investigations are still underway to improve EPSS characteristics and performance for the human driver interactions, while conducting both actual field tests and indoor HILS. Meanwhile, to replace the costly and time-consuming field tests, the indoor EPSS based HILS has been frequently used as an alternative to explore the characteristics of an actual EPSS and mimic the steering reaction torque created by a real car. However, the recent EPSS Hardware-In-the-Loop (HIL) simulators become computationally expensive, complicated as well as costly by integrating several software(s) with the hardware(s). This might be extravagant for those who wish to practically implement those systems within a limited budget. Therefore, we proposed a compact, cost-effective and minimum hardware-based EPSS HIL simulator interacting with a human driver. Specifically, the dynamic models of 3-D.O.F vehicle and EPSS are constructed on the virtual environment (MATLAB/Simulink), and the dynamic behavior of EPSS, generated by those virtual models, has been mimicked via an actual motor and delivered to actual test participants operating the simulator. The effectiveness and accuracy of the proposed simulator in conjunction with a human driver have been compared with the simulation results of certified Carsim software. In addition, for our future studies, the dynamic responses of the vehicle body and EPSS under the effect of cross-wind have been explored based on the proposed simulator and, the average of human driver's torque to compensate for the effect has been finally addressed.

TI Investigation of Accuracy of TOA and SNR of Radio Pulsar Signals for
   Vehicles Navigation

LA English
DT Article
DE pulsar; radar; GPS; signal processing; navigation
AB It is known that X-ray and gamma-ray pulsars can only be observed by spacecraft because signals from these pulsars are impossible to be detected on the Earth's surface due to their strong absorption by the Earth's atmosphere. The article is devoted to the theoretical aspects regarding the development of an autonomous radio navigation system for transport with a small receiving antenna, using radio signals from pulsars, similar to navigation systems for space navigation. Like GNSS systems (X-ray and radio), they use signals from four suitable pulsars to position the object. These radio pulsars (out of 50) are not uniformly distributed but are grouped in certain directions (at least 6 clusters can be determined). When using small antennas (with an area of up to tens of square meters) for pulsar navigation, the energy of the pulsar signals received within a few minutes is extremely insufficient to obtain the required level of SNR at the output of the receiver to form TOA estimation, ensuring positioning accuracy up to tens of kilometers. This is one of the scientific tasks that is solved in the paper by studying the relationship between the SNR of the receiver output, which depends on the size of the antenna, the type of signal processing, and the magnitude of the TOA accuracy estimate. The second scientific task that is solved in the paper is the adaptation of all the possible approaches and algorithms suggested in the statistical theory of radars in the suggested signal algorithm for antenna processing and to evaluate the parameters of the TOA and DS pulsar signals, in order to increase the SNR ratio at the receiver output, while preserving the dimensions of the antenna. In this paper, the functional structure of signal processing in a pulsar transport navigation system is proposed, and the choice of the observed second and millisecond pulsars for obtaining a more accurate TOA estimate is discussed. The proposed estimates of positioning accuracy (TOA only, no phase) in an autonomous pulsar vehicle navigation system would only be suitable for the navigation of large vehicles (sea, air, or land) that do not require accurate navigation at sea, air, or desert. Large-sized antennas with an area of tens of square meters to hundreds of square meters can be installed in such vehicles.

AB Intelligent tire systems are promising solutions for achieving precise vehicle state estimations, localization, and motion control in the context of autonomous driving. Tire cornering properties, namely, lateral force, aligning moment, and pneumatic trail, are crucial factors that should be accurately estimated for vehicle dynamics control purposes. In this work, a soft sensor for estimating tire cornering properties based on intelligent tire and machine learning is developed. The intelligent tire system is based on a triaxial accelerometer mounted on the inner liner of the tire tread, which provides acceleration measurements from the x, y, and z directions. Partial least squares and variable importance in the projection scores (PLS-VIP) are used in the feature extraction of the acceleration signals over the contact patch. A Gaussian process regression (GPR) model is trained to predict the cornering properties with confidence intervals under different input conditions. Based on the variances in the GPR predictions and minimum mean-square error criterion, a data fusion method for pneumatic trail estimation is proposed. It is demonstrated that the developed GPR models for cornering properties and the data fusion method for pneumatic trail estimation have satisfactory accuracy and reliability. The experimental results show that the soft sensor proposed in this work is a strong candidate for further applications in the development of vehicle state estimation and control algorithms.

AB Ridepooling service options introduced by transportation network companies (TNCs) and microtransit companies provide opportunities to increase shared-ride trips in vehicles, thereby improving congestion and environmental factors. This paper reviews the existing literature available on ridepooling and related services, specifically focusing on pooling options available from on-demand transportation companies. The paper summarizes the existing knowledge on the use of pooled-ride services, factors in travel mode service options for customers, available policy and planning strategies to incentivize sharing vehicles, and effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on shared-ride travel. Overall, research shows that ridepooling options are more likely to be considered by public transit users who have lower household incomes, while ridesourcing users of upper-class backgrounds are less likely to consider moving to a shared-ride service. Travel time and trip cost are the most important factors for travelers determining whether to use a ridesplitting or microtransit service rather than a ride-alone ridesourced trip. Existing policy and planning tools targeting pooled travel or TNCs can be expanded on and specified for on-demand ridepooling services, such as offering better incentives to use shared vehicles and increased access to curb areas or travel lanes, but the most effective strategies will include increasing the user costs for parking or riding alone.

AB Autonomous driving technology is safety-critical and thus requires thorough validation. In particular, the probabilistic algorithms employed in perception systems of autonomous vehicles (AV) are notoriously hard to validate due to the wide range of possible critical scenarios. Such critical scenarios cannot be easily addressed with current manual validation methods, thus there is a need for an automatic and formal validation technique. To this end, we propose a new approach for perception component verification that, given a high-level and human-interpretable description of a critical situation, generates relevant AV scenarios and uses them for automatic verification. To achieve this goal, we integrate two recently proposed methods for the generation and the verification that are based on formal verification tools. First, we use formal conformance test generation tools to derive, from a verified formal model, sets of scenarios to be run in a simulator. Second, we model check the traces of the simulation runs to validate the probabilistic estimation of collision risks. Using formal methods brings the combined advantages of an increased confidence in the correct representation of the chosen configuration (temporal logic verification), a guarantee of the coverage and relevance of automatically generated scenarios (conformance testing), and an automatic quantitative analysis of the test execution (verification and statistical analysis on traces).

AB In this study, a systematic solution for mobile manipulation with the application of autonomous trolley collection in the airport is presented. The developed system features a novel integrated hardware and software system, incorporating a specially designed manipulator capable of tightly catching the trolley. Particularly, we innovatively present a supervisory control guided coarse-to-fine visual trolley catching strategy in large-scale airport environments. At the coarsest level, an image-based visual servoing method is utilized to approach the trolley from far to near, where a learning-based object detection method is adopted to identify trolleys in the environment in real-time. At the finest level, we present an accurate point cloud registration based object pose estimation method to promote the object manipulation with a position-based visual servoing controller. The tightly integrated system and the subsystems are evaluated through conducting experiments in the trolley collection task and comparing the key module with the state of the art. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed framework can find and fetch the trolley robustly. Notably, the proposed object detection and pose estimation methods exhibit higher accuracy, providing credible perceptual approaches for mobile manipulation. Moreover, the proposed framework can be easily extended to other mobile manipulation tasks for object search and retrieval.

AB Benthic accumulations of filamentous, mat-forming bacteria occur throughout the oceans where bisulfide mingles with oxygen or nitrate, providing key but poorly quantified linkages between elemental cycles of carbon, nitrogen and sulfur. Here we used the autonomous underwater vehicle Sentry to conduct a contiguous, 12.5 km photoimaging survey of sea-floor colonies of filamentous bacteria between 80 and 579 m water depth, spanning the continental shelf to the deep suboxic waters of the Santa Barbara Basin (SBB). The survey provided >31?000 images and revealed contiguous, white-colored bacterial colonization coating > similar to 80% of the ocean floor and spanning over 1.6 km, between 487 and 523 m water depth. Based on their localization within the stratified waters of the SBB we hypothesize a dynamic and annular biogeochemical zonation by which the bacteria capitalize on periodic flushing events to accumulate and utilize nitrate. Oceanographic time series data bracket the imaging survey and indicate rapid and contemporaneous nitrate loss, while autonomous capture of microbial communities from the benthic boundary layer concurrent with imaging provides possible identities for the responsible bacteria. Based on these observations we explore the ecological context of such mats and their possible importance in the nitrogen cycle of the SBB.

AB The timely and accurate identification of traffic signs plays a significant role in realizing the autonomous driving of vehicles. However, the size of traffic signs accounts for a low proportion of the input picture, which increases the difficulty of detection. This paper proposes an improved faster R-CNN traffic sign detection method. ResNet50-D feature extractor, attention-guided context feature pyramid network (ACFPN), and AutoAugment technology are designed for the faster R-CNN model. ResNet50-D is selected as the backbone network to obtain more characteristic information. ACFPN is performed to decrease the loss of contextual information. And data augmentation and transfer learning are adopted to make model training more convenient and time-saving. To prove the availability of the proposed method, we compare it with mainstream approaches (SSD, YOLOv3, RetinaNet, cascade R-CNN, FCOS, and CornerNet-Squeeze) and state-of-the-art methods. Experimental results on the CCTSDB dataset show that the improved faster R-CNN achieves the frames per second of 29.8 and the mean average precision of 99.5%, which is superior to the state-of-the-art methods and more suitable for traffic sign detection. Moreover, the proposed model is extended to the Tsinghua-Tencent 100 K (TT100K) dataset and also achieves a competitive detection result.

   detection; autonomous driving
AB Object detection plays a critical role in autonomous driving, but current state-of-the-art object detectors will inevitably fail in many driving scenes, which is unacceptable for safety-critical automated vehicles. Given the complexity of the real traffic scenarios, it is impractical to guarantee zero detection failure; thus, online failure prediction is of crucial importance to mitigate the risk of traffic accidents. Of all the failure cases, False Negative (FN) objects are most likely to cause catastrophic consequences, but little attention has been paid to the online FN prediction. In this paper, we propose a general introspection framework that can make online prediction of FN objects for black-box object detectors. In contrast to existing methods which rely on empirical assumptions or handcrafted features, we facilitate the FN feature extraction by an introspective FN predictor we designed in this framework. For this purpose, we extend the original concept of introspection to object-wise FN predictions, and propose a multi-branch cooperation mechanism to address the distinct foreground-background imbalance problem of FN objects. The effectiveness of the proposed framework is verified through extensive experiments and analysis, and the results show that our method successfully predicts the FN objects with 81.95% precision for 88.10% recall on the challenging KITTI Benchmark, and effectively improves object detection performance by taking FN predictions into consideration.

AB This paper employs correct-by-construction control synthesis, in particular controlled invariant set computations, for falsification. Our hypothesis is that if it is possible to compute a "large enough" controlled invariant set either for the actual system model or some simplification of the system model, interesting corner cases for other control designs can be generated by sampling initial conditions from the boundary of this controlled invariant set. Moreover, if falsifying trajectories for a given control design can be found through such sampling, then the controlled invariant set can be used as a supervisor to ensure safe operation of the control design under consideration. In addition to interesting initial conditions, which are mostly related to safety violations in transients, we use solutions from a dual game, a reachability game for the safety specification, to find falsifying inputs. We also propose optimization-based heuristics for input generation for cases when the state is outside the winning set of the dual game. To demonstrate the proposed ideas, we consider case studies from basic autonomous driving functionality, in particular, adaptive cruise control and lane keeping. We show how the proposed technique can be used to find interesting falsifying trajectories for classical control designs like proportional controllers, proportional integral controllers and model predictive controllers, as well as an open source real-world autonomous driving package.

AB The technical advances in navigation systems should enhance the driving experience, supporting drivers' spatial decision making and learning in less familiar or unfamiliar environments. Furthermore, autonomous driving systems are expected to take over navigation and driving in the near future. Yet, previous studies pointed at a still unresolved gap between environmental exploration using topographical maps and technical navigation means. Less is known about the impact of the autonomous system on the driver's spatial learning. The present study investigates the development of spatial knowledge and cognitive workload by comparing printed maps, navigation systems, and autopilot in an unfamiliar virtual environment. Learning of a new route with printed maps was associated with a higher cognitive demand compared to the navigation system and autopilot. In contrast, driving a route by memory resulted in an increased level of cognitive workload if the route had been previously learned with the navigation system or autopilot. Way-finding performance was found to be less prone to errors when learning a route from a printed map. The exploration of the environment with the autopilot was not found to provide any compelling advantages for landmark knowledge. Our findings suggest long-term disadvantages of self-driving vehicles for spatial memory representations.

ID THREAT
AB The paper presents and discusses a system (xDriver) which uses an Intelligent System of Decision-making (ISD) for the task of car driving. The principal subject is the implementation, simulation and testing of the ISD system described earlier in our publications (Kowalczuk and Czubenko in artificial intelligence and soft computing lecture notes in computer science, lecture notes in artificial intelligence, Springer, Berlin, 2010, 2010, In Int J Appl Math Comput Sci 21(4):621-635, 2011, In Pomiary Autom Robot 2(17):60-5, 2013) for the task of autonomous driving. The design of the whole ISD system is a result of a thorough modelling of human psychology based on an extensive literature study. Concepts somehow similar to the ISD system can be found in the literature (Muhlestein in Cognit Comput 5(1):99-105, 2012; Wiggins in Cognit Comput 4(3):306-319, 2012), but there are no reports of a system which would model the human psychology for the purpose of autonomously driving a car. The paper describes assumptions for simulation, the set of needs and reactions (characterizing the ISD system), the road model and the vehicle model, as well as presents some results of simulation. It proves that the xDriver system may behave on the road as a very inexperienced driver.

AB The number of unmanned aerial system (UAS) applications for supporting rescue forces is growing in recent years. Nevertheless, the analysis of sensed information and control of unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) creates an enormous psychological and emotional load for the involved humans especially in critical and hectic situations. The introduced research project EffFeu (Efficient Operation of Unmanned Aerial Vehicle for Industrial Firefighters) especially focuses on a holistic integration of UAS in the daily work of industrial firefighters. This is done by enabling autonomous mission-guided control on top of the presented overall system architecture, goal-oriented high-level task control, comprehensive localisation process combining several approaches to enable the transition from and to GNSS-supported and GNSS-denied environments, as well as a deep-learning based object recognition of relevant entities. This work describes the concepts, current stage, and first evaluation results of the research project.

AB With the development of aerospace industry, the guidance system of an entry vehicle will be more robust, reliable and autonomous in the future. Based on fuzzy logic, the paper designs a predictor-corrector guidance law. The trajectory prediction is realized by numerical integration. The correction system is based on two fuzzy controllers, which correct the longitudinal motion and lateral motion synergistically. The error of flight range is eliminated by correcting the magnitude of bank angle. The altitude error is eliminated by correcting the attack angle. The lateral error is eliminated by regulating the reversal time of bank angle. Comparing with the traditional corrector based on Newton-Raphson iteration, the method in this paper only needs a single trajectory prediction in one correction cycle, which is favorable for on-board calculation. Moreover, the longitudinal motion and lateral motion are synergistically corrected in the predictor-corrector, which makes the method more robust and flexible.

ID TRAJECTORY GENERATION; LOCALIZATION
AB Enhanced logistics is widely regarded as a key technology to increase flexibility and cost efficiency of today's factories. For example, fully autonomous transport vehicles aim to gradually replace conveyor belts, guided vehicles, and manual labor. In this context, especially omnidirectional robots are appealing thanks to their advanced maneuvering capabilities. In industrial applications, however, accuracy as well as safety and efficiency are key requirements for successful navigation systems. In this paper, we present an accurate navigation system for omnidirectional robots. Our system includes dedicated modules for mapping, localization, trajectory generation and robot control. It has been designed for accurate execution by devising smooth, curvature continuous trajectories, by planning appropriate velocities and by accounting for platform and safety constraints. In this way, it completely utilizes the maneuvering capabilities of omnidirectional robots and optimizes trajectories with respect to time of travel. We present extensive experimental evaluations in simulation and in changing real-world environments to demonstrate the robustness and accuracy of our system.

AB In recent years, cyber-physical systems (CPS) have emerged as a promising direction to enrich the interactions between physical and virtual worlds. In this article, we first present the correlations among machine-to-machine (M2M), wireless sensor networks (WSNs), CPS and internet of things (IoT), and introduce some research activities in M2M, including M2M architectures and typical applications. Then, we review two CPS platforms and systems that have been proposed recently, including a novel prototype platform for multiple unmanned vehicles with WSNs navigation and cyber-transportation systems. Through these reviews, we propose CPS is an evolution of M2M by the introduction of more intelligent and interactive operations, under the architecture of IoT. Also, we especially hope to demonstrate how M2M systems with the capabilities of decision-making and autonomous control can be upgraded to CPS and identify the important research challenges related to CPS designs.

DE H-infinity estimation; Systems with implicit outputs; Robotics

AB This paper addresses the state estimation of a class of continuous-time-affine systems with implicit outputs. We formulate the problem in the deterministic H. filtering setting by computing the value of the state that minimizes the induced L-2-gain from disturbances and noise to estimation error, while remaining compatible with the past observations. To avoid weighting the distant past as much as the present, a forgetting factor is also introduced. We show that, under appropriate observability assumptions, the optimal estimate converges globally asymptotically to the true value of the state in the absence of noise and disturbance. In the presence of noise, the estimate converges to a neighborhood of the true value of the state. We apply these results to the estimation of position and attitude of an autonomous vehicle using measurements from an inertial measurement unit (IMU) and a monocular charged-coupled-device (CCD) camera attached to the vehicle.

AB In this paper, we consider an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)-powered wireless sensor network (WSN) in which a UAV transfers wireless energy to ground sensor (GS) nodes using a directional antenna, and the GS nodes use the harvested energy to transmit sensing information back to the UAV. Considering the tradeoff aspect in adjusting the antenna beamwidth and altitude of the UAV, we jointly optimize the altitude and beamwidth to collect sensing data from all GSs as quickly as possible. The numerical analysis verifies the existence of unique altitude and beamwidth values that minimize the data collection time. The simulation result indicates that the use of a directional antenna and the joint optimization of altitude and beamwidth are essential for maximizing the performance of UAV-powered WSN systems.

AB This paper presents a passive inverted Ultra-Short Baseline (piUSBL) positioning system which provides accurate and instantaneous positioning for small Autonomous Underwater Vehicles (AUVs) at low cost and power consumption. Conventional underwater positioning systems tend to be expensive and bulky, limiting the application of small AUVs. This system is based on an iUSBL positioning system, which places a small circular receiver array on an AUV rather than on a deployment ship. The One-Way Travel-Time (OWTT) range and Direction of Arrival (DOA) between the vehicle and a single acoustic beacon enable AUV navigation relative to the beacon. Deconvolved conventional beamforming (dCv) provides high-resolution azimuth estimation. This paper describes the system design in detail and presents experimental results in an anechoic tank and some field lakes. The piUSBL system shows great potential for small AUVs after several successful AUV applications.

AB Most of the existing trajectory tracking control strategies for vehicles aim at achieving high tracking accuracy but ignore energy consumption and road geometry. This paper proposes a fuel economy-oriented trajectory tracking control strategy for plug-in hybrid electric buses to improve fuel economy while ensuring tracking accuracy under different road geometries in the real world. First, a reference trajectory is reconstructed for trajectory tracking control to simulate the road geometry in real world. Next, a tracking controller based on model predictive control and proportional-integral control is developed to track the reference trajectory. Finally, an optimal control strategy with target preview method based on Pontryagin's minimum principle is developed to achieve the optimal fuel economy while tracking the trajectory. Simulation results illustrate that the proposed control strategy can realize not only excellent trajectory tracking performance but also optimal fuel economy.

AB Pedestrian trajectory prediction is one of the main concerns of computer vision problems in the automotive industry, especially in the field of advanced driver assistance systems. The ability to anticipate the next movements of pedestrians on the street is a key task in many areas, e.g., self-driving auto vehicles, mobile robots or advanced surveillance systems, and they still represent a technological challenge. The performance of state-of-the-art pedestrian trajectory prediction methods currently benefits from the advancements in sensors and associated signal processing technologies. The current paper reviews the most recent deep learning-based solutions for the problem of pedestrian trajectory prediction along with employed sensors and afferent processing methodologies, and it performs an overview of the available datasets, performance metrics used in the evaluation process, and practical applications. Finally, the current work exposes the research gaps from the literature and outlines potential new research directions.

AB Guaranteed state estimation computes the set of possible states of dynamical systems given the bounds of model uncertainties, disturbances, and noises. For the first time, we evaluate and compare a broad class of guaranteed state estimators for linear time-invariant systems regarding scalability, accuracy, and real-time applicability. In particular, we consider strip-based observers, set-propagation observers, and interval observers. The performance of most guaranteed state estimators is significantly affected by the chosen set representation. Zonotopes have emerged as a popular set representation since important operations such as linear maps and Minkowski sum can be computed exactly and efficiently. Furthermore, we provide comparisons with ellipsoids and constrained zonotopes as set representations. The comparison is conducted on various models for state estimation of autonomous vehicles.

AB The control of large greenhouse installations, especially those with hydroponics crops, is based on the analysis and use of data recorded by many sensors. At the same time, the size of such installations does not allow for their effective terrestrial surveillance, to detect problems promptly. In recent years, there has been an interest in the development of autonomous agbots equipped with agricultural sensors. Several ground-based AGV (automated guided vehicles) and UAV (unmanned aerial vehicles) systems have been developed for use in open-air plots. A key feature of all these innovative systems is spectroscopy, the development of which has been assisted by the surveillance capabilities and speed of modern-day UAVs (drones). However, there is a lag in the use of spectroscopy inside greenhouses since UAVs do not move freely indoors. In this paper, we propose as a solution a three-device (3DS) system.

AB This letter reports a general path following framework for the tractor-trailers system in Global Positioning System (GPS)-denied environments. Compared to existing methods, this approach prioritizes a robust, cost-optimized, and easy-to-implement solution. First, to achieve accurate path following, a force sensor is subtly introduced to capture the impact of an arbitrary number of trailers and varying payloads on the tractor dynamics. A robust controller is then designed on the basis of a newly derived tractor dynamic model and the lateral force compensation. Second, a novel visual-inertial estimator, which explicitly considers the nonlinear velocity dynamics, is developed to allow real-time translational velocity and position estimation for dynamic feedback control. It is rigorously proved by the Lyapunov theory that the stability of the proposed estimation and control system is guaranteed. Full-scale experiments are conducted to demonstrate the feasibility of the approach.

AB Autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) is an unmanned tether-free vehicle which is powered by battery or fuel cell. The weight of the AUV is a major issue to be decided when considering its performance. To manufacture a propeller that is lighter in weight and able to carry the pressure applied to the blades is an involving process. The present study investigates the performance of the propeller of an AUV, manufactured by additive manufacturing, using ABS plastic material. The propeller blade designed in SolidWorks was transferred to the CUBPRO (DUO), followed by setting the parameters for a 3D printing machine. A comparative study was carried out for ABS (Acrylonitrile Butadiene Styrene) material between the required dimensions and a 3D printed model dimension propeller blade. An error analysis was carried out and we observed that ABS material is the most suitable for an AUV propeller. A stress-strain analysis for the propeller was carried out using the Finite Element Method.

ID ALGORITHM
AB Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) have gained a lot of attention from the researchers across the globe. Their autonomous capabilities provide vast range of applications such as disaster management, surveillance, border security and inter-civilian activities. UAV networks have a major issue regarding the data flow and routing. UAVs operate in different band as compared to the ground nodes. Hence, there is a chance of congestion that may fail the whole network. Prediction of such congestion states can provide continuous connectivity. For this, a new optimised fruit fly routing protocol (OFFRP) is proposed which uses the properties of existing fruit fly optimisation algorithm for finding appropriate routes. The search of food sources by fruit flies using their smell index forms the basis of the proposed protocol. The proposed protocol is evaluated using standard network simulations and is compared with all the major routing protocols as well as existing TCP-oriented congestion control algorithms.

ID ALGORITHM
AB Gravity matching algorithm is the pivotal technique in gravity-aided navigation, which is the main method in the application of underwater autonomous vehicle. TERCOM algorithm is one of the classical matching algorithms in this research field. Due to the characteristic of inertial navigation system (INS) location error, an affine or a rigid transformation relationship between actual vehicle trajectory and INS-indicated trajectory is assumed to be existed. In order to improve the accuracy of TERCOM algorithm, a mismatch diagnostic method based on the restricted spatial order constraints (RSOC) algorithm from image registration is assisted. RSOC strategy integrates spatial order constraints and decision criteria restrictions to screen outliers in a matched sequence. It is obtained that the mismatch diagnostic method can select the mismatched points accurately. Therefore, the matching algorithm with mismatch detection mechanism has better performance. The reliability and accuracy of the method are verified via simulation tests.

AB Collaborative autonomous landing of a quadrotor Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) on a moving Unmanned Ground Vehicle (UGV) presents challenges due to the need for accurate real-time tracking of the UGV and the adjustment for the landing policy. To address this challenge, we propose a progressive learning framework for generating an optimal landing policy based on vision without the need of communication between the UAV and the UGV. First, we propose the Landing Vision System (LVS) to offer rapid localization and pose estimation of the UGV. Then, we design an Automatic Curriculum Learning (ACL) approach to learn the landing tasks under different conditions of UGV motions and wind interference. Specifically, we introduce a neural network-based difficulty discriminator to schedule the landing tasks according to their levels of difficulty. Our method achieves a higher landing success rate and accuracy compared with the state-of-the-art TD3 reinforcement learning algorithm.

AB Demand-Side Management systems aim to modulate energy consumption at the customer side of the meter using price incentives. Current incentive schemes allow consumers to reduce their costs, and from the point of view of the supplier play a role in load balancing, but do not lead to optimal demand patterns. In the context of charging fleets of electric vehicles, we propose a centralised method for setting overnight charging schedules. This method uses evolutionary algorithms to automatically search for optimal plans, representing both the charging schedule and the energy drawn from the grid at each time-step. In successive experiments, we optimise for increased state of charge, reduced peak demand, and reduced consumer costs. In simulations, the centralised method achieves improvements in performance relative to simple models of non-centralised consumer behaviour. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI A hybrid frequency-time domain technique for ground effect
   identification
SO AERONAUTICAL JOURNAL
LA English
DT Article
AB The estimation from flight data of aerodynamic parameters for vehicle in steady-state conditions, perturbed by an identification manoeuvre, is a well-established technology, whereas system identification from dynamic flight data is a subject of continuous interest. This paper presents a hybrid frequency and time domain technique for identification of vehicle longitudinal aerodynamic model, including the ground effect. Identification is performed in the framework of a multi-step approach, in which, first aerodynamic coefficients are estimated in the frequency domain, using an equation error method; then time domain techniques are applied to identify out of ground effect aerodynamic derivatives and ground effect model parameters. The technique was successfully applied to flight data of an experimental ultra light aircraft. Identification results showed that the proposed method works properly also in the dynamic phases of the flight or when no dedicated identification manoeuvres are executed. Moreover, the identified longitudinal aerodynamic model was used to design the flight control system that successfully performed many autonomous landings.

ID AUTONOMOUS VEHICLES; ABSENCE
AB Path planning is one of the most focused on problems in the field of autonomous robots. The autonomous robot should pass around obstacles from a given starting position to a goal position without touching them. Research on path planning has pursued many different approaches to the solution of this problem, in which the A* algorithm is one of the outstanding approaches that has been widely disseminated in applications, but the algorithm utilizes a large amount of time. Therefore, an alternative Partitioning-Based Path Planning approach, namely PBPP, is proposed to reduce time consumption using a hierarchical partitioning method to improve the A* algorithm. A combination of the two concepts, the coarse-to-fine grid map representation and the A* path planner, which achieves a near-shortest path in O(n(2)) computational complexity is the main contribution of the study. Conceptually, the PBPP uses the principle of divide-and-conquer to divide the global map into several sub-maps in which individual collision-free spaces are able to be decomposed and represented. With the subdivided maps, hierarchical planning can provide a more feasible direction to achieve a smooth path in the result of the optimal path. The experimental results demonstrate the PBPP's utility for reducing time-consumption and finding the shortest path.

AB Multi-sensor integration is necessary to provide high-precision navigation solutions for autonomous vehicles. Land-vehicles often rely on global navigation satellite systems (GNSS) to acquire its position. However, there are some environments where GNSS signals are unavailable, such as indoor-parking garages, tunnels, and under bridges. Additional sensors are required to allow reliable positioning regardless of location. The vehicle's on-board low cost inertial sensors (accelerometers and gyroscopes) are used for positioning in GNSS-denied environments. Despite their fidelity in short-term usage, inertial navigation systems (INS) are susceptible to drifts in their positioning solution due to the inherent inertial sensor errors, causing positioning errors over time in prolonged scenarios, such as indoor-parking garages. Modern land-vehicles can be equipped with a diversified set of perception systems (e.g. LiDAR, cameras) to provide information about the surrounding environment. These systems are well-studied in literature to provide accurate positioning. Yet, the performance of these systems may degrade in weather conditions such as heavy snow or rain, and may fail in degraded vision environments. The proposed research addresses some of the limitations of current positioning technologies for land vehicles by integrating low-cost on-board motion sensors with the all-weather electronic scanning radar (ESR) systems presently used in adaptive cruise control. This research employs a method of estimating the vehicle position based on multiple ESR systems. Integration with the on-board motion sensors guarantees continuous positioning estimation for uninterrupted navigation. The multi-sensor system integration utilizes extended Kalman filter (EKF) with a unique dynamic tuning approach for reliable and uninterrupted positioning. The proposed solution was examined in real GNSS-denied scenario of an indoor parking. This research has reached an uninterrupted self-contained EKF-based multi-sensor positioning system providing less than 2m error 90% of the time in a GNSS-denied environment for up to four minutes.

AB Cooperative driving is an essential component of future intelligent road systems. It promises greater safety, reducing accidents due to drivers distraction, improved infrastructure utilization, and fuel consumption reduction with platooning applications. Proper platoon management requires inter-vehicular communication (IVC), longitudinal control and lateral control for stability and safety, and proper application protocols and algorithms to manage platoons and perform coordinated maneuvers. This paper shows, how a longitudinal controller based on distributed consensus can, at the same time, guarantee stability and performance in regime platoon operations, and be at the hearth of maneuvering protocols and algorithms, as it remains stable in face of changes of platoon topology and control gains. The adoption of a single control algorithm for two fundamental tasks greatly simplify the overall design of the system and improves stability and safety as it is not required to switch between different controllers during platoon operation. The theoretical properties are proven in the first part of the paper. The second part of the paper is devoted to its implementation in a state-of-the-art mobility and IVC simulator, which is used for an extensive experimental campaign showing the dynamic properties of the system and its performance in a set of typical platoon maneuvers as join, leave, and inclusion of a vehicle in the middle of the platoon. All simulations include realistic details of the vehicle dynamics (mass, dimensions, power train dynamics) as well as extremely detailed modeling of the communication network, from IEEE 802.11p protocol details, to collisions, packet errors, path loss and fading on the channel, and source-destination-based delays.

AB This paper proposes an autonomous navigation solution for an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) in an unknown and Global Navigation Satellite System (GNNS)-denied environment using a goal-aware robocentric reference frame. A combined Proportional Navigation (PN)-guidance and obstacle avoidance controller is developed to help navigate the UAV to a user-defined goal by successfully avoiding obstacles along its path. An extended Kalman filter is used to estimate the relative orientation of the UAV with respect to the goal and other objects of interest in the environment (called landmarks). This work uses a bearing-only measurement model based on the positions of the goal and landmarks provided by a visual tracker. A detailed two-dimensional observability analysis is performed and the proposed goal-aware solution is shown to provide more information about the system than a general robocentric approach. The problem formulation is corroborated through extensive simulation and hardware results.

AB As 5G technology becomes operational and continues to expand, smart cities become a reality that is transforming urban life at a rapid pace. Electric Vehicles (EV) and automated driving, equipped with Battery Energy Storage Systems (BESSs), are expected to dominate public transportation in smart cities. While new technologies can facilitate efficiency and reduce the costs in a city, they can also present challenges. This paper provides an overview of the technical challenges of real-time monitoring and control of Energy Storage Systems (ESSs) for EVs in smart cities. It also covers the Internet-of-the-Things (IoT) technology that can be utilized to address the challenges and improve the efficiency of Battery Management Systems (BMS). Autonomous Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs) in smart cities provide the infrastructure to support advanced EV features, such as self-parking. IoT sensors can also be used to determine the State-of-Charge (SoC) in EVs by data-driven methods and cloud computing services.

AB In this paper, target hunting aims to detect target and surround the detected target in a surface-water using Multiple Autonomous Underwater Vehicles (multi-AUV) in a given area. The main challenge in multi-AUV target hunting is the design of AUV's motion path and coordination mechanism. To conduct the cooperative target hunting by multi-AUV in a surface-water environment, an integrated algorithm based on improved potential field (IPF) is proposed. First, a potential field function is established according to the information of the surface-water environment. Then, the dispersion degree, the homodromous degree, and district-difference degree are introduced to increase the cooperation of the multi-AUV system. Finally, the target hunting is solved by embedding the three kinds of degree into the potential field function. The simulation results show that the proposed approach is applicable and feasible for multi-AUV cooperative target hunting.

AB This letter considers covert communications in the context of unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) networks, where a UAV is employed as a base station to transmit covert data to a legitimate ground user, while ensuring that the data transmission cannot be detected by a warden. Aiming at maximizing the legitimate user's average effective covert throughput (AECT), the UAV's trajectory and transmit power are jointly optimized. Taking advantage of deep reinforcement learning (DRL) on solving dynamic and unpredictable problems, we develop a twin-delayed deep deterministic policy gradient aided covert transmission algorithm (TD3-CT), to determine the UAV's optimal trajectory and transmit power. Furthermore, by introducing a reward shaping mechanism, the convergence of the algorithm is guaranteed. The experiment results show that the developed TD3-CT algorithm not only enables the covert transmission but also significantly improves its performance in termed of achieving a higher AECT, compared with the benchmark schemes.

AB This study examines teachers' perceptions of the specific factors and conditions which shape international communities of practice as successful vehicles for their professional development. Data were collected through semi-structured interviews with thirteen teachers in Poland who have extensive experience working in a wide range of international professional development settings. The findings indicate that teachers perceived international communities to be a unique platform for their professional development because they offered multi-layered topographies for professional growth; created space for the collective organisation of development activities in diverse, autonomous teams working on challenging topics; and allowed for sharing teaching stories, reflecting on practice, as well as feeling affirmed/affirming others. Based on the results, recommendations are made for future research and policies which enrich communities within and across schools by providing teachers with the flexibility to discover and build international communities.

AB This paper presents a method for planning optimal trajectories with a team of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) performing autonomous cinematography. The method is able to plan trajectories online and in a distributed manner, providing coordination between the UAVs. We propose a novel non-linear formulation for this challenging problem of computing multi-UAV optimal trajectories for cinematography; integrating UAVs dynamics and collision avoidance constraints, together with cinematographic aspects like smoothness, gimbal mechanical limits and mutual camera visibility. We integrate our method within a hardware and software architecture for UAV cinematography that was previously developed within the framework of the MultiDrone project; and demonstrate its use with different types of shots filming a moving target outdoors. We provide extensive experimental results both in simulation and field experiments. We analyze the performance of the method and prove that it is able to compute online smooth trajectories, reducing jerky movements and complying with cinematography constraints.

AB The solution of fleet assignment problems is one of the core points in the management of a car-rental company. These problems arise from the restrictions imposed by the acceptance of reservations of the customers and from the necessity of an arrangement of the cars at the different depots for attending these bookings. However, with the coming of driverless cars, the rearrangement of vehicles among the depots can be simplified since no staff must be responsible of these tasks. In this note, we show a heuristic algorithm that permits to minimize the number of cars that have to be subcontracted from an external provider in order to attend a list of reservations from customers. Its efficacy is shown in comparison with the solution given by the integer linear programming method. These results can be of interest for other autonomous systems that need to be controlled.

AB In this paper we investigate the structure and motion problem for calibrated one-dimensional projections of a two-dimensional environment. The theory of one-dimensional cameras are useful in several areas, e.g. within robotics, autonomous guided vehicles, projection of lines in ordinary vision and vision of vehicles undergoing so called planar motion. In a previous paper the structure and motion problem for all cases with non-missing data was classified and solved. Our aim is here to classify all structure and motion problems, even those with missing data, and to solve them. In the classification we introduce the notion of a prime problem. A prime problem is a minimal problem that does not contain a minimal problem as a sub-problem. We further show that there are infinitely many such prime problems. We give solutions to four prime problems, and using the duality of Carlsson these can be extended to solutions of seven prime problems. Finally we give some experimental results based on synthetic data.

AB In conditionally automated driving, drivers are required to respond to takeover requests (TORs) and resume manual driving of the vehicle in situations where the conditionally automated driving systems are ineffective. Prior to TORs, the driver may be engaged in Non-Driving Related Tasks (NDRTs), and their manual driving performance after the takeover transition (post-automation) may require time to return to normal. This study investigated the influences of NDRTs on manual driving performance during the post-automation period. Seventeen volunteers participated in this driving simulator study. There were three NDRTs: writing business emails (working condition), watching videos (entertaining condition), and taking a break with eyes closed (resting condition). The duration of engagement in each NDRT before resuming manual driving was either 5 min (short interval) or 30 min (long interval). When TORs were made, drivers were given 10 s (TOR lead time) to switch from an NDRT to manual driving and then continue driving on a straight highway for 5 min. The results demonstrated that driving performance was impaired during the post-automation period. A significant detrimental effect on driving performance was observed for all three NDRT conditions and both task engagement durations. This effect was particularly evident for lane control, where drivers on average spent 4-8 s per minute outside of their lane for each of the five minutes following the TOR. These results indicate that driver engagement in other tasks, even for brief periods, can increase accident risk during the minutes following a TOR. Analysis of individual driving performance revealed a subset of 5 drivers who were strongly impaired, spending 10-25 s per minute outside of their lane throughout the post-automation period. These unsafe drivers could be accurately identified from their driving behaviour during the pre-automation (control) period. Surprisingly, participants were unaware that their degraded driving performance following the takeover. These findings extend the understanding of the disruptive effect of cognitive set-switching while driving and have important implications for the design and safety of autonomous vehicles.

AB For autonomous navigation, three main functions are essential: finding the location, creating the mapping, and getting the optimum path. Since Human operators study the map and correlate it to aerial pictures to locate target locations, consistent localization and mapping concurrently are challenging tasks. Light detection and ranging (LiDAR) can create a 2-dimensional (2D) map and generate positional data for the indoor area, but it fails in the presence of a dynamic object. The global positioning systems (GPS) data offering precise location tracking in outdoor spaces can tackle the weakness of LiDAR. Therefore, we design a robot operating system (ROS) based vehicular system integrating GPS and LiDAR data. The Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU) is used to make an educated approximation for LiDAR registration. A Rao-Blackwellized particle filter (RBPF) based Gmapping algorithm has been retreated in the proposed system using sensors data for navigation and mapping, where each particle has its map of the surrounding. The computational complexity due to large particle formation in RBPF is solved using Gaussian distribution based convergence. The experiments are carried out in moderate room size and large size room environments with obstacles and without obstacles. It generates a 2D map of unknown environments minimizing the cumulative error due to relative measurement of LiDAR data. The proposed system provides autonomous driving in an unfamiliar environment increasing localization accuracy by solving the error accumulation problem in an unconstraint environment. The Gmapping based proposed implementation succeeded to generate maps accurately with a trajectory error of about 0.094 cm.

AB The current advancement of robotics, especially in Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS), leads to a prominent combination between the mining industry and connected-embedded technologies. This progress has arisen in the form of state-of-the-art automated giant vehicles with Autonomous Haulage Systems (AHS) that can transport ore without human intervention. Like CPS, AHS enable autonomous and/or remote control of physical systems (e.g., mining trucks). Thus, similar to CPS, AHS are also susceptible to cyber attacks such as Wi-Fi De-Auth and GPS attacks. With the use of the AHS, several mining activities have been strengthened due to increasing the efficiency of operations. Such activities require ensuring accurate data collection from which precise information about the state of the mine should be generated in a timely and consistent manner. Consequently, the presence of secure and reliable communications is crucial in making AHS mines safer, productive, and sustainable. This paper aims to identify and discuss the relation between safety of AHS in the mining environment and both cybersecurity and communication as well as highlighting their challenges and open issues. We survey the literature that addressed this aim and discuss its pros and cons and then highlight some open issues. We conclude that addressing cybersecurity issues of AHS can ensure the safety of operations in the mining environment as well as providing reliable communication, which will lead to better safety. Additionally, it was found that new communication technologies, such 5G and LTE, could be adopted in AHS-based systems for mining, but further research is needed to considered related cybersecurity issues and attacks.

AB Due to the complex and changing interactions in dynamic scenarios, motion forecasting is a challenging problem in autonomous driving. Most existing works exploit static road graphs to characterize scenarios and are limited in modeling evolving spatio-temporal dependencies in dynamic scenarios. In this letter, we resort to dynamic heterogeneous graphs to model the scenario. Various scenario components including vehicles (agents) and lanes, multi-type interactions, and their changes over time are jointly encoded. Furthermore, we design a novel heterogeneous graph convolutional recurrent network, aggregating diverse interaction information and capturing their evolution, to learn to exploit intrinsic spatio-temporal dependencies in dynamic graphs and obtain effective representations of dynamic scenarios. Finally, with a motion forecasting decoder, our model predicts realistic and multi-modal future trajectories of agents and outperforms state-of-the-art published works on several motion forecasting benchmarks.

AB In this letter, a novel aerial reconfigurable intelligent surface (ARIS) assisted covert communication framework is proposed, where RIS is mounted on unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) to enhance the covert performance of ground transceivers in the presence of a warden. The detection performance of warden is first analyzed, and then a covert energy efficiency (CEE) maiximization problem is formulated by jointly optimizing power control, passive beamforming, and UAV trajectory. To solve the non-convex problem, an algorithm based on alternating optimization is devised to achieve the suboptimal solution. Numerical evaluations show that the proposed scheme has a larger CEE gain than the scheme without RIS under the condition of more reflecting elements. Moreover, the proposed scheme can achieve near-same covertness performance at a lower energy consumption cost compared with covert transmission rate maximization scheme.

AB Techniques for identifying potholes on road surfaces aim at developing strategies for real-time or offline identification of potholes, to support real-time control of a vehicle (for driver assistance or autonomous driving) or offline data collection for road maintenance. For these reasons, research around the world has comprehensively explored strategies for the identification of potholes on roads. This paper starts with a brief review of the field; it classifies developed strategies into several categories. We, then, present our contributions to this field by implementing strategies for automatic identification of potholes. We developed and studied two techniques based on stereo-vision analysis of road environments ahead of the vehicle; we also designed two models for deep-learning-based pothole detection. An experimental evaluation of those four designed methods is provided, and conclusions are drawn about particular benefits of these methods.

AB The transportation system is gradually migrating toward autonomous, electric and intelligent vehicles. Wireless-enabled vehicles along with infrastructure units on the road are connected with traffic management centers that use intelligent data analysis tools to efficiently manage city's traffic. However, such wireless connectivity can make the ITS networks vulnerable to security threats; thus, impacting the application's reliability. On the other hand, the use of robust security techniques could hamper applications' quality of service (QoS). To understand the interplay between these two conflicting requirements, this article reviews the security and QoS design challenges in the ITS aspect of smart cities. Using an experimental test-bed, we evaluate the standard compliant security processing delays, develop an on-line tool that presents detailed security benchmark results, and study the impact of security on QoS using simulation results. We also discuss how machine learning based adaptive signature verification techniques can enhance QoS in ITS. We further present future opportunities to optimize the security QoS balance for ITS applications.

AB A trajectory control problem for simple micro air vehicles (MAVs) is introduced and studied. The MAVs are endowed with the ability to estimate their position and velocity and can control their drag coefficient. The objective of this work is to design a control law for the drag coefficient in order to land the MAV close to a desired streamwise location, after being dropped from an airborne carrier at low altitude. We use a simple model-predictive control law, relying on a two-dimensional time-averaged atmospheric velocity field, which is validated on an unsteady three-dimensional representation of an unstratified atmospheric boundary layer. The simulation results show that the proposed control law results in a significant (10-fold) improvement in the accuracy of the streamwise landing point location, with respect to the uncontrolled case. Similar results are obtained when errors are considered in the location of the release point and in the estimate of the mean flowfield.

AB Line-of-sight radio control has received widespread acceptance for use in many mining methods because today's technology offers improved economic and personnel safely. Significant advances in higher autonomy for mining machines are not currently seeing widespread use even though they offer great future potential. With autonomous capabilities being a longer-term goal a logical sequence of advances based on TeleRemote control is proposed. Under TeleRemote control, the operator is in direct control of the machine at all limes. Three levels of TeleRemote control systems are presented including line-of-sight, extended line-of-sight and full load-haul-dump applications Distributed control and sensing subsystems arranged in a vehicle control area network support incremental system expansion through the three levels of TeleRemote control and prepare the machine for integration of higher levels of automation as mature technology becomes available. This approach allows full exploitation of today's mining automation technology with a flexible future growth path.

AB In this study, a local dynamic predictive control framework combined with Levy flight (LDPC-Levy) method is proposed to assist autonomous underwater vehicles (AUV) and unmanned surface vehicles (USV) in target search missions without prior information in unknown ocean environments. The LDPC-Levy method allocates sub-regions to be searched for AUVs and simultaneously plans the appropriate position for USVs to ensure a reasonable communication distance while exploring the environment and searching for the targets. To solve the optimization problem in LDPC-Levy method, an improved remora optimization algorithm (IROA) is utilized with a restart strategy based on the concept of the firework algorithm (FWA) and simulated annealing (SA). The simulation results show that the LDPC-Levy method has significant advantages over random search and parallel line methods in terms of space exploration rate, search uniformity, and stability of the number of marked targets, while being robust against partial failure.

AB Today, traffic lights are widely used in places with high vehicle traffic. Especially in autonomous vehicles, fast and high accuracy detection and recognition of traffic lights are critical. Machine learning methods are generally used to do this. Deep learning models give more successful results than machine learning methods in detecting the exact location of traffic lights in different climatic conditions. In this study, Faster R-CNN Inception v2 deep learning model was trained and tested on two different datasets that we prepared and published publicly under variable traffic and climatic conditions in Turkey. Successful results were obtained with fewer data by using the Transfer Learning method with the help of TensorFlow Object Detection API in the training of the model. It has been shown that the datasets we have prepared can be developed considering the conditions in other countries and successful results will be obtained.

AB Helicopters are well-known by their hovering capabilities. However, the performance of this valuable feature can be seriously affected by external disturbances such as wind effects. The latter could be even more significant when dealing with small-size helicopters, which are commonly adopted as base platforms for developing unmanned aerial vehicles. Motivated by this context, this work proposes an augmented configuration for performing more stable hovering maneuvers that consists of the unmanned helicopter itself, a tether connecting the helicopter to the ground, and a device on ground adjusting the tether tension. A modeling analysis on the inherent benefits to the proposed configuration as well as the control guidelines to exploit such potentialities are presented in this paper. As a proof a concept, a first basic implementation of the control structure for the entire system is also included. Finally, several demonstrating simulations under artificially generated wind influences are presented to endorse the validity of the proposed approach.

AB This paper presents a three-dimensional (3D) localization and attitude estimation system to track a Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) using a single camera without prior knowledge of the environment. The hardware system consists of a Dynamic Vision Sensing (DVS) camera, a circle-shaped blinking marker made by Light-Emitting Diodes (LEDs), and a base station computer. The algorithm for spatial localization and attitude estimation includes a temporal video filter, triangulation-based location and attitude estimation, and 3D real-time plotting with a graphical user interface (GUI). The temporal video filter processes the image stream from the DVS camera to identify the frequency of the marker and removes the background image. The circle-shaped marker creates an ellipse in the image, whose diameter length and angles are utilized for calculating the location and attitude of the UAV, which offers a low-computing overhead. The proposed system has been evaluated in hardware flight testing. The results are compared with the benchmark data from both the infrared motion capturing system for localization and the on-board inertial measurement units of the UAV for attitude estimation. The accuracy and detection range surpasses similar state-of-the-art systems. The proposed method provides a simple yet accurate solution for tracking the location and attitude of a UAV.

AB Integration of Global Positioning System (GPS) and Inertial Navigation System (INS) technologies, which has widespread usage in industry, is also regarded as an ideal solution for automated agriculture because it fulfils the accuracy, reliability and availability requirements of industrial and agricultural applications. Agriculture applications use position, velocity and heading information for automated vehicle guidance and control to enhance the yield and quality of the crop, and in order to vary the application of fertilizer and herbicides according to soil heterogeneity at sub-field level. A loosely coupled GPS/INS integration algorithm known as "AhrsKf" is introduced for automated agriculture vehicle guidance and control utilizing MEMS inertial sensors and GPS. The AhrsKf can produce high-frequency attitude solutions for the vehicle's guidance and control system, by using inputs from a single survey grade L1/L2 antenna, eliminating the need for the previous two antenna solutions. Given its agricultural application, the AhrsKf has been implemented with some specific design features to improve the accuracy of the attitude solution including, temperature compensation of the inertial sensors, and the aid of plough lines of farm lands. To evaluate the AhrsKf solution, two bench-marking tests have been conducted by using a three-antenna GPS system and NovAtel's SPAN-CPT. The results have demonstrated that the AhrsKf solution is stable and can correctly track the movement of the farming vehicle.

AB Barkley Canyon is one of the few known sites worldwide with the occurrence of thermogenic gas seepage and formation of structure-II and structure-H gas hydrate mounds on the seafloor. This site is the location of continuous seafloor monitoring as part of the Ocean Networks Canada (ONC) cabled observatory off the west coast off Vancouver Island, British Columbia, Canada. We combine repeat remotely operated vehicle (ROV) seafloor video observations, mapping with an autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV), ship-, ROV-, and AUV-based identification of gas flares, as well as seismic and Chirp data to investigate the distribution of fluid migration pathways. Geologically, the site with the prominent gas hydrate mounds and associated fluid seepage is covering an area of similar to 0.15 km(2) and is situated on a remnant of a rotated fault block that had slipped off the steep flanks of the north-east facing canyon wall. The gas hydrate mounds, nearly constant in dimension over the entire observation period, are associated with gas and oil seepage and surrounded by debris of chemosynthetic communities and authigenic carbonate. The formation of gas hydrate at and near the seafloor requires additional accommodation space created by forming blisters at the seafloor that displace the regular sediments. An additional zone located centrally on the rotated fault block with more diffuse seepage (similar to 0.02 km(2) in extent) has been identified with no visible mounds, but with bacterial mats, small carbonate concretions, and clam beds. Gas venting is seen acoustically in the water column up to a depth of similar to 300 m. However, acoustic water-column imaging during coring and ROV dives showed rising gas bubbles to much shallower depth, even <50 m, likely a result of degassing of rising oil droplets, which themselves cannot be seen acoustically. Combining all observations, the location of the gas hydrate mounds is controlled by a combination of fault-focused fluid migration from a deeper reservoir and fluid seepage along more permeable strata within the rotated slope block. Fluids must be provided continuously to allow the sustained presence of the gas hydrate mounds at the seafloor.

AB Background and objective: Recent research and tested data suggested that spinal injuries occur more often in a frontal impact. Most of the published information is focused on the lumbar spinal injury with respect to axial compression force by varying the height of drops. Parametric studies on the lumbar spinal injury are very scanty. Therefore, the present investigation aimed to optimize the effects of drop height, torso weight and seat angle on the characterization of lumbar injury criteria
   Methods: A detailed finite element model of a spine with multi-segmented spinal columns is developed and validated with the experimental or cadaveric tests using CORA evaluation. Hence, Dynamic loading studies or weight drop techniques were used to characterize the effect of drop height, seat angle and torso weight of the upper body on the lumbar spinal injury during a frontal impact. Parametric simulations were carried out using response surface methodology (RSM). Test of significance (p < 0.05) on the parameters was carried out using ANOVA. Desirability Function Approach is used to optimize the parameters for better safety design.
   Results: The result shows that all the factors considered in the experiment are related to the risk of lumbar spinal injury during the frontal impact. All the factors selected, the drop height, torso weight and the seat angle were the most prominent element in determining the lumbar spinal injury. The injury increased with the increase in the posture angle of the seat. Optimal parameters were determined for the better safety of the occupants as seat angle of 105, drop height 500 mm and torso weight of 25 kg in vehicle design. During vertical impact, posterior undergoes maximum impact in the portions of vertebra and confirmed with the patient case study fracture of vertical drop incident.
   Conclusions: This research insight gives an improved understanding of the parametric influence of design alternatives to minimize the risk of lumbar spinal injury in automotive vehicles. The optimal combination of drop height and the seat angle provides futuristic view on autonomous vehicle seat design. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Electric vehicles (EVs) are expected to take over the transportation and mobility market over traditional internal combustion engine (ICE) vehicles soon. The internal power demands of EVs are expected to increase. The reason for this is to achieve a longer driving range for the EV and to provide the required power for the low-voltage (LV) network auxiliary loads. To illustrate, there are extra added sensors, cameras, and small actuating motors, especially for future autonomous vehicles. Therefore, a new electrical/electronic (E/E) architecture is required to convert the high-voltage (HV) traction battery voltage (e.g., 320-800 V DC) to the standard LV levels with high current ratings of 5 kW and more. This HV-LV DC-DC converter is known in the literature as an auxiliary power module (APM). The standard LV rails in an EV are the 12 V/24 V rail to supply for an instant the EV's lighting and electronic control units (ECUs), while the 48 V rail is required for propulsive loads, such as air compressors and electric power steering systems. Furthermore, in a few applications, this converter is responsible for voltage upwards to support the start of a hybrid vehicle or emergency backup power handling, which requires bidirectional capability. Therefore, in this paper, possible APM topologies for EV applications are presented. In line with this, the main standards and safety requirements of the APMs are presented. Detailed quantitative and qualitative comparisons between topologies and their associated control schemes are discussed. In addition, the placement of the APM in the EV cooling cycle has been investigated and demonstrated. Finally, the industrial trends and future research targets for the APM in automotive applications are outlined.

AB Automated vehicles (AV) have the potential to provide cost-effective mobility options along with overall system-level benefits in terms of congestion and vehicular emissions. Additional resource allocation at the network level, such as AV-exclusive lanes, can further foster the usage of AVs rendering this mode of travel more attractive than legacy vehicles (LV). However, it is necessary to find the crucial locations in the network where providing these dedicated lanes would reap the maximum benefits. In this study, we propose an integrated mixed-integer programming framework for optimal AV-exclusive lane design on freeway networks which accounts for commuters' demand split among AVs and LVs via a logit model incorporating class-based utilities. We incorporate the link transmission model (LTM) as the underlying traffic flow model due to its computational efficiency for system optimum dynamic traffic assignment. The LTM is modified to integrate two vehicle classes namely, LVs and AVs with a lane-based approach. The presence of binary variables to represent lane design and the logit model for endogenous demand estimation results in a nonconvex mixed-integer nonlinear program formulation. We propose a Benders' decomposition approach to tackle this challenging optimization problem. Our approach iteratively explores possible lane designs in the Benders' master problem and, at each iteration, solves a sequence of system-optimum dynamic traffic assignment problems in an attempt to find fixed-points representative of logit-compatible demand splits. The proposed approach is implemented on three hypothetical freeway networks with single and multiple origins and destinations. Our numerical results reveal that the optimal lane design of freeway network is non-trivial while accounting for endogenous demand of each mode.

AB Direct visual observations from submersible vehicles at hydrothermal vents typically only reveal a fraction of the vent environment at any one time. We describe the use of precision Remotely Operated Vehicle (ROV) videography to produce extensive mosaic images of hydrothermal vent chimneys and surrounding seafloor areas (c. 250 m(2)), with sufficient resolution to determine distributions of macro- and megafauna. Doppler velocity log navigation (DVLNAV) was used to follow overlapping vertical survey lines in a fixed plane facing a vent chimney, while acquiring high-definition video imagery using a forward-looking camera. The DVLNAV also enabled the vehicle to follow overlapping horizontal survey lines while acquiring seafloor imagery from a downward-looking video camera and mapping variations in seawater temperature. Digital stills images extracted from video were used to compile high-resolution composite views of the surveyed areas. Applying these image acquisition techniques at vent fields on the East Scotia Ridge, Southern Ocean, revealed consistent patterns of faunal zonation around vent sources, variations in proportions of faunal assemblage types on different faces of a vent chimney, and differences in proportions of faunal assemblages between two different vent fields. The technique can therefore be used to determine the composition and spatial distribution of fauna across complex areas of topography, such as vent fields, where mosaic images of vertical structures cannot currently be acquired using other platforms such as autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs). These image acquisition techniques, demonstrated here in the first ROV dives at newly discovered vent fields, may offer an appropriate technology for rapid baseline studies required by the potential mining of seafloor massive sulfides (SMS).

AB A motion strategy plays an important role in supporting autonomous Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) movement. Many studies have been conducted to improve the motion frameworks in terms of its robustness, safety and performance. Most of them worked on the prior known maps scenario where the area information was collected by Global Positioning System (GPS) and satellite cameras. Even though the scheme can provide high quality map, the computation of motion planning remains dependent on the communication signal. In the rural areas such as forests and mountains, where communication signal does not perform well, unclear and noisy terrain maps can be generated and lead to mission failure. Therefore, it is significant that an alternative framework to enhance autonomous UAV motion performance in these certain conditions should be developed. Our work focuses on developing a high performance path planner for autonomous UAV motion when communication signal does not work well in rural areas. The search mission problem in forest terrain has been implemented in 3D simulation as an evaluation. By conducting a simulation process repeatedly with different test cases for positions, time constraints, flight speed (3-11 m/s) and flight range, our path planning framework can achieve completeness between 90-100% and better performance compared to others.

DE target search; AUV; multi-AUVs system; reinforcement learning
AB As a new type of marine unmanned intelligent equipment, autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) has been widely used in the field of ocean observation, maritime rescue, mine countermeasures, intelligence reconnaissance, etc. Especially in the underwater search mission, the technical advantages of AUV are particularly obvious. However, limited operational capability and sophisticated mission environments are also difficulties faced by AUV. To make better use of AUV in the search mission, we establish the DMACSS (distributed multi-AUVs collaborative search system) and propose the ACSLA (autonomous collaborative search learning algorithm) integrated into the DMACSS. Compared with the previous system, DMACSS adopts a distributed control structure to improve the system robustness and combines an information fusion mechanism and a time stamp mechanism, making each AUV in the system able to exchange and fuse information during the mission. ACSLA is an adaptive learning algorithm trained by the RL (Reinforcement learning) method with a tailored design of state information, reward function, and training framework, which can give the system optimal search path in real-time according to the environment. We test DMACSS and ACSLA in the simulation test. The test results demonstrate that the DMACSS runs stably, the search accuracy and efficiency of ACSLA outperform other search methods, thus better realizing the cooperation between AUVs, making the DMACSS find the target more accurately and faster.

AB The increasing number of vehicles has caused traffic conditions to become increasingly complicated in terms of safety. Emerging autonomous vehicles (AVs) have the potential to significantly reduce crashes. The advanced driver assistance system (ADAS) has received widespread attention. Lane keeping and lane changing are two basic driving maneuvers on highways. It is very important for ADAS technology to identify them effectively. The lane changing maneuver recognition has been used to study traffic safety for many years. Different models have been proposed. With the development of technology, machine learning has been introduced in this field with effective results. However, models which require a lot of physical data as input and unaffordable sensors lead to the high cost of AV platforms. This impedes the development of AVs. This study proposes a model of lane changing maneuver recognition based on a distinct set of physical data. The driving scenario from the natural vehicle trajectory dataset (i.e., HighD) is used for machine learning. Acceleration and velocity are extracted and labeled as physical data. The normalized features are then input into the k-nearest neighbor (KNN) classification model. The trained model was applied to another set of data and received good results. The results show that based on the acceleration features, the classification accuracy of lane keeping (LK), lane changing to the left (LCL) and lane changing to the right (LCR) is 100%, 97.89% and 96.19%.

AB This paper presents a rapid (real time) solution to the minimum-time path planning problem for Dubins vehicles under environmental currents (wind or ocean currents). Real-time solutions are essential in time-critical situations (such as replanning under dynamically changing environments or tracking fast moving targets). Typically, Dubins problem requires to solve for six path types; however, due to the presence of currents, four of these path types require to solve the root-finding problem involving transcendental functions. Thus, the existing methods result in high computation times and their applicability for real-time applications is limited. In this regard, in order to obtain a real-time solution, this paper proposes a novel approach where only a subset of two Dubins path types (LSL and RSR) are used which have direct analytical solutions in the presence of currents. However, these two path types do not provide full reachability. We show that by extending the feasible range of circular arcs in the LSL and RSR path types from 2p to 4p: (1) full reachability of any goal pose is guaranteed, and (2) paths with lower time costs as compared to the corresponding 2p-arc paths can be produced. Theoretical properties are rigorously established, supported by several examples, and evaluated in comparison to the Dubins solutions by extensive Monte-Carlo simulations. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V.

ID ORIENTED GRADIENTS; HISTOGRAMS
AB Autonomous driving is not only required to detect pedestrians around vehicles, but also expected to understand the behaviors of pedestrians. Pedestrian body orientation and head orientation are the relevant indicators of the pedestrian intention. This paper proposes an accurate estimation system to recognize the pedestrian body orientation and the pedestrian head orientation from on-board camera and inertial sensors. The proposed system discretizes the body orientation and the head orientation into 16 directions. In order to achieve the accurate orientation estimation, a novel training database is established, which includes strongly labeled data and weakly labeled data. Semi-Supervised Learning method is employed to annotate the weakly labeled data, and to generate the accurate classifier based on the proposed training database. In addition, the temporal constraint and the human physical model constraint are considered in orientation estimation, which are beneficial to the reasonable and stable result of orientation estimation for the pedestrian in image sequences. This estimated result is the orientation in camera space. The comprehension of the pedestrian behavior needs to be conducted in the real world space. Therefore, this paper proposes to model the motion of the host vehicle using inertial sensor, then transforms the estimated orientation from camera space to the real world space by considering the vehicle and pedestrian motion. The represented orientation indicates the behavior of the pedestrian more directly. Finally, a series of experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed pedestrian orientation system.

AB On the basis of a full-appendage DARPA SUBOFF model (DTRC model 5470), a scale (lambda = 0.535) semi-autonomous submarine free-running model (SFRM) was designed for testing its manoeuvrability and stability in the constrained water. Prior to the experimental tests of the SFRM, a six-degree-of-freedom (6-DOF) manoeuvre model with an autopilot system was developed by using logic operations in MATLAB. The SFRM's attitude and its trim polygon were presented by coping with the changes in mass and trimming moment. By adopting a series of manoeuvring tests in empty tanks, the performances of the SFRM were introduced in cases of three sailing speeds. In addition, the PD controller was established by considering the simulation results of these manoeuvring tests. The optimal control gains with respect to each manoeuvring test can be calculated by using the PID tuner in MATLAB. Two sets of control gains derived from the optimal characteristics parameters were compared in order to decide on the most appropriate PD controller with the line-of-sight (LOS) guidance algorithm for the SFRM in the autopilot simulation. Eventually, the simulated trajectories and course angles of the SFRM would be illustrated in the post-processor based on the Cinema 4D modelling.

AB Rapidly-exploring random tree (RRT) has been studied for autonomous parking as it quickly finds an initial path and is easily scalable in complex environments. However, the planning time increases by searching for the path in narrow parking spots. To reduce the planning time, the target tree algorithm, which substitutes a parking goal in RRT with a set (target tree) of backward parking paths, was proposed. However, as it consists of circular and straight paths, it deteriorates parking accuracy because of curvature-discontinuity. Moreover, the planning time increases in complex environments; backward paths can be blocked by obstacles. Therefore, this paper introduces the TargetTree-RRT* algorithm for complex environments. First, a target tree is designed using clothoid paths to address such curvature-discontinuity. Second, to reduce the planning time further, a cost function is defined to initialize a proper target tree that considers obstacles. By integrating with optimal-variant RRT and searching for the shortest path, the proposed TargetTree-RRT* algorithm obtains a near-optimal path as the sampling time increases. Experiment results in real environments showed that the vehicle parked more accurately, and continuous-curvature paths were obtained more quickly and with higher success rates than those acquired using other sampling-based and other types of planning algorithms.

AB Hyperspectral anomaly detection is aimed at detecting observations that differ from their surroundings, and is an active area of research in hyperspectral image processing. Recently, autoencoders (AEs) have been applied in hyperspectral anomaly detection; however, the existing AE-based methods are complicated and involve manual parameter setting and preprocessing and/or postprocessing procedures. In this article, an autonomous hyperspectral anomaly detection network (Auto-AD) is proposed, in which the background is reconstructed by the network and the anomalies appear as reconstruction errors. Specifically, through a fully convolutional AE with skip connections, the background can be reconstructed while the anomalies are difficult to reconstruct, since the anomalies are relatively small compared to the background and have a low probability of occurring in the image. To further suppress the anomaly reconstruction, an adaptive-weighted loss function is designed, where the weights of potential anomalous pixels with large reconstruction errors are reduced during training. As a result, the anomalies have a higher contrast with the background in the map of reconstruction errors. The experimental results obtained on a public airborne data set and two unmanned aerial vehicle-borne hyperspectral data sets confirm the effectiveness of the proposed Auto-AD method.

AB We discuss trajectory optimization for a class of hybrid systems with a natural, hierarchical separation of discrete and continuous dynamics, where the continuous dynamics do not change with the discrete state. The trajectory optimization problem considered requires that a discrete state sequence and a continuous state trajectory must be both determined to minimize a single cost function, such that the discrete state sequence also solves a symbolic planning problem. We model this symbolic planning problem as a search on a planning graph, and we introduce a family of graphs called lifted planning graphs parametrized by an integer H. We define a family of continuous state trajectory optimization problems and associate them with edge costs in the lifted planning graphs. Next, we present an algorithm for finding an optimal solution to the hybrid trajectory optimization problem, which includes mapping paths in the lifted planning graphs to discrete state sequences and continuous state trajectories. We show that the cost of optimal hybrid trajectories is a nonincreasing function of H, and that there exists a finite H for which this cost attains a minimum. We illustrate the proposed algorithm with numerical simulation results for two application examples: an autonomous mobile vehicle and an autonomous robotic manipulator. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

AB Modern autonomous emergency braking (AEB) system is a typical safety-critical cyber-physical system (CPS) synthesizing the vehicular communications, control, and proception technologies. However, the control performance of braking can be easily deteriorated by the road adhesion saturation in physical environment and the multi-hop communication network-induced delays in cyber systems. Motivated by this, a new multi-hop loop delay analysis method and its associated upper-bound expression is proposed to scrutinize the system uncertainties, within the scope of CPS. Following this endeavor, a hierarchical cyber-physical control scheme for the AEB system is proposed to mitigate the adverse effects of road adhesion saturation and multi-hop communication network-induced delays. At the upper layer, a mu-adaptive time-to collision (TTC) planning strategy is adopted to generate the desired acceleration for collision risk avoidance considering the road adhesion saturation. At the lower layer, an H-infinity-based linear quadratic regulator (LQR) is designed for acceleration tracking with strong robustness to the uncertainties of cyber system. Hardware-In-Loop (HIL) experiments validate that the proposed method is superior in terms of braking accuracy and the robustness to the system uncertainties.

AB A multitude of applications based on unmanned aircraft vehicles (UAVs), in conjunction with the UAVs' diminishing costs and increasing capabilities, present a major threat to public safety as well as critical infrastructure security, leading to the need for versatile and robust counter-drone solutions. This work presents a novel multi-agent jamming system, where a group of cooperative autonomous agents employ various algorithms (detection, tracking, jamming, and self-localization) to counter unauthorized drone operations. The proposed system employs a joint wireless jamming and cooperative positioning framework to best track and intercept the moving rogue drone, utilizing a relative positioning system based on signals of opportunity in conjunction with inertial and vision measurements. Software-defined radio technology is incorporated on the pursuer agent to achieve rogue drone GPS disruption, while at the same time the autonomous agents cooperate to compute the location estimate of the pursuer agent. In the presence of jamming, to improve the wireless communication performance of the autonomous agents, a cellular communication architecture is also used as an additional channel for control and information exchange. For evaluation purposes, a prototype multi-agent system is designed, implemented, and tested in a real-world environment to demonstrate its enhanced localization and jamming performance, when compared to single-agent approaches.

AB Perception of the environment by sensor systems in variable environmental conditions is very complex due to the interference influences. In the field of autonomous machines or autonomous vehicles, environmental conditions play a decisive role in safe person detection. A uniform test and validation method can support the manufacturers of sensor systems during development and simultaneously provide proof of functionality. The authors have developed a concept of a novel test method, "REDA", for this purpose. In this article, the concept is applied and measurement data are presented. The results show the versatile potential of this test method, through the manifold interpretation options of the measurement data. Using this method, the strengths and weaknesses of sensor systems have been identified with an unprecedented level of detail, flexibility, and variance to test and compare the detection capability of sensor systems. The comparison was possible regardless of the measuring principle of the sensor system used. Sensor systems have been tested and compared with each other with regard to the influence of environmental conditions themselves. The first results presented highlight the potential of the new test method. For future applications, the test method offers possibilities to test and compare manifold sensing principles, sensor system parameters, or evaluation algorithms, including, e.g., artificial intelligence.

AB Recent advancements in the Vehicular Ad-hoc Network (VANET) have tremendously addressed road-related challenges. Specifically, Named Data Networking (NDN) in VANET has emerged as a vital technology due to its outstanding features. However, the NDN communication framework fails to address two important issues. The current NDN employs a pull-based content retrieval network, which is inefficient in disseminating crucial content in Vehicular Named Data Networking (VNDN). Additionally, VNDN is vulnerable to illusion attackers due to the administrative-less network of autonomous vehicles. Although various solutions have been proposed for detecting vehicles' behavior, they inadequately addressed the challenges specific to VNDN. To deal with these two issues, we propose a novel push-based crucial content dissemination scheme that extends the scope of VNDN from pullbased content retrieval to a push-based content forwarding mechanism. In addition, we exploit Machine Learning (ML) techniques within VNDN to detect the behavior of vehicles and classify them as attackers or legitimate. We trained and tested our system on the publicly accessible dataset Vehicular Reference Misbehavior (VeReMi). We employed five ML classification algorithms and constructed the best model for illusion attack detection. Our results indicate that Random Forest (RF) achieved excellent accuracy in detecting all illusion attack types in VeReMi, with an accuracy rate of 100% for type 1 and type 2, 96% for type 4 and type 16, and 95% for type 8. Thus, RF can effectively evaluate the behavior of vehicles and identify attacker vehicles with high accuracy. The ultimate goal of our research is to improve content exchange and secure VNDN from attackers. Thus, our ML-based attack detection and prevention mechanism ensures trustworthy content dissemination and prevents attacker vehicles from sharing misleading information in VNDN.

AB For a complex operational environment, to actualize safe obstacle avoidance and collision avoidance, a swarm must be capable of autonomous formation reconfiguration. First, this paper introduces the basic pigeon-inspired optimization (PIO) algorithm, and establishes the unmanned aerial vehicle motion model and the virtual leader swarm formation control structure. Then, given the above knowledge, the basic error objective function of a UAV swarm, obstacle avoidance objective function, and collision avoidance objective function are devised based on the variable-stepsize model predictive control technique. Next, the adaptive perception Cauchy mutation PIO algorithm is proposed by introducing the Cauchy mutation operator, adaptive weight factor, and roulette wheel selection into the basic PIO. This algorithm is used to optimally solve the abovementioned swarm objective functions. Ultimately, a set of comparative simulations are performed to verify the effectiveness and reliability of the proposed algorithm.

AB As unmanned vehicles become smaller and more autonomous, it is becoming feasible to use them in large groups with comparatively few human operators. Design and analysis of such distributed systems are complicated by the many interactions among agents and phenomena of human behavior. In particular, human susceptibility to fatigue and cognitive overload can introduce errors and uncertainty into the system. In this paper, we demonstrate how advanced computational tools can help to overcome these engineering difficulties by optimizing multirobot, multioperator surveillance systems for cost, speed, accuracy, and stealth according to diverse user preferences in multiple case studies. The tool developed is a graphical user interface that returns the optimal number and mix of diverse agent types as a function of the user's trade-off preferences. System performance prediction relies on a multiagent simulation with submodels for human operators, fixed-wing unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), quadrotor UAVs, and flapping wing UAVs combined in different numbers.

AB In this paper, we analyze the performance of a reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS)-assisted unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) wireless system that is affected by mixture-gamma small-scale fading, stochastic disorientation and misalignment, as well as transceivers hardware imperfections. First, we statistically characterize the end-to-end channel for both cases, i.e., in the absence as well as in the presence of disorientation and misalignment, by extracting closed-form formulas for the probability density function (PDF) and the cumulative distribution function (CDF). Building on the aforementioned expressions, we extract novel closed-form expressions for the outage probability (OP) in the absence and the presence of disorientation and misalignment as well as hardware imperfections. In addition, high signal-to-noise ratio OP approximations are derived, leading to the extraction of the diversity order. Finally, an OP floor due to disorientation and misalignment is presented.

AB The paper deals with the consensus problem in a leaderless network of agents that have to reach a common velocity while forming a uniformly spaced string. Moreover, the final common velocity (reference velocity) is determined by the agents in a distributed and leaderless way. Then, the consensus protocol parameters are optimized for networks characterized by a communication topology described by a class of directed graphs having a directed spanning tree, in order to maximize the convergence rate and avoid oscillations. The advantages of the optimized consensus protocol are enlightened by some simulation results and comparison with a protocol proposed in the related literature. The presented protocol can be applied to coordinate agents such as mobile robots, automated guided vehicles (AGVs) and autonomous vehicles that have to move with the same velocity and a common inter-space gap.

AB The communications quality of unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) has been brought into focus increasingly, which can be severely affected by other users, as well as complex topography. In this letter, we propose a path planning algorithm for UAV anti-jamming communications with the joint assistance of two kinds of radio maps-signal power map and signal to interference plus noise ratio (SINR) map, which contain the abundant information of path loss caused by the topography and interference from jammers. We show how to generate these maps from real topographic data, and provide the optimal UAV path planning by adopting the power and the SNR maps to the heuristic and graphic based A* algorithm. Simulations with various settings for areas with complex topography in real world, show that the proposed algorithm can considerably improve the efficiency by minimizing the UAV flying distance for anti-jamming communications.

AB The design of a robust perception method is a substantial component towards achieving underwater human-robot collaboration. However, in complex environments such as the oceans, perception is still a challenging issue. Data-fusion of different sensing modalities can improve perception in dynamic and unstructured ocean environments. This study addresses the control of a highly maneuverable autonomous underwater vehicle for diver tracking based on visual and acoustic signals data fusion measured by low-cost sensors. The underwater vehicle U-CAT tracks a diver using a 3-degree-of-freedom fuzzy logic Mamdani controller. The proposed tracking approach was validated through open water real-time experiments. Combining acoustic and visual signals for underwater target tracking provides several advantages compared to previously done related research. The obtained results suggest that the proposed solution ensures effective detection and tracking in poor visibility operating conditions.

AB UAV swarm is a typical application of multi-agent system and consists of a certain number of single- or multi-function UAVs. This paper mainly focuses on the motion consensus and formation control of UAV swarm. A novel formation control algorithm suitable for both leaders and followers is designed, in which leaders are implicitly integrated into the swarm and can be influenced by navigational feedback from their flockmates. Theoretical analysis shows that the system is asymptotically stable and can converge to the desired formation without collision among vehicles. Numerical simulations are performed to illustrate the theoretical results and verify the velocity and trajectory tracking abilities of the algorithm. Results reveal that the proposed algorithm guarantees a swarm of UAVs to fly with predefined formation and track scheduled trajectory. Furthermore, the novel algorithm can reduce the communication consumption and enhance the adaptability and scalability of the system. (C) 2017 Elsevier Masson SAS. All rights reserved.

AB Road markings embody the rules of the road whilst capturing the upcoming road layout. These rules are diligently studied and applied to driving situations by human drivers who have read Highway Traffic driving manuals (road marking interpretation). An autonomous vehicle must however be taught to read the road, as a human might. This paper addresses the problem of automatically reading the rules encoded in road markings, by classifying them into seven distinct classes: single boundary, double boundary, separator, zig-zag, intersection, boxed junction and special lane. Our method employs a unique set of geometric feature functions within a probabilistic RUSBoost and Conditional Random Field (CRF) classification framework. This allows us to jointly classify extracted road markings. Furthermore, we infer the semantics of road scenes (pedestrian approaches and no drive regions) based on marking classification results. Finally, our algorithms are evaluated on a large real-life ground truth annotated dataset from our vehicle.

SO ADVANCES IN MECHANICAL ENGINEERING

DT Article
AB This paper aims at realizing an automatic parking method through a bird's eye view vision system. With this method, vehicles can make robust and real-time detection and recognition of parking spaces. During parking process, the omnidirectional information of the environment can be obtained by using four on-board fisheye cameras around the vehicle, which are the main part of the bird's eye view vision system. In order to achieve this purpose, a polynomial fisheye distortion model is firstly used for camera calibration. An image mosaicking method based on the Levenberg-Marquardt algorithmis used to combine four individual images from fisheye cameras into one omnidirectional bird's eye view image. Secondly, features of the parking spaces are extracted with a Radon transform based method. Finally, double circular trajectory planning and a preview control strategy are utilized to realize autonomous parking. Through experimental analysis, we can see that the proposed method can get effective and robust real-time results in both parking space recognition and automatic parking.

AB Blade health is directly related to the safety and efficiency of wind turbine (WT) operation. In this article, a cloud-edge-end collaborative detection method for WT blade surface damage is proposed based on lightweight deep learning network. The blade images are obtained by unmanned aerial vehicle. The YOLOv3 is optimized on the cloud server, including backbone network replacement, filter pruning, and knowledge distillation. After model training, the lightweight deep learning model YOLOv3-Mobilenet-PK is obtained and deployed on edge device to detect the surface damage of the WT blades, then the detection results can be viewed through the portable mobile device. The results show that the mean average precision (mAP) of the detection method proposed in this article is over 90%, the detection speed is about two times that of the YOLOv3-DarkNet53. This method has the advantages of fast detection speed, high accuracy, and less occupation of bandwidth.

AB The failure of the traditional initial alignment algorithm for the strapdown inertial navigation system (SINS) in high latitude is a significant challenge due to the rapid convergence of polar longitude. This paper presents a novel vision aided initial alignment method for the SINS of autonomous underwater vehicles (AUV) in polar regions. In this paper, we redesign the initial alignment model by combining inertial navigation mechanization equations in a transverse coordinate system (TCS) and visual measurement information obtained from a camera fixed on the vehicle. The observability of the proposed method is analyzed under different swing models, while the extended Kalman filter is chosen as an information fusion algorithm. Simulation results show that: the proposed method can improve the accuracy of the initial alignment for SINS in polar regions, and the deviation angle has a similar estimation accuracy in the case of uniaxial, biaxial, and triaxial swing modes, which is consistent with the results of the observable analysis.

ID CHALLENGES
AB Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) are in general faster to deploy and easier to operate due to many off-the-shelf guidance, navigation, and control solutions. Such solutions usually support short-range line-of-sight operations. However, operating a swarm of UAVs for surveillance purposes in diverse terrains requires cost-effective wireless connectivity, infrastructure-less operation, adaptive mobility models, multiclass routing solutions, and a tailored ground control station . In this article, we address the challenge of UAV swarm communications by presenting a framework that offers an open-interface communication and networking solution for surveillance operations in urban/outreach areas. It is based on a hybrid connectivity module that can enable the coexistence of 5G infrastructures, adaptive multiband SDR waveforms empowered with cooperative communication capacities, and satellite communications for continuous swarm operation in any demographic area. In addition, we also discuss some of the current and futuristic applications and scenarios that can benefit from the provided solution.

AB This paper shows some guidelines to improve the estimation accuracy of a navigation system, which is based on wide-field-integration (WFI) of optic flow. Optic flow is a vector field of relative velocities obtained by photoreceptors in image sensors, and WFI of optic flow enables motion estimation robust by integrating wide range of optic flow. Since the system has several attractive features (small size, light weight, and low computation), it is applicable to an autonomous control system of micro air vehicles. However, due to some restrictions of real systems, WFI of optic flow theory should be applied while considering sensor arrangement for better estimation. In this paper, first an adequate number and adequate optical-axes of image sensors are investigated. Then, a new estimation system combining a gyro sensor with WFI of optic flow is discussed by numerical simulations. Finally, the essential effect for the number of cameras are verified in experiments.

The potential security threats posed by these systems are collectively presented and the legal issues surrounding their successful integration are briefly outlined. Key difficulties involved in the identification and hence tracking of these radar elusive' systems are discussed, along with how research efforts relating to drone detection, classification and radar cross section (RCS) characterisation are being directed in order to address this emerging challenge. Such methods are thoroughly analysed and critiqued; finally, an overall picture of the field in its current state is painted, alongside scope for future work over a broad spectrum.

LA English
DT Article
ID AUTONOMOUS PARAFOILS
AB This paper presents a time-varying control methodology for a variable-sized circular parachute to reach a target landing location. A trajectory is calculated for the immediate control horizon using wind forecast data. To create a parachute-payload trajectory, a three-degree-of-freedom kinematic model is developed. Using this, the performance envelope is determined, revealing the potential target range of the system during a descent. Next, this model is further developed into a control methodology to determine the necessary descent rate, to reach the desired landing target, to be controlled via parachute size manipulation. Finally, simulation results are presented to validate the control scheme. Various release locations were simulated with paired uncontrolled/controlled parachute descents from within the performance envelope. Results demonstrate the feasibility of the system, with controlled parachute descents actively navigating toward the target. With accurate wind data, the vehicle can overcome release location errors as well as vehicle uncertainties and perform significantly better than an uncontrolled parachute in reaching targeted landing locations.

AB This paper presents a novel asymptotic tracking controller for an underactuated quadrotor unmanned aerial vehicle using the robust integral of the signum of the error (RISE) method and an immersion and invariance (I&I)-based adaptive control methodology. The control system is decoupled into two parts: the inner loop for attitude control and the outer loop for position control. The RISE approach is applied in the inner loop for disturbance rejection, whereas the I&I approach is chosen for the outer loop to compensate for the parametric uncertainties. The asymptotic tracking of the time-varying 3-D position and the yaw motion reference trajectories is proven via the Lyapunov-based stability analysis and LaSalle's invariance theorem. Real-time experiment results, which are performed on a hardware-in-the-loop simulation testbed, are presented to illustrate the performance of the proposed control scheme.

AB In this paper, a method to extract features of the environment based on ultrasonic sensors is presented. A 3D model of a set of sonar systems and a workplace has been developed. The target of this approach is to extract in a short time, while the vehicle is moving, features of the environment. Particularly, the approach shown in this paper has been focused on determining walls and corners, which are very common environment features. In order to prove the viability of the devised approach, a 3D simulated environment has been built. A Neuro-Fuzzy strategy has been used in order to extract environment features from this simulated model. Several trials have been carried out, obtaining satisfactory results in this context. After that, some experimental tests have been conducted using a real vehicle with a set of sonar systems. The obtained results reveal the satisfactory generalization properties of the approach in this case.

ID DIRECTIONAL CONTROL; UNDERWATER VEHICLE; STABILITY; STABILIZATION
AB The three-dimensional directional stabilization problem is addressed for a slender autonomous underwater vehicle with three inputs: thrust, pitch moment, and yaw moment. The control law reshapes potential energy through feedback. Conditions for asymptotic stability are derived by applying Lyapunov's direct method to a control Lyapunov function constructed from the control-modified energy and other conserved quantities. Analysis proves asymptotic stability and suggests almost global convergence. The dynamic model requires minimal assumptions concerning the viscous force and moment, resulting in a directional controller that is inherently robust to uncertainty in these effects. The directional control algorithm is then extended by incorporating a line-of-sight guidance rule to enable cross-track control, or line following, although the extension requires an additional control moment about the roll axis. Spectral stability analysis provides sufficient conditions for local exponential stability and numerical simulations suggest that stability is almost globally asymptotic. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

AB Connected and autonomous vehicles will play a pivotal role in future intelligent transportation systems and smart cities, in general. High-speed and low-latency wireless communication links will allow municipalities to warn vehicles against safety hazards, as well as support cloud-driving solutions to drastically reduce traffic jams and air pollution. To achieve these goals, vehicles need to be equipped with a wide range of sensors generating and exchanging high rate data streams. Recently, millimeter wave (mm Wave) techniques have been introduced as a means of fulfilling such high data rate requirements. In this paper, we model a highway communication network and characterize its fundamental link budget metrics. In particular, we specifically consider a network where vehicles are served by mm Wave base stations (BSs) deployed alongside the road. To evaluate our highway network, we develop a new theoretical model that accounts for a typical scenario where heavy vehicles (such as buses and lorries) in slow lanes obstruct line-of-sight (LOS) paths of vehicles in fast lanes and, hence, act as blockages. Using tools from stochastic geometry, we derive approximations for the signal-to-interference-plus-noise Ratio (SINR) outage probability, as well as the probability that a user achieves a target communication rate (rate coverage probability). Our analysis provides new design insights for mmWave highway communication networks. In considered highway scenarios, we show that reducing the horizontal beam width from 90 degrees to 30 degrees determines a minimal reduction in the SINR outage probability (namely 4. 10(-2) at maximum). Also, unlike bidimensional mmWave cellular networks, for small BS densities (namely one BS every 500 m) it is still possible to achieve an SINR outage probability smaller than 0.2.

AB In environmental monitoring, human presence is necessary in order to monitor, record and control the evolution of environmental parameters, but, at the same time, is to be avoided, because it is a disturbing and possibly intrusive element. A solution to this challenging dilemma is to use autonomous or remote controlled mobile sensors, which, in its turn, leads to the use of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), similar to those already developed and used in the military field. UAVs have unmatched qualities that make them the only effective solution in specialised tasks where human presence either is not necessary, or is not allowed. Although the civil applications of the UAVs were developed later than military ones, there is already a wide range of civil UAVs. Nowadays, they are used in scientific, emergency, governmental or commercial missions. The environmental monitoring missions are already performed by some UAVs meant for scientific or emergency missions. This work presents some current aspects of designing UAV built specifically for environmental monitoring and other scientific missions in civil area. The particular project presented will be entirely developed by an academic consortium. The environmental monitoring project described in this paper was focused - more than others - on the interaction with the environment, because the authors gave careful consideration to its environmentally-friendly dimension. Consequently, the design specifications imposed that the vehicle should have the smallest possible impact onto environment. The assigned design goal was to realise an environmental monitoring system/vehicle according to some criteria, prioritised on an environmental preservation basis (the choice of the main characteristics, the propulsion method and the onboard energy resource management). The resulting design is able to carry out multiple missions. The operation mode was therefore determined depending on the number and on the type of sensors that would be installed as a payload in each particular mission.

AB The cooperative control of large-scale unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) swarms to establish a complex configuration is one of the most challenging goals. The poor scalability of the network topology, inability to self-organize the desired configuration and the separation of swarm configuration are the main obstructions that hinder the attainment of the goal. This paper studies the self-organized aggregation control of large-scale UAVs by designing a scalable distributed network architecture. We present a novel centerless and scalable multilayer graph model to solve the nonextensible problem of the traditional network topology. A large number of UAVs are organized with several interconnected and globally covered layers, and each layer consists of many undifferentiated clusters. Afterwards, a self-organized aggregation control law using the potential function method is designed for UAVs to realize autonomous configuration and configuration swarming under the consideration of collision and obstacle avoidance.

AB The United States Marine Corps (USMC) is advancing future hybrid capabilities involving autonomous unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) launched from future vertical take-off and lift (VTOL) piloted (or manned) aircraft for coordinated manned/unmanned operations to enhance a variety of warfi ghting missions. The concept includes launching UAVs from manned aircraft with diff erent payload and capabilities to extend reach while keeping human warfighters further from contested environments. Paramount to these mission sets is the ability to effectively enable the complex human -machine interactions between the USMC pilots and the air-launched UAVs. This paper describes a study conducted by the Naval Postgraduate School focused on the human -machine interactions of future USMC hybrid VTOL aircraft/ UAV coordinated operations. The study applied a systems engineering analysis method called Coactive Design to explore human machine interdependencies and develop initial human-machine teaming (HMT) concepts for this future hybrid warfi ghting concept.

ID IDENTIFICATION
AB A controller based on integral concurrent learning (ICL) has been developed for controlling a multirotor unmanned aerial vehicle with unknown mass and moment of inertia, and it guarantees that the tracking errors and the estimation errors of the parameters asymptotically converge to zero. The condition for convergence of the estimated parameters in the developed ICL controller can be verified online or offline by utilizing the data recorded during normal operation over a period, and satisfying the condition does not require persistence of excitation. Since the dynamics of a multirotor is globally defined, the developed ICL controller ensures almost global tracking and parameter estimation. The developed control architecture can be generalized to control any multirotor of unknown mass and moment of inertia with guaranteed system stability. A stability analysis is conducted to ensure that both the tracking errors and the estimation errors of the parameters asymptotically converge to zero. The performance and efficacy of the ICL controller have been verified in experiments.

AB An online experiment was conducted to investigate how perceived collision algorithm types (selfish vs. utilitarian) and social approval for the algorithms (weak approval vs. strong approval) jointly affect individuals' attitudes toward automated vehicles (AVs). The results showed a discrepancy between what individuals consider socially desirable and what they trust or would use. Although participants regarded AVs with utilitarian collision algorithms as more ethical and socially beneficial, they personally preferred AVs with selfish algorithms: they trusted selfish AVs more and showed higher intention to use and pay a premium for selfish AVs. Also, participants evaluated AVs as more ethical and socially beneficial when strong social approval was given to the algorithms. However, in utilitarian algorithms, strong social approval did not increase trust or behavioral intention to use AVs. Only strong social approval of selfish algorithms increased participants' trust and intention to use AVs.

AB In the near future, road traffic is expected to be a mixture of CAVs (connected and autonomous vehicles) and HDVs (human-driven vehicles). CAVs can be monitored by the system. By contrast, the information of HDVs is not readily available. Since full traffic flow topology information is valuable for applications such as data routing, this study proposes a method to infer the information of HDVs using CAV trajectories in partial VANET (Vehicular Ad Hoc Network). Specifically, two deep networks, i.e. VexSen and VelSen, are constructed to infer the existence and location of HDVs. Then, the networks are combined and fused into one sensing procedure. The proposed method was validated by conducting numerous experiments. The results show that HDV existence inferrence accuracy can reach 80%, whereas for the case of multiple CAVs at least the information of 20% HDVs can be inferred given the CAVs penetration rate of 20%.

AB Next-generation autonomous and networked industrial systems (i.e., robots, vehicles, drones) have driven advances in ultra-reliable low-laten-cy communications (URLLC) and computing. These networked multi-agent systems require fast, communication-efficient, and distributed machine learning (ML) to provide mission-crit-ical control functionalities. Distributed ML techniques, including federated learning (FL), represent a mushrooming multidisciplinary research area weaving together sensing, communication, and learning. FL enables continual model training in distributed wireless systems: rather than fusing raw data samples at a centralized server, FL leverages a cooperative fusion approach where networked agents, connected via URLLC, act as distributed learners that periodically exchange their locally trained model parameters. This article explores emerging opportunities of FL for the next-generation networked industrial systems. Open problems are discussed, focusing on cooperative driving in connected automated vehicles and collaborative robotics in smart manufacturing.

ID MODEL
AB In order to realize reliable Vehicle-to-Vehicle (V2V) communication systems for autonomous driving, the recognition of radio propagation becomes an important technology. However, in the current wireless distributed network systems, it is difficult to accurately estimate the radio propagation characteristics because of the locality of the radio propagation caused by surrounding buildings and geographical features. In this paper, we propose a measurement-based radio environment database for improving the accuracy of the radio environment estimation in the V2V communication systems. The database first gathers measurement datasets of the received signal strength indicator (RSSI) related to the transmission/reception locations from V2V systems. By using the datasets, the average received power maps linked with transmitter and receiver locations are generated. We have performed measurement campaigns of V2V communications in the real environment to observe RSSI for the database construction. Our results show that the proposed method has higher accuracy of the radio propagation estimation than the conventional path loss model-based estimation.

AB How should policymakers engage with the possibilities of self-driving cars? Considering the major investment in systems involving self-driving cars and their speedy development, their social complexity has received inadequate attention. The anticipation necessary for good governance can be informed only in part by experiments such as testing self-driving cars on open roads, and there is a need to broaden the set of issues that are considered relevant. In this paper, we report on the first systematic UK process of engagement with stakeholders. We organise the findings of these workshops in terms of questions that might inform the ongoing debate about the governance of self-driving cars. Our conclusions are that this debate urgently needs to be broadened in order to build trustworthiness and maximise the public value of this emerging technology, and that the possibilities of self-driving cars suggest the need for a more active form of governance for responsible innovation.

AB Underwater cameras are widely used to observe the sea floor. They are usually included in autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs), unmanned underwater vehicles (UUVs), and in situ ocean sensor networks. Despite being an important sensor for monitoring underwater scenes, there exist many issues with recent underwater camera sensors. Because of light's transportation characteristics in water and the biological activity at the sea floor, the acquired underwater images often suffer from scatters and large amounts of noise. Over the last five years, many methods have been proposed to overcome traditional underwater imaging problems. This paper aims to review the state-of-the-art techniques in underwater image processing by highlighting the contributions and challenges presented in over 40 papers. We present an overview of various underwater image-processing approaches, such as underwater image de-scattering, underwater image color restoration, and underwater image quality assessments. Finally, we summarize the future trends and challenges in designing and processing underwater imaging sensors.

AB Two strategies based on epipolar geometry are proposed to guide an aerial vehicle to a desired position defined by a reference image. The starting point to design the strategies is the engagement geometry of two images: the online image provided by the onboard camera and the reference image. A full closed-loop system is derived combining the concept of classical proportional navigation, with the input-output nonlinear control technique, and the tracking of epipolar references. The main contribution of this paper is the definition of a guidance algorithm based on the partial linearization of the full closed-loop system by means of pure image-based information: the epipolar geometry across two views. The proposed formulation avoids the requirement of estimating the range between the current and target positions. Conditions for stability are established for both strategies. Simulation experiments show the interception of the target position by the aerial vehicle and, additionally, a simple attitude control.

AB An integrated navigation method based on the strapdown inertial navigation system (SINS) and Doppler Lidar was presented and its validity is demonstrated by practical experiments. A very effective and independent integrated navigation mode is realized that both an inertial navigation system (INS) and Lidar are not interfered with or screened by electromagnetic waves. In our work, the SINS error model was first introduced, and the velocity error model was transformed into body reference coordinates. Then the expression for measurement model of SINS/Lidar integrated navigation was deduced under Lidar reference coordinates. For application of land or vehicle navigation, the expression for the measurement model was simplified, and observation analysis was carried out. Finally, numerical simulation and vehicle test results were carried out to validate the availability and utility of the proposed SINS/Lidar integrated navigation method for land navigation.

These 294 elements are divided into six independent modules of 49 cymbals wired together electrically in parallel. The six modules, in turn, are wired so that they can be easily combined together. electrically either in parallel, series, or as a combination of both. Based on the VA power curve and a low duty cycle input voltage, an acoustic source level of at least 180 dB (re: 1 muPa @ 1 m) is attainable across the frequency span similar to3-15 kHz. This particular design is best suited for shallow water, but is shown to still be operable at water depths up to 200 meters without significant degradation in performance.

AB With the gradual maturity of autonomous driving and automatic parking technology, electric vehicle charging is moving towards automation. The charging port (CP) location is an important basis for realizing automatic charging. Existing CP identification algorithms are only suitable for a single vehicle model with poor universality. Therefore, this paper proposes a set of methods that can identify the CPs of various vehicle types. The recognition process is divided into a rough positioning stage (RPS) and a precise positioning stage (PPS). In this study, the data sets corresponding to four types of vehicle CPs under different environments are established. In the RPS, the characteristic information of the CP is obtained based on the combination of convolutional block attention module (CBAM) and YOLOV7-tinp, and its position information is calculated using the similar projection relationship. For the PPS, this paper proposes a data enhancement method based on similar feature location to determine the label category (SFLDLC). The CBAM-YOLOV7-tinp is used to identify the feature location information, and the cluster template matching algorithm (CTMA) is used to obtain the accurate feature location and tag type, and the EPnP algorithm is used to calculate the location and posture (LP) information. The results of the LP solution are used to provide the position coordinates of the CP relative to the robot base. Finally, the AUBO-i10 robot is used to complete the experimental test. The corresponding results show that the average positioning errors (x, y, z, rx, ry, and rz) of the CP are 0.64 mm, 0.88 mm, 1.24 mm, 1.19 degrees, 1.00 degrees, and 0.57 degrees, respectively, and the integrated insertion success rate is 94.25%. Therefore, the algorithm proposed in this paper can efficiently and accurately identify and locate various types of CP and meet the actual plugging requirements.

AB Underwater walking robot (UWR) is a kind of autonomous underwater vehicles which can walk underwater. In this work, the fixed-time tracking control problem of UWR with external disturbances, error constraints, and actuator faults is investigated. An interval type-2 fuzzy neural network approximator is designed to tackle nonlinear uncertainties, and a novel prescribed performance terminal sliding-mode surface is proposed to handle error constraints. Furthermore, two fault-tolerant controllers are given, where one is nonsingular and the other has higher steady-state precision. According to Lyapunov theory, the proposed controllers can guarantee that system states will converge to the expected values in a fixed time. Simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed control strategies.

AB This paper considers conducting underwater surveys using multiple sonar-equipped Autonomous Surface Vehicles (ASVs). Given a workspace, every ASV simultaneously searches for a mine towing a Side Scan Sonar (SSS) which can provide high-resolution image of underwater environments. Under strong currents, a survey may result in blurry sonar image, which is not desirable for detecting mines. In the case where the heading of the ASV is opposite to the direction of currents, we can obtain vivid sonar images suitable for detecting mines. This paper thus introduces global path planning of multiple ASVs satisfying the following three goals: 1. there is no hole in coverage after the search is done. 2. whenever an ASV performs sonar survey inside the workspace, the heading of the ASV is opposite to the direction of currents. 3. the workload of every ASV is balanced for time-efficient search. We verified the effectiveness of our multi-ASV path planning methods using MATLAB simulations.

AB The recent boom of animal collective motion investigation has attracted many researchers to the field of applying such intelligence to complicated distribute control problems in artificial systems, such as autonomous unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) flocking. In this paper, a distributed control framework inspired by homing pigeon hierarchical strategies is proposed to solve the UAV flocking problem. This new approach combines the advantages of velocity correlation, leader-follower interaction and hierarchical leadership network observed in pigeon flock with altitude consensus control algorithm used in UAV flocking. The flocking control algorithm is implemented to achieve a stable performance by controlling local position and velocity of each UAV. The practical dynamic and constraints of fix-wing UAV are also taken into account. The distributed flocking algorithms are tested in several simulation cases, which verify the effectiveness and applicability of the proposed control framework. (C) 2017 Elsevier Masson SAS.

AB The airborne launch vehicle, studied in this article, has to find an appropriate route to reach the mission goal, considering environment requirements and system constraints, for mission safety and efficiency. A method for three-dimensional waypoint generation based on an improved version of the A* algorithm with avoidance of detected obstacles is presented in this article. As the mission proceeds, the information about the environment is regularly updated. This information is considered in the mission plan, yielding a revised sequence of waypoints, to reach one or multiple goal points, depending on their order of priority. The output of the algorithm is twofold: a dynamic waypoint generation and a shortest route refined regularly. Diverse obstacles such as turbulence zones, no-fly zones, storms, etc., are considered in the flight plan as soon as they are detected. Their locations and shapes are introduced into the path search space. The improved A* capabilities are tested via simulation in different scenarios.

AB In this paper, an optimal bounded robust control algorithm for secure autonomous navigation in quadcopter vehicles is proposed. The controller is developed combining two parts; one dedicated to stabilize the closed-loop system and the second one for dealing and estimating external disturbances as well unknown nonlinearities inherent to the real system's operations. For bounding the energy used by the system during a mission and, without losing its robustness properties, the quadratic problem formulation is used considering the actuators system constraints. The resulting optimal bounded control scheme improves considerably the stability and robustness of the closed-loop system and at the same time bounds the motor control inputs. The controller is validated in real-time flights and in unconventional conditions for high wind-gusts and Loss of Effectiveness in two rotors. The experimental results demonstrate the good performance of the proposed controller in both scenarios.

AB The cyclist trajectory prediction is critical for the local path planning of autonomous vehicles. Based on the assumption that cyclist's movement is limited by its dynamics and subjected to interactions with environments, a novel LSTM based cyclist trajectory prediction model which utilizes multiple interactions with surroundings and motion feature in a unified framework is proposed. Road features describing road boundary and static obstacles are employed to address cyclist's interaction with the road. To address interactions with pedestrians, other cyclists and vehicles, object features including object attributes and relative positions are utilized. The focal attention mechanism is employed to reveal the importance of features at each time-steps. By feeding features into LSTM encoder, the movement in the next two seconds is predicted. Experiments were conducted on two datasets, and results show that the presented model outperforms the state-of-art models in most cases. (c) 2020 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB In recent years, distributed ledger technologies (DLTs) and blockchain have become disruptive technologies to support distributed and trusted sharing ecosystems in various domains. Among the potential scenarios that can leverage their benefits, cooperative intelligent transport systems (C-ITS) and autonomous vehicles (AV) represent a key trend of the next digital era to build a safer society. However, different aspects such as performance and practical issues, as well as conformance with current standards and legislation, may hinder the adoption of DLT in such scenarios. This article analyses the potential applications that could leverage DLTs features and the challenges to be overcome in the coming years to foster the adoption of DLTs in C-ITS and AV. Through this analysis, we additionally provide a set of potential research directions and ways forward to exploit the advantages of DLTs in C-ITS and AV in terms of decentralized trust and transparency.

AB This note introduces a new concept of cooperative and adversarial multigroup system, which consists of cooperative leaders and followers, as well as adversaries. For example, cooperation of multiple military vehicles operate in complex dynamic networked environments with unknown enemies and hidden malicious attackers. The lack of global situational awareness in distributed settings makes autonomous vehicles prone to cyberattacks and infiltration. Each agent is unaware of the motives of its neighbors and may receive information/data from both the teammates and the adversaries. Secure and resilient control protocols are essential for the networked multigroup systems to prevent the adversaries' attacks from propagating across the network, which may influence the system performance and even overall stability. To counter sensor faults and attacks from the adversaries, a distributed resilient control architecture is proposed, which guarantees uniform ultimate boundedness of the closed-loop dynamical system. Numerical simulations illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed results.

DT Article
ID SIMULTANEOUS LOCALIZATION
AB This paper describes a navigation system for autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) in partially structured environments, such as darns, harbors, marinas, and marine platforms. A mechanically scanned imaging sonar is used to obtain information about the location of vertical planar structures present in such environments. A robust voting algorithm has been developed to extract line features, together with their uncertainty, from the continuous sonar data flow. The obtained information is incorporated into a feature-based simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) algorithm running an extended Kalman filter. Simultaneously, the AUV's position estimate is provided to the feature extraction algorithm to correct the distortions that the vehicle motion produces in the acoustic images. Moreover, a procedure to build and maintain a sequence of local maps and to posteriorly recover the full global map has been adapted for the application presented. Experiments carried out in a marina located in the Costa Brava (Spain) with the Ictineu AUV show the viability of the proposed approach. (c) 2008 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

AB Formation control, which is a core problem in multi-autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) systems, plays an important role in realizing safe and accurate cooperation of multi-AUV systems. This paper provides a study on fault-tolerant formation control for multiple stochastic AUV systems under Markovian switching topologies. Considering the effect of noise and Markovian switching communication topology, a novel leader-following group formation control protocol with an actuator fault for a multi-AUV system is developed under the influence of the two independent stochastic processes. The designed controller is proved by an infinitesimal generator with Lyapunov stability theory and can guarantee that the follower AUVs' states will eventually converge to the leader's state in each subgroup while forming the desired sub-formation. Finally, the effectiveness of the theoretical analysis is verified by a simulation experiment.

AB Unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) recognition is of increasing importance since UAV is widely applied and imposes threats to the public safety. Although many UAV recognition methods based on deep learning have been proposed by using the radio frequency fingerprints, they depend on a large amount of training samples or have poor performance when the training samples are few. In this letter, in order to tackle those issues, two few-shot learning UAV recognition methods are proposed based on our designed tri-residual semantic network. Moreover, our proposed tri-residual semantic network not only can extract different levels of the feature information, but also can significantly suppress the effect of interference and noise. Simulation results demonstrate that our proposed methods are superior to the benchmark few-shot learning schemes in terms of the recognition accuracy.

AB This paper presents new cooperative path planning algorithms for multiple unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) using Game theory-based particle swarm optimization (GPSO). First, the formation path planning is formulated into the minimization of a cost function that incorporates multiple objectives and constraints for each UAV. A framework based on game theory is then developed to cast the minimization into the problem of finding a Stackelberg-Nash equilibrium. Next, hierarchical particle swarm optimization algorithms are developed to obtain the global optimal solution. Simulation results show that the GPSO algorithm can generate efficient and feasible flight paths for multiple UAVs, outperforming other path planning methods in terms of convergence rate and flexibility. The formation can adjust its geometrical shape to accommodate a working environment. Experimental tests on a group of three UAVs confirm the advantages of the proposed approach for a practical application.

AB Motion estimation is critical for the localization of autonomous underwater vehicles. Current SONAR-based techniques exclusively utilize either Doppler or spatial measurements. However, these measurement domains are complementary to each other; Doppler measurements directly measure radial motion, whereas spatial measurements uniquely observe angular motion. Therefore, this article presents SONARODO (SONAR Odometry), a novel real-time motion estimation algorithm for 2-D forward-looking SONARs. It depends on a largely decoupled motion estimation process that better utilizes each measurement domain for their respective strengths. Specifically, it estimates translational motion from Doppler-azimuth images and rotational motion from range-azimuth images. While this method does require a SONAR that can provide both image types, it was designed to ensure robustness to featureless seafloor environments and low-resolution images. This article's validation with high-fidelity simulation data demonstrated that SONARODO offers accuracy and computational cost advantages over related motion estimation techniques.

For the development, a quadrotor dynamic model, including nonlinear actuator dynamics, is constructed and guidance and control system is designed based on feedback linearization and linear quadratic tracker. Stereo vision sensor is used to acquire depth map information of the terrain and flatness information of the topography is obtained by extracting the edge of the depth map and performing Euclidean distance transform. Energy consumption of the quadrotor is also considered. The three measures of: 1) the depth; 2) the flatness; and 3) the energy consumption are combined to propose a performance index to determine the safe landing spot of the quadrotor. Numerical simulation is performed to verify the performance of the proposed algorithm and hardware system applicable to practical implementation is also included.

AB A novel algorithm capable of estimating free space for vehicle navigation is presented. When a disparity map dense or sparse from stereo matching and a longitudinal profile of the road surface on the disparity domain are provided, the free space is estimated precisely. According to the longitudinal profile of the road surface, the disparity map is classified into an obstacle disparity map and a road surface disparity map. After combining these two disparity maps through a score map, a border line separating the road surface and the non-road surface is estimated using dynamic programming on a u-disparity representation. The main contribution of the proposed approach is the robust detection of the free space and the distance between stereo cameras and obstacles, whereby the detection is sufficiently rapid for vehicle navigation. The validity of the proposed algorithm is demonstrated by experiments through many outdoor road images from various traffic scenarios.

AB Fog Computing (FC) is a paradigm that offers centralized cloud computing services to the proximity of a device, i.e., at the edge for fast, secure, efficient, and reliable processing. Although FC offers many benefits, but it is not ideally suitable for various mission-critical applications such as healthcare, autonomous vehicle, connected cars, and unmanned aerial vehicles. To overcome the aforementioned issue, this paper integrates the concept of Device-to-Device (D2D) communication with the traditional FC. D2D offers faster processing due to the local processing of data at the device itself. But, D2D communication is potentially affected by interferences (from the cellular user and other devices) and noises (additive-white Gaussian noise). This can be mitigated if the Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiple Access (OFDMA) is replaced with Non-Orthogonal Multiple Access (NOMA) scheme. The Successive Interference Cancellation (SIC) technique of NOMA minimizes the interference effect. To improve the secrecy capacity of the network and spectral efficiency, we used a coalition game theory. Simulation results scrutinize the superiority of the proposed NOMA-based D2D-aided FC system over sum rate, secrecy capacity, and processing delay parameters.

D2D offers faster processing due to the local processing of data at the device itself. But, D2D communication is potentially affected by interferences (from the cellular user and other devices) and noises (additive-white Gaussian noise). This can be mitigated if the Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiple Access (OFDMA) is replaced with Non-Orthogonal Multiple Access (NOMA) scheme. The Successive Interference Cancellation (SIC) technique of NOMA minimizes the interference effect. To improve the secrecy capacity of the network and spectral efficiency, we used a coalition game theory. Simulation results scrutinize the superiority of the proposed NOMA-based D2D-aided FC system over sum rate, secrecy capacity, and processing delay parameters.

   This work describes the design, modeling, and simulation of a free-rotating wing sail solution for an autonomous environmental land yacht probe. The adopted method involves the application of land sailing principles for the design, the usage of Fusion 360 tool for 3D modeling, and the integration of Gazebo with the Robotic Operating System (ROS) framework for the simulation of the land yacht.
   Autonomous land yachts can play a major role in the context of environmental monitoring, namely, in open, flat, windy regions, such as iced planes or sandy shorelines. This work addresses the design, modeling, and simulation of a land yacht probe equipped with a rigid free-rotating wing sail and tail flap. The wing was designed with a symmetrical airfoil and dimensions to provide the necessary thrust to displace the vehicle. Specifically, it proposes a novel design and simulation method for free rotating wing sail autonomous land yachts. The simulation relies on the Gazebo simulator together with the Robotic Operating System (ROS) middleware. It uses a modified Gazebo aerodynamics plugin to generate the lift and drag forces and the yawing moment, two newly created plugins, one to act as a wind sensor and the other to set the wing flap angular position, and the 3D model of the land yacht created with Fusion 360. The wing sail aligns automatically to the wind direction and can be set to any given angle of attack, stabilizing after a few seconds. Finally, the obtained polar diagram characterizes the expected sailing performance of the land yacht. The described method can be adopted to evaluate different wing sail configurations, as well as control techniques, for autonomous land yachts.

AB With the recent emergence of deep learning, computer vision-based applications have demonstrated better applicability in accomplishing driving tasks including drivable road region detection, lane keeping and steering control in self-driving cars. Till recently, numerous lane-marking detection based steering control and lane keeping methods have been proposed to perform autonomous driving on urban well-structured roads. But the matter of fact is that these methods are not feasible on roads where lane markings are not available or faded over time which makes drivable road region detection a crucial task. Moreover, it is highly arduous task to estimate steering angle on deteriorated roads using existing road detection and steering angle estimation methods. To the best of our knowledge, there is no standard benchmark available for drivable road region detection and steering angle estimation on unstructured roads. To this end, we present a large-scale dataset for drivable region road detection, comprising of 15,000-pixel level high quality fine annotations. Alongside dataset, we also present an end-to-end drivable road region detection and steering angle estimation method to ensure the autonomous driving on generalized urban, rural, and unstructured road conditions. The proposed method performs pixel-level segmentation to extract drivable road region and quantifies lane interception to estimate the steering angle of self-driving cars. A comprehensive qualitative and quantitative analysis has been carried out to demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed dataset, road detection and steering angle estimation methods. Our benchmark is available at https://carl-dataset.github.io/index/.

AB The ever-growing demand for low power, high performance, cost-effective, low-profile, and highly integrated wireless systems for emerging applications has triggered the need for the enormous innovations in wireless transceiver systems, components, architectures and technologies. This is especially valid for the antenna which is an integral component of the wireless transceiver systems and contributes significantly in determining their overall performance. Antenna-on-Chip (AoC) is an alternative antenna technology, which has drawn a substantial attention in recent days because of its various benefits over off-chip antenna technology. A few of these benefits include miniaturization, low power, low cost, and high integration of the wireless modules. Motivated by these valuable advantages and to unveil the true potential of the AoCs, this article presents, for the first time, a comprehensive survey of the suitability, advantages, and challenges of the AoCs for the emerging wireless applications such as 5th generation (5G) Wireless Systems, Internet-of-Things (IoT) Wireless Devices and Systems, Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs), Wireless Interconnects, Wireless Energy Transfer, Radio Frequency (RF) Energy Harvesting, Biomedical Implants, Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs), Autonomous vehicles, Innovative characterization methods for Integrated Circuits (ICs) and Antennas, and Smart City. In addition, this article presents the current state-of-the-art of the AoC's applications by classifying their applications in Millimeter-Wave (MM-Wave) band, Terahertz (THz) band, and low-frequency bands. The article also investigates and describes some useful methods for the mitigation of the challenges and issues posed by the emerging applications for the realization of the AoCs in a systematic manner. A concise description of the future directions of the AoCs with respect to each emerging application is also a part of this article. It is expected that this well-structured and organized survey will not only act as an excellent source of scholarship for the relevant research community, but also open up a world of novel research opportunities.

AB The ability to navigate unstructured environments is an essential task for intelligent systems. Autonomous navigation by ground vehicles requires developing an internal representation of space, trained by recognizable landmarks, robust visual processing, computer vision and image processing. A mobile robot needs a platform enabling it to operate in an environment autonomously, recognize the objects, and avoid obstacles in its path. In this study, an open-source ground robot called SROBO was designed to accurately identify its position and navigate certain areas using a deep convolutional neural network and transfer learning. The framework uses an RGB-D MYNTEYE camera, a 2D laser scanner and inertial measurement units (IMU) operating through an embedded system capable of deep learning. The real-time decision-making process and experiments were conducted while the onboard signal processing and image capturing system enabled continuous information analysis. State-of-the-art Real-Time Graph-Based SLAM (RTAB-Map) was adopted to create a map of indoor environments while benefiting from deep convolutional neural network (Deep-CNN) capability. Enforcing Deep-CNN improved the performance quality of the RTAB-Map SLAM. The proposed setting equipped the robot with more insight into its surroundings. The robustness of the SROBO increased by 35% using the proposed system compared to the conventional RTAB-Map SLAM.

AB This paper is concerned with a self-triggered three-dimensional coordinated path following problem for a fleet of under-actuated disk-type autonomous underwater gliders (AUGs) subject to input constraints as well as internal model uncertainties and external ocean disturbances. A modular backstepping design approach is employed to devise three-dimensional fuzzy coordinated path following controllers for networked AUGs. Especially, a threedimensional kinematic control law is firstly constructed by using a line-of-sight guidance scheme. Secondly, a predictor-based self-triggered communication mechanism is proposed to guarantee that each AUG broadcasts information at its own triggering instants, and to listen to and receive the incoming information from the neighboring AUGs at their triggering instants. Finally, an adaptive kinetic control law is designed based on low frequency learning fuzzy predictors, which are able to extract the high-frequency components of uncertainties and disturbances. The closed-loop system is proven to be input-to-state stable via a cascade stability analysis. Simulation results validate the feasibility and efficacy of the proposed self-triggered three-dimensional coordinated path following controllers for the under-actuated disk-type AUGs subject to uncertainties and disturbances.

AB Electric vehicles (EVs) will play a central role in future energy-efficient and sustainable transportation systems. Compared to the operation of conventional vehicles, EVs provide significantly reduced energy consumption and lower operating costs. With conventional vehicles, fuel use ties directly to the instantaneous energy consumption required to provide motive power to the wheels. Predicting the energy use can be much more complex for EVs with hybridized power-trains because the onboard vehicle systems are trying to balance the provision of power to the wheels as well as manage the state of charge (SOC) of the battery pack. Traditional modeling methodologies for estimating real-world vehicle energy consumption either depend on numerical analysis of laboratory or on-road vehicle test data or the use of full-system simulation tools. Unfortunately, full-system simulation tools suffer from scaling problems in the context of large transportation network, necessitating the development of approaches that support large transportation network projections of modal EV operations and applicable modal energy use rates (energy use for various on-road modes of operation) to predict EV energy consumption.
   In this study, a new modal-based approach for estimating EV energy consumption is proposed. The modal-based approach considers the variance of vehicle operating conditions and supports energy estimation for large-scale transportation networks. The Department of Energy's fullsystem vehicle simulation tool known as Autonomie (R) is used to generate energy consumption rates for specific simulations of on-road operating conditions. A sample of EV models was first developed in Autonomie (R) to simulate a wide range of operating conditions and generate energy use rates for selected EVs. Classification and regression tree (CART) analysis was then applied to the simulation output data to generate energy consumption rates under distinct on-road operating conditions, as represented by combinations of vehicle speed, acceleration rate, and battery state of charge (SOC). A large-scale regional travel demand analysis was performed for the Atlanta, GA metropolitan area, integrating a variety of EV market share scenarios. The CART-derived energy consumption rates are then applied to the model-predicted link-by-link traffic attributes to estimate fleet energy consumption. The modeling framework employs MOVES-embedded driving cycles to represent on-road operations for average speed operating conditions and random initial SOC start levels as model inputs. The model results suggest a 50% PHEV market share can achieve a 30% energy savings without significantly adding to electricity load. This modeling approach can be used to assess network-level energy use for a wide-variety of modeled transportation studies, such as evaluating transportation improvement plans, assessing the net impact on the electric grid, and forecasting the potential benefits of electrifying shared-autonomous vehicles under future scenarios.

TI Automated vehicles: exploring possible consequences of government

ID AUTONOMOUS VEHICLES; GOVERNANCE; POLICY; FUTURE
AB Academic research on automated vehicles (AVs) has to date been dominated by the fields of engineering and computer science. Questions of how this potentially transformative technology should be governed remain under-researched and tend to concentrate on governing the technology's early development. We respond in this paper by exploring the possible longer-term effect of government (lack of) intervention. The paper tests the hypothesis that a "laissez-faire" governance approach is likely to produce less desirable outcomes in a scenario of mass uptake of AVs than would a well-planned set of government interventions. This is done using two prominent themes in transport policy - traffic flow and accessibility - in a scenario of high market penetration of Level-5 automated vehicles in capitalist market economies. The evidence used is drawn from a literature review and from the findings of a set of workshops with stakeholders. We suggest that a laissez-faire approach will lead to an increase in traffic volume as a result of a growing population of "drivers" and a probable increase in kilometres driven per passenger. At the same time, the hoped-for increases in network efficiency commonly claimed are not guaranteed to come about without appropriate government intervention. The likely consequence is an increase in congestion. And, with respect to accessibility, it is likely that the benefits of AVs will be enjoyed by wealthier individuals and that the wider impacts of AV use (including sprawl) may lead to a deterioration in accessibility for those who depend on walking, cycling or collective transport. We consider the range of possible government intervention in five categories: Planning/land-use; Regulation/policy; Infrastructure/technology; Service provision; and Economic instruments. For each category, we set out a series of interventions that might be used by governments (at city, region or state level) to manage congestion or protect accessibility in the AV scenario described. Many of these (e.g. road pricing) are already part of the policy mix but some (e.g. ban empty running of AVs) would be new. We find that all interventions applicable to the management of traffic flow would also be expected to contribute to the management of accessibility; we define a small number of additional interventions aimed at protecting the accessibility of priority groups. Our general finding is that the adoption of a package of these interventions could be expected to lead to better performance against generic traffic-flow and accessibility objectives than would a laissez-faire approach, though questions of extent of application remain. In our conclusions, we contrast laissez-faire with both anticipatory governance and "precautionary" governance and acknowledge the political difficulty associated with acting in the context of uncertainty. We point out that AVs do not represent the first emerging technology to offer both opportunities and risks and challenge governments at all levels to acknowledge the extent of their potential influence and, in particular, to examine methodically the options available to them and the potential consequences of pursuing them.

ID TRACKING
AB This article investigates the attitude control problem for a novel foldable wave-energy powered autonomous underwater vehicle (FWEPAUV) with model uncertainties and external disturbances. To find a trade-off between the control accuracy and control energy consumption, a robust performance-prescribed optimized backstepping control (RPOBC) scheme is designed for optimal tracking problem by combining the reinforcement learning (RL) technique. The performance-prescribed mechanism is devised to ensure the prescribed tracking accuracy. To make the controller robust against the model uncertainties and external disturbances, an auxiliary system with a novel cost function is introduced into the optimized backstepping (OB) framework. Besides, the theoretical analysis indicates that the RPOBC scheme can guarantee tracking errors converge to predefined performance with an optimal control performance. At last, the simulation results are presented and analyzed to demonstrate the effectiveness of the designed RPOBC strategy.

AB To explore the seabed as well as the depth, to perform the various tasks in an underwater environment, to study the behavior of aquatic animals many researchers and scientists have developed underwater autonomous vehicles using different techniques. After going through all the robotic fishes developed in the last decade, we have developed a novel way and technique to enhance the speed of the robotic fishes under a certain range (30-40cm) of robotic body length. A crank-slotted slider and lever mechanism-based mechanism and fin have been designed to produce a forward thrust up to 25gmf. In the above system, the rotational motion produced by the DC motor is translated to oscillatory motion using a crank-slotted slider mechanism. The mechanical advantage is enhanced by the use of a certain length of the lever. Finally, for the given system a mathematical fin formula is introduced, tested, and implemented.

ID DAMAGE; EARTHQUAKES
AB The area affected by the earthquake is vast and often difficult to entirely cover, and the earthquake itself is a sudden event that causes multiple defects simultaneously, that cannot be effectively traced using traditional, manual methods. This article presents an innovative approach to the problem of detecting damage after sudden events by using an interconnected set of deep machine learning models organized in a single pipeline and allowing for easy modification and swapping models seamlessly. Models in the pipeline were trained with a synthetic dataset and were adapted to be further evaluated and used with unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) in real-world conditions. Thanks to the methods presented in the article, it is possible to obtain high accuracy in detecting buildings defects, segmenting constructions into their components and estimating their technical condition based on a single drone flight.

AB Poor road-surface conditions pose a significant safety risk to vehicle operation, especially in the case of autonomous vehicles. Hence, maintenance of road surfaces will become even more important in the future. With the development of deep learning-based computer image processing technology, artificial intelligence models that evaluate road conditions are being actively researched. However, as the lighting conditions of the road surface vary depending on the weather, the model performance may degrade for an image whose brightness falls outside the range of the learned image, even for the same road. In this study, a semantic segmentation model with an autoencoder structure was developed for detecting road surface along with a CNN-based image preprocessing model. This setup ensures better road-surface crack detection by adjusting the image brightness before it is input into the road-crack detection model. When the preprocessing model was applied, the road-crack segmentation model exhibited consistent performance even under varying brightness values.

AB Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) have recently shown great performance collecting visual data through autonomous exploration and mapping, which are widely used in reconnaissance, surveillance, and target acquisition (RSTA) applications. In this paper, we present an onboard vision-based system for low-cost UAVs to autonomously track a moving target. Real-time visual tracking is achieved by using an object detection algorithm based on the Kernelized Correlation Filter (KCF) tracker. A 3-axis gimbaled camera with separate Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU) is used to aim at the selected target during flights. The flight control algorithm for tracking tasks is implemented on a customized quadrotor equipped with an onboard computer and a microcontroller. The proposed system is experimentally validated by successfully chasing a ground and aerial target in an outdoor environment, which has proven its reliability and efficiency.

AB Collisions may be harnessed as a way to improve the overall safety and navigational effectiveness of some spacecraft. However, leveraging this capability in autonomous platforms requires the ability to plan trajectories comprising impulsive contact. This paper addresses this problem through the development of a collision-inclusive approach to optimal trajectory planning for a three-degree-of-freedom free-flying spacecraft. First, experimental data are used to formulate a physically realistic collision model for the spacecraft. It is shown that this model is linear over the expected operational range, enabling a piecewise affine representation of the full hybrid vehicle dynamics. Next, the dynamics model and vehicle constraints are incorporated into a mixed integer program. Experimental comparisons of trajectories with and without collision-avoidance requirements demonstrate the capability of the collision-inclusive strategy to achieve significant performance improvements in realistic scenarios. A simulated case study illustrates the potential for this approach to find damage-mitigating paths in online implementations.

AB The SAE AutoDrive Challenge is a 3-year collegiate competition to develop a self-driving car by 2020. The second year of the competition was held in June 2019 at MCity, a mock town built for self-driving car testing at the University of Michigan. Teams were required to autonomously navigate a series of intersections while handling pedestrians, traffic lights, and traffic signs. Zeus is aUToronto's winning entry in the AutoDrive Challenge. This article describes the system design and development of Zeus as well as many of the lessons learned along the way. This includes details on the team's organizational structure, sensor suite, software components, and performance at the Year 2 competition. With a team of mostly undergraduates and minimal resources, aUToronto has made progress toward a functioning self-driving vehicle, in just 2 years. This article may prove valuable to researchers looking to develop their own self-driving platform.

ID THRESHOLD
AB The purpose of the self-driving car is to minimize the number casualties of traffic accidents. One of the effects of traffic accidents is an improper speed of a car, especially at the road turn. If we can make the anticipation of the road turn, it is possible to avoid traffic accidents. This paper presents a cutting edge curve lane detection algorithm based on the Kalman filter for the self-driving car. It uses parabola equation and circle equation models inside the Kalman filter to estimate parameters of a using curve lane. The proposed algorithm was tested with a self-driving vehicle. Experiment results show that the curve lane detection algorithm has a high success rate. The paper also presents simulation results of the autonomous vehicle with the feature to control steering and speed using the results of the full curve lane detection algorithm.

AB Modeling and evaluation of human driving behavior are the core to intelligent transportations and autonomous vehicles. This paper applies a human-like driver model based on vehicle test data and the neural network. This is accomplished by compromising the merits of error-based HMM-PID module and style-based neural network algorithm, both of which will work together to form a united driver model. In the simulation, the comparisons on driving performance, e.g., fuel economy and target following ability, are presented between PID-like driver and the proposed human-like driver. Several driving behavior criteria published by SAE, e.g., energy rating and energy economy rating, are borrowed in this paper to provide standardized metrics for evaluating the driver performance on fuel economy and emissions. Experimental results verified the effectiveness of the proposed scheme.

AB In contrast to the wide adoption of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) in the military sector, a far less number of successful applications have been reported on civilian side due to high cost, complexities in operation, and conflicts with existing infrastructure, notably the access of civilian airspace. However, there exist a few cases where UAVs have been successfully adopted to delegate dull, dirty, dangerous tasks in civilian sectors. In this paper, we consider one of such cases, the agricultural application of UAVs and present our work to develop an industrial UAV platform. The developed system is capable of fully autonomous flights with a payload of 30 kg for more than an hour. We present the overview of our program as well as detailed description of the development processes. We believe, when combined with highly reliable hardware and adequate adaptation to the civilian demands, in a not too distant future more UAVs will successfully serve the needs of public.

AB The Object Oriented Control Architecture for Autonomy (O-2 CA(2)) is a control architecture being developed at the University of Girona. Conceived as a hybrid, it is organised in three layers (deliberative, control execution and reactive) merging the deliberation mechanisms of planning with reactive behaviours in charge of controlling the robot in real-time. The aim of this paper is to provide an overall description of the whole architecture and an in-depth description of the reactive layer. The concepts of the architecture were firstly tested through the simulation of a simple mission consisting of navigating through a sequence of way-points while avoiding contact with obstacles. Apart from that, further testing has been carried out using the GARBI ROV as an experimental platform. The principal object is to increase the capabilities of GARBI in order to transform it into an AUV. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB In this paper, we discuss the security and reliability performance of a communication system, where the base station (BS) transmits signals to multiple users and an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) jammer sends friendly jamming signals to protect against a full-duplex active eavesdropper with the aid of caching. We derive the closed-form expressions of outage probability (OP) and intercept probability (IP) for the legitimate users and active eavesdropper, respectively. Aimed at minimizing the sum of the IP and the maximum OP among all users, we jointly optimize the BS transmit power, UAV jammer location and jamming power. An efficient algorithm based on alternating optimization (AO) and successive convex approximation (SCA) methods is designed to solve the optimization problem. Numerical results show that compared to other benchmark strategies, the proposed solution improves the reliability and security performance with the aid of caching and UAV friendly jamming.

ID DEPLOYMENT
AB The deployment of aerial base stations (ABSs) mounted onboard unmanned aerial vehicles is emerging as a promising technology to provide connectivity in areas where terrestrial infrastructure is insufficient or absent. This may occur, for example, in remote areas, large events, emergency situations, or areas affected by natural disasters such as wildfires or tsunamis. To successfully materialize this goal, it is required that ABSs are placed at locations in 3D space that ensure a high quality of service to the ground terminals. This article provides a tutorial introduction to this ABS placement problem where the fundamental challenges and trade-offs are first investigated by means of a toy application example. Next, the different approaches in the literature to address the aforementioned challenges in both 2D or 3D space are introduced, and a discussion on adaptive placement is provided. The article is concluded by discussing future research directions.

AB The localization performance of single beacon navigation system is affected by the accuracy of effective sound velocity (ESV) which is difficult to precisely know. The state augmented method and expectation-maximization (EM) based method, the two existing state-of-the-art single beacon navigation methods which can deal with the unknown ESV, are sensitive to the noise statistic parameters and vehicle initial position offset, respectively. This paper proposes a variational Bayesian (VB) approximation based adaptive single beacon navigation method to deal with these deficiencies. The ESV is treated as a random variable with unknown statistic parameters, and the state vector, ESV and ESV uncertainty parameters are simultaneously estimated by VB approximation. Numerical studies indicate that the proposed VB approximation based navigation method can overcome the deficiencies of both state augmented and EM-based navigation methods, achieve better localization and ESV estimation performance than the existing state-of-the-art methods.

AB A nonlinear control algorithm for tracking dynamic trajectories using an aerial vehicle is developed in this work. The control structure is designed using a sliding mode methodology, which contains integral sliding properties. The stability analysis of the closed-loop system is proved using the Lyapunov formalism, ensuring convergence in a desired finite time and robustness toward unknown and external perturbations from the first time instant, even for high frequency disturbances. In addition, a dynamic trajectory is constructed with the translational dynamics of an aerial robot for autonomous take-off, surveillance missions, and landing. This trajectory respects the constraints imposed by the vehicle characteristics, allowing free initial trajectory conditions. Simulation results demonstrate the good performance of the controller in closed-loop system when a quadrotor follows the designed trajectory. In addition, flight tests are developed to validate the trajectory and the controller behavior in real time.

AB In order to improve path tracking performance of Beaver AUV, a new method for path tracking controller design is proposed basing on variable structure control theory and nonlinear dynamics model of Beaver. Switching surface of variable structure controllers is founded with corresponding error and error derivative of surge displacement and yaw angle. Exponential approach law is adopted to derive control algorithm for surge and yaw in the process of path tracking. Chattering phenomenon is restrained due to adaptive neurons which are used for approaching speed adjusting online. Simulation results of sinusoidal path tracking, circular path tracking and planning path tracking show that tracking precision of Beaver AUV is improved more evidently through variable structure control with adaptive approaching speed compared with variable structure control using fixed approaching speed. The method proposed in this article is effective and feasible.

AB In recent years there has been a growing awareness of the benefits of using ''intelligent pigs '' as a means of maintaining the integrity of pipelines. These pigs are autonomous devices which are transported internally through a pipeline and conduct inspections on-line without the need for taking the pipeline out of operation.
   This awareness has resulted in the worldwide acceptance of the use of high-resolution on-line inspection equipment for the inspection of high-pressure transmission pipelines.
   This inspection technology has now been further developed by British Gas for low-pressure pipelines, such as gas and water distribution pipelines, refinery pipelines and even pipelines from the jetty loading point to the terminal. Indeed, discrete sections of decommissioned high-pressure transmission pipelines can also be inspected by this method.
   This paper describes the tethered inspection vehicle (TIV) as a method of ensuring pipeline integrity, while eliminating unnecessary hydrostatic testing, thereby avoiding the environmental consequences of pipeline failure.

AB The berthing of maritime autonomous surface ships (MASSs) is a challenging operation even for an experienced captain due to the required complicated maneuvering at low speeds in a constrained water space. This article addresses safety-aware automatic berthing of MASSs moving in a constrained water region with stationary and moving obstacles. A safety-critical constrained anti-disturbance control method is proposed for the automatic berthing of MASSs subject to velocity constraints, input constraints, and collision-avoidance constraints, as well as ocean disturbances. At the kinematic level, desired linear velocities and yaw rate are prescribed by incorporating a line-of-sight guidance scheme to achieve position-heading stabilization. At the kinetic level, an anti-disturbance kinetic control law is designed based on an extended state observer. Through converting the input constraints to velocity constraints on guidance signals, the safety-guidance signals are obtained by solving a quadratic programming problem subject to the state, input, and collision-avoidance constraints. It is proven that an MASS controlled by using the proposed method is input-to-state safe in the presence of ocean disturbances. Simulation results are elaborated to substantiate the efficacy of the proposed safety-certified control law for the automatic berthing of an MASS subject to physical constraints and environmental disturbances.

AB Point-based 3D detection approaches usually suffer from the severe point sampling imbalance problem between foreground and background. We observe that prior works have attempted to alleviate this imbalance by emphasizing foreground sampling. However, even adequate foreground sampling may be extremely unbalanced between nearby and distant objects, yielding unsatisfactory performance in detecting distant objects. To tackle this issue, this paper first proposes a novel method named Distant Object Augmented Set Abstraction and Regression (DO-SA&R) to enhance distant object detection, which is vital for the timely response of decision-making systems like autonomous driving. Technically, our approach first designs DO-SA with novel distant object augmented farthest point sampling (DO-FPS) to emphasize sampling on distant objects by leveraging both object-dependent and depth-dependent information. Then, we propose distant object augmented regression to reweight all the instance boxes for strengthening regression training on distant objects. In practice, the proposed DO-SA&R can be easily embedded into the existing modules, yielding consistent performance improvements, especially on detecting distant objects. Extensive experiments are conducted on the popular KITTI, nuScenes and Waymo datasets, and DO-SA&R demonstrates superior performance, especially for distant object detection. Our code is available at https://github.com/mikasa3lili/DO-SAR.

AB Oil spill, may happen as a result of the offshore well vessel failures. The precise information about the location and real-time situation of the oil spill is essential to perform an efficient treatment of these environmental catastrophes. A novel approach of multi robot's system which can navigate autonomously and track oil spill on the sea surfaces. This system is able to self-adapt and path plan amidst environmental changes, including the temporospatial variation of the oil concentration. The method consists of two main parts, which are the modelling of the oil spill, the tracking system and autonomous control of the robots. The simulated model depicts the morphological complexities of the spatiotemporal changes in the oil spills. The fuzzy controller is designed to control the robots to control nonlinear and non-crisply distributed water surfaces where oil pollution occurs. Meanwhile, the multi-robot path planning system hybridised with artificial potential field approach to avoid the collision. Several numerical simulations with different scenarios are done to show the robustness of the methods, based on the accuracy and precision of tracking. The evaluation with the simulated ground truth demonstrates that accuracy and precision of the tracking system are more than 70 and 80 percent respectively.

AB The problem of pose estimation arises in many areas of computer vision, including object recognition, object tracking, site inspection and updating, and autonomous navigation using scene models. We present a new algorithm, called SoftPOSIT, for determining the pose of a 3D object from a single 2D image in the case that correspondences between model points and image points are unknown. The algorithm combines Gold's iterative SoftAssign algorithm [19, 20] for computing correspondences and DeMenthon's iterative POSIT algorithm [13] for computing object pose under a full-perspective camera model. Our algorithm, unlike most previous algorithms for this problem, does not have to hypothesize small sets of matches and then verify the remaining image points. Instead, all possible matches are treated identically throughout the search for an optimal pose. The performance of the algorithm is extensively evaluated in Monte Carlo simulations on synthetic data under a variety of levels of clutter, occlusion, and image noise. These tests show that the algorithm performs well in a variety of difficult scenarios, and empirical evidence suggests that the algorithm has a run-time complexity that is better than previous methods by a factor equal to the number of image points. The algorithm is being applied to the practical problem of autonomous vehicle navigation in a city through registration of a 3D architectural models of buildings to images obtained from an on-board camera.

AB A novel covert communication framework is proposed to enhance the privacy of the unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)-enabled relaying systems. Specifically, the full-duplex (FD) UAV covertly relays data from each ground sensor to remote base station (BS) against a warden (Willie). Considering a noise uncertainty model, the minimum detection error probability (DEP) of Willie is first derived. Under the constraint of the derived DEP, the minimum average covert transmission rate (ACTR) is then maximized by jointly designing the sensor association, the UAV transmit power, and the UAV trajectory. A low-complexity algorithm based on the penalty successive convex approximation (P-SCA) is further invoked to achieve the locally optimal solution. Finally, numerical results show the effectiveness of the proposed framework and reveal some insights, i.e., increasing uncertainty at Willie can improve the covertness performance.

AB The article addresses the three-dimensional (3D) underwater path planning problem of an autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) in a time-varying current. A modified artificial potential field algorithm combining the velocity vector synthesis method is proposed to search for the optimal path. The modified potential field (MPF) algorithm is designed to dynamically plan the non-collision path. Meanwhile, this modified method is also proved to be an effective solution to the goals not reachable with obstacles nearby (GNRON), U-shaped trap, and rotation unreachable problems. To offset the influence of time-varying current, the velocity synthesis approach is designed to adjust the AUV movement direction. Besides, considering path planning in the complex underwater environment, the multi-beam forward-looking sonar (FLS) model is used. Finally, simulation studies substantiate that the designed algorithm can implement the AUV path planning effectively and successfully in a 3D underwater environment.

AB Bathymetric simultaneous localisation and mapping (SLAM) methods yield accurate navigation results for autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) and can construct consistent seabed terrain maps. Multiple independently working vehicles can complete tasks like surveying and mapping efficiently, which means cooperative bathymetric SLAM using multiple AUVs is suitable for large-scale seabed mapping. However, the transmission of bathymetric measurements collected using a multi-beam echo sounder over a low bandwidth, noisy, and unreliable acoustic channel is difficult, making cooperative bathymetric SLAM very challenging. This paper develops a graph-based cooperative bathymetric SLAM system that can compress many bathymetric measurements into small-scale acoustic packets and yield accurate navigation results with a 10% loss of acoustic packets caused by unreliable acoustic communication. According to the simulation conducted using the field data, the new algorithm is shown to be robust and capable of providing accurate location and mapping results over a low bandwidth, noisy, and unreliable acoustic channel.

AB As unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) are used more and more in military operations, increasing their level of autonomous decision making becomes necessary. In uncertain battlefield environments, when making sovereign decisions, UAVs must choose low-risk options. An integrated framework is proposed for UAV robust decision making in air-to-ground attack missions under severe uncertainty. In the offline part of the framework, the battlefield scenarios are analyzed and an influence diagram is built to represent the decision situation. In the online part, the UAV evaluates the alternative actions for every scenario, and then the optimal robust action is chosen, using the robust decision model. Results of simulation show that the proposed approach is feasible and effective. The framework can support UAVs in making independent robust decisions under circumstances which require immediate responses under severe uncertainty, and it can also be extended to applications in more complex situations.

AB It is known that for non-holonomic systems it is impossible to design a universal controller able to asymptotically stabilise any feasible reference trajectory. We present a smooth time-varying controller able to stabilise a wide class of reference trajectories that include converging (parking problem) and persistently exciting (tracking problem) ones, as well as set-points. For the first time in the literature we establish uniform global asymptotic stability for the origin of the closed-loop system in the kinematics state space. We also show that the kinematics controller renders the system robust to perturbations in the sense of integral-input-to-state stability. Then, we show that for the case in which the velocity dynamics equations are also considered (full model), any velocity-tracking controller with the property that the error velocities are square integrable may be used to ensure global tracking or stabilisation even under parametric uncertainty.

AB This paper describes an automated path-tracking system using a vision sensor. A lateral control law for path tracking is especially emphasized which is developed by using back-stepping control design methodology. To establish the proposed control system, the lateral offset to the reference path, the heading angle of the vehicle relative to the tangent line to the path, and the path curvature are required. Those inputs to the controller have been calculated through a Kalman filter which is frequently utilized for the purpose. Lane mark detection has been achieved in an electronic control unit platform with a vision sensor. The yaw rate and side-slip angle also needed in the controller are estimated by the observer. To demonstrate the performances of the proposed controller at different speeds, an experiment has been conducted on a proving ground having a straight section and a curved section with a curvature of about 260 m.

AB To realize a path keeping system (PKS), it is essential to guide autonomous vehicle (AV) to a desired direction while maintaining safety. To maintain a desired driving path, it is necessary for an AV to perceive its surrounding environment by gathering directional information while traveling. Therefore, precise localization of an AV and autonomous guidance are essential technologies for the successful implementation of a PKS. As a type of radio guidance, an AV can use trilateration to identify its location relative to three reference positions by measuring the strength, time, or time difference of the reception of transmitted radio signals. Direction of arrival (DOA) techniques can also be used to estimate the direction of a signal emitted from a transmitter, and this information can be used to set the driving direction of an AV. However, in a practical environment, estimation errors may arise when the AV estimates its location or the direction of signal emitted from a transmitter, and these errors may cause the problem of path departure. To address this problem, we conducted a mathematical analysis to identify potential errors in estimating location and direction. Herein we propose a target position decision algorithm for PKS, which uses trilateration and DOA (PKS-TnD) to drive an AV in a desired direction to avoid path departure. By using this algorithm, an AV calculates its next target position based on the error constraints of trilateration and DOA by means of numerical analysis. Additionally, an energy efficiency problem is also formulated herein and energy use is optimized by using a Lagrangian equation.

AB The lateral deviations on account of the penetrations of road curvature and the parameters uncertainties are the main issues against the autonomous vehicles (AVs) controller to provide effective performance including less error, fast response, and small overshoot. In this regard, this paper suggests a new improvement for the bald eagle search (BES) algorithm by dimension learning-based hunting (DLH). The proposed DLH strategy enhances the exploration behavior of the original BES to tackle different issues such as slow convergence, trapping in local optima, and the loss of the diversity in early stage. The proposed strategy improves the learning of each eagle from its neighbors rather than the knowledge of all individuals in the population. The improved BES (I-BES) is dedicated to overcome the tuning issue of the model predictive control (MPC) for AVs including vision dynamics. Besides, frequency domain bounds are formulated based on Hermite-Biehler theorem to handle the parameters uncertainty issue due to the variation of the AV speed and the road curvature during the tuning of the MPC gains. The optimization process is performed to ameliorate the damping performance of the AV response particularly by decreasing the system steady-state error, settling time, and maximum overshoot. A newly developed multi-objective formula is utilized to achieve the diminishing of the performance criteria simultaneously. The proposed I-BES and BES are tested against various standard benchmark optimization test functions and different statistical tests to confirm that the I-BES can perform better than BES. Moreover, the proposed I-BES is confirmed with the default BES, neural network algorithm (NNA), and genetic algorithm (GA) in cases of AV controllers. Furthermore, the response of the inspired robust MPC based on the I-BES algorithm can tackle the lateral deviation due to the variations of the road curvature with small overshoot and short settling time less than 0.1745% and 0.05 s respectively better than the fuzzy logic controller. Various scenarios are carried out to confirm the effectiveness of the suggested technique against the road curvature variation and the AV parameters uncertainty. The results emphasize the superiority of the inspired robust MPC based on the I-BES algorithm to provide the best-damped response and stabilize the AV system against the parameters uncertainty and the road curvature variation compared with the other techniques.

AB Motion Prediction (MP) of multiple surroundings agents is a crucial task in arbitrarily complex environments, from simple robots to Autonomous Driving Stacks (ADS). Current techniques tackle this problem using end-to-end pipelines, where the input data is usually a rendered top-view of the physical information and the past trajectories of the most relevant agents; leveraging this information is a must to obtain optimal performance. In that sense, a reliable ADS must produce reasonable predictions on time. However, despite many approaches use simple ConvNets and LSTMs to obtain the social latent features, State-of-the-Art (SOTA) models might be too complex for real-time applications when using both sources of information (map and past trajectories) as well as little interpretable, specifically considering the physical information. Moreover, the performance of such models highly depends on the number of available inputs for each particular traffic scenario, which are expensive to obtain, particularly, annotated High-Definition (HD) maps. In this work, we propose several efficient baselines for the well-known Argoverse 1 Motion Forecasting Benchmark. We aim to develop compact models using SOTA techniques for MP, including attention mechanisms and GNNs. Our lightweight models use standard social information and interpretable map information such as points from the driveable area and plausible centerlines by means of a novel physics-based heuristic step based on kinematic constraints, in opposition to black-box CNN-based or too-complex graphs methods for map encoding, to generate plausible multi-modal trajectories achieving up-to-pair accuracy with less operations and parameters than other SOTA methods. Our code is publicly available at https://github.com/Cram3r95/mapfe4mp.

AB Successful use of an auto-guided agricultural machine in paddy fields depends on the ability to generate a full-coverage path consisting of inner and outer-work paths adapted to various field shapes in the presence of an enclosing field boundary. To enhance the performance of a coverage path planner (CPP) developed in our previous study, this article describes the development of a complete CPP for a fully autonomous tillage tractor that provides automatic generation of both inner and outer-work paths, and boundary corner turning methods applicable to polygonal-shapedpaddy fields with various corner angles. Computer simulation of the developed turning manoeuvres was conducted using a 3D tractor-driving simulator by analysing the trajectories of a virtual tractor on ground under varying corner angle conditions. A field evaluation was performed with a 60-kW auto-guided tillage tractor equipped with the developed CPP in three different shapes of paddy fields. The results of the computer simulation confirmed that the designed boundary corner turning methods could provide an acceptable level of tracking performance with lateral deviations <70 mm when following boundary corner turning paths. In the field tests, the autonomous tillage tractor successfully followed the whole paths with lateral and heading root-mean-squared errors ranging from 32 to 101 mm and 0.6 degrees-2.2 degrees, respectively, and demonstrated superior tillage performance by reducing the skipped areas of 1.7%(triangle), 0.9% (quadrilateral), and 1.0%(pentagon) of the total area as compared with that of 8.5% obtained with the previously developed system.

AB Semantic segmentation is important for many real-world systems, e.g., autonomous vehicles, which predict the class of each pixel. Recently, deep networks achieved significant progress w.r.t. the mean Intersection-over Union (mIoU) with the cross-entropy loss. However, the cross entropy loss can essentially ignore the difference of severity for an autonomous car with different wrong prediction mistakes. For example, predicting the car to the road is much more servery than recognize it as the bus. Targeting for this difficulty, we develop a Wasserstein training framework to explore the inter-class correlation by defining its ground metric as misclassification severity. The ground metric of Wasserstein distance can be pre-defined following the experience on a specific task. From the optimization perspective, we further propose to set the ground metric as an increasing function of the pre-defined ground metric. Furthermore, an adaptively learning scheme of the ground matrix is proposed to utilize the high-fidelity CARLA simulator. Specifically, we follow a reinforcement alternative learning scheme. The experiments on both CamVid and Cityscapes datasets evidenced the effectiveness of our Wasserstein loss. The SegNet, ENet, FCN and Deeplab networks can be adapted following a plug in manner. We achieve significant improves on the predefined important classes, and much longer continuous play time in our simulator.

AB In this research, a hybrid approach for path planning of autonomous ships that generates both global and local paths, respectively, is proposed. The global path is obtained via an improved artificial potential field (APF) method, which makes up for the shortcoming that the typical APF method easily falls into a local minimum. A modified velocity obstacle (VO) method that incorporates the closest point of approach (CPA) model and the International Regulations for Preventing Collisions at Sea (COLREGS), based on the typical VO method, can be used to get the local path. The contribution of this research is two-fold: (1) improvement of the typical APF and VO methods, making up for previous shortcomings, and integrated COLREGS rules and good seamanship, making the paths obtained more in line with navigation practice; (2) the research included global and local path planning, considering both the safety and maneuverability of the ship in the process of avoiding collision, and studied the whole process of avoiding collision in a relatively entirely way. A case study was then conducted to test the proposed approach in different situations. The results indicate that the proposed approach can find both global and local paths to avoid the target ship.

AB This paper introduces an autonomous parking trajectory planning method in an unstructured environment with narrow passages. The proposed hierarchical trajectory planner consists of a graph search layer and a numerical optimal control layer. The contribution mainly lies in the graph search layer, wherein a multistage hybrid A* algorithm is proposed to handle narrow passages formed by obstacles in the cluttered environment. In the multistage hybrid A* algorithm, a 2-dim A* search is conducted to find a global route that connects the starting and goal points. Along the derived global route, subtle segments that traverse narrow passages are extracted. Thereafter, the hybrid A* algorithm is used to plan kinematically feasible subpaths that connect the boundary points of each subtle segment. The hybrid A* algorithm is also used to find linking paths that connect adjacent subpaths. Combining all the subpaths and linking paths in a sequence yields a coarse path, which is converted into a coarse trajectory by attaching a time-optimal velocity profile to it. The coarse trajectory is fed into the numerical optimization layer as the initial guess. Simulation results indicate that the hierarchical trajectory planner runs much faster than prevalent ones in dealing with unstructured environments with narrow passages.

ID AUTONOMOUS VEHICLES; CITIES
AB Fully driverless automated vehicles (AVs) could considerably alter the proximity value of parking, due to an AV's ability to drop passengers off at their destination, search for cheaper parking, and return to pick up their occupants when needed. This study estimates the potential impact of privately owned driverless vehicles on vehicle kilometers traveled (VKT), energy use, emissions, and parking revenues in the city of Seattle, Washington, from changes in parking decisions using an agent-based simulation model. Each AV is assumed to consider the cost to drive to each parking spot, the associated daily parking cost, and the parking availability at each location, and the AV ranks each choice in terms of economic cost. The simulation results indicate that at low penetration rates (5-25% AV penetration), AVs in downtown Seattle would travel an additional 5.6-6.4 km/day (3.5-4.0 mi/day) on average, and that, at high penetration rates (50-100% AV penetration), AVs would travel an additional 9.0-13.5 km/day (5.6-8.4 mi/day) on average. The results also suggest that as AV penetration rates increase, parking lot revenues decrease significantly and could likely decline to the point where operating a lot is unsustainable economically, if no parking-demand management policies are implemented. This could lead to changes in land use as the amount of parking needed in urban areas is reduced and cars move away from the downtown area for cheaper parking. This analysis provides an illustration of the first-order effects of AVs on the built environment and could help inform near- and long-term policy and infrastructure decisions during the transition to automation.

AB Dynamic road network optimization has been used for improving traffic flow in an infrequent and localized manner. The development of intelligent systems and technology provides an opportunity to improve the frequency and scale of dynamic road network optimization. However, such improvements are hindered by the high computational complexity of the existing algorithms that generate the optimization plans. We present a novel solution that integrates machine learning and road network optimization. Our solution consists of two complementary parts. The first part is an efficient algorithm that uses reinforcement learning to find the best road network configurations at real-time. The second part is a dynamic routing mechanism, which helps connected vehicles adapt to the change of the road network. Our extensive experimental results demonstrate that the proposed solution can substantially reduce the average travel time in a variety of scenarios, whilst being computationally efficient and hence applicable to real-life situations.

TI A Survey on Secure Deployment of Mobile Services in Edge Computing
SO SECURITY AND COMMUNICATION NETWORKS

DT Review
ID RESOURCE-ALLOCATION
AB Mobile edge computing (MEC) is an emerging technology that is recognized as a key to 5G networks. Because MEC provides an IT service environment and cloud-computing services at the edge of the mobile network, researchers hope to use MEC for secure service deployment, such as Internet of vehicles, Internet of Things (IoT), and autonomous vehicles. Because of the characteristics of MEC which do not have terminal servers, it tends to be deployed on the edge of networks. However, there are few related works that systematically introduce the deployment of MEC. Also, secure service deployment frameworks with MEC are even rare. For this reason, we have conducted a comprehensive and concrete survey of recent research studies on secure deployment. Although numerous research studies and experiments about MEC service deployment have been conducted, there are few systematic summaries that conclude basic concepts and development strategies about secure service deployment of commercial MEC. To make up for the gap, a detailed and complete survey about relative achievements is presented.

Fuzzy correlation peak problem of underwater LBL acoustic propagation multipath could be solved based on SINS positional information, thus improving LBL positional accuracy. Moreover, introduction of SINS-centered LBL locating information could compensate accumulative AUV position error effectively and regularly. Compared to loosely coupled algorithm, this tightly coupled algorithm can still provide accurate location information when there are fewer than four available hydrophones (or within the signal receiving range). Therefore, effective positional calibration area of tightly coupled system based on LBL array is wider and has higher reliability and fault tolerance than loosely coupled. It is more applicable to AUV positioning based on SINS/LBL.

AB Thermal soaring saves much energy, but flying large distances in this form represents a great challenge for birds, people and unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs). The solution is to make use of the so-called thermals, which are localized, warmer regions in the atmosphere moving upward with a speed exceeding the descent rate of birds and planes. Saving energy by exploiting the environment more efficiently is an important possibility for autonomous UAVs as well. Successful control strategies have been developed recently for UAVs in simulations and in real applications. This paper first presents an overview of our knowledge of the soaring flight and strategy of birds, followed by a discussion of control strategies that have been developed for soaring UAVs both in simulations and applications on real platforms. To improve the accuracy of the simulation of thermal exploitation strategies we propose a method to take into account the effect of turbulence. Finally, we propose a new GPS-independent control strategy for exploiting thermal updrafts.

AB Configuration random access memory (CRAM), which consists of the static random access memory susceptible to single event upset (SEU), configures all of the user logic in field-programmable gate array (FPGA). In this article, we evaluate the impact of SEU in CRAM on the image-based lane tracking for autonomous driving via neutron irradiation experiments. In the experiments, the cross section of bit upsets and its corresponding single event function interrupt (SEFI) in the logic function of image processing are measured. By using a virtual driving environment, we observe whether a bit upset finally induces a severe SEFI of the system failure. The system failure is observed by an abnormal behavior on the virtual autonomous car driving by lane tracking. Experimental results show the bit upset has a maximum probability of 23% to induce SEFI and finally 8% of the bit upsets lead to failures in lane tracking. All the SEFIs observed in irradiation experiments are reproduced in fault injections with the same bit address. The cross section of SEFI was estimated in fault injections with reasonable precision. Moreover, we evaluate the improvement of system reliability by the error correction against soft errors. Our evaluation result shows that the error correction within the period of two-frame processing time could reduce the 74% SEFI cross section, but it has little benefit for system failure cross section if an error happens during the period of the image processing.

TI Service agent-transport agent task planning incorporating robust
   scheduling techniques
SO ROBOTICS AND AUTONOMOUS SYSTEMS
LA English
DT Article
DE Autonomous agents; Robotics; Scheduling; Bayes risk; Robust scheduling
AB As the use of cooperative, heterogeneous teams of autonomous robots to perform tasks such as autonomous package delivery and long-duration ocean sampling becomes more prevalent, the is a quickly emerging need to study the high-level interaction of specialized robotic agents that perform service tasks, and specialized transport agents that transport the service agents between service areas. If the service routes, docking, and deployment schedules are not carefully planned, the overall schedule is inefficient at best, and possibly even infeasible due to fuel limitations at worst. We introduce a new problem in the area of scheduling and route planning operations called the service agent transport problem (SATP). Within the SATP, autonomous service agents must perform tasks at a number of locations. The agents are free to move between locations, however, the agents may also be transported throughout the region by a limited number of faster-moving transport agents. The goal of the SATP is to plan a schedule of service agent and transport agent actions such that all locations are serviced in the shortest amount of time. We believe the SATP formulation is unique because there is strong coupling between vehicle constraints as well as between the task allocation component of the problem and the scheduling component of the problem. We present a solution to the problem using a mixed-integer linear programming optimization framework and compare several complexity reduction heuristics to full optimization. Additionally, we include methods to account for relative uncertainty in the duration of planned tasks in such a manner as to balance the risk of schedule slips (conflicts) to the risk of creating an overly conservative and sub-optimal schedule.

AB Rapid localization of hazardous gas leak sources is a vital task regarding the security of human society. Over the past few decades, autonomous search using mobile sensing devices equipped with gas sensors has become a promising field. Cognitive search strategies, such as Infotaxis and Entrotaxis, have been successfully used to search an unknown source autonomously in turbulence. However, they are time-consuming and may not be efficient because all source parameters (locations and strength) are estimated via particle filtering, especially when the prior information of source strength is rarely known. To address this inefficiency, this paper proposes a hybrid autonomous source searching approach, named as regression-enhanced Entrotaxis, which incorporates the Entrotaxis algorithm with the regression methods. Only the position of leak source is inferred by particle filtering, while the strength is estimated by the least squares based on the historical measurements. Through this way, the searching space in particle filtering is converted from 3-dimensions (source position in x-y plane and source strength) to 2-dimensions (source position in x-y plane), speeding up the computation significantly. Then, the reward function according to maximum entropy sampling principles is utilized to guide the robot's next move. The performance of the proposed method is compared to that of the Entrotaxis algorithm. The results of Monte Carlo simulations demonstrate that fewer particles will be used to reach a specific success rate, saving time in the search process. Besides, the proposed strategy relies on less prior information regarding source strength, which is more in line with the actual scenario. In addition, the proposed approach is adaptable to a broader search region.

AB Both underwater and wave gliders are known as autonomous unmanned energy-saving vehicles which have recently found applications for monitoring the world ocean. The paper under consideration discusses simplified mathematical models of these platforms enabling the straightforward parametric investigation into relationships between their parameters and performance. In its first part the paper discusses equations describing the motion of an underwater glider (UG) in a vertical plane as a basis for derivations relating geometric, kinematic and hydrodynamic characteristics of UG and its lifting system with relative differential buoyancy and pitch angle. Obtained therewith are formulae for the estimation of the UG glide path speed, lift-to-drag ratio, range of navigation and endurance. The approach is exemplified for typical cases of the UG conceived as winged bodies of revolution and flying wings. The calculated results feature dependencies of the UG speed on its configuration and volume as well as on the angle of attack for different magnitudes of relative buoyancy. Also considered is an optimal mode of operation, based on the maximization of the lift-to-drag ratio. The second part of the paper is dedicated to the estimation of the thrust and speed of a wave glider (WG), comprising a surface module (float) and underwater module represented by a wing, with the use of a simplified mathematical modeling intended to clarify the influence of the parameters upon the performance of the WG. The derivations led to an equation of forced oscillations of the vehicle accounting for the interaction of the upper and lower modules, connected by a rigid umbilical. The exciting impact of progressive waves of a given length and amplitude is found through the calculation of the variation of a buoyancy force in accordance with the Froude-Krylov hypothesis. The derivatives of time-varying lift with respect to kinematic parameters, entering the equation of vertical motion of the WG, as well as coefficients of instantaneous and time-averaged thrust force, are found by resorting to the oscillating hydrofoil theory. The derivation of the available thrust and the approximate calculation of the drag of the vehicle with account of wave and viscous components enable the evaluation of the speed of the WG for the prescribed geometry of the craft and wave motion parameters.

AB In this paper, we proposed a scheduling method to optimize a time-critical traffic using genetic algorithm in automotive ethernet networks. The proposed traffic scheduling method aims to generate a transmission schedule to minimize end-to-end delay, variation of reception time at the destination (jitter), and bandwidth utilization. These indicators should be simultaneously considered when generating a schedule since they are closely related to the performance of the networks. However, it is not easy to schedule the traffic considering these indicators together since they have different sizes and units. To solve this problem, the fitness function to evaluate performance of a chromosome has normalized indicators as parameters. A chromosome in the genetic algorithm consists of genes containing information (size, transmission period, and network delay) of messages to be scheduled. Finally, the applicability of the proposed schedule optimization method was examined by simulating an extended automotive Ethernet network for an autonomous vehicle.

AB Operations of transportation in cluttered environments require robust motion planning algorithms. Specially with large and heavy vehicles under hazardous operations of maintenance, such as in the ITER, an international nuclear fusion research project. The load transportation inside the ITER facilities require smooth and optimized paths with safety margin of 30 cm. The transportation is accomplished by large rhombic-like vehicles to exploit its kinematic capabilities. This paper presents the performance analysis of a motion planning algorithm to optimize trajectories in terms of clearance, smoothness and execution time in cluttered scenarios. The algorithm is an upgraded version of a previous one used in ITER, replacing the initialization implemented using Constrained Delaunay Triangulation by the Fast Marching Square. Exhaustive simulated experiments have been carried out in different levels of ITER buildings, comparing the performance of the algorithm using different metrics. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

ID SLIDING MODE CONTROL; NONLINEAR-SYSTEMS; UNDERWATER
AB The tracking control problem of AUV in six degrees-of-freedom (DOF) is addressed in this paper. in general, the velocities of the vehicles are very difficult to be accurately measured, which causes full state feedback scheme to be not feasible. Hence, an adaptive output feedback controller based on dynamic recurrent fuzzy neural network (DRFNN) is proposed, in which the location information is only needed for controller design. The DRFNN is used to online estimate the dynamic uncertain nonlinear mapping. Compared to the conventional neural network, DRFNN can clearly improve the tracking performance of AUV due to its less inputs and stronger memory features. The restricting condition for the estimation of the external disturbances and network's approximation errors, which is often given in the existing literatures, is broken in this paper. The stability analysis is given by Lyapunov theorem. Simulations illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed control scheme. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Resistance to the adoption of autonomous systems comes in part from the perceived unreliability of the systems. The concerns can be addressed by deploying decision making algorithms that defines what it means to fail, and look for plans with the highest reward while limiting the probability of failure. This chance-constrained approach thus explicitly imposes a set of constraints that must be satisfied for success, and provides upper-bounds on the probability of violating such constraints. A chance-constrained mixed logical-linear program (CC-MLLP) is a natural formulation, allowing for the specification of linear and logical constraints, with probabilistic continuous variables. The formalism can be used to describe problems ranging from autonomous underwater vehicle path planning, to network routing under uncertainty. While naive encodings of CC-MLLPs can be solved with generalised solvers, the solution time may be unreasonable. In this work, we study architectures to speed up solutions by partitioning CC-MLLPs into the discrete and continuous portions. In order to provide faster solutions, we investigate methods for speeding up the solutions to the continuous chance constrained linear programs. Further, by exploiting the new solution methods, we develop techniques for guiding the discrete decision making portion of the problem. The resulting algorithm achieves 10 times speed up over prior approaches on autonomous path planning benchmarks.& COPY; 2023 Published by Elsevier B.V.

AB Inspired by the excellent navigational behavior of animals, this paper presents a bionic autonomous navigation (bio-navi) system by using a stereo camera and a polarization navigation sensor (POLNS). A topological graph consisting of nodes and edges forms the core of the system, which is similar to the simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM). Like most of the SLAM approaches, in the bio-navi system, a node contains pose (position and attitude) and visual template information while an edge represents a constraint between two nodes. The difference is that the POLNS is introduced into the system. The yaw angle obtained from POLNS is attached to a node as a new property and also forms a new edge which restricts the direction of the related node. Besides, an absolute place constraint edge is added to the current node when recognizing a prior known place. To improve the accuracy and robustness of the place recognition, a POLNS-assist loop closure detection method is presented and to correct the pose error of constructed nodes, an improved graph optimization algorithm is derived in detail which is able to make full use of all the constraints. To demonstrate the performance of the system, an outdoor vehicle test has been done, and the results show its effectiveness and feasibility.

AB Stereo matching is an important component technology that constitutes the 3D perception capability of autonomous vehicles. On resource-constrained edge devices, it is very important to compute in real-time with very low time. However, most stereo matching networks focus on generating disparity maps on high-end GPUs, which do not meet the real-time requirements on edge devices. To solve this problem, a new stereo matching network is proposed in this paper to achieve real-time stereo matching on edge devices. The proposed network greatly improves the inference speed by constructing a low-resolution feature extractor, and by using multi-stage residual methods for stereo matching. In particular, we propose a method that combines the group-wise L1 distance & the group-wise correlation cost volume and an effective attention-based 3D cost aggregation method. Our network achieves a good balance between speed and accuracy on the KITTI 2012 and KITTI 2015 datasets. The proposed network achieves 2.77% and 3.44% accuracy (D1-all) on KITTI 2012 and KITTI 2015, respectively. With TensorRT, the proposed network achieves 31.8 FPS and outperforms the real-time results of most state-of-the-art networks on NVIDIA Jetson Nano edge devices.

AB Autonomous harvesting and transportation is a long-term goal of the forest industry. One of the main challenges is the accurate localization of both vehicles and trees in a forest. Forests are unstructured environments where it is difficult to find a group of significant landmarks for current fast feature-based place recognition algorithms. This paper proposes a novel approach where local point clouds are matched to a global tree map using the Delaunay triangularization as the representation format. Instead of point cloud based matching methods, we utilize a topology-based method. First, tree trunk positions are registered at a prior run done by a forest harvester. Second, the resulting map is Delaunay triangularized. Third, a local submap of the autonomous robot is registered, triangularized and matched using triangular similarity maximization to estimate the position of the robot. We test our method on a dataset accumulated from a forestry site at Lieksa, Finland. A total length of 200 m of harvester path was recorded by an industrial harvester with a 3D laser scanner and a geolocation unit fixed to the frame. Our experiments show a 12 cm s.t.d. in the location accuracy and with real-time data processing for speeds not exceeding 0.5 m/s. The accuracy and speed limit are realistic during forest operations.

DT Article
ID WIND-FIELD; AIRCRAFT; EXPLORATION; MINI
AB Soaring strategies are redefining the flight capabilities of small-class fixed-wing unmanned aerial vehicles. This paper presents an autonomous soaring strategy that exploits updraft energy independent of the classification of an updraft. The strategy employs an artificial lumbered flight algorithm (ALFA) that weighs near-field updraft velocity estimates and mission priorities in real time for navigation through a wind field. This work addresses the question of ALFA's ability to handle classified and unclassified updrafts. Instead of explicitly considering the classification of the updraft, the ALFA measures updraft data along an aircraft's flight path, estimates updraft data ahead of the aircraft, generates candidate flight paths ahead of the aircraft for evaluation, and then selects the best candidate flight path based on a reward function. This paper describes the structure of ALFA and the tuning processes used for the updraft estimator and the reward function. Flight results demonstrate the ALFA's ability to harvest atmospheric energy from classified and unclassified updrafts. The results discuss several produced flight behaviors in more detail, examining the ALFA's effectiveness when flying among classified updrafts. Finally, this paper concludes that harvesting energy from the atmosphere with real-time local decision making is practically feasible and suggests that autonomous flight design and control strategies for small-class fixed-wing aircraft will likely be driven by harvesting energy from the atmosphere.

ID MISSION
AB Robotic surface planetary exploration is a challenging endeavor, with critical safety requirements and severe communication constraints. Autonomous navigation is one of the most crucial and yet risky aspects of these operations. Therefore, a certain level of local autonomy for onboard robots is an essential feature, so that they can make their own decisions independently of ground control, reducing operational costs and maximizing the scientific return of the mission. In addition, existing tools to support research in this domain are usually proprietary to space agencies, and out of reach of most researchers. This paper presents a framework developed to support research in this field, a modular onboard software architecture design and a series of algorithms that implement a visual-based autonomous navigation approach for robotic space exploration. It allows analysis of algorithms' performance and functional validation of approaches and autonomy strategies, data monitoring and the creation of simulation models to replicate the vehicle, sensors, terrain and operational conditions. The framework and algorithms are partly supported by open-source packages and tools. A set of experiments and field testing with a physical robot and hardware are described as well, detailing results and algorithms' processing time, which experience an incremented of one order of magnitude when executed in space-certified like hardware, with constrained resources, in comparison to using general purpose hardware.

AB Planning and control for autonomous vehicles usually are hierarchically separated. However, increasing performance demands and operating in highly dynamic environments requires a frequent re-evaluation of the planning and tight integration of control and planning to guarantee safety, performance, and reliability. We propose an integrated hierarchical predictive control and planning approach to tackle this challenge. The planner and controller are based on repeated solutions of moving horizon optimal control problems. To increase flexibility and feasibility, the planner can choose different low-layer controller modes for increased flexibility and performance instead of using a single controller with a large safety margin for collision avoidance under uncertainty. Planning is based on simplified system dynamics and safety, yet flexible operation is ensured by constraint tightening based on a mixed-integer linear programming formulation. A cyclic horizon tube-based model predictive controller guarantees constraint satisfaction for different control modes and disturbances. Examples of different modes are slow-speed movement with high precision and fast-speed movements with large uncertainty bounds. Allowing for different control modes reduces conservatism, while the hierarchical decomposition of the problem reduces the computational cost and enables real-time implementation. We derive conditions for recursive feasibility to ensure constraint satisfaction and obstacle avoidance to guarantee safety and compatibility between the layers and modes. Simulation results illustrate the efficiency and applicability of the proposed hierarchical strategy.

AB Dynamic Field Theory (DFT) is an established framework for modeling embodied cognition. In DFT, elementary cognitive functions such as memory formation, formation of grounded representations, attentional processes, decision making, adaptation, and learning emerge from neuronal dynamics. The basic computational element of this framework is a Dynamic Neural Field (DNF). Under constraints on the time-scale of the dynamics, the DNF is computationally equivalent to a soft winner-take-all (WTA) network, which is considered one of the basic computational units in neuronal processing. Recently, it has been shown how a WTA network may be implemented in neuromorphic hardware, such as analog Very Large Scale Integration (VLSI) device. This paper leverages the relationship between DFT and soft WTA networks to systematically revise and integrate established DFT mechanisms that have previously been spread among different architectures. In addition, I also identify some novel computational and architectural mechanisms of DFT which may be implemented in neuromorphic VLSI devices using WTA networks as an intermediate computational layer. These specific mechanisms include the stabilization of working memory, the coupling of sensory systems to motor dynamics, intentionality, and autonomous learning. I further demonstrate how all these elements may be integrated into a unified architecture to generate behavior and autonomous learning.

AB Autonomous driving has gradually become a research hotspot in recent years. Visual Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) technology can help unmanned vehicles accurately explore the environment at a lower cost, and the readability of the map can be improved by integrating target detection algorithms. However, the location and 3D shape of the object in the map were not obtained. The method of RGBD-SLAM based on object detection with two-stream YOLOv4-MobileNetv3 convolutional neural network is proposed in this paper. RGBD SLAM algorithm and target detection algorithm are combined to build an algorithm model that can generate the global sparse map and build target dense map quickly. The two-stream network is integrated to obtain 2D information about the target, and further combined with the camera pose after the front-end key frame detection of the SLAM algorithm in this paper, and the dense 3D point cloud of the target and the center point position of the object is obtained. Then, the sparse point cloud of the SLAM system and the dense point cloud of the target can be obtained. The experimental results show that the number of point clouds decreases by about 50% and the time for mapping accounts for about 60% of the global dense mapping time. The method of this paper can efficiently decrease the computational space and improve the speed of semantic mapping, which verifies its feasibility and superiority. It can be used to achieve large-area mapping and the ability to update maps during autonomous driving.

AB Autonomous driving (AD) agents generate driving policies based on online perception results, which are obtained at multiple levels of abstraction, e.g., behavior planning, motion planning and control. Driving policies are crucial to the realization of safe, efficient and harmonious driving behaviors, where AD agents still face substantial challenges in complex scenarios. Due to their successful application in fields such as robotics and video games, the use of deep reinforcement learning (DRL) and deep imitation learning (DIL) techniques to derive AD policies have witnessed vast research efforts in recent years. This paper is a comprehensive survey of this body of work, which is conducted at three levels: First, a taxonomy of the literature studies is constructed from the system perspective, among which five modes of integration of DRL/DIL models into an AD architecture are identified. Second, the formulations of DRL/DIL models for conducting specified AD tasks are comprehensively reviewed, where various designs on the model state and action spaces and the reinforcement learning rewards are covered. Finally, an in-depth review is conducted on how the critical issues of AD applications regarding driving safety, interaction with other traffic participants and uncertainty of the environment are addressed by the DRL/DIL models. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first survey to focus on AD policy learning using DRL/DIL, which is addressed simultaneously from the system, task-driven and problem-driven perspectives. We share and discuss findings, which may lead to the investigation of various topics in the future.

AB Driven by the demand for efficient plant protection in orchards, the autonomous navigation system for orchards is hereby designed and developed in this study. According to the three modules of unmanned system "perception-decision-control," the environment perception and map construction strategy based on 3D lidar is constructed for the complex environment in orchards. At the same time, millimeter-wave radar is further selected for multi-source information fusion for the perception of obstacles. The extraction of orchard navigation lines is achieved by formulating a four-step extraction strategy according to the obtained lidar data. Finally, aiming at the control problem of plant protection machine, the ADRC control strategy is adopted to enhance the noise immunity of the system. Different working conditions are designed in the experimental section for testing the obstacle avoidance performance and navigation accuracy of the autonomous navigation sprayer. The experimental results show that the unmanned vehicle can identify the obstacle quickly and make an emergency stop and find a rather narrow feasible area when a moving person or a different thin column is used as an obstacle. Many experiments have shown a safe distance for obstacle avoidance about 0.5 m, which meets the obstacle avoidance requirements. In the navigation accuracy experiment, the average navigation error in both experiments is within 15 cm, satisfying the requirements for orchard spray operation. A set of spray test experiments are designed in the final experimental part to further verify the feasibility of the system developed by the institute, and the coverage rate of the leaves of the canopy is about 50%.

AB This article describes a Voronoi-based path generation (VPG) algorithm for an energy-constrained mobile robot, such as an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV). The algorithm solves a variation of the coverage path-planning problem where complete coverage of an area is not possible due to path-length limits caused by energy constraints on the robot. The algorithm works by modeling the path as a connected network of mass-spring-damper systems. The approach further leverages the properties of Voronoi diagrams to generate a potential field to move path waypoints to near-optimal configurations while maintaining path-length constraints. Simulation and physical experiments on an aerial vehicle are described. Simulated runtimes show linear-time complexity with respect to the number of path waypoints. Tests in variously shaped areas demonstrate that the method can generate paths in both convex and nonconvex areas. Comparison tests with other path generation methods demonstrate that the VPG algorithm strikes a good balance between runtime and optimality, with significantly better runtime than direct optimization, lower cost coverage paths than a lawnmower-style coverage path, and moderately better performance in both metrics than the most conceptually similar method. Physical experiments demonstrate the applicability of the VPG method to a physical UAV, and comparisons between real-world results and simulations show that the costs of the generated paths are within a few percent of each other, implying that analysis performed in simulation will hold for real-world application, assuming that the robot is capable of closely following the path and a good energy model is available.
   Note to Practitioners-For autonomous mobile-robotics-based applications where a robot equipped with a tool or sensor is required to survey an area for inspection, monitoring, cleaning, and so on, effectively covering the area is desirable. However, for energy-constrained systems such as aerial vehicles with limited flight time, complete coverage is not possible. Presented here is a new Voronoi-based path generation algorithm that takes energy constraints into account to generate waypoints for the robot to follow in a near-optimal configuration while maintaining path-length constraints. The approach is applied in simulation and experiments for an application in environmental monitoring using unmanned aerial vehicles.

AB Evaluation of thermal stratification and systematic monitoring of water temperature are required for lake management. Water temperature profiling requires temperature measurements through a water column to assess the level of thermal stratification which impacts oxygen content, microbial growth, and distribution of fish. The objective of this research was to develop and assess the functions of a water temperature profiling system mounted on a multirotor unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV). The buoyancy apparatus mounted on the UAV allowed vertical takeoff and landing on the water surface for in situ measurements. The sensor node that was integrated with the UAV consisted of a microcontroller unit, a temperature sensor, and a pressure sensor. The system measured water temperature and depth from seven pre-selected locations in a lake using autonomous navigation with autopilot control. Measurements at 100 ms intervals were made while the UAV was descending at 2 m/s until it landed on water surface. Water temperature maps of three consecutive depths at each location were created from the measurements. The average surface water temperature at 0.3 m was 22.5 degrees C, while the average water temperature at 4 m depth was 21.5 degrees C. The UAV-based profiling system developed successfully performed autonomous water temperature measurements within a lake.

AB In the global navigation satellite positioning denial environment, the matching localization based on a high-definition map is a well-recognized method to assist autonomous vehicles in achieving continuous, stable, and reliable navigation and positioning in complex scenes. However, due to the complexity, density, and richness of the typical high-definition point cloud map, there are high technical thresholds in the process of localization production, application, and maintenance. As a result, referring to the idea of traverse survey in geodesy, we design a priori lightweight point cloud feature map structure based on road mileage nodes as the main line to increase the flexibility of map segmentation, splicing, retrieval, and communication transmission. At the same time, an efficient and practical mini-matching positioning method is proposed. Finally, using the real datasets of various urban canyon scenes for verification, the proposed method can achieve stable sub-meter level localization.

AB Autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) are important tools for topography mapping and geological surveys, and bathymetric simultaneous localization and mapping (BSLAM) method holds high potential for accurate navigation in long endurance AUV missions. However, invalid loop closures caused by nearly flat seabed topography may cause BSLAM algorithm fail catastrophically. In this paper, a robust BSLAM algorithm is proposed, whose robustness is guaranteed by both a residual-based loop closure identification method and a robust filter algorithm. In residual-based loop closure identification, a Gini impurity based on probabilistic labels is proposed in the random forest (RF) method to classify invalid and valid loop closures; meanwhile, a posteriori state estimate function of the vehicle considering the stability of robust BSLAM algorithm is proposed to generate both stable and accurate navigational results in robust filter. The play-back experiments have shown that robust BSLAM algorithm can provide accurate and stable navigational results in real-time.

AB A standard control systems objective is to achieve stable motion on a trajectory in the state-control space configuration compatible with the system dynamics. Path following and trajectory tracking are typical methods to accomplish this goal. This work uses a version of the path following technique, called maneuvering, to drive a quadrotor to the desired path. In maneuvering, the desired path is a geometric curve parameterized in terms of the path-variable. The path-variable can be employed to fulfill an assignment of speed or acceleration on the path. To obtain experimental results using an indoor positioning system, a quadrotor velocity observer becomes necessary; thus, a velocity observer and a constant disturbance estimator, based on the immersion and invariance technique (Astolfi et al. 2008), are proposed to complement the maneuvering controller. Timescale separation between the quadrotor translational and rotational dynamics is instrumental in the closed-loop stability analysis.

AB This article first defines a class of estimation problem called simultaneous navigation and characterization (SNAC), which is a superset of simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM). A SNAC framework is then developed for the Autonomous Nanosatellite Swarming (ANS) mission concept to autonomously navigate about and characterize an asteroid including the asteroid gravity field, rotational motion, and 3-D shape. The ANS SNAC framework consists of three modules: 1) multiagent optical landmark tracking and 3-D point reconstruction using stereovision, 2) state estimation through a computationally efficient and robust unscented Kalman filter, and 3) reconstruction of an asteroid spherical harmonic shape model by leveraging a priori knowledge of the shape properties of celestial bodies. Despite significant interest in asteroids, there are several limitations to current asteroid rendezvous mission concepts. First, completed missions heavily rely on human oversight and Earth-based resources. Second, proposed solutions to increase autonomy make oversimplifying assumptions about state knowledge and information processing. Third, asteroid mission concepts often opt for high size, weight, power, and cost (SWaP-C) avionics for environmental measurements. Finally, such missions often utilize a single spacecraft, neglecting the benefits of distributed space systems. In contrast, ANS is composed of multiple autonomous nanosatellites equipped with low SWaP-C avionics. The ANS SNAC framework is validated through a numerical simulation of three spacecraft orbiting asteroid 433 Eros. The simulation results demonstrate that the proposed architecture provides autonomous and accurate SNAC in a safe manner without an a priori shape model and using only low SWaP-C avionics.

SO APPLIED OPTICS

DT Article
ID ENHANCEMENT
AB The solution to the problem of road environmental perception is one of the essential prerequisites to realizing the autonomous driving of intelligent vehicles, and road lane detection plays a crucial role in road environmental per-ception. However, road lane detection in complex road scenes is challenging due to poor illumination conditions, the occlusion of other objects, and the influence of unrelated road markings. It also hinders the commercial appli-cation of autonomous driving technology in various road scenes. In order to minimize the impact of illumination factors on road lane detection tasks, researchers use deep learning (DL) technology to enhance low-light images. In this study, road lane detection is regarded as an image segmentation problem, and road lane detection is studied based on the DL approach to meet the challenge of rapid environmental changes during driving. First, the Zero-DCE++ approach is used to enhance the video frame of the road scene under low-light conditions. Then, based on the bilateral segmentation network (BiSeNet) approach, the approach of associate self-attention with BiSeNet (ASA-BiSeNet) integrating two attention mechanisms is designed to improve the road lane detection ability. Finally, the ASA-BiSeNet approach is trained based on the self-made road lane dataset for the road lane detection task. At the same time, the approach based on the BiSeNet approach is compared with the ASA-BiSeNet approach. The experimental results show that the frames per second (FPS) of the ASA-BiSeNet approach is about 152.5 FPS, and its mean intersection over union is 71.39%, which can meet the requirements of real-time autonomous driving. & COPY; 2023 Optica Publishing Group

ID SERVICE NETWORK DESIGN
AB This study investigates the cost allocation of cooperative autonomous truck (AT) platooning among carriers. Motivated by the fuel consumption saving from truck platooning, carriers can collaborate for creating more platooning opportunities in an alliance. The formation of carrier alliance is associated with two key conditions: (i) efficiency: the total cost is allocated to each carrier without a budget deficit, and (ii) stability: all carriers find it beneficial to stay in the grand alliance and do not form sub-alliance. Since an alliance satisfying these two conditions may not always exist, we aim to find a cost allocation such that the violation of efficiency and stability conditions is minimized. We first propose a cooperative AT platooning problem for a trade-off between fuel consumption savings and schedule deviation cost. Then, we model the problem as a cooperative AT platooning game and formulate cost allocation models. The exact row-generation solution method is developed to computationally calculate the cost allocation. Extensive numerical experiments demonstrate the properties of proposed models and the effectiveness of solution methods. The results show that the developed row-generation solution method can solve the instances of up to 100 requests and 20 carriers within a twohour time limit, and the schedule deviation coefficients significantly impact the performance of optimal cost allocation.

AB The lack of ground-tracking resources has become a primary bottleneck for the Chinese BeiDou navigation satellite system. As crosslinks have been widely recognized as a promising augmentation for the autonomous navigation of the global navigation satellite system, this article studies a new decentralized data fusion method for orbit determination of crosslink-augmented satellite constellations. In the new solution, the system is modeled as a probabilistic graphical model, the dynamical Bayesian network, and a graphical method named junction tree is introduced to analyze the structure of the system. By dividing and arranging the predictions and estimations of junction tree in a proper sequence, a new decentralized solution with centralized equivalent precision is designed. As the solution requires satellites in the constellation cooperating with each other through communications and measurements, it is named junction-tree-based cooperative orbit determination. Simulation results indicate that junction-tree-based cooperative orbit determination has centralized equivalent precision and good robustness after satellite failures, whereas centralized solutions such as extended Kalman filter may suffer from processing center malfunctions. Junction-tree-based cooperative orbit determination could not only serve as an optional choice for global navigation satellite system autonomous navigation but also be used as a general scheme for decentralized data fusion in cooperative systems such as unmanned aerial vehicle formations and so on.

AB The paper presents a receding horizon planning and control strategy for quadrotor-type micro aerial vehicle (mav)s to navigate reactively and intercept a moving target in a cluttered unknown and dynamic environment. Leveraging a lightweight short-range sensor that generates a point-cloud within a relatively narrow and short field of view (fov), and an ssd-MobileNet based Deep neural network running on board the mav, the proposed motion planning and control strategy produces safe and dynamically feasible mav trajectories within the sensor fov, which the vehicle uses to autonomously navigate, pursue, and intercept its moving target. This task is completed without reliance on a global planner or prior information about the environment or the moving target. The effectiveness of the reported planner is demonstrated numerically and experimentally in cluttered indoor and outdoor environments featuring maximum speeds of up to 4.5-5 m/s.

AB The present work is focused on the development of a Virtual Environment as a test system for new advanced control algorithms for an Unmanned Aerial Vehicles. The virtualized environment allows us to visualize the behavior of the UAV by including the mathematical model of it. The mathematical structure of the kinematic and dynamic models is represented in a matrix form in order to be used in different control algorithms proposals. For the dynamic model, the constants are obtained experimentally, using a DJI Matrice 600 Pro UAV. All of this is conducted with the purpose of using the virtualized environment in educational processes in which, due to the excessive cost of the materials, it is not possible to acquire physical equipment; moreover, is it desired to avoid damaging them. Finally, the stability and robustness of the proposed controllers are determined to ensure analytically the compliance with the control criteria and its correct operation.

AB In recent decades, agricultural goods demand has grown exponentially due to the growth of the human population. Agricultural production demands new and simple techniques. Moreover, safe, efficient, and cost-effective methods are required for monitoring agriculture crops. This research aims to provide a simple image processing technique that detects and distinguishes the object (agricultural goods) in drone-based agrarian imagery. We used cotton crop images as experimental data in this research due to its different spectral characteristics according to drone camera sensors, minimum weather constraints, and flight schedule timing-related constraints. The proposed method used fuzzy reasoning-based tactics combined with RGB and HSV color spaces by manipulating image color pixel values and setting the upper/lower limits values of the colors for detection and distinguishing the agricultural objects such as white cotton bolls from the rest of the image.

AB Source location privacy (SLP) protection is an important means of security protection in wireless sensor networks (WSNs). With the development of underwater acoustic sensor networks (UASNs), security and privacy have attracted increasing attention. In this study, we incorporated SLP into UASNs as the basis for a novel stratification-based source location privacy (SSLP) scheme. In the SSLP scheme, SLP is protected through the cooperation of autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) in each network layer. Because fake source nodes and fake data streams are commonly used in WSNs, methods that have similar functions in UASNs are required. Hence, we incorporate a fake source node into the underwater cluster structure to add randomness to the underwater network. Furthermore, fake data streams have been included within the AUV data collection and transmission for each cluster. Simulation results confirm that the SSLP scheme offers improved security in comparison with existing underwater data transmission schemes.

AB The problem of intelligent flight support under complex operational conditions is studied, A 'chain reaction' mechanism of a flight accident is described. An affordable method of flight safety enhancement in advanced aircraft is suggested. This method employs the concept of a hybrid intelligent pilot model, which combines positive anthropomorphic and mathematical properties. A central component of this Al model is a comprehensive knowledge base in the form of fuzzy situational tree-network (FSTN) of flight. A conceptual framework and some algorithmic issues of the method are discussed. Examples of FSTN prototyping are demonstrated. Potential applications include an intelligent pilot-vehicle interface, automatic flight-envelope protection, autonomous (robotic) flight including multiple vehicle systems, resolution of conflicts in close free-flight air space, and others. This paper is addressed to specialists and managers in the sector of applied research into intelligent flight control and flight safety. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The vehicular crowdsensing, which benefits from edge computing devices (ECDs) distributedly selecting autonomous vehicles (AVs) to complete the sensing tasks and collecting the sensing results, represents a practical and promising solution to facilitate the autonomous vehicular networks (AVNs). With frequent data transaction and rewards distribution in the crowdsensing process, how to design an integrated scheme which guarantees the privacy of AVs and enables the ECDs to earn rewards securely while minimizing the task execution cost (TEC) therefore becomes a challenge. To this end, in this article, we develop a blockchain-based collaborative crowdsensing (BCC) scheme to support secure and efficient vehicular crowdsensing in AVNs. In the BCC, by considering the potential attacks in the crowdsensing process, we first develop a secure crowdsensing environment by designing a blockchain-based transaction architecture to deal with privacy and security issues. With the designed architecture, we then propose a coalition game with a transferable reward to motivate AVs to cooperatively execute the crowdsensing tasks by jointly considering the requirements of the tasks and the available sensing resources of AVs. After that, based on the merge and split rules, a coalition formation algorithm is designed to help each ECD select a group of AVs to form the optimal crowdsensing coalition (OCC) with the target of minimizing the TEC. Finally, we evaluate the TEC of the task and the rewards of the ECDs by comparing the proposed scheme with other schemes. The results show that our scheme can lead to a lower TEC for completing crowdsensing tasks and bring higher rewards to ECDs than the conventional schemes.

AB Autonomous maneuver decision making is the core of intelligent warfare, which has become the main research direction to enable unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) to independently generate control commands and complete air combat tasks according to environmental situation information. In this paper, an autonomous maneuver decision making method is proposed for air combat by two cooperative UAVs, which is showcased by using the typical olive formation strategy as a practical example. First, a UAV situation assessment model based on the relative situation is proposed, which uses the real-time target and UAV location information to assess the current situation or threat. Second, the continuous air combat state space is discretized into a 13 dimensional space for dimension reduction and quantitative description, and 15 typical action commands instead of a continuous control space are designed to reduce the difficulty of UAV training. Third, a reward function is designed based on the situation assessment which includes the real-time gain due to maneuver and the final combat winning/losing gain. Fourth, an improved training data sampling strategy is proposed, which samples the data in the experience pool based on priority to accelerate the training convergence. Fifth, a hybrid autonomous maneuver decision strategy for dual-UAV olive formation air combat is proposed which realizes the UAV capability of obstacle avoidance, formation and confrontation. Finally, the air combat task of dual-UAV olive formation is simulated and the results show that the proposed method can help the UAVs defeat the enemy effectively and outperforms the deep Q network (DQN) method without priority sampling in terms of the convergence speed.

AB Literature review Cystoscopy is the gold standard for initial macroscopic assessments of the human urinary bladder to rule out (or diagnose) bladder cancer (BCa). Despite having guidelines, cystoscopic findings are diverse and often challenging to classify. The extent of the false negatives and false positives in cystoscopic diagnosis is currently unknown. We suspect that there is a certain degree of under-diagnosis (like the failure to detect malignant tumours) and over-diagnosis (e.g. sending the patient for unnecessary transurethral resection of bladder tumors with anesthesia) that put the patient at risk. Conclusions XAI robot-assisted cystoscopes would help to overcome the risks/flaws of conventional cystoscopy. Cystoscopy is considered a less life-threatening starting point for automation than open surgical procedures. Semi-autonomous cystoscopy requires standards and cystoscopy is a good procedure to establish a model that can then be exported/copied to other procedures of endoscopy and surgery. Standards also define the automation levels-an issue for medical product law. These cystoscopy skills do not give full autonomy to the machine, and represent a surgical parallel to 'Autonomous Driving' (where a standard requires a human supervisor to remain in the 'vehicle'). Here in robotic cystoscopy, a human supervisor remains bedside in the 'operating room' as a 'human-in-the-loop' in order to safeguard patients. The urologists will be able to delegate personal- and time-consuming cystoscopy to a specialised nurse. The result of automated diagnostic cystoscopy is a short video (with pre-processed photos from the video), which are then reviewed by the urologists at a more convenient time.

AB The design of a state feedback and robust controller for regulating the tridimensional (3D) movement of autonomous underwater mobile crafts (AUMCs). The controller design is based on the application of Averaged Sub-Gradient Integral Sliding Mode Realisation (ASGISMR). The application of the ASGISMR yields the solution of the closed-loop extreme seeking control for a non-strictly convex functional depending on the tracking error between reference and 3D position of the AUMC. The design of reference trajectories was proposed to enforce the AUMC to follow a continued submersion and ellipsoidal detouring. The mechanical dynamical form of AUMC is well posed for applying the extended version of ASGISMR, considering that integral term represents an ASG associated to the euclidean norm of the tracking error. The time evolution of the functional over the controlled trajectories of the AUMC is compared with the corresponding functional enforced by a traditional state feedback controller with gravity effect compensation. The proposed controller exhibits better tracking and similar control magnitude than the considered reference state feedback realisation. These outcomes justify the potential contributions of the suggested ASGISMR to obtain the local minimisation of the evaluated functional, considering such controller as an extreme seeking realisation for the proposed AUMC.

AB A micro air vehicle (MAV) is a class of miniature unmanned aerial vehicles that has a size restriction and may be autonomous. Fixed-wing MAVs are very attractive for outdoor surveillance missions since they generally offer better payload and endurance capabilities than rotorcraft or flapping-wing vehicles of equal size. This research paper describes the methodology applying indicial function theory and artificial neural networks for identification of aerodynamic derivatives for fixed-wing MAV. The formulation herein proposed extends well- known aerodynamic theories, which are limited to thin aerofoils in incompressible flow, to strake wing planforms. Using results from dynamic water tunnel tests and indicial functions approach allowed to identify MAV aerodynamic derivatives. The experiments were conducted in a water tunnel in the course of dynamic tests of periodic oscillatory motion. The tests program range was set at high angles of attack and a wide scope of reduced frequencies of angular movements. Due to a built-in propeller, the model's structure test program was repeated for a turned-on propelled drive system. As a result of these studies, unsteady aerodynamics characteristics and aerodynamic derivatives of the micro-aircraft were identified as functions of state parameters. At the Warsaw University of Technology and the Air Force Institute of Technology, a "Bee" fixed wings micro aerial vehicle with an innovative strake-wing outline and a propeller placed in the wing gap was worked. This article is devoted to the problems of identification of aerodynamic derivatives of this micro-aircraft. The result of this research was the identification of the aerodynamic derivatives of the fixed wing MAV "Bee" as non-linear functions of the angle of attack, and reduced frequency. The identification was carried out using the indicial function approach.

AB DALBIT-1, a miniature-sized, fully integrated, Earth-based lander test bed was designed and developed for the vertical takeoff and vertical landing flight demonstration. Mission and design requirements and vehicle subsystems were selected to accommodate the vertical takeoff and vertical landing preliminary flight demonstration. Subsystems, including the propulsion system, structure, avionics, and ground control station, were designed, developed, and integrated as a system. The flight control system of DALBIT-1 was generated to enable the vehicle an autonomous flight and was validated using a computer simulation in a MATLAB/Simulink environment. Simulation results show that DALBIT-1 adequately follows the predetermined trajectory and softly lands on the surface. The developed test bed performed a series of static fire tests and water/propellant flow tests to enhance the predictability of the flight control system. Using the developed flight control system, finally, the preliminary flight demonstration was conducted and proved the capability of the test bed of performing a vertical liftoff, vertical landing flight.

AB Manufacturers of safety-critical systems must make the case that their product is sufficiently safe for public deployment. Much of this case often relies upon critical event outcomes from real-world testing, requiring manufacturers to be strategic about how they allocate testing resources in order to maximize their chances of demonstrating system safety. This paper frames the partially observable and the belief-dependent problem of test scheduling as a Markov decision process, which can be solved efficiently to yield closed-loop manufacturer testing policies. By solving for policies over a wide range of problem formulations, we are able to provide high-level guidance for manufacturers and regulators on issues relating to the testing of safety-critical systems. This guidance spans an array of topics, including circumstances under which manufacturers should continue testing despite observed incidents, when manufacturers should test aggressively, and when regulators should increase or reduce the real-world testing requirements for safety-critical systems.

ID VARIABLE-STRUCTURE CONTROL; UNDERWATER VEHICLES; STABILITY
AB This paper presents a discrete-time quasi-sliding mode controller of SIMO systems with parameter uncertainty and long sampling interval. The discrete quasi-sliding mode control system is designed to track the desired path on the basis of a Lyapunov function, and sufficient conditions of the switching gain are given to make the discrete system stable. Each component of the switching gain can be determined separately. The switching region is variable according to the product of the bounds of uncertainty and the amplitude of the trajectory. The controller is robust to the uncertainties, and the reaching condition of the control system is satisfied for any initial condition. This control law is a generalized form of the discrete quasi-sliding mode control and reduces the chattering problem considerably. Simulation results for motion control of an autonomous underwater vehicle which acquires position information with a discrete interval show the effectiveness of the proposed technique.

AB As a key use case of Industry 4.0 and the Smart City, the Internet of Vehicles (IoV) provides an efficient way for city managers to regulate the traffic flow, improve the commuting performance, reduce the transportation facility cost, alleviate the traffic jam, and so on. In fact, the significant development of Internet of Vehicles has boosted the emergence of a variety of Industry 4.0 applications, e.g., smart logistics, intelligent transforation, and autonomous driving. The prerequisite of deploying these applications is the design of efficient data dissemination schemes by which the interactive information could be effectively exchanged. However, in Internet of Vehicles, an efficient data scheme should adapt to the high node movement and frequent network changing. To achieve the objective, the ability to predict short-term traffic is crucial for making optimal policy in advance. In this article, we propose a novel data dissemination scheme by exploring short-term traffic prediction for Industry 4.0 applications enabled in Internet of Vehicles. First, we present a three-tier network architecture with the aim to simply network management and reduce communication overheads. To capture dynamic network changing, a deep learning network is employed by the controller in this architecture to predict short-term traffic with the availability of enormous traffic data. Based on the traffic prediction, each road segment can be assigned a weight through the built two-dimensional delay model, enabling the controller to make routing decisions in advance. With the global weight information, the controller leverages the ant colony optimization algorithm to find the optimal routing path with minimum delay. Extensive simulations are carried out to demonstrate the accuracy of the traffic prediction model and the superiority of the proposed data dissemination scheme for Industry 4.0 applications.

   Reinforcement learning (RL); Objective penalty function method
ID MODEL-PREDICTIVE CONTROL; OPTIMIZATION
AB Trajectory tracking is a key technology for controlling the autonomous vehicles effectively and stably to track the reference trajectory. How to handle the various constraints in trajectory tracking is very challenging. The recently proposed generalized exterior point method (GEP) shows high computational efficiency and closed-loop performance in solving the constrained trajectory tracking problem. However, the neural networks used in the GEP may suffer from the ill-conditioning issue during model training, which result in a slow or even non-converging training convergence process and the control output of the policy network being suboptimal or even severely constraint-violating. To effectively deal with the large-scale nonlinear state-wise constraints and avoid the ill-conditioning issue, we propose a model-based reinforcement learning (RL) method called the actor-critic objective penalty function method (ACOPFM) for trajectory tracking in autonomous driving. We adopt an integrated decision and control (IDC)-based planning and control scheme to transform the trajectory tracking problem into MPC-based nonlinear programming problems and embed the objective penalty function method into an actor-critic solution framework. The nonlinear programming problem is transformed into an unconstrained optimization problem and employed as a loss function for model updating of the policy network, and the ill-conditioning issue is avoided by alternately performing gradient descent and adaptively adjusting the penalty parameter. The convergence of ACOPFM is proved. The simulation results demonstrate that the ACOPFM converges to the optimal control strategy fast and steadily, and perform well under the multi-lane test scenario.

AB Maritime Autonomous Surface Ships (MASSs) will reshape the fast-evolving ecosystem for their attractive socio-economic benefits and potential to improve safety. However, their new systems and technology need thorough verifications to identify unintended components of risk. The interaction between MASS cyber-physical systems and the existing regulatory framework is currently unpredictable; AI-powered intelligent situation awareness and autonomous navigation algorithms must safely and efficiently adhere to the regulations which are only designed for human interpretation without MASSs consideration. This paper contributes to algorithmic regulations and particularly algorithmic COLREGs in real-world MASS applications. It focuses on codifying COLREGs into a machine-executable system applicable to MASSs. This fullest COLREGs evaluation is modelled in form of a fuzzy expert system based on ordinary seamanship practice. The full input space spans 21 features derived from maneuverability-dependent risk, AIS traffic data, vessel information, maps and nautical charts, water-depth, visibility, and sea conditions. The model assesses pairwise vessel encounters over the full time-window of a situation from entrance to exit. 42 fuzzy rules are designed in 6 criteria that represent COLREGs Rules 2-19 and model their logical connections, priorities, and relationships. This algorithmic COLREGs form satisfies the crucial needs in simulation, collision-avoidance, complexity monitoring, and compliance quantification in MASS applications. The fullest COLREGs evaluation model is verified on a large database of historical encounters using real data from multiple sources.

AB Underwater wireless sensor network (UWSN) is used to monitor the compactness of ocean surveillance, marine and harsh underwater environment. In this article, an efficient energy consumption and delay aware autonomous data gathering routing protocol (ADGRP) scheme based on deep learning (dl) mobile edge model (mem) and beetle antennae search algorithm (BASA) for UWSN is proposed to overcome above problems. ADGRP is used to gather more data from the underwater environment by the use of the autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV). DL-MEM is used to increase the network life time. Then the deep learning parameters are optimized by using BAS. The objective function is "to increase the efficiency and lifetime of network by decreasing the energy consumptions and delay." The simulation process is carried out in MATLAB site. The proposed ADGRP-DL-MEM-BASA provides lower energy consumption 20.83%, 34.66%, 18.03%, 20.92%, 22.34%, lower energy drop 7.85%, 23.94%, 17.93%, 21.93%, 31.94% is compared with the existing energy-efficient probabilistic depth-based routing (EEPDBR-UWSN), ordered contention MAC (OCMAC-UWSN), Q-learning based energy-efficient and void avoidance routing protocol for underwater acoustic sensor networks (QL-EEBDG-UWSN), energy-efficient depth-base opportunistic routing along Q-learning for underwater wireless sensor networks (EDORQ-UWSN), channel-aware reinforcement learning-based multipath adaptive routing for underwater wireless sensor networks (CARMA- EE-UWSN) respectively.

AB Collaborative robots represent an evolution in the field of swarm robotics that is pervasive in modern industrial undertakings from manufacturing to exploration. Though there has been much work on path planning for autonomous robots employing floor plans, energy-efficient navigation of autonomous robots in unknown environments is gaining traction. This work presents a novel methodology of low-overhead collaborative sensing, run-time mapping and localization, and navigation for robot swarms. The aim is to optimize energy consumption for the swarm as a whole rather than individual robots. An energy- and information-aware management algorithm is proposed to optimize the time and energy required for a swarm of autonomous robots to move from a launch area to the predefined destination. This is achieved by modifying the classical Partial Swarm SLAM technique, whereby sections of objects discovered by different members of the swarm are stitched together and broadcast to members of the swarm. Thus, a follower can find the shortest path to the destination while avoiding even far away obstacles in an efficient manner. The proposed algorithm reduces the energy consumption of the swarm as a whole due to the fact that the leading robots sense and discover respective optimal paths and share their discoveries with the followers. The simulation results show that the robots effectively re-optimized the previous solution while sharing necessary information within the swarm. Furthermore, the efficiency of the proposed scheme is shown via comparative results, i.e., reducing traveling distance by 13% for individual robots and up to 11% for the swarm as a whole in the performed experiments.

AB Current concept, development, and testing applications in production concerning Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS), Industry 4.0 (I40), and Internet of Things (IoT) are mainly addressing fully autonomous systems, fostered by an increase in available technologies regarding distributed decision-making, sensors, and actuators for robotics systems. This is applied also to production logistics settings with a multitude of transport tasks, e.g., between warehousing or material supply stations and production locations within larger production sites as for example in the automotive industry. In most cases, mixed environments where automated systems and humans collaborate (e.g., cobots) are not in the center of analysis and development endeavors although the worker's adoption and acceptance of new technologies are of crucial relevance. From an interdisciplinary research perspective, this constitutes an important research gap, as the future challenges for successful automated systems will rely mainly on human-computer interaction (HCI) in connection with an efficient collaboration between motivated workers, automated robotics, and transportation systems. We develop a HCI efficiency description in production logistics based on an interdisciplinary analysis consisting of three interdependent parts: (i) a production logistics literature review and process study, (ii) a computer science literature review and simulation study for an existing autonomous traffic control algorithm applicable to production logistics settings with the specific inclusion of human actors, and (iii) a work science analysis for automation settings referring to theoretical foundations and empirical findings regarding the management of workers in digital work settings. We conclude with practical implications and discuss avenues for future research and business applications.

AB Monocular 3D object detection, with the aim of predicting the geometric properties of on-road objects, is a promising research topic for the intelligent perception systems of autonomous driving. Most state-of-the-art methods follow a keypoint-based paradigm, where the keypoints of objects are predicted and employed as the basis for regressing the other geometric properties. In this work, a unified network named as FADNet is presented to address the task of monocular 3D object detection. In contrast to previous keypoint-based methods, we propose to divide the output modalities into different groups according to the estimation difficulty of object properties. Different groups are treated differently and sequentially associated by a convolutional Gated Recurrent Unit. Another contribution of this work is the strategy of depth hint augmentation. To provide characterized depth patterns as hints for depth estimation, a dedicated depth hint module is designed to generate row-wise features named as depth hints, which are explicitly supervised in a bin-wise manner. The contributions of this work are validated by conducting experiments and ablation study on the KITTI benchmark. Without utilizing depth priors, post optimization, or other refinement modules, our network performs competitively against state-of-the-art methods while maintaining a decent running speed.

AB The focus of this research is on the estimation of traffic density from data obtained from Connected and Autonomous Probes (CAPs). CAPs pose an advantage over expensive and invasive infrastructure such as loop detectors. CAPs maneuver their driving trajectories, sensing the presence of adjacent vehicles and distances to them by means of several electronic sensors, whose data can be used for more sophisticated traffic density estimation techniques. Traffic density has a highly nonlinear nature during on-congestion and queue-clearing conditions. Closed-mathematical forms of the traditional density estimation techniques are incapable of dealing with complex nonlinearities, which opens the door for data-driven approaches such as machine learning techniques. Deep learning algorithms excel in data-rich contexts, which recognize nonlinear and highly situation-dependent patterns. Our research is based on an LSTM (Long short-term memory) neural network for the nonlinearity associated with time dynamics of traffic flow. The proposed method is designed to learn the input-output relation of Edie's definition. At the same time, the method recognizes a temporally nonlinear pattern of traffic. We evaluate our algorithm by using a microscopic simulation program (PARAMICS) and demonstrate that our model accurately estimates traffic density in Free-flow, Transition, and Congested conditions.

AB By focusing on unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) communications in non-terrestrial networks (NTNs), this paper provides a guideline on the appropriate base station (BS) service provisioning scheme with considering the antenna tilt angle of BSs. Specifically, two service provisioning schemes are considered including the inclusive-service BS (IS-BS) scheme, which makes BSs serve both ground users (GUs) and aerial users (AUs) (i.e., UAVs) simultaneously, and the exclusive-service BS (ES-BS) scheme, which has BSs for GUs and BSs for AUs. By considering the antenna tilt angle-based channel gain, we derive the network outage probability for both IS-BS and ES-BS schemes and show the existence of the optimal tilt angle that minimizes the network outage probability after analyzing the conflict impact of the antenna tilt angle. We also analyze the impact of various network parameters, including the ratio of GUs to total users and densities of total and interfering BSs, on the network outage probability. Finally, we analytically and numerically show in which environments each service provisioning scheme can be superior to the other one.

AB In this study, we developed a low-cost, high-precision vehicle navigation system for deep urban multipath environments using time-differenced carrier phase (TDCP) measurements. Although many studies are being conducted to navigate autonomous vehicles using the global positioning system (GPS), it is difficult to obtain accurate navigation solutions due to multipath errors in urban environments. Low-cost GPS receivers that determine the solution based on pseudorange measurements are vulnerable to multipath errors. We used carrier phase measurements that are more robust for multipath errors. Without correction information from reference stations, the limited information of a low-cost, single-frequency receiver makes it difficult to quickly and accurately determine integer ambiguity of carrier phase measurements. We used TDCP measurements to eliminate the need to determine integer ambiguity that is time-invariant and we combined TDCP-based GPS with an inertial navigation system to overcome deep urban multipath environments. Furthermore, we considered a cycle slip algorithm for its accuracy and a multi-constellation navigation system for its availability. The results of dynamic field tests in a deep urban area indicated that it could achieve horizontal accuracy of at the submeter level.

AB In this paper, a serial distributed model predictive control (MPC) approach for connected automated vehicles (CAVS) is developed with local stability (disturbance dissipation over time) and multi-criteria string stability (disturbance attenuation through a vehicular string). Two string stability criteria are considered within the proposed MPC: (i) the l(infinity)-norm string stability criterion for attenuation of the maximum disturbance magnitude and (ii) l(2)-norm string stability criterion for attenuation of disturbance energy. The l(infinity)-norm string stability is achieved by formulating constraints within the MPC based on the future states of the leading CAV, and the l(2)-norm string stability is achieved by proper weight matrix tuning over a robust positive invariant set. For rigor, mathematical proofs for asymptotical local stability and multi-criteria string stability are provided. Simulation experiments verify that the distributed serial MPC proposed in this study is effective for disturbance attenuation and performs better than traditional MPC without stability guarantee.

AB Keeping a vehicle well-localized within a prebuilt-map is at the core of any autonomous vehicle navigation system. In this work, we show that both standard SIR sampling and rejection-based optimal sampling are suitable for efficient (10 to 20 ms) real-time pose tracking without feature detection that is using raw point clouds from a 3D LiDAR. Motivated by the large amount of information captured by these sensors, we perform a systematic statistical analysis of how many points are actually required to reach an optimal ratio between efficiency and positioning accuracy. Furthermore, initialization from adverse conditions, e.g., poor GPS signal in urban canyons, we also identify the optimal particle filter settings required to ensure convergence. Our findings include that a decimation factor between 100 and 200 on incoming point clouds provides a large savings in computational cost with a negligible loss in localization accuracy for a VLP-16 scanner. Furthermore, an initial density of similar to 2 particles/m s required to achieve 100% convergence success for large-scale (similar to 100,000 m ), outdoor global localization without any additional hint from GPS or magnetic field sensors. All implementations have been released as open-source software.

AB Precision application of pesticides based on tree canopy characteristics such as tree height is more environmentally friendly and healthier for humans. Offline prescription maps can be used to achieve precise pesticide application at low cost. To obtain a complete point cloud with detailed tree canopy information in orchards, a LiDAR-RTK fusion information acquisition system was developed on an all-terrain vehicle (ATV) with an autonomous driving system. The point cloud was transformed into a geographic coordinate system for registration, and the Random sample consensus (RANSAC) was used to segment it into ground and canopy. A 3D voxel prescription map with a unit size of 0.25 m was constructed from the tree canopy point cloud. The height of 20 trees was geometrically measured to evaluate the accuracy of the voxel prescription map. The results showed that the RMSE between tree height calculated from the LiDAR obtained point cloud and the actual measured tree height was 0.42 m, the relative RMSE (rRMSE) was 10.86%, and the mean of absolute percentage error (MAPE) was 8.16%. The developed LiDAR-RTK fusion acquisition system can generate 3D prescription maps that meet the requirements of precision pesticide application. The information acquisition system of developed LiDAR-RTK fusion could construct 3D prescription maps autonomously that match the application requirements in digital orchard management.

AB One of the most important parameters in navigating an Autonomous Underwater Vehicle (AUV) is velocity estimation. There are a variety of water velocity sensors that can measure the velocity of an AUV using different technologies. For example ultrasonic, electromagnetic, optical, paddlewheel and Doppler velocity sensors are used for measuring the water velocity. In this paper, the aim is to design and manufacturing an inexpensive water velocity sensor based on differential pressure that can measure the surge and sway velocity of an AUV using Bernoulli's law. In the present paper, in order to prove the claim of the proposed theory, the results of Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) related to a part of the body of an AUV are also presented. To evaluate the performance of the proposed sensor, a part of the body of an AUV was constructed and tested in the towing tank of the National Iranian Marine Laboratory (NIMALA). In order to check the accuracy of the proposed sensor, a velocity sensor is used as a reference sensor that is installed on the towing tank. Finally, the results show that in the speed range of 0.5-4.5 m/s, the accuracy of measuring the axial velocity is about 0.05 m/s (1% Full scale span (FSS)), and for speeds higher than 2 m/s, the accuracy of estimating the sideslip angle and sway velocity are respectively 0.2 and 0.015 m/s.

SO JOURNAL OF FIELD ROBOTICS

DT Article
ID COOPERATIVE LOCALIZATION; AUVS; EXPLORATION
AB This study proposes a navigation method of multiple autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) where low-cost AUVs (child AUVs) estimate their self-states including their position, yaw angle, and horizontal moving velocity accurately thanks to a single high-performance AUV (parent AUV) without any external support. Since the child AUVs have only simple navigational sensors, positioning performance is not enough. The parent AUV, on the other hand, can conduct accurate self-state estimation using high-grade navigational sensors without any external support. The parent AUV supports the child AUVs through all processes of deployment, surveying, recovery, and surfacing. This study focuses on the accurate positioning method for the phase of the surveying. The child AUVs have acoustic devices for positioning and communication or cameras; hence, they build a parent-centered wireless positioning and communication network and can also estimate their self-states as accurately as the parent AUV, thanks to the positioning relative to the parent AUV. Field experiments with AUVs were conducted in a deep sea (hydrothermal vent field) and a shallow area. We confirmed that long-range navigation could be achieved while keeping an accuracy that is 5-10 times greater than that achieved by the child AUV alone based on state estimation using sensor data from the experiments in postprocessing. The performance of the proposed system does not depend on the child AUV's performance. We also verified that the proposed method has a certain scalability and a high-level performance in terms of accuracy, efficiency, and cost by a comparison with other existing navigation methods.

ID PERFORMANCE
AB We propose an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) enabled integrated sensing, computing, and communication (U-ISCC) framework, where a treble-functional UAV performs local computation and also delivers its computational tasks to ground access points. Meanwhile, this UAV is employed to sense a target by using the unified beam waves. Our goal is to characterize the Pareto boundary between the computation capacity and the sensing beampattern gain, by which the fundamental trade-off of them is unveiled. To solve the challenging problem, we propose a joint optimization algorithm by applying the semidefinite programming method and the concave-convex procedure technique, which ensures the rank-1 constraint with a low complexity. Numerical results finally verify that the proposed algorithm explicitly depicts the performance region, and demonstrate that the UAV boosts the ability of sensing, computing, and communication to strike a balance by fully exploring its functions.

AB In this paper, a mobile manipulation system for automatized logistic applications is presented. The robotic system is specifically designed for depalletizing/palletizing tasks, namely is product extraction from homogeneous pallets and assembly of new heterogeneous pallets. The robotic system is mainly composed by an autonomous vehicle, a collaborative robotic arm and a lifting device, which is able to collect products from different pallet layers. The handling strategy is not based on lifting items, as in classical pick-and-place operations, but on dragging them aboard the mobile vehicle. As the payload weight is not supported by the arm, the overall robotic system is very light compared to the manipulated items, which is a paramount benefit for a mobile collaborative application. This paper presents the mechanical design, the hardware selection and the experimentation in a laboratory scenario, thus demonstrating the effectiveness of the proposed manipulation strategy.

SO JOURNAL OF ADVANCED TRANSPORTATION

DT Review
ID LOOK-AHEAD CONTROL; VEHICLE PLATOON; CONSUMPTION; EFFICIENT
AB A truck platoon is a set of virtually linked trucks that travel in tandem with small intervehicle distances. Several studies have proved that traveling in platoons can significantly improve fuel economy due to the reduced aerodynamic drag. However, most literature only provides scattered pieces of information regarding fuel economy in truck platoons. Therefore, a literature survey is needed to understand what has been studied and what problems remain to be further addressed. This paper presents an overview of existing studies to illustrate the state of the art about fuel savings for truck platooning. Specifically, it summarized the methodologies, the contributing factors of fuel consumption, the coordination methods to improve the platooning rate, and the look-ahead control strategies to generate fuel-efficient speed profiles for each vehicle driving in a platoon over different road grades. After that, the autonomous truck platooning was introduced, and we raised and discussed a couple of outstanding questions to be addressed in future work.

AB This paper presents a receding horizon optimal controller with guaranteed stability for multirobot formation, taking into account collision and obstacle avoidance. The proposed scheme is based on synchronous decentralized strategy wherein all the vehicles that are connected via a packed-delaying network solve a finite horizon-constrained optimal control problem to obtain their own control action at each sampling instant. First, each robot is modeled by a single integrator dynamics; then, by defining a control law for each robot and considering the effect of communication delay, the closed-loop dynamics is described as a delay differential equation with tunable parameters. Afterwards, a novel finite-horizon optimal control setup is established to obtain these adjustable gains such that a desirable formation is achieved. The efficiency and applicability of the suggested scheme are demonstrated by simulation results.

AB A connected autonomous vehicle (CAV) network can be defined as a set of connected vehicles including CAVs that operate on a specific spatial scope that may be a road network, corridor, or segment. The spatial scope constitutes an environment where traffic information is shared and instructions are issued for controlling the CAVs movements. Within such a spatial scope, high-level cooperation among CAVs fostered by joint planning and control of their movements can greatly enhance the safety and mobility performance of their operations. Unfortunately, the highly combinatory and volatile nature of CAV networks due to the dynamic number of agents (vehicles) and the fast-growing joint action space associated with multi-agent driving tasks pose difficultly in achieving cooperative control. The problem is NP-hard and cannot be efficiently resolved using rule-based control techniques. Also, there is a great deal of information in the literature regarding sensing technologies and control logic in CAV operations but relatively little information on the integration of information from collaborative sensing and connectivity sources. Therefore, we present a novel deep reinforcement learning-based algorithm that combines graphic convolution neural network with deep Q-network to form an innovative graphic convolution Q network that serves as the information fusion module and decision processor. In this study, the spatial scope we consider for the CAV network is a multi-lane road corridor. We demonstrate the proposed control algorithm using the application context of freeway lane-changing at the approaches to an exit ramp. For purposes of comparison, the proposed model is evaluated vis-a-vis traditional rule-based and long short-term memory-based fusion models. The results suggest that the proposed model is capable of aggregating information received from sensing and connectivity sources and prescribing efficient operative lane-change decisions for multiple CAVs, in a manner that enhances safety and mobility. That way, the operational intentions of individual CAVs can be fulfilled even in partially observed and highly dynamic mixed traffic streams. The paper presents experimental evidence to demonstrate that the proposed algorithm can significantly enhance CAV operations. The proposed algorithm can be deployed at roadside units or cloud platforms or other centralized control facilities.

AB With the increasing concerns about traffic congestion and climate change, much effort has been made to enhance sustainable urban mobility for passengers and goods. One emerging promising strategy is to transport passengers and goods in an integrated manner, as it could reduce the number of vehicles on the road compared with the separate transportation of passengers and goods. This study proposes the simultaneous transportation of passengers and goods using demand-responsive buses and drones. Compared with the prevalent strategies that rely only on ground vehicles to integrate passenger and parcel transportation, we propose the joint usage of ground vehicles and drones to transport passengers and deliver parcels. The ground vehicles for passenger and parcel delivery are on-demand buses, which combine the advantages of the flex-ibility of taxis and the large capacity of public transport modes. The drones automatically take off from and land on the on-demand buses' rooftops and are only for parcel delivery. A new opti-mization problem that designs the routes for both demand-responsive buses and drones is pro-posed and denoted as the passenger and parcel share-a-ride problem with drones (SARP-D). A mixed-integer nonlinear programming model is devised; the nonlinearity exists because drone launch/recovery can occur simultaneously with request servicing by a bus at the same node. To solve the model for large-scale instances, we develop an adaptive large neighborhood search metaheuristic. Numerical experiments are conducted to validate the correctness of the model and evaluate the efficiency of the metaheuristic. Moreover, sensitivity analyses are performed to explore the influences of the maximum number of intermediate stops during one passenger request service, the drone flight endurance, and the unit delay penalty on the total cost, which comprises the transportation and delay costs.

AB Cities' high traffic concentration, fast technological change, resource scarcity and growing environmental con-cerns accentuate competing tensions between stakeholders, transport modes and policies in the mobility sector. Tensions become even more salient in shared mobility - a complex yet relatively new phenomenon at the intersection between sharing economy and the transport sector - and raise numerous concerns for meeting sustainability objectives. The purpose of this paper is to identify conflicting demands associated with shared mobility by conducting a systematic literature review. Our results reveal several contradictions related to shared mobility and sustainability goals, and relations between those constantly evolving in a dynamic fashion. Thus, although shared mobility represents a step forward in achieving sustainability in theory, in practice, this task is only partially completed due to existing inherent contradictions. A paradox perspective on shared mobility, proposed in this paper, provides grounds for revisiting policy actions and finding workable solutions for practitioners.

AB In this paper, we propose a game theoretic framework for secure physical layer authentication (PLA) by applying the spatial correlations of received signal strength (RSS) in the air-to-ground channels between an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV), a legitimate transmitter, and a spoofer. Based on our hypothesis model, we first derive the false alarm rate and miss detection rate for the UAV receiver. We then formulate a zero-sum PLA game where the UAV receiver selects its RSS detection threshold while the spoofer selects its attack probability to maximize their respective utilities. We derive the Nash equilibrium (NE) and its existence condition for the proposed PLA game. Monte Carlo simulation results accurately verify our analytical expressions for the false alarm rate and miss detection rate. Numerical results highlight the complex interplay between the detection threshold, spoofing attack probability and UAV altitude in the derived NE.

AB The concept of cloud computing relies on central large datacentres with huge amounts of computational power. The rapidly growing Internet of Things with its vast amount of data showed that this architecture produces costly, inefficient and in some cases infeasible communication. Thus, fog computing, a new architecture with distributed computational power closer to the IoT devices was developed. So far, this decentralised fog-oriented architecture has only been used for performance and resource management improvements. We show how it could also be used for improving the users' privacy. For that purpose, we map privacy patterns to the IoT / fog computing / cloud computing architecture. Privacy patterns are software design patterns with the focus to translate privacy-by-design into practical advice. As a proof of concept, for each of the used privacy patterns we give an example from a smart vehicle scenario to illustrate how the patterns could improve the users' privacy.

In order to offer accurate and reliable control ability, with the X rudder's character taken into consideration, one anti-normalization method based on virtual rudders and one rudder allocation including double-rudder, triple-rudder and quadruple-rudder modes are designed. Besides that, one new control ability judgment combined with traditional method and resistance energy is offered to find out the best control method. The simulations with different kinds of controllers under instantaneous and random disturbance are performed. In one simulation, one comparison with a cross-rudder AUV transformed from the test X-rudder AUV is also made. The results show that all of the designed X-rudder AUV motion control methods can complete the mission and the quadruple-rudder allocation has the best control ability.

AB Efficient task offloading decision is a crucial technology in vehicular edge computing, which aims to fulfill the computational performance demands of complex vehicular tasks with respect to delay and energy consumption while minimizing network resource competition and consumption. Conventional distributed task offloading decisions rely solely on the local state of the vehicle, failing to optimize the utilization of the server's resources to its fullest potential. In addition, the mobility aspect of vehicles is often neglected in these decisions. In this paper, a cloud-edge-vehicle three-tier vehicular edge computing (VEC) system is proposed, where vehicles partially offload their computing tasks to edge or cloud servers while keeping the remaining tasks local to the vehicle terminals. Under the restrictions of vehicle mobility and discrete variables, task scheduling and task offloading proportion are jointly optimized with the objective of minimizing the total system cost. Considering the non-convexity, high-dimensional complex state and continuous action space requirements of the optimization problem, we propose a task offloading decision-making algorithm based on deep deterministic policy gradient (TODM_DDPG). TODM_DDPG algorithm adopts the actor-critic framework in which the actor network outputs floating point numbers to represent deterministic policy, while the critic network evaluates the action output by the actor network, and adjusts the network evaluation policy according to the rewards with the environment to maximize the long-term reward. To explore the algorithm performance, this conduct parameter setting experiments to correct the algorithm core hyper-parameters and select the optimal combination of parameters. In addition, in order to verify algorithm performance, we also carry out a series of comparative experiments with baseline algorithms. The results demonstrate that in terms of reducing system costs, the proposed algorithm outperforms the compared baseline algorithm, such as the deep Q network (DQN) and the actor-critic (AC), and the performance is improved by about 13% on average.

AB Connected automated vehicles have the capability to operate autonomously by monitoring realtime traffic information through on-board sensors, such as velocity and distance. However, no measurement can be perfect, and sensors are no exception, especially in challenging road and weather conditions, leading to the deviations between multiple information measured by vehicles and true information. Since the sizes of sensor detection errors are uncertain, we call this issue as multiple information uncertainties. This issue affects not only the normal operation of host vehicle directly but also the connected automated vehicular flow indirectly through wireless communication, resulting in the instability of car-following behavior and further deteriorating traffic congestion. So far, it is hard for us to obtain the repeatable, transferable, and even comparable results due to the lack of generic model. Therefore, this study develops a generalized model by using the uncertainty levels of multiple information to describe the dynamics of connected automated vehicles under the influence of sensor detection errors based on car-following theory. The theoretical and simulation-based investigations present a complete method to analyze the stability of traffic flow under multiple information uncertainties. Analytical results show that traffic stability will be reduced when the velocity measured by sensors is smaller than true velocity (i.e., negative uncertainty level of velocity information) or the headway monitored by sensors is bigger than real headway (i.e., positive uncertainty level of headway information), whereas the velocity and headway of equilibrium state will be enlarged. Otherwise, the opposite. These findings indicate that the impacts of multiple information uncertainties are double-edged swords, depending on the uncertainty levels of different information. To improve the adverse impacts of multiple information uncertainties on traffic stability, this study proposes a novel carfollowing controller and verifies its effectiveness. Overall, the present study provides a set of theoretical frameworks to investigate and improve traffic stability under multiple information uncertainties. All results contribute to enhancing the stability of traffic flow and further easing traffic congestion.

AB A recent study (Li, 2020) analytically predicted tradeoffs between automated vehicle (AV) following characteristics on safety, mobility, and stability using a parsimonious linear car following model. This work aimed to verify the key theoretical findings in the above study with empirical experiments using commercial AVs, e.g., vehicles with adaptive cruise control (ACC) functions. We collect high-resolution trajectory data of multiple commercial AVs following one another in a platoon with different headway settings. Parsimonious linear AV-following models that capture the first-order parameters on safety, mobility, and stability aspects are estimated with the data. The estimation results of the key parameters validate several theoretical predictions predicted by Li (2020). Specifically, it was found that as the time lag setting increases, the corresponding safety buffer decreases, indicating that AV safety could be improved with less pursuit of AV mobility or, conversely, AV mobility improvement may come at a cost of more stringent safety requirements. Also, as the time lag setting increases, AV string stability increases, indicating that stop-and-go traffic potentially could be dampened by compromising AV mobility. With this, one possible explanation to the observed string instability of commercial AV following control (i.e., ACC function) is that automakers may prefer to ensure a relatively short headway (and thus better user experience on vehicle mobility) at a cost of compromising string stability. It was also found that as the time lag increases, the cycle period of traffic oscillations gets longer, and the oscillation amplification gets smaller, which supports the tradeoff between mobility and stability. On the other hand, field experiments revealed issues beyond the predictivity of a simple linear model. That is, vehicle control sensitivity factors vary across different speed and headway settings, and the model estimation results for key parameters are not consistent over different speed ranges. This opens future research needs for investigating nonlinearity and stochasticity in the AV following modeling.

AB In this paper, in order to overcome certain limitations of previously commercialized platforms, a new integrated unmanned surface vehicle (USV) and unmanned underwater vehicle (UUV) platform connected via underwater cable capable of acquiring real-time underwater data and long-time operation are studied. A catamaran-type USV was designed to overcome the limitations of an ocean environment and to play the role as the hub of power supply and communication for the integrated platform. Meanwhile, the UUV was designed as torpedo-shaped to minimize hydrodynamic resistance and its hardware design was focused on processing and sending the underwater camera and sonar data. The underwater cable driven by a winch system was installed to supply power from the USV to the UUV and to transmit acquired data form underwater sonar sensor or camera. Different from other previously studied cooperation system of USVs and autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs), the merit of the proposed system is real-time motion coordination control between the USV and UUV while transmitting large amount of data using the tether cable. The main focus of the study is coordination of the UUV with respect to the global positioning system (GPS) attached at USV and verification of its performance throughout field tests. Waypoint tracking control algorithm was designed and implemented on USV and relative heading, distance control for USV-UUV coordination was implemented to UUV. To ensure the integrity of the coordination control of the integrated platform, a study on accurate measurement system of the relative position between the USV and the UUV by using the GPS and the ultrashort baseline (USBL) device was performed. Individual tests were conducted to verify the performance of USBL and AHRS, which provide the position and heading data of UUV among the sensors mounted on the actual platform, and the effectiveness of the obtained sensor data is presented. Using the accurate measurement system, a number of field tests were conducted to verify the performance of the integrated platform.

AB Advanced route planning algorithms are one of the key enabling technologies for emerging electric and autonomous mobility. Large realistic data sets are needed to test such algorithms under conditions that capture natural time-varying traffic patterns and corresponding travel-time and energy-use predictions. Further, the time-varying availability of charging infrastructure and vehicle-specific charging-power curves may be necessary to support advanced planning. While some data sets and synthetic data generators capture some of the aspects mentioned above, no integrated testbeds include all of them. We contribute with a modular testbed architecture. First, it includes a semi-synthetic data generator that uses a state-of-the-art traffic simulator, real traffic volume distribution patterns, EV-specific data, and elevation data. These elements support the generation of time-dependent travel-time and energy-use weights in a road-network graph. The generator ensures that the data satisfies the FIFO property, which is essential for time-dependent routing. Next, the testbed provides a thin layer of services that can serve as building blocks for future advanced routing algorithms. The experimental study demonstrates that the testbed can reproduce travel-time and energy-use patterns for long-distance trips similar to commercially available services.

AB This article is motivated by the lack of empirical data on the performance of commercially available Society of Automotive Engineers level one automated driving systems. To address this, a set of car following experiments are conducted to collect data from a 2015 luxury electric vehicle equipped with a commercial adaptive cruise control (ACC) system. Velocity, relative velocity, and spacing data collected during the experiments are used to calibrate an optimal velocity relative velocity car following model for both the minimum and maximum following settings. The string stability of both calibrated models is assessed, and it is determined that the best-fit models are string unstable, indicating they are not able to prevent all traffic disturbances from amplifying into phantom jams. Based on the calibrated models, we identify the consequences of the string unstable ACC system on synthetic and empirical lead vehicle disturbances, highlighting that commercial ACC platoons of moderate size can dampen some disturbances even while being string unstable. The primary contributions of this article are the development of a data-driven approach to calculate string stability of ACC systems, and the collection and interpretation of a dataset to understand the car following behavior of a commercial ACC system.

AB Understanding the trencher interaction through analyses on the design and mechanics is essential for autonomous and operations of underwater tracked vehicles (UTVs) with a ladder trencher (LT). The objective of this paper is to analyze the mechanics of the UTV system that are affected by LT force and moment. For this, the force and moment on the cutter bar based on the analysis of the mechanics of the individual cutting tool are determined. Also, the mathematical expression is derived for the force and moment of the combined system of the UTV and LT for trencher tool cutting of the soil. For this, the parameters that affect the mechanics of the combined system are studied. For applying the trencher system to underwater soil cutting, the hydrostatic effect of buoyancy force is also studied.
   For the design of the UTV system, the required tractive thrust or normal reaction force was analyzed, and the moment to the rotor carriage caused by the cutting system is studied. In addition, analysis on the energy and power for the cutter bar actuator related to the tool characteristics is performed.
   To support the validity of the analyses, a number of numerical simulations are performed using the derived equations.

We employed dashcam video footage to evaluate microsleep-related behaviors immediately prior to real-world truck collisions in pro-fessional drivers to explore a new solution to reduce collisions attributed to falling asleep at the wheel.Methods: In total, 3,120 s of video footage (60 s/case x 52 cases) from real-world truck collisions of 52 pro-fessional drivers obtained from interior and exterior dashcams were used and visually analyzed in a second-by -second manner to simultaneously evaluate any eye changes and microsleep-related behaviors (the driver's anti -sleepiness behavior, behavioral signs of microsleep, and abnormal vehicle behavior) during driving.Results: Assessment of the frequency of occurrence of each item of microsleep-related behavior in the 52 colli-sions revealed that the item "touching" in terms of anti-sleepiness behavior, "absence of body movement" in terms of behavioral signs of microsleep, and "inappropriate line crossing" in terms of abnormal vehicle behavior were observed at the highest rate in all drivers (46.2%, 75.0%, and 78.8%, respectively). Decreases in anti -sleepiness behavior coincided with increases in behavioral signs of microsleep and abnormal vehicle behavior, with collisions occurring within approximately 40 s of these changes. Collisions were more common among young people and in the early morning and evening.Conclusion: Our dashcam video footage-based analysis in truck collisions attributed to falling asleep at the wheel revealed the process of changes in microsleep-related driver and vehicle behaviors, classified as anti-sleepiness behavior, behavioral signs of microsleep, and abnormal vehicle behavior. Based on these findings, to prevent collisions caused by falling asleep at the wheel, it is crucial to monitor not only the driver's eyes, but also the driver's whole body and vehicle behavior simultaneously to reliably detect microsleep-related behaviors.

AB Camera-based object detection is widely used in safety-critical applications such as advanced driver assistance systems (ADAS) and autonomous vehicle research. Road infrastructure has been designed for human vision, so computer vision, with RGB cameras, is a vital source of semantic information from the environment. Sensors, such as LIDAR and RADAR, are also often utilized for these applications; however, cameras provide a higher spatial resolution and color information. The spatial frequency response (SFR), or sharpness of a camera, utilized in object detection systems must be sufficient to allow a detection algorithm to localize objects in the environment over its lifetime reliably. This study explores the relationship between object detection performance and SFR. Six state-of-the-art object detection models are evaluated with varying levels of lens defocus. A novel raw image dataset is created and utilized, containing pedestrians and cars over a range of distances up to 100-m from the sensor. Object detection performance for each defocused dataset is analyzed over a range of distances to determine the minimum SFR necessary in each case. Results show that the relationship between object detection performance and lens blur is much more complex than previous studies have found due to lens field curvature, chromatic aberration, and astigmatisms. We have found that smaller objects are disproportionately impacted by lens blur, and different object detection models have differing levels of robustness to lens blur.

AB The underwater wireless power transfer (UWPT) technology provides a feasible way to solve the problems of the traditional power supply method of the autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV). The magnetic coupler is the most essential component in the wireless power transfer system. Its configuration determines its applicable scenarios, and its parameter design and optimization will directly affect the system's overall output power and efficiency. In this article, an arc-shaped underwater wireless power transfer magnetic coupler is proposed, which is suitable for AUV's curved shell. Especially, the proposed novel magnetic coupler utilizes Fe-based nanocrystalline alloy soft magnetic material as the magnetic core. Both volume and weight of the receiver are reduced compared with the traditional Mn-Zn ferrite material. Fe-based nanocrystalline alloy material provides a novel design idea for the magnetic coupler on electrical equipment with special-shaped shell due to its flexibility. A prototype of the UWPT system for 320 mm diameter AUV is built, and it can transfer 3 kW power in the experiment with a dc-dc efficiency of 91.9% at the forward maximum output power point. Compared with the structure with ferrite core, the volume of the proposed structure is reduced by 41.1%, and the weight is reduced by 42.6%, so that the expected effect has been achieved.

AB Accurate and timely weather prediction is of significance for autonomous vehicles, such as designing more appropriate sensors or other configurations and developing safer driving strategies. Generally, as the mainstream weather prediction method, numerical weather prediction (NWP) relies on high-quality spatio-temporal observations. However, the precise state of the real world is not measurable. Thus, how to obtain a proper initial condition estimation based on big geospatial-temporal data is a crucial procedure for NWP. Data assimilation (DA) has been a traditional solution to the problem, for the better performance of which various mathematical-physics models have been used. However, the computational effectiveness and efficiency are still largely compromised by the complicated and nonparallel integration process in existing DA methods. In this paper, we propose a novel data-driven method named HDA-MLP to address the DA problem. We first constructed a customized MLP by introducing the temporal peculiarities of the state variables to simulate and optimize pure 3DVar and EnKF. Then we blended the optimized analysis fields directly by implicitly updating the background error covariance matrix through another neural network model to alleviate the dependence on traditional DA methods. We conducted extensive experiments to investigate the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposal by utilizing two classical nonlinear dynamic models. Results reveal that our approach has better robustness and enhanced capability to capture the variation of state variables. Notably, the analysis quality and computational efficiency are significantly improved. (C) 2020 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB This letter demonstrates the feasibility of a passive underwater acoustic marker technology (or "AcoustiCode") for use in underwater navigation. An AcoustiCode tag is a planar surface with machined periodic patterns capable of producing Bragg backscattering beampatterns with engineered spatial and frequency variations, thus having a unique three-dimensional acoustic signature over a selected frequency band. Hence, these AcoustiCodes enable three-dimensional navigation and information signaling in a totally passive manner for existing high-frequency SONAR systems (potentially mounted on autonomous underwater vehicles), which naturally operate in a narrow frequency band and can also be used over significantly longer ranges compared to optically-based systems.

AB Reinforcement learning (RL) is one of the emerging fields of artificial intelligence (AI) intended for designing agents that take actions in the physical environment. RL has many vital applications, including robotics and autonomous vehicles. The key characteristic of RL is its ability to learn from experience without requiring direct programming or supervision. To learn, an agent interacts with an environment by acting and observing the resulting states and rewards. In most practical applications, an environment is implemented as a virtual system due to cost, time, and safety concerns. Simultaneously, multibody system dynamics (MSD) is a framework for efficiently and systematically developing virtual systems of arbitrary complexity. MSD is commonly used to create virtual models of robots, vehicles, machinery, and humans. The features of RL and MSD make them perfect companions in building sophisticated, automated, and autonomous mechatronic systems. The research demonstrates the use of RL in controlling multibody systems. While AI methods are used to solve some of the most challenging tasks in engineering, their proper understanding and implementation are demanding. Therefore, we introduce and detail three commonly used RL algorithms to control the inverted N-pendulum on the cart. Single-, double-, and triple-pendulum configurations are investigated, showing the capability of RL methods to handle increasingly complex dynamical systems. We show 2D state space zones where the agent succeeds or fails the stabilization. Despite passing randomized tests during training, blind spots may occur where the agent's policy fails. Results confirm that RL is a versatile, although complex, control engineering approach.

   camera-radar; adverse weather; fog; attention module
AB AVs are affected by reduced maneuverability and performance due to the degradation of sensor performances in fog. Such degradation can cause significant object detection errors in AVs' safety-critical conditions. For instance, YOLOv5 performs well under favorable weather but is affected by mis-detections and false positives due to atmospheric scattering caused by fog particles. The existing deep object detection techniques often exhibit a high degree of accuracy. Their drawback is being sluggish in object detection in fog. Object detection methods with a fast detection speed have been obtained using deep learning at the expense of accuracy. The problem of the lack of balance between detection speed and accuracy in fog persists. This paper presents an improved YOLOv5-based multi-sensor fusion network that combines radar object detection with a camera image bounding box. We transformed radar detection by mapping the radar detections into a two-dimensional image coordinate and projected the resultant radar image onto the camera image. Using the attention mechanism, we emphasized and improved the important feature representation used for object detection while reducing high-level feature information loss. We trained and tested our multi-sensor fusion network on clear and multi-fog weather datasets obtained from the CARLA simulator. Our results show that the proposed method significantly enhances the detection of small and distant objects. Our small CR-YOLOnet model best strikes a balance between accuracy and speed, with an accuracy of 0.849 at 69 fps.

AB A double layer bio-inspired self-organizing map (DLBSOM) algorithm for multiple autonomous underwater vehicle (multi-AUV) dynamic task planning to search for multi-targets in the 3-D underwater environments affected by random ocean currents and dynamic uncertainty obstacles is proposed. Combined with a task urgency bio-inspired neural network (TUBNN) model that is applied to construct the neuron activity network to complete initial task assignment and path planning with the constraint of energy consumption. The decoupling of the task assignment and path planning in the initial task planning is solved through the corrected redistribution mechanism and end-to-end trajectory optimization method. The unknown obstacles information is fused with the diamond-shaped local neuronal network constructed by the diamond closed curve function. Through the function curve, the local neuronal network can be precisely adjusted according to AUV operation information and equipment performance to achieve the saving of computing resources and quick processing speed. Subsequently, the distance-speed comprehensive evaluation (DSCE) strategy is used to complete dynamic avoidance decision. By the General Bathymetric Chart of the Oceans (GBCO) and the Integrated Ocean Observing System (IOOS), the environment is generated to complete multiple sets of simulations that demonstrate the efficiency and adaptability of the DLBSOM algorithm in multi-AUV collaborative search.

ID BIOMETRIC AUTHENTICATION
AB Driverless taxis are now closer to their worldwide launch, however, unsupervised physical access to the riders can pose unexpected safety and security risks to the connected and autonomous vehicle's ecosystems. Thus, the need for human-to-machine authentication in driverless settings cannot be disregarded to maintain their smooth operations. In this paper, we propose a first rider authentication scheme, RiderAuth, using touch -signature behavioral biometrics to authenticate customers before they commence their ride in driverless settings. We also propose a template protection scheme for finite length touch-signature features using a random orthogonal projection method to address biometric template leakage. We design Android-based client and Cloud-based server prototypes to evaluate both the security and usability of our proposed scheme. We collect a new database of 1800 touch-signatures samples from 30 users in an unsupervised field experiment for two weeks. RiderAuth achieves a True Acceptance Rate (TAR) of 96.66% at False Acceptance Rate (FAR) of 0.01% without template protection and a TAR of 94.88% at FAR=0.01% with proposed template protection scheme. Subsequently, we implement a d-prime weighted score-level fusion to further enhance RiderAuth's accuracy. We evaluate the unlinkability and revocability of the proposed template protection scheme to verify its suitability for authenticating riders in a privacy preserved setting. In addition, we conduct a survey to evaluate user acceptance of our proposed scheme using the System Usability Scale (SUS) where we get a score of approximate to 70% suggesting a positive experience and acceptance of RiderAuth.

AB High end-to-end delay is a major challenge in autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV)-aided routing protocols for underwater monitoring applications. In this paper, a new routing protocol called atomic-shaped efficient delay and data gathering (ASEDG) has been introduced for underwater wireless sensor networks. The ASEDG is divided into two phases; in the first phase, the atomic-shaped trajectory model with horizontal and vertical ellipticals was designed for the movement of the AUV. In the second phase, two types of delay models were considered to make our protocol more delay efficient: member nodes (MNs) to MNs and MNs to gateway nodes (GNs). The MNs-to-MNs delay in the network specifies how long is required for the selection of the next possible forwarders by eliminating the chances of backtracking and a higher number of association links. The MNs-to-GNs delay is considered to choose the path from a multipath environment that takes a minimum amount of time for sending the packet from its generation to destination node. For efficient data gathering, this new trajectory model creates the maximum possible GNs for the association of the MNs. Furthermore, our protocol, ASEDG, has been evaluated by using the aquasim network simulator (NS-2), and its results were compared with the already existing protocol, an efficient data gathering (AEDG) routing protocol. The simulation results show that the ASEDG performed better than the AEDG in terms of end-to-end delay and throughput.

AB The use of a small autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) as a platform for making in situ flow measurements in the ocean environment is described. Two high-wavenumber shear probes and a dynamic Pitot tube, housed in a pressure vessel mounted on the nose of the AW, allow measurements, in the dissipation range, of all three components of velocity. Microstructure temperature and possible body vibrations are monitored using auxiliary local probes. A conductivity-temperature-depth package, an acoustic Doppler current profiler, and a Marsh-McBirney current meter on board allow measurement of mean background conditions. Gathered data are stored on an onboard computer The AUV can survey 7-11-km regions at a speed of 1.5-2 m s(-1), its motion bring uncoupled from that of any surface mother ship. The vehicle has relatively low: manufacture and operational costs and can potentially operate in stormy conditions. The small-scale measurements allow the determination of estimates of in situ energy dissipation rates. Turbulence measurements in shallow water off the east coast of Florida are described. Analysis shows that the gathered data are of high quality, the measured cross-stream shear spectra being in very good agreement with the Nasmyth spectrum. The agreement suggests that the custom-designed, self-noise isolation system that has been implemented is well engineered and has rendered the AUV platform's self-noise acceptably low for making turbulence measurements. Use of a small AUV for flow measurement promises to be an inexpensive, practical way of making a four-dimensional survey of significant regions of the ocean.

AB This letter studies a cellular-connected unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) scenario, in which a UAV user communicates with ground base stations (GBSs) in cellular uplink by sharing the spectrum with ground users (GUs). To deal with the severe air-to-ground (A2G) co-channel interference, we consider an adaptive interference cancellation (IC) approach, in which each GBS can decode the GU's messages by adaptively switching between the modes of IC (i.e., precanceling the UAV's resultant interference) and treating interference as noise (TIN). By designing the GBSs' decoding mode, jointly with the wireless resource allocation and the UAV's trajectory control, we maximize the UAV's data-rate throughput over a finite mission period, while ensuring the minimum data-rate requirements at individual GUs. We propose an efficient algorithm to solve the throughput maximization problem by using the techniques of alternating optimization and successive convex approximation (SCA). Numerical results show that our proposed design significantly improves the UAV's throughput as compared to the benchmark schemes without the adaptive IC and/or trajectory optimization.

AB Exact sideslip angle estimation is significant to the dynamics control of four-wheel independent drive electric vehicles. It is costly and difficult-to-popularize to equip vehicular sensors for real-time sideslip angle measurement; therefore, the reliable sideslip angle estimation method is investigated in this paper. The electric driving wheel model is proposed and applied to the longitudinal force estimation. Considering that electric driving wheel model is a nonlinear model with unknown input, an unknown input estimation method is proposed to facilitate the longitudinal force observer design, in which the adaptive high-order sliding mode observer is designed to achieve the state estimation, the analytic formula of longitudinal force is obtained by decoupling electric driving wheel model, and the longitudinal force estimator is designed by recurrence estimation method. With the designed virtual longitudinal force sensor, an adaptive attenuated Kalman filtering is proposed to estimate the vehicle running state, in which the time-varying attenuation factor is applied to weaken the past data to the current filter and the covariance of process noise and measurement noise can be adjusted adaptively. Finally, simulations and experiments are conducted and the effectiveness of proposed estimation method is validated.

AB Generally, in order to ensure the reliability of Navigation system, vehicles are usually equipped with two or more sets of inertial navigation systems (INSs). Fusion of navigation measurement information from different sets of INSs can improve the accuracy of autonomous navigation effectively. However, due to the existence of misalignment angles, the coordinate axes of different systems are usually not in coincidence with each other absolutely, which would lead to serious problems when integrating the attitudes information. Therefore, it is necessary to precisely calibrate and compensate the misalignment angles between different systems. In this paper, a dynamic calibration method of misalignment angles between two systems was proposed. This method uses the speed and attitude information of two sets of INSs during the movement of the vehicle as measurements to dynamically calibrate the misalignment angles of two systems without additional information sources or other external measuring equipment, such as turntable. A mathematical model of misalignment angles between two INSs was established. The simulation experiment and the INSs vehicle experiments were conducted to verify the effectiveness of the method. The results show that the calibration accuracy of misalignment angles between the two sets of systems can reach to 1 while using the proposed method.

AB The integration of plug-in electric vehicles (PEVs) to a power system leads to significant impacts on the electricity distribution infrastructure, and coping with the charging demand of high PEV penetration in an existing distribution network is an important concern. This paper provides a comprehensive study on using multiterminal low-voltage direct current (MT-LVDC) to connect multiple feeders or transformers, which can solve network constraints efficiently to improve the ability of the power supply for more PEV integration. This paper proposes an adaptive droop control for the MT-LVDC distribution system and presents a probabilistic evaluation method to analyze the PEV integration capacity. To illustrate the potential of using MT-LVDC to improve PEV integration in an existing distribution network, a case study is performed, and the results show that MT-LVDC based on the proposed adaptive droop control can share the charging power demand during steady-state and dynamic conditions between multiple feeders or transformers. The ability of MT-LVDC to improve the PEV integration capacity and cost can be evaluated effectively.

AB Automated vehicles have started to be integrated into the road transportation system and operate in a mixed traffic environment. To ensure a smooth and successful integration, it is vital to have a good understanding of the human factor challenges involved in the process, especially the issues related to other road users who will share roads with automated vehicles. The study focuses on conventional vehicle drivers' acceptance of and interaction with fully automated vehicles (FAV). An online survey with experimental scenarios showing an FAV's lane-changing intention was designed to test the interaction responses of participants. The survey also collected the partici-pants' demographic information (e.g., age, gender, driving experience), self-reported general driving behaviours (e.g., errors, lapses and violations), past benchmark behaviour in the same situation and their acceptance of FAVs. The study recruited 838 participants in total, comprising 465 participants from Australia (216 males vs. 249 females) and 373 participants from China (172 males vs. 201 females). Ordered probit models were developed to predict three types of behav-ioural responses of drivers in the lane-changing scenario, i.e., positive, disregardful and aggres-sive responses. The results showed that older drivers, females, and drivers who had less driving experience were more likely to adopt positive interactions with FAVs than their counterparts. Drivers who reported frequent risky driving behaviours (e.g., aggressions, lapses and errors) were less likely to report positive interaction but more likely to report disregardful and aggressive interactions. Drivers reporting more positive/favourable attitudes and a higher trust toward FAVs demonstrated a higher possibility of positive interaction, and those with higher perceived behaviour control were more likely to restrain disregardful interaction. The study helps to form a greater understanding of conventional vehicle drivers' perception of FAVs and the underlying factors that may influence their interaction behavioural tendency.

AB For single target tracking (STT), when the target detection status is unknown, meaning the system lacks direct knowledge of whether or not the target has been detected, the system state follows a Gaussian mixture distribution. The number of Gaussians grows exponentially over time, making it challenging to theoretically determine the stability of STT. The main contribution of this article is that we address the problem of theoretically determining the stability of STT. Specifically, we first design an improved generalized pseudo-Bayesian (IGPB) filter by introducing a novel $\epsilon$-similarity-based pruning mechanism to manage the exponentially growing data association hypotheses. Unlike other STT filters, whose stability is theoretically difficult to determine, the stability of the IGPB filter is rigorously proven, and sufficient conditions for the filter's stability are established: 1) for a stable system, the IGPB filter remains stable irrespective of the detection rate; 2) for an unstable system, the filter is stable when the detection rate exceeds a threshold value. Numerical and experimental results are presented to validate the efficacy and application potential of the IGPB filter in tracking unmanned aerial vehicles.

AB Flying Ad-Hoc Network (FANET) is a set of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) inter-connected wirelessly. FANETs self-organize and provide low-cost, adaptable, and simple-to-implement flying nodes, enabling them to complete complicated tasks more quickly and collectively. The high mobility of nodes and the highly dynamic topology pose challenges to communication design, particularly when creating a routing protocol for UAV networks; this has inspired researchers to contribute and develop this technology. Hierarchical routing technique known as clustering is necessary to offer scalability, survivability, and distribute payload among UAVs to maintain the performance. This study has proposed a comprehensive survey of the cluster-based routing protocols (CBRPs) in terms of their strengths, weaknesses, specific applications, method, number of nodes, and future improvements for serving FANETs. Moreover, 21 CBRPs based FANETs were reviewed in terms of their topology, challenges, scalability, characteristics, clustering strategy, outstanding features, cluster head (CH) selection, routing metrics, and performance measures. In addition, open issues that need to be addressed in future studies in the field of routing protocols for UAV networks were also debated.

AB The applications of information technology (IT) tools and techniques have, over the years, simplified complex problem solving procedures. But the power of automation is inhibited by the technicality in manning advanced equipment. To this end, tools deliberately combating this inhibition and advancing technological growth are the Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs). UAVs are rapidly taking over major industries such as logistics, security, and cinematography. Among others, this is a very efficient way of carrying out missions unconventional to humans. An application area of this technology is the local film industry which is not producing quality movies primarily due to the lack of technical know-how in utilizing these systems. This study therefore aim to devise an autonomous object tracking UAV system that would eliminate the complex procedure involved in stabilizing an aerial camera (aerial bot) midair and promote the creation of quality aerial video shooting. The study adopted Unified Modeling Language (UML) tools in modeling the system's functionality. The traditional Server-Client model architecture was adopted. The OpenCV library employed proved highly efficient in aiding the tracking procedure. The system provided a usable web controller which provides easy interaction between the pilot and the drone. Conclusively, investments in UAVs would enhance creation of quality graphic contents.

AB Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) have been considered as a promising approach for providing additional computation capability and extensive coverage to ground mobile devices (MDs), especially in the scenario where the communication infrastructure is unavailable. This article investigates a UAV-assisted multiaccess edge computing system, where a number of ground MDs are served by a flying UAV and a ground base station, both of them are equipped with computation resources. The system aims to minimize the weighted cost of time latency and energy consumption, subject to the constraints on offloading decisions and resource competition. Since this problem is NP-hard, and the MDs are autonomous, we propose a game theory-based scheme to find the optimal solution and prove the existence of the Nash equilibrium. Meanwhile, we propose another two schemes as the benchmark to evaluate the efficiency and effectiveness of the game-theoretic solution. The simulation results show that the game-theoretic scheme is able to achieve a near-optimal performance, and the convergence time is also stable when the number of MDs increases.

AB Connected and autonomous vehicles (CAVs) are an innovative form of traditional vehicles. Automotive Ethernet replaces the controller area network and FlexRay to support the large throughput required by high-definition applications. As CAVs have numerous functions, they exhibit a large attack surface and an increased vulnerability to attacks. However, no previous studies have focused on intrusion detection in automotive Ethernet-based networks. In this paper, we present an intrusion detection method for detecting audio-video transport protocol (AVTP) stream injection attacks in automotive Ethernet-based networks. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first such method developed for automotive Ethernet. The proposed intrusion detection model is based on feature generation and a convolutional neural network (CNN). To evaluate our intrusion detection system, we built a physical BroadR-Reach-based testbed and captured real AVTP packets. The experimental results show that the model exhibits outstanding performance: the F1-score and recall are greater than 0.9704 and 0.9949, respectively. In terms of the inference time per input and the generation intervals of AVTP traffic, our CNN model can readily be employed for real-time detection. (C) 2021 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Recently, vehicular networks have emerged to facilitate intelligent transportation systems (ITS). They enable vehicles to communicate with each other in order to provide various services such as traffic safety, autonomous driving, and entertainments. The vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) communication channel is doubly selective, where the channel changes within the transmission bandwidth and the frame duration. This necessitates robust algorithms to provide reliable V2V communications. In this paper, we propose a scheme that provides joint adaptive modulation, coding and payload length selection (AMCPLS) for V2V communications. Our AMCPLS scheme selects both the modulation and coding scheme (MCS) and the payload length of transmission frames for V2V communication links, according to the V2V channel condition. Our aim is to achieve both reliability and spectrum efficiency. Our proposed AMCPLS scheme improves the V2V effective throughput performance while satisfying a predefined frame error rate (FER). Furthermore, we present a deep learning approach that exploits deep convolutional neural networks (DCNN) for implementing the proposed AMCPLS. Simulation results reveal that the proposed DCNN-based AMCPLS approach outperforms other competing machine learning algorithms such as k-nearest neighbors (k-NN) and support vector machines (SVM) in terms of FER, effective throughput, and prediction time.

AB The allocation of sensors is a significant problem in surveillance, search, and tracking, with applications ranging from sea to space. The widespread development of unmanned systems provides new opportunities for these platforms to serve as intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance (ISR) assets, pulling information from the battlefield into the global information grid. This paper incorporates ideas from automatic control, stochastic processes, and optimization to solve a sensor coverage problem. The solution methods developed might be used to give unmanned air vehicles the capability to 'make autonomous path planning decisions, or to help a mission planner determine the number of target areas that could be covered by a single ISR asset.

AB Connected and automated vehicles (CAVs) have the potential to improve the operation of future road traffic systems. In this paper, we propose a control method that uses CAVs as dynamic actuators to improve the capacity at motorway bottlenecks robustly. The proposed approach has been designed for mixed traffic flow using the fundamental diagram model of mixed traffic flow as a control activation tool. In order to implement our approach, we assume that the availability of detectors at motorway are able to obtain the density in real-time. The idea is that assuming a certain percentage of CAVs presence on the road, such vehicles can be used as mobile actuators to perform speed coordination tasks. Furthermore, the aim is to transfer the delays observed at the bottlenecks upstream on the motorway, where the conditions are more homogeneous. The proposed approached can be generalized and used in bottleneck scenarios with or without additional inflow from an on-ramp. According to the designed control strategy, when the traffic density at the bottleneck satisfies the activation condition, the CAVs will shift to moving actuator mode and generate a new speed profile. The objective is to improve traffic flow at the downstream bottleneck and also smooth the upstream arrival vehicle speed, thus improving the overall throughput of the network. The method has been evaluated through microscopic simulation experiments conducted with scenarios on the real-case study, a motorway in Antwerp, Belgium. The results show significant improvements in reducing traffic density and improving travel speed both locally at the control area, as well as at network level. Comparative experiments under different penetration rates show that the proposed method remains robust to the percentage of CAVs on the road. Finally, it can significantly reduce vehicle delays and prevent over-congested conditions, and also improve the traffic flow rate, even for relatively low penetration rates of CAVs.

AB This letter reports an experimental evaluation of a three-axis magnetometer into an inertial navigation system (INS) for underwater localization. The magnetometer measurements of geomagnetic field are compared with map values to provide position updates to the INS. The concept of such navigation system is not new but lacks test verification and actual application. We examine the capabilities of the integrated navigation by using a localization algorithm based on the interval knowledge of geomagnetic field values. The underwater experimental result indicates that the use of geomagnetic values significantly reduces the growth of position errors of an INS. (C) 2013 AIP Publishing LLC.

A simple relative positioning approach based only on one infrared emitter, receiver and compass is presented. Using this method, we characterized the accuracy of positioning between robots and identified sources of imprecision. Finally, this module is clearly demonstrated with the autonomous docking of multiple micro robots.

ID VISION; CAMERA
AB The vehicle detection algorithm based on visual perception has been applied in all types of automatic driving scenes. However, there are still flaws in the current detection algorithm model, especially for small objects. The detection effect of vehicle objects with small pixels in the image is often missed and wrongly detected. This research proposes an improved feature fusion module based on double-channel residual pyramid (DRP) structure for autonomous detection algorithm which named binary residual feature pyramid network (BiResFPN) to solve the above problems. Firstly, a DRP structure, which can effectively supplement the shallow information of the network, is proposed. The residual structure is added to the output feature map for further supplement. Then, an average sampling method of positive and negative samples based on intersection-over-union (IOU) value is proposed on the basis of this structure, aimed at the unbalanced sampling of positive and negative samples in the training stage of faster regions with CNN features (RCNN). It leads to the reduction of the interference of a large number of simple negative samples, which makes the learned model better. The experimental results based on the KITTI and BDD100K dataset datasets show that the capability of the feature fusion module based on DRP structure is strong for small object detection. Compared with Faster-RCNN (FPN), the detection algorithm of small object detection accuracy AP(small) was increased by 2.6%, AP(medium) and AP(large) was increased by 1.1% and 0.3%.

ID HURRICANE EVACUATION; ADOPTION; CARLESS; MODELS; POLICY
AB The potential use of privately-owned autonomous vehicles (AVs) for the evacuation of carless households threatened by hurricanes is underexplored. Based on 518 original survey responses from South Carolina (SC) residents, an ordered logistic model was developed to determine the willingness of individuals to temporarily share their AVs for evacuation without their presence. The model results indicated that respondents who (a) were unemployed, (b) had experience giving disaster relief assistance, (c) took regular religious trips and were more comfortable with AVs (d) delivering packages and (e) being purchased and shared for income in the next five years were more willing to share for evacuation. Respondents who (a) were aged 65 or older, (b) had income below $15,000 per year, and (c) had less than two social media accounts were less willing to share. The model was applied to a state-wide synthetic population to simulate a disaster scenario in SC under different AV market penetration (p) scenarios to determine the potential use of AVs for evacuation assistance. Monte Carlo simulation results indicated that the percentage of households that can be evacuated increased linearly with respect to p, by 5.5% for every 1% increase in p until p was nearly 20%. When p was 30% or higher, the number of shared AVs was sufficient to evacuate all households in need. Therefore, in SC, if privately-owned AVs are widely available, they could serve as a viable alternative or be used to supplement the traditional evacuation programs that rely on buses.

AB Freshwater ecosystems are endangered, underfunded and understudied, making new methods such as passive acoustic monitoring (PAM) essential for improving the efficiency and effectiveness of data collection. However, many challenges are still to be addressed with PAM: difficulty in accessing research sites, the logistics of implementing large-scale studies and the invasiveness of data collection. When combined with PAM and other sensing strategies, mobile robotics are a promising solution to directly address these challenges. In this paper, we integrate water surface and underwater acoustic monitoring equipment onto a prototype unmanned aerial-aquatic vehicle (UAAV) capable of sailing and flight (SailMAV). Twelve autonomous sailing missions were run on Lake Vrana, Croatia, during which acoustic data were collected, and the ability of the UAAV to facilitate the collection of acoustic data demonstrated. Data were simultaneously collected using standard recording methods on buoys and banksides to provide a comparative approach. Acoustic indices were used to analyse the soundscape of underwater acoustic data and BirdNET (a deep artificial neural network) was used on water surface datasets to determine bird species composition. Results show higher species richness and call abundance from UAAV surveys and high site dissimilarity owing to turnover between stationary and UAAV methods. This highlights the success of the UAAV in detecting biodiversity and the complementarity of these methods in providing a broad picture of the biodiversity of freshwater ecosystems. Increased bird diversity and underwater acoustic activity in protected areas demonstrate the benefits of protecting freshwater ecosystems; however, site dissimilarity driven by turnover highlights the importance of protecting the entire ecosystem. We show how, by integrating PAM and a UAAV, we can overcome some of the current challenges in freshwater biodiversity monitoring, improving accessibility, increasing spatial scale and coverage, and reducing invasiveness.

AB Ensuring the structural integrity of civil infrastructures is critical, given the potential hazards presented by cracks. Traditional manual inspections, though common, often face challenges related to accuracy, accessibility, safety, and cost-effectiveness. To address these issues, this study presents a new approach that integrates un-manned aerial vehicles (UAVs) with advanced computer vision techniques. A key feature of our approach is a system where a self-operating UAV is paired with a carefully crafted deep-learning design. This design takes advantage of both the Fast Region-based Convolutional Neural Network (FRCNN) and Residual Network (ResNet) models, allowing for real-time and accurate crack detection from ongoing video feeds. For uninter-rupted real-time processing, our UAV is equipped with a data transmission module, sending live video to a computational platform enhanced with our advanced crack-spotting tool. After thorough training using a diverse dataset of 1000 images, our FRCNN-ResNet model was compared to other top models, achieving a precision rate of 93.3% and a quick 59.7ms inference time. Overall, this study offers a notable improvement in how we monitor civil structures, focusing on better safety and cost savings.

AB Due to the considerable number of deaths and vehicle accidents caused by a driver's inattention, as reported by WHO, automobile manufacturers are aiming to combine advanced driver assistance systems (ADAS) with artificial intelligence algorithms, particularly deep learning and computer vision techniques. One feature that assists drivers is traffic sign recognition, which is a technique that allows vehicles to detect and recognize road signs placed on the road. This can be achieved by the aid of computer vision and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN). The main aim of this research is to propose and improve a CNN based-model that can be efficiently and accurately applied for embedded applications, this might be accomplished with the help of several preprocessing algorithms. An improved network model called LeNet-5 has been developed for the classification of traffic signs. Furthermore, the proposed model network is trained using both German Traffic Sign Recognition Benchmark (GTSRB) and extended GTSRB (EGTSRB) datasets. According to the test results, the improved LeNet-5 architecture obtained an accuracy of 99.12% on GTSRB and 99.78% on EGTSRB datasets respectively, which has a positive performance compared to other state-of-the-art papers in terms of accuracy.

AB Quadcopter unmanned aerial vehicles have become increasingly popular for various real-world applications, and a significant body of literature exists regarding the improvement of their flight capabilities to render them fully autonomous. The precise landing onto moving platforms, such as ship decks, is one of the remaining challenges that is largely unresolved. The reason why this operation poses a considerable challenge is because landing performance is considerably degraded by the ground effect or external disturbances. In this paper, we propose a synthesized landing algorithm that allows a quadcopter to land precisely on a vertically moving pad. Firstly, we introduce a disturbance observer-based altitude controller that allows the vehicle to perform robust altitude flight in the presence of external disturbances and the ground effect, strictly proving the system's stability using Lyapunov's theory. Secondly, we derive an apron state estimator to provide information on the landing target's relative position. Additionally, we propose a landing planner to ensure that the landing task is completed in a safe and reliable manner. Finally, the proposed algorithms are implemented in an actual quadcopter, and we demonstrate the effectiveness and applicability of our method through real flight experiments.

ID OPERATION
AB To ensure the autonomous power supply in microgrids (MGs) in stand-alone mode while also maintaining stability, energy storage systems (ESSs) and demand-side flexibility can be utilized together. Motivated by this fact, in this study, a scenario-based energy management system (EMS) modelled as a mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) problem is presented by taking the stochastic nature of wind and photovoltaic (PV) sources into account in order to analyze the operational behaviour of MGs and thereby to reduce the network energy losses. Direct load control (DLC) based demand response (DR) program is implemented to the system with the objective of exploiting the remarkable potential of thermostatically controllable appliances (TCAs) for energy reduction while satisfying comfort and operational constraints. Furthermore, a common ESS with a bi-directional power flow facility is incorporated in the proposed structure and electric vehicles (EVs) are employed as an additional flexible load in grid-to-vehicle (G2V) mode. To testify the effectiveness of the proposed optimization algorithm, different case studies are conducted considering diverse scenarios. Moreover, the performance is compared with a deterministic method from the perspective of achieving loss reduction and capturing the uncertainties.

AB Optimal path planning for three or more unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) in radio source localization has been studied extensively; but path planning for two UAVs in signal strength based localization is still a challenge. This paper investigates the autonomous path planning for a pair of UAVs equipped with received signal strength (RSS) sensors applying optimum experimental design criteria based on the fisher information matrix (FIM). The control strategy steers the UAVs along the paths that minimize the emitter location uncertainty. Since there is one differential received signal strength (DRSS) measurement (two RSS sensors) in each time step, the emitter location uncertainty is infinite for a single measurement and the FIM is singular. The FIM is approximated at successive waypoints using the estimated location of the emitter produced by the extended kalman filter (EKF). The objective of this paper is to propose path planning approaches for minimum number of UAVs in DRSS-based localization based on different optimum criteria including D-, E-, A-optimality and sensitivity. Each criterion is related to a different characteristic of the estimation uncertainty ellipsoid and consequently generates different trajectories. The proposed steering algorithms are evaluated through extensive simulations.

AB Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), which are commonly known as drones, have proved to be useful not only on the battlefields where manned flight is considered too risky or difficult, but also in everyday life purposes such as surveillance, monitoring, rescue, unmanned cargo, aerial video, and photography. More advanced drones make use of global positioning system (GPS) receivers during the navigation and control loop which allows for smart GPS features of drone navigation. However, there are problems if the drones operate in heterogeneous areas with no GPS signal, so it is important to perform research into the development of UAVs with autonomous navigation and landing guidance using computer vision. In this research, we determined how to safely land a drone in the absence of GPS signals using our remote maker-based tracking algorithm based on the visible light camera sensor. The proposed method uses a unique marker designed as a tracking target during landing procedures. Experimental results show that our method significantly outperforms state-of-the-art object trackers in terms of both accuracy and processing time, and we perform test on an embedded system in various environments.

AB With the increasing use of automated vehicles (AVs) in the coming decades, government authorities and private companies must leverage their potential disruption to benefit society. Few studies have considered the impact of AVs towards mode shift by considering a range of factors at the city level, especially in Australia. To address this knowledge gap, we developed a system dynamic (SD)-based model to explore the mode shift between conventional vehicles (CVs), AVs, and public transport (PT) by systematically considering a range of factors, such as road network, vehicle cost, public transport supply, and congestion level. By using Melbourne's Transport Network as a case study, the model simulates the mode shift among AVs, CVs, and PT modes in the transportation system over 50 years, starting from 2018, with the adoption of AVs beginning in 2025. Inputs such as current traffic, road capacity, public perception, and technological advancement of AVs are used to assess the effects of different policy options on the transport systems. The data source used is from the Victorian Integrated Transport Model (VITM), provided by the Department of Transport and Planning, Melbourne, Australia, data from the existing literature, and authors' assumptions. To our best knowledge, this is the first time using an SD model to investigate the impacts of AVs on mode shift in the Australian context. The findings suggest that AVs will gradually replace CVs as another primary mode of transportation. However, PT will still play a significant role in the transportation system, accounting for 50% of total trips by person after 2058. Cost is the most critical factor affecting AV adoption rates, followed by road network capacity and awareness programs. This study also identifies the need for future research to investigate the induced demand for travel due to the adoption of AVs and the application of equilibrium constraints to the traffic assignment model to increase model accuracy. These findings can be helpful for policymakers and stakeholders to make informed decisions regarding AV adoption policies and strategies.

AB As the population is ageing, the number of older adults with cognitive impairment (CI) is increasing. Automated vehicles (AVs) can improve independence and enhance the mobility of these individuals. This study aimed to: (1) understand the perception of older adults (with and without CI) and stakeholders providing services and supports regarding care and transportation about AVs, and (2) suggest potential solutions to improve the perception of AVs for older adults with mild or moderate CI. A survey was conducted with 435 older adults with and without CI and 188 stakeholders (e.g. caregivers). The results were analysed using partial least square - structural equation modelling and multiple correspondence analysis. The findings suggested relationships between older adults' level of cognitive impairment, mobility, knowledge of AVs, and perception of AVs. The results provided recommendations to improve older adults' perception of AVs including education and adaptive driving simulation-based training.Practitioner summary: This study investigated the perception of older adults and other stakeholders regarding AVs. The findings suggested relationships between older adults' level of cognitive impairment, mobility, knowledge of AVs, and perception of AVs. The results provided guidelines to improve older adults' perception of AVs.

AB This article investigates the trajectory tracking control of fully actuated unmanned surface vehicles (USVs) in the presence of lumped system uncertainty and input saturation. To address this problem, an output feedback scheme, which combines the saturated adaptive super twisting algorithm and non-singular fast terminal sliding mode (SASTA-NFTSM) technique, is proposed. First, the velocities and lumped system uncertainty including external disturbances and model uncertainties, are estimated by a finite-time extended state observer (FTESO), simultaneously in finite time. Second, to deal with the saturation constraints on actuators, a novel sliding mode reaching law scheme, namely SASTA, that consists of an anti-windup compensator and a super twisting algorithm based on switching logic adaptive gains is proposed. Finally, the trajectory tracking control of USVs is solved with the non-trivial combination of SASTA and NFTSM. The chattering phenomenon can be effectively attenuated by virtue of the continuous control laws compared with the traditional NFTSM control (NFTSMC) approaches. The tracking errors are guaranteed to converge to zero in finite time. Comparative simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness and advantage of the proposed scheme.

AB Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) or drone, is an evolving technology in today's market with an enormous number of applications. Mini UAVs are developed in order to compensate the performance constraints imposed by larger UAVs during emergency situations. Multiple mini autonomous UAVs require communication and coordination for ubiquitous coverage and relaying during deployment. Multi-UAV coordination or swarm optimization is required for reliable connectivity among UAVs, due to its high mobility and dynamic topology. In this paper, a Secured UAV (S-UAV) model is proposed which takes the location of the UAVs as inputs to form a Wireless Mesh Network (WMN) among multiple drones with the help of a centralized controller. After WMN formation, efficient communication takes place using A* search, an intelligent algorithm that finds the shortest communication path among UAVs. Further, the S-UAV model utilizes cryptographic techniques such as Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) and Blowfish to overcome the security attacks efficiently. Simulation results show that the S-UAV model offers higher throughput, reduced power consumption and guaranteed message transmission with reduced encryption and decryption time.

AB Vehicular fog computing (VFC) is envisioned as a promising solution to process the explosive tasks in autonomous vehicular networks. In the VFC system, task offloading is the key technique to process the computation-intensive tasks efficiently. In the task offloading, the task is transmitted to the VFC system according to the 802.11p standard and processed by the computation resources in the VFC system. The delay of task offloading, consisting of the transmission delay and computing delay, is extremely critical especially for some delay-sensitive applications. Furthermore, the long-term reward of the system (i.e., jointly considers the transmission delay, computing delay, available resources, and diversity of vehicles and tasks) becomes a significantly important issue for providers. Thus, in this article, we propose an optimal task offloading scheme to maximize the long-term reward of the system where 802.11p is employed as the transmission protocol for the communications between vehicles. Specifically, a task offloading problem based on a semi-Markov decision process (SMDP) is formulated. To solve this problem, we utilize an iterative algorithm based on the Bellman equation to approach the desired solution. The performance of the proposed scheme has been demonstrated by extensive numerical results.

AB The Internet of Vehicles (IoVs) is an emerging paradigm aiming to introduce a plethora of innovative applications and services that impose a certain quality of service (QoS) requirements. The IoV mainly relies on vehicular ad-hoc networks (VANETs) for autonomous inter-vehicle communication and road-traffic safety management. With the ever-increasing demand to design new and emerging applications for VANETs, one challenge that continues to stand out is the provision of acceptable QoS requirements to particular user applications. Most existing solutions to this challenge rely on a single layer of the protocol stack. This paper presents a cross-layer decision-based routing protocol that necessitates choosing the best multi-hop path for packet delivery to meet acceptable QoS requirements. The proposed protocol acquires the information about the channel rate from the physical layer and incorporates this information in decision making, while directing traffic at the network layer level. Key performance metrics for the system design are analyzed using extensive experimental simulation scenarios. In addition, three data rate variant solutions are proposed to cater for various application-specific requirements in highways and urban environments.

ID INDEX
AB Operating outdoor is still a daunting challenge for an autonomous ground vehicle, especially with the presence of vegetation. Therefore, this paper addresses a solution for general vegetation detection which lets the vehicle fully exploit its outdoor mobility capability. A new vision system integrated from photonic mixer device (PMD) and CMOS camera is implemented to provide simultaneously near-infrared (NIR), colour, and depth images. Whereby, the reflectance of the modulated NIR given by the PMD sensor and the red channel of the CMOS sensor are used to calculate normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI). In addition, a relative distance estimation method referencing a perfect flat ground is described to obtain quickly 3D point cloud in the vehicle frame, thus, enables a 3D distribution analysis for spatial feature extraction. As vegetation usually appears in several typical colours and unstructured texture, the paper also derives a methodology for generating colour histogram models and assessing unstructured texture orientation to create visual features. Finally, NDVI, spatial features and visual features are gathered to form feature vectors, which are then used to train a robust vegetation classifier. In all real-world experiments we carried out, our approach yields a detection accuracy of over 90%, which outperforms conventional approaches.

AB This paper deals with the problem of deploying a team of flying robots to perform surveillance-coverage missions over a terrain of arbitrary morphology. In such missions, a key factor for the successful completion of the mission is the knowledge of the terrain's morphology. The focus of this paper is on the implementation of a two-step procedure that allows us to optimally align a team of flying vehicles for the aforementioned task. Initially, a single robot constructs a map of the area using a novel monocular-vision-based approach. A state-of-the-art visual-SLAM algorithm tracks the pose of the camera while, simultaneously, autonomously, building an incremental map of the environment. The map generated is processed and serves as an input to an optimization procedure using the cognitive, adaptive methodology initially introduced in Renzaglia et al. (Proceedings of the IEEE international conference on robotics and intelligent system (IROS), Taipei, Taiwan, pp. 3314-3320, 2010). The output of this procedure is the optimal arrangement of the robots team, which maximizes the monitored area. The efficiency of our approach is demonstrated using real data collected from aerial robots in different outdoor areas.

AB Aerial surveillance and tracking have gained significant traction in recent years for both civilian applications and military reconnaissance. Disaster analysis, emergency medical response, pandemic spread analysis, etc. have significantly improved with the availability of aerial data. The next big step is to push the system for autonomous detection and tracking of targets beyond visual range (BVR). Presently, this is done using GPS-based techniques in which the target information is assumed to be precisely known. In situations where such information is unavailable or if the target of interest is non-stationary, this method is not applicable and currently, no alternative exists. In this work, we aim to address this limitation and propose a deep learning-based algorithm for terminal guidance of aerial vehicle BVR with only bearing information about the target of interest. The algorithm operates in search and track modes. We describe both the modes and also discuss the challenges associated with this kind of deployment in real time. Since the weight and power requirements of the payload directly translate to the cost of deployment and endurance of aerial vehicles, we have configured a custom lightweight convolutional neural network (CNN) with minimal layers and successfully deployed the system on Jetson Nano, the smallest GPU available from NVIDIA as of this writing. We evaluated the performance of the proposed algorithm on proprietary and open-source datasets and achieved detection accuracy greater than 98.6% on custom datasets.

AB Over the last decade, Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs), also known as drones, have been broadly utilized in various agricultural fields, such as crop management, crop monitoring, seed sowing, and pesticide spraying. Nonetheless, autonomy is still a crucial limitation faced by the Internet of Things (IoT) UAV systems, especially when used as sprayer UAVs, where data needs to be captured and preprocessed for robust real-time obstacle detection and collision avoidance. Moreover, because of the objective and operational difference between general UAVs and sprayer UAVs, not every obstacle detection and collision avoidance method will be sufficient for sprayer UAVs. In this regard, this article seeks to review the most relevant developments on all correlated branches of the obstacle avoidance scenarios for agricultural sprayer UAVs, including a UAV sprayer's structural details. Furthermore, the most relevant open challenges for current UAV sprayer solutions are enumerated, thus paving the way for future researchers to define a roadmap for devising new-generation, affordable autonomous sprayer UAV solutions. Agricultural UAV sprayers require data-intensive algorithms for the processing of the images acquired, and expertise in the field of autonomous flight is usually needed. The present study concludes that UAV sprayers are still facing obstacle detection challenges due to their dynamic operating and loading conditions.

ID VISION
AB Motion estimation is crucial to predict where other traffic participants will be at a certain period of time, and accordingly plan the route of the ego-vehicle. This paper presents a novel approach to estimate the motion state by using region-level instance segmentation and extended Kalman filter (EKF). Motion estimation involves three stages of object detection, tracking and parameter estimate. We first use a region-level segmentation to accurately locate the object region for the latter two stages. The region-level segmentation combines color, temporal (optical flow), and spatial (depth) information as the basis for segmentation by using super-pixels and Conditional Random Field. The optical flow is then employed to track the feature points within the object area. In the stage of parameter estimate, we develop a relative motion model of the ego-vehicle and the object, and accordingly establish an EKF model for point tracking and parameter estimate. The EKF model integrates the ego-motion, optical flow, and disparity to generate optimized motion parameters. During tracking and parameter estimate, we apply edge point constraint and consistency constraint to eliminate outliers of tracking points so that the feature points used for tracking are ensured within the object body and the parameter estimates are refined by inner points. Experiments have been conducted on the KITTI dataset, and the results demonstrate that our method presents excellent performance and outperforms the other state-of-the-art methods either in object segmentation and parameter estimate.

ID CONTROL STRATEGY
AB The development of sensor technology enabled the use of composite sensors to measure the torque and angle of steering wheels at gradually decreasing costs while maintaining the required safety. The electric power steering (EPS) is vital to the safety of the car, therefore it is not worth sacrificing safety to save cost and the SWA control with angle sensor gradually becomes the mainstream. Existing methods to control steering wheel angle (SWA) for EPS consider the self-aligning torque as a disturbance that should be rejected. However, this torque is useful to return the SWA from an outward to the center position. Hence, we propose a nonlinear control of SWA using the self-aligning torque for EPS in the lateral control system of autonomous vehicles. The proposed method consists of a high-gain disturbance observer and a backstepping controller, where the former aims to estimate the self-aligning torque, and an auxiliary state variable prevents using the derivative of the measured signal. The nonlinear controller is designed via backstepping to bound the SWA tracking error. The self-aligning torque provides damping that can improve the controller tracking when following the same direction of the input torque on the steering wheel control. In this case, the control input can be reduced by the damping effect of the self-aligning torque. The performance of the proposed method is validated through EPS hardware-in-the-loop simulation.

AB The current Internet of Underwater Things (IoUT) for marine observations and emergency responses suffers from two critical issues: 1) energy efficient and 2) timely data collection. Autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs), serving as tools for collecting and forwarding distributed data, can deal with the unbalanced power consumption in a traditional multihop underwater communication network. However, the low speed of the AUV has not been able to guarantee the timeliness of delay-sensitive data. In this article, we introduce a hybrid data collection scheme (HDCS), taking both real-time data collection and energy efficiency (EE) issues into consideration. All sensor nodes (SNs) are first clustered based on their locations in the network. We develop an analytic expression to describe the attenuation of Value of Information (VoI), involving the relationship between the importance degree and timeliness; initial VoI could be measured by historical data. The emergency can be recognized by the presented criterion, and the transmission mode of cluster heads (CHs) in the same layer is judged by CHs themselves according to VoI. The selected CHs shall transmit the urgent data via multihop routing to avoid over attenuation of VoI. The normal data are collected by AUVs visiting all remaining CHs, and the shortest trajectory is achieved by addressing a variation of the classic traveling salesman problem (TSP). Our simulation experiments show that this mechanism can effectively increase long-term VoI while significantly improving EE.

AB With the development of the Internet of Underwater Things (IoUT), two critical problems have been prominent, i.e., the energy constraint of underwater devices and large demand for data collection. In this article, we introduce an autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV)-aided underwater acoustic sensor networks (UWSNs) to solve these problems. To improve the performance of UWSNs, we formulate an optimization problem to maximize the energy consumption utility, which is defined to balance the energy consumption and network throughput. To solve this optimization problem, we decompose it into four parts. First, due to the constraint of communication distance, we construct a cluster-based network and formulate the selection of cluster heads as a maximal clique problem (MCP). Second, the clustering algorithm is proposed. Third, we design a novel media access control (MAC) protocol to coordinate data transmission between AUV and cluster heads, among intracluster nodes, as well as among intercluster nodes. Finally, path planning of AUV is formulated as a traveling salesman problem to minimize AUV travel time. Based on the above analysis, two algorithms, namely, AUV-aided energy-efficient data collection (AEEDCO) and approximate AUV-aided energy-efficient data collection (AEEDCO-A), are developed accordingly. The simulation results show that the proposed algorithms perform well and are very promising in UWSNs with demand for large-scale communication, large system capacity, long-term monitoring, and high data traffic load.

AB Numerical modeling of three-dimensional estuarine circulation is often challenging due to complex flow features and strong density gradients. In this paper the skill of a specific model is assessed against a highresolution data set, obtained in a river-dominated mesotidal estuary with autonomous underwater vehicles and a shipborne winched profiler. The measurements provide a detailed view of the salt wedge dynamics of the Columbia River estuary. Model skill is examined under contrasting forcing conditions, covering spring freshet and autumn low flow conditions, as well as spring and neap tides. The data set provides a rigorous benchmark for numerical circulation models. This benchmark is used herein to evaluate an unstructured grid circulation model, based on linear finite element and finite volume formulations. Advection of momentum is treated with an Eulerian-Lagrangian scheme. After the model's sensitivity to grid resolution and time step is examined, a detailed skill assessment is provided for the best model configuration. The simulations reproduce the timing and tidal asymmetry of salinity intrusion. Sharp density gradients, however, tend to be smoothed out affecting vertical mixing and gravitational circulation. We show that gravitational salt transport is underestimated in the model, but is partially compensated through tidal effects. The discrepancy becomes most pronounced when the stratification is strongest, i. e., under high river discharge and neap tide conditions. (C) 2015 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB Several monitoring approaches have been used to understand the physical, chemical, and biological processes associated with coastal sewage discharges. However, these efforts have not improved the understanding of the interaction of effluent plume/coastal ocean processes. Autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) have already been shown to be very useful for performing high-resolution surveys of small features such as outfall plumes. Some of the advantages of these platforms include easier field logistics, low cost per deployment, good spatial coverage, sampling over repeated sections, and the ability to perform feature based or adaptive sampling. Once the data have been collected in the field, it is necessary to extrapolate from monitoring samples to unsampled locations. Geostatistics has been successfully used to obtain information; for example, regarding the spatial distribution of soil properties. Besides giving estimated values at unsampled locations, it provides a measure of the accuracy of the estimate, which is a significant advantage over traditional methods used to assess pollution. In this work, geostatistics is used to model and map the spatial distribution of temperature measurements gathered by an AUV in a sea ouffall monitoring campaign, with the aim of distinguishing the effluent plume from the receiving waters and characterizing its spatial variability in the vicinity of the discharge. The results demonstrate that this methodology can provide good estimates of the dispersion of effluent, and it is therefore very valuable in assessing the environmental impact and managing sea outfalls.

AB Unattended autonomous systems of the future will involve groups of static and mobile sensors functioning in coordination to achieve overall task objectives. Such systems can be viewed as wirelessly networked unmanned heterogeneous sensor networks. We discuss a distributed heterogeneous sensing system with static sensors and mobile robots with novel adaptive control optimization algorithms for dynamic adaptation, coordinated control and end to end resource management of all sensors in response to detected events to achieve overall system goals and objectives. While our system design is applicable to a host of domains, it has been applied to and tested offline on an existing, functional maritime sensor web system, the New York Harbor Observation and Prediction System (NYHOPS) comprised of a host of maritime ocean and land sensors. Our goal is to enable adaptive control technologies to make the NYHOPS sensor web react faster and more effectively to threats or changing conditions, and to further maritime homeland security for the New York Harbor. Our contribution allows static sensors to work seamlessly with unmanned vehicles that can be deployed autonomously in response to detected events, and dynamically adjust operational parameters of static and mobile assets in the sensor web. Results for large area coastal monitoring are presented. Offline results using actual modeled data from in situ sensory measurements from the NYHOPS sensor web demonstrate how the sensor parameters can be adapted to maximize observability of a freshwater plume while ensuring that individual system components operate within their physical limitations.

DE core sampling; portable underwater vehicle; sediment penetration
AB As described in this paper, we investigate the sediment penetration performance of a portable underwater robot with a helical screw pipe using marine thrusters with limited force. First, we derive a mathematical model based on an empirical and simple method using the undrained shear strength of cohesive soil to provide a rough estimate of maximum penetration depths. Then, we perform numerical analysis for estimating the maximum depth of sediment penetration and for designing a sampling pipe. Additionally, we use experimentation to investigate the relation between the penetration depth of the helical screw pipe and the force of marine thrusters mounted on the portable underwater robot. After testing the penetration performance in a water tank, we conduct a field experiment at Lake Biwa and obtain results of the penetration depths. The maximum penetration into the lake sediment is at least 0.30 m. The results demonstrated the possibility of using the derived mathematical model to make a rough estimation of the maximum penetration depth for clay sediments. Additionally, we can use non-powerful thrusters equipped with small autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) and remotely operated vehicles (ROVs) for sediment sampling. The proposed method is also applicable for the installation of underwater sensors using small AUVs and ROVs.

AB Comprehensive safety evaluation methodologies for automated driving systems that account for the large complexity real traffic are currently being developed. This work adopts a scenario-based safety evaluation approach and aims at investigating an advanced methodology to generate test cases by applying heuristics to naturalistic driving data. The targeted requirements of the generated test cases are severity, exposure, and realism. The methodology starts with the extraction of scenarios from the data and their split in two subsets-containing the relatively more critical scenarios and, respectively, the normal driving scenarios. Each subset is analysed separately, in regard to the parameter value distributions and occurrence of dependencies. Subsequently, a heuristic search-based approach is applied to generate test cases. The resulting test cases clearly discriminate between safety critical and normal driving scenarios, with the latter covering a wider spectrum than the former. The verification of the generated test cases proves that the proposed methodology properly accounts for both severity and exposure in the test case generation process. Overall, the current study contributes to fill a gap concerning the specific applicable methodologies capable of accounting for both severity and exposure and calls for further research to prove its applicability in more complex environments and scenarios.

AB In order to realise autonomous navigation of unmanned platforms in urban or off-road environments, it is crucial to study accurate, versatile and real-time road detection methods. This study proposes an adaptive road detection method that combines lane lines and obstacle boundaries, which can be applied to a variety of driving environments. Combining multi-channel threshold processing, it is robust to lane feature detection under various complex situations. Obstacle information extracted from the grid image constructed by 3D LIDAR point cloud is used for lane feature selection to avoid interference from pedestrians and vehicles. The proposed method makes use of adaptive sliding window for feature selection, and piecewise least squares method for road line fitting. Experimental results on dataset and in real-world environments show that the proposed method can overcome illumination changes, shadow occlusion, pedestrian, vehicle interference and so on in a variety of scenes. The proposed method has good enough efficiency, robustness and real-time performance.

AB The advent of underwater acoustic sensor networks (UASNs) has enhanced marine environmental monitoring, auxiliary navigation, and marine military defense. One of the core functions of UASNs is data collection. However, current underwater data collection schemes generally encounter problems such as high energy consumption and high latency. Furthermore, the application of multiple autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) has contributed to more problems of task assignment and load balancing. This leads to significant failure in data collections and controlling of spontaneous emergencies. To address these problems, a district partition-based data collection algorithm with event dynamic competition in UASNs has been proposed. In this algorithm, the value of information of the packet determines the priority of its transmission to the cluster head. The navigation position of the mobile sink and the area under the responsibility of each AUV are determined by the spatial region division. The path of the AUV in the subregion is then planned using reinforcement learning. Subsequently, the dynamic competition of multiple AUVs is used to handle emergency tasks. The simulation demonstrates that our proposed algorithm significantly reduces energy consumption to guarantee load balancing while reducing end-to-end transmission delay.

TI Determination of the optimal connected and automated vehicles platoon

AB The platoon size is a critical parameter in connected and automated vehicle (CAV) platoon configuration. However, the optimal platoon size configuration for the mixed human-driven vehicles (HVs) and CAVs traffic has not been well-studied, especially in merging areas. This paper aims to determine the optimal platoon size in the merge area through numerical analysis. Specifically, the existing merge probability calculation model is improved considering the impact of mainline random platoon size on on-ramp vehicles. In the improved model, the CAV platoon is treated as a vehicle with different lengths, and the headway between the platoon and single vehicle and the headway between the platoons are related to the maximum platoon size and CAV penetration rate. Three key parameters, namely the CAV penetration rate, acceleration lane length, and mainline traffic volume, were combined at various values. Based on this input, the relationship between the success rate and the platoon size was analyzed. The numerical analysis results indicate that: (1) when the CAV penetration rate is 10% similar to 30%, the merge success rate increases and stabilizes as the platoon size increases, and the optimal platoon size is 4 similar to 6. (2) When the CAV penetration rate is 40% similar to 70%, the trend of merge success rate varies with increasing platoon size under different mainline traffic volumes and acceleration lane lengths. Under the situation with lower traffic and longer acceleration length, the merge success rate tends to decline easier with larger platoon sizes, with 3 similar to 8 being the optimal platoon size. (3) When the CAV penetration rate is 80% similar to 90%, as the platoon size increases, the merging success rate tends to increase to the highest point and decrease. The optimal platoon size is 3 similar to 5. Finally, the validity of the theoretical model is confirmed through simulation experiments, and its limitations are discussed.

AB This paper illustrates agent technologies applied to unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) target tracking. The combination of the three technologies presented in this paper provide UAVs with functionality needed for coordinated autonomous operation, from building up accurate beliefs, efficiently gathering information, to acting rationally. In the UAV target tracking domain, communication among agents is necessary for building beliefs about target locations. Reliable information provisioning networks are constructed through selection of appropriate information sources and trust evaluations are applied to belief revision. Also, a macro-based action selection scheme is deployed for efficient coordination of the target tracking activity among agents.

AB Single hidden layer perceptron neural network controllers combined with dynamic inversion are applied to the tilt-rotor unmanned aerial vehicle and its variant model with the nacelle mounted wing extension. The bandwidths of the inner loop and outer loop of the controller are designed using the timescale separation approach, which uses the combined analysis of the two loops. The bandwidth of each loop is selected to be close to each other using a combination of the pseudo-control-hedging and the pole-placement method. Similar to the previous studies on sigma-pi neural network, the dynamic inversion at hover conditions of the original tilt-rotor model is used as a baseline for both aircraft, and the compatible solution to the Lyapunov equation is suggested. The single hidden layer perceptron neural network minimizes the error of the inversion model through the back-propagation adaptation. The waypoint guidance is applied to the outermost loop of the neural network controller for autonomous flight which includes vertical take-off and landing as well as nacelle conversion. The simulation results under the two wind conditions for the tilt-rotor aircraft and its variant are presented. The south and north-west wind directions are simulated in order to compare with the results from the existing sigma-pi neural network, and the estimation results of the wind are presented.

AB In this paper, a collision avoidance control algorithm for unmanned surface vehicle (USV) with COLREGs is studied. To solve the constraints of actuator and dynamics in the maneuvering characteristics and the estimation of velocity window parameters in dynamic window approach (DWA), a real-time collision avoidance control algorithm based on dynamic constraints is proposed according to the principle of DWA, which mainly includes the design of candidate control behavior space, feasible trajectory prediction, collision risk assessment, acquisition of optimal control quantities and so on. The candidate control behavior space designed according to DWA meets the actuator constraints; The feasible trajectory prediction method can meet the dynamic constraints and avoid the problem of velocity window parameters estimation in DWA; The optimal control quantity method constructs the collision avoidance control evaluation function according to the collision risk evaluation principle, and obtain the feasible dynamic trajectory and collision avoidance control quantities at the same time. In addition, the collision avoidance rule function is introduced into the collision avoidance control evaluation function to enable the USV to comply with the COLREGs. Finally, simulation results are provided to illustrate the efficacy of collision avoidance control algorithm.

AB Unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) assisted emergency communication is an important technique for future B5G/6G scenario. The UAV is usually considered as a mobile relay to forward information from the macro base station (MBS) to the users in emergency area. In this paper, the MBS power allocation, the UAV service zone selection, and the user scheduling are jointly investigated to enhance the sum spectrum efficiency. We formulate the MBS power allocation and UAV service zone selection problem as an Markov Decision Process (MDP) in the delay ignored system (DIS) and propose a deep reinforcement learning (DRL) algorithm based on Q-learning and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN). Then the proposed DRL-based scheme is extended in time delay system (TDS) to estimate the current optimal action with the outdated channel information. We also formulate the user scheduling as a 0-1 optimization problem and solve it by dividing into sub-problems. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed DRL-based resource scheduling scheme can effectively improve the spectrum efficiency compared with the existing schemes.

AB A recurrent neural network (RNN) based fuzzy sliding mode control (RFSMC) method is proposed in this paper to achieve a stable movement for 4-degree freedom remotely operated vehicle (ROV) under the condition of ROV uncertainty and in the presence of external disturbance. The ROV model uncertainty term is estimated and compensated adaptively by training a RNN offline. Meanwhile, a fuzzy logic system (FLS) is employed as the switching term of the conventional sliding mode control (CSMC) in order to reduce the chattering phenomenon. By doing so, the external disturbance can be eliminated automatically during the movement of the ROV even though the upper bound of the external disturbance is unknown. The stability of the ROV with the presented RFSMC method is proven by Lyapunov stability analysis, and compared with the state-of-the-art methods including CSMC, double-loop sliding mode control (DSMC) and back propagation neural network based sliding mode control (BPSMC) method. The experiment results demonstrate that the proposed method has great robustness. The position error and trajectory error can rapidly converge to zero, and the chattering phenomenon can be suppressed consequently.

AB As neural networks become an increasingly popular technique in the field of aeromagnetic compensation, there is an increasing demand for hardware systems with more computing power. Compared with the linear regression method, applying a neural network to the task of real-time compensation is difficult because of insufficient computing resources in the unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) flight detection platform. To perform real-time compensation calculations with limited computing resources, we optimized back propagation neural network (OBPNN) through model compression and acceleration. In this study, we found that the most time-consuming part of network training is the iterative updating of the weights in the BPNN interference model. Using transfer learning, we replace the randomly initialized weights (RWs) with pretrained weights, thereby greatly reducing the number of iterations required. We also apply other model compression and acceleration algorithms. In a case study of our new technique, we implement the fast training of the OBPNN on a Raspberry Pi 4B system. This network processes approximately 316 samples per 0.1 s, which is fast enough to complete aeromagnetic compensation in real time.

AB Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) with multi-input-multi-output technologies are considered as a promising platform to provide future high-speed wireless communication services. In this study, considering three-dimensional (3D) antenna arrays and 3D arbitrary trajectories of the UAV and mobile terminal, the authors propose a new 3D non-stationary geometry-based stochastic channel model for UAV-ground communication systems. Under 3D non-isotropic scattering scenarios, the computation and optimisation methods of time-variant channel parameters are investigated. In addition, the theoretical statistical properties such as the autocorrelation function, cross-correlation function, Doppler power spectrum density, level-crossing rate, and average fading duration are analysed and derived. Finally, the usefulness of the proposed model as well as theoretical derivations are verified by the comparison between theoretical, simulated, and measured results.

AB Personal rapid transit (PRT) is a kind of innovative public transport service operated by autonomous vehicles on a dedicated guideway network. In the situation, where PRT guideway network is composed of unidirectional links, the congestion degree of network and vehicle travel distance depend on the arrangement of link directions, given certain traffic demand and network configuration. The motivation of this paper is to propose a method to optimize the link direction of PRT network for enhancing system performance. The proposed optimization problem considers both the vehicle travel time and waiting time at merging nodes as the optimization objective and is formulated as a non-linear programming modal. A linear approximation-based solution method is further developed to obtain solutions in an efficient way and the exact solution is achieved via this method. The result shows that the proposed method is effective to find an optimized arrangement of link directions in the network given certain travel demand and network configuration. The computational results of the proposed model in comparison to other models are presented and discussed, which show that the significant reduction of waiting time does not necessarily lead to the high increase of travel time, suggesting the importance of congestion control for merging modes.

AB In order to develop safe autonomous systems, accurate and precise models of human behavior must be developed. For intelligent vehicles, one can imagine the need for predicting driver behavior to develop minimally invasive active safety systems or to safely interact with human drivers on the road. We present an optimization-based method for approximating the stochastic reachable set for human-in-the-loop systems. This method identifies the most precise subset of states that a human driven vehicle may enter, given some data set of observed trajectories. We phrase this problem as a mixed integer linear program, solved via branch and bound methods. The resulting model uncovers the most representative set that encapsulates the likely trajectories, up to some probability threshold, by optimally rejecting outliers in the data set. This tool provides set predictions consisting of trajectories observed from the nonlinear dynamics and behaviors of the human driven car, and can account for modes of behavior, like the driver state or intent. This method is applied to predict lane changing behavior, achieving similar to 90% accuracy over long time horizons. This flexible algorithm is to handle realistic complex human driving data and provide a robust and informative prediction of driver behavior.

AB Given the lack of systematic research on bathymetric surveys with multi-beam sonar carried by autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) in unfamiliar waters, this paper proposes a method for multi-beam bathymetric surveys based on the constant-depth mode of AUVs, considering equipment safety, operational efficiency, and data quality. Firstly, basic principles for multi-beam bathymetric surveys under the constant-depth mode are proposed based on multi-beam operational standards and AUV constant-depth mode characteristics. Secondly, a vertical effective height model for the vehicle is established, providing vertical constraints and a basis for determining fixed depth in constant-depth missions. Subsequently, according to these basic principles and the vertical effective height model, the operational process for multi-beam bathymetric surveys in unfamiliar waters under the AUV constant-depth mode is outlined. Finally, we validate the proposed method through sea trials in the Xisha Sea of the South China Sea. The test results show that the method proposed in this paper not only ensures the vehicle safety operation and multi-beam data quality, but also improves the operation efficiency by about 68%, demonstrating the reliability of the proposed method and its significant engineering value and guidance implications.

AB Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) or drones are increasingly used for urban applications like traffic monitoring and construction surveys. Autonomous navigation allows drones to visit waypoints and accomplish activities as part of their mission. A common activity is to hover and observe a location using on-board cameras. Advances in Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) allow such videos to be analyzed for automated decision making. UAVs also host edge computing capability for on-board inferencing by such DNNs. To this end, for a fleet of drones, we propose a novel Mission Scheduling Problem () that co-schedules the flight routes to visit and record video at waypoints, and their subsequent on-board edge analytics. The proposed schedule maximizes the data capture and computing utilities from the activities while meeting the activity deadlines, and the energy and computing constraints. We first prove that is NP-hard and then optimally solve it by formulating a mixed integer linear programming (MILP) problem. Next, we design five time-efficient heuristic algorithms that provide sub-optimal but fast solutions that are empirically competitive with the optimal solution. Evaluation of these five schedulers using real drone traces demonstrate utility-runtime trade-offs under diverse workloads.

AB The source location based on the hybrid time difference of arrival (TDOA)/frequency difference of arrival (FDOA) is a basic problem in wireless sensor networks, and the layout of sensors in the hybrid TDOA/FDOA positioning will greatly affect the accuracy of positioning. Using unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) as base stations, by optimizing the trajectory of the UAV swarm, an optimal positioning configuration is formed to improve the accuracy of the target position and velocity estimation. In this paper, a hybrid TDOA/FDOA positioning model is first established, and the positioning accuracy of the hybrid TDOA/FDOA under different positioning configurations and different measurement errors is simulated by the geometric dilution of precision (GDOP) factor. Second, the Cramer-Rao lower bound (CRLB) matrix of hybrid TDOA/FDOA location under different moving states of the target is derived theoretically, the objective function of the track optimization is obtained, and the track of the UAV swarm is optimized in real time. The simulation results show that the track optimization effectively improves the accuracy of the target position and velocity estimation.

AB The capability of avoiding collisions in an environment with obstacles is a necessary function for an autonomous unmanned surface vehicle (USV). This paper reports the preliminary research results of a novel multiple obstacles avoidance approach for USVs. This method adds the time dimension in a time-varying environment containing multiple obstacles with arbitrary known motion patterns. The approach presented is a path searching based algorithm, the three-dimensional multiple obstacle avoidance (TDMOA) algorithm, which applies a novel multi-objective optimization and interval programming method, and can plan a suboptimal collision-free path in seconds. A unique property of the approach is the compliance with existing marine collision regulations in the planning process. The approach first incorporates navigational safety and maritime operational rules to establish an obstacle risk domain model. The time dimension is then introduced to a two-dimensional plane to establish the three-dimensional risk model, and then the improved D* Lite algorithm searches a collision-free path in compliance with marine collision regulations. Several complex multi-obstacle collision scenarios are simulated in experiments to verify the validity of the new TDMOA algorithm and results indicate good real-time performance and safe navigation paths for USVs.

AB To overcome the problems caused by the limited battery lifetime in multiple-unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) wireless networks, we propose a hierarchical multi-agent reinforcement learning (RL) framework to maximize the energy efficiency (EE) of UAVs by finding the optimal frequency reuse factor and transmit power. The proposed algorithm consists of distributed inner-loop RL for transmit power control of the UAV terminal (UT) and centralized outer-loop RL for finding the optimal frequency reuse factor. Specifically, the proposed algorithm adjusts these two factors jointly to effectively mitigate intercell interference and reduce undesired transmit power consumption in multi-UAV wireless networks. We show that, for this reason, the proposed algorithm outperforms conventional algorithms, such as a random action algorithm with a fixed frequency reuse factor and a hierarchical multi-agent Q-learning algorithm with binary transmit power controls. Furthermore, even in the environment where UTs are continuously moving based on the mixed mobility model, we show that the proposed algorithm can find the best reward when compared to conventional algorithms.

AB Multi-UAV systems are attracting, especially in the last decade, the attention of researchers and companies of very different fields due to the great interest in developing systems capable of operating in a coordinated manner in complex scenarios and to cover and speed up applications that can be dangerous or tedious for people: search and rescue tasks, inspection of facilities, delivery of goods, surveillance, etc. Inspired by these needs, this work aims to design, implement and analyze a trajectory planning and collision avoidance strategy for multi-UAV systems in 3D environments. For this purpose, a study of the existing techniques for both problems is carried out and an innovative strategy based on Fast Marching Square-for the planning phase-and a simple priority-based speed control-as the method for conflict resolution-is proposed, together with prevention measures designed to try to limit and reduce the greatest number of conflicting situations that may occur between vehicles while they carry out their missions in a simulated 3D urban environment. The performance of the algorithm is evaluated successfully on the basis of certain conveniently chosen statistical measures that are collected throughout the simulation runs.

AB This paper proposes the development of a formation control algorithm of multiple acoustic underwater vehicles by employing the behaviour of autonomous mobile agents under a proposed pursuit. A robust pursuit is developed using the distributed consensus coordinated algorithm ensuring the transfer of information among the AUVs. The development of robust pursuit based on characteristics of multi-agent system is for solving the incomplete information capabilities in each agent such as asynchronous computation, decentralized data and no system global control. In unreliable and narrow banded underwater acoustic medium, the formation of AUVs based distributed coordinated consensus tracking can be accomplished under the constant or varying virtual leader's velocity. Further, the study to achieve tracking based on virtual leader AUV's velocity is extended to fixed and switching network topologies. Again for mild connectivity, an adjacency matrix is defined in such a way that an adaptive connectivity is ensured between the AUVs. The constant virtual leader vehicle velocity method based on consensus tracking is more robust to reduce inaccuracy because no accurate position and velocity measurements are required. Results were obtained using MATLAB and acquired outcomes are analysed for efficient formation control in presence of the underwater communication constraints.

SO TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH RECORD

ID SHARED AUTONOMOUS VEHICLES; WAVES; TAXIS; MODEL
AB Mobility-on-demand (MoD) services are provided by multiple competing companies. In their competition for travelers, they need to provide minimum travel costs, or travelers will switch to competitors. This study developed a dynamic traffic assignment of MoD systems. A static traffic assignment (STA) model is first defined. When demand is asymmetric, empty rebalancing trips are required to move vehicles to traveler origins, and the optimal rebalancing flows are found by a linear program. Because of the time-dependent nature of traveler demand, the model was converted to dynamic traffic assignment (DTA). The method of successive averages, which is provably convergent for STA, was used to find dynamic user equilibrium (DUE). The simulation was conducted on two networks. The MoD system was simulated with different fleet sizes and demands. The results showed that the average total delay and travel distance decreased with the increase in fleet size whereas the average on-road travel time increased with the fleet size. The result of traffic assignment of one network with MoD system was compared with a network where all travelers use private vehicles. The results showed that the network with MoD system created more trips but less traffic congestion.

AB Visual condition inspections serve as the basis for determining the need and schedule for service tasks such as maintenance and remediation projects to preserve the proper functioning of power facilities and infrastructure. An increasing accumulation of service projects has recently surfaced due to the lengthy, labour-intensive and subjective qualities of the current method for inspection. These processes are also costly due to the temporary closure of the infrastructure as well as the requirement of special inspection equipment. Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), commonly known as drones, offer potential as a useful tool for infrastructure inspections. UAVs provide visual assessments of structures while eliminating the need for manual inspections. Thus, aerial systems have the potential to reduce the cost of inspections as well as limit the disruption of the public while allowing engineers to have a better three-dimensional understanding of the system. However, the implementation of UAV inspection includes several difficulties such as flight stability, control accuracy, and safety. This study summarises the context for UAV inspection of power facilities and structures. Technologies to address the hindrances preventing UAV integration into the current practice are reviewed. Existing challenges and future work in research for UAV inspections are also presented.

ID SCHEME
AB Cellular vehicle-to-everything (C-V2X) has been continuously evolving since Release 14 of the 3rd Generation Partnership Project (3GPP) for future autonomous vehicles. Apart from automotive safety, 5G NR further bring new capabilities to C-V2X for autonomous driving, such as real-time local update, and coordinated driving. These capabilities rely on the provision of low latency and high reliability from 5G NR. Among them, a basic demand is broadcasting or multicasting environment update messages, such as cooperative perception data, with high reliability and low latency from a Road Side Unit (RSU) or a base station (BS). In other words, broadcasting multiple types of automotive messages with high reliability and low latency is one of the key issues in 5G NR C-V2X. In this work, we consider how to select Modulation and Coding Scheme (MCS), RSU/BS, Forward Error Correction (FEC) code rate, to maximize the system utility, which is a function of message delivery reliability. We formulate the optimization problem as a nonlinear integer programming problem. Since the optimization problem is NP-hard, we propose an approximation algorithm, referred to as the Hyperbolic Successive Convex Approximation (HSCA) algorithm, which uses the successive convex approximation to find the optimal solution. In our simulations, we compare the performance of HSCA with those of three algorithms respectively, including the baseline algorithm, the heuristic algorithm, and the optimal solution. Our simulation results show that HSCA outperforms the baseline and the heuristic algorithms and is very competitive to the optimal solution.

ID ROBOTICS
AB Multi-line LiDAR and GPS/IMU are widely used in autonomous driving and robotics, such as simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM). Calibrating the extrinsic parameters of each sensor is a necessary condition for multi-sensor fusion. The calibration of each sensor directly affects the accurate positioning control and perception performance of the vehicle. Through the algorithm, accurate extrinsic parameters and a symmetric covariance matrix of extrinsic parameters can be obtained as a measure of the confidence of the extrinsic parameters. As for the calibration of LiDAR-GPS/IMU, many calibration methods require specific vehicle motion or manual calibration marking scenes to ensure good constraint of the problem, resulting in high costs and a low degree of automation. To solve this problem, we propose a new two-step self-calibration method, which includes extrinsic parameter initialization and refinement. The initialization part decouples the extrinsic parameters from the rotation and translation part, first calculating the reliable initial rotation through the rotation constraints, then calculating the initial translation after obtaining a reliable initial rotation, and eliminating the accumulated drift of LiDAR odometry by loop closure to complete the map construction. In the refinement part, the LiDAR odometry is obtained through scan-to-map registration and is tightly coupled with the IMU. The constraints of the absolute pose in the map refined the extrinsic parameters. Our method is validated in the simulation and real environments, and the results show that the proposed method has high accuracy and robustness.

TI Fusion of neural networks, for LIDAR-based evidential road mapping
SO JOURNAL OF FIELD ROBOTICS
LA English
DT Article
AB LIDAR sensors are usually used to provide autonomous vehicles with three-dimensional representations of their environment. In ideal conditions, geometrical models could detect the road in LIDAR scans, at the cost of a manual tuning of numerical constraints, and a lack of flexibility. We instead propose an evidential pipeline, to accumulate road detection results obtained from neural networks. First, we introduce RoadSeg, a new convolutional architecture that is optimized for road detection in LIDAR scans. RoadSeg is used to classify individual LIDAR points as either belonging to the road, or not. Yet, such point-level classification results need to be converted into a dense representation, that can be used by an autonomous vehicle. We thus second present an evidential road mapping algorithm, that fuses consecutive road detection results. We benefitted from a reinterpretation of logistic classifiers, which can be seen as generating a collection of simple evidential mass functions. An evidential grid map that depicts the road can then be obtained, by projecting the classification results from RoadSeg into grid cells, and by handling moving objects via conflict analysis. The system was trained and evaluated on real-life data. A python implementation maintains a 10 Hz framerate. Since road labels were needed for training, a soft labeling procedure, relying lane-level HD maps, was used to generate coarse training and validation sets. An additional test set was manually labeled for evaluation purposes. So as to reach satisfactory results, the system fuses road detection results obtained from three variants of RoadSeg, processing different LIDAR features.

AB This paper presents the development of direct adaptive control laws to enable an autonomous unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) to track reference trajectories in the presence of external disturbances. A maneuver database of reference trajectories is computed offline from a linear UAV dynamic model using an optimization routine. Each maneuver in the database is therefore represented as a state trajectory, as well as the control input sequence that generates that trajectory. The trajectory tracking control laws are designed to enable a UAV to follow reference trajectories from this maneuver database. A disturbance accommodating control law is first developed and applied for the tracking of reference trajectories while the UAV is subjected to a persistent external disturbance. This control design requires a state-space disturbance generator model and the derivation of ideal trajectories from a reference model, which requires the solution of a set of matching conditions. A direct adaptive controller is then developed to enable the UAV to track reference trajectories while subject to modeling error and external disturbances. The adaptive controller also requires a disturbance model and the existence of ideal trajectories, but it does not require the explicit solution of the matching conditions. Simulation results for the disturbance accommodating controller and the adaptive controller are presented using a linear six-degree-of-freedom dynamic model that is representative of typical UAV dynamics. The results show that, although both controllers track reference trajectories and provide disturbance rejection, the adaptive controller is better suited for handling modeling errors or uncertainties.

TI Road to autonomous vehicles in Australia: an exploratory literature

SO ROAD & TRANSPORT RESEARCH
LA English
DT Review
ID TRAFFIC FLOW; SYSTEMS; OPPORTUNITIES; CHALLENGES; ATTITUDES; MODEL
AB Autonomous vehicle technology and its potential effects on traffic and daily activities is a popular topic in the media and in the research community. It is anticipated that AVs will reduce accidents, improve congestion, increase the utility of time spent travelling and reduce social exclusion. However, knowledge about the way in which AVs will function in a transport system is still modest and a recent international study showed a lower familiarity with AVs in Australia compared to the USA and UK. Attitudes towards fully automated driving (or higher levels of autonomy) range from 'excitement' to 'suspicion'. The breadth of feelings may be due to the low level of awareness or reflect polarising attitudinal positions. Whilst experts appear to be more confident about the adoption of AV technology in the near future, public acceptance is key to AVs' market success. Hence, research that examines local contexts and opinions is needed.
   This paper reviews existing scholarly work and identifies gaps and directions for future developments, with a focus on the Australian context. The review will address the following broad categories: investigation of AV features and mobility models, implications for road traffic and connectivity to infrastructure (especially in low to medium density urban areas), public attitudes and concerns, travel behaviour and demand, potential business models, and policy implications. The aims of the paper are to identify critical issues for the development of a focus group inquiry to understand attitudes of potential users of AVs and to highlight AV development issues for policy makers in Australia.

ID ALGORITHM
AB Most applications of underwater wireless sensor networks (UWSNs) demand reliable data delivery over a longer period in an efficient and timely manner. However, the harsh and unpredictable underwater environment makes routing more challenging as compared to terrestrial WSNs. Most of the existing schemes deploy mobile sensors or a mobile sink (MS) to maximize data gathering. However, the relatively high deployment cost prevents their usage in most applications. Thus, this paper presents an autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV)-aided efficient data-gathering (AEDG) routing protocol for reliable data delivery in UWSNs. To prolong the network lifetime, AEDG employs an AUV for data collection from gateways and uses a shortest path tree (SPT) algorithm while associating sensor nodes with the gateways. The AEDG protocol also limits the number of associated nodes with the gateway nodes to minimize the network energy consumption and to prevent the gateways from overloading. Moreover, gateways are rotated with the passage of time to balance the energy consumption of the network. To prevent data loss, AEDG allows dynamic data collection at the AUV depending on the limited number of member nodes that are associated with each gateway. We also develop a sub-optimal elliptical trajectory of AUV by using a connected dominating set (CDS) to further facilitate network throughput maximization. The performance of the AEDG is validated via simulations, which demonstrate the effectiveness of AEDG in comparison to two existing UWSN routing protocols in terms of the selected performance metrics.

AB This article explores deep reinforcement learning (DRL) for the flocking control of unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) swarms. The flocking control policy is trained using a centralized-learning-decentralized-execution (CTDE) paradigm, where a centralized critic network augmented with additional information about the entire UAV swarm is utilized to improve learning efficiency. Instead of learning inter-UAV collision avoidance capabilities, a repulsion function is encoded as an inner-UAV "instinct. " In addition, the UAVs can obtain the states of other UAVs through onboard sensors in communication-denied environments, and the impact of varying visual fields on flocking control is analyzed. Through extensive simulations, it is shown that the proposed policy with the repulsion function and limited visual field has a success rate of 93.8% in training environments, 85.6% in environments with a high number of UAVs, 91.2% in environments with a high number of obstacles, and 82.2% in environments with dynamic obstacles. Furthermore, the results indicate that the proposed learning-based methods are more suitable than traditional methods in cluttered environments.

AB To solve the shortcomings of wireless sensor networks (WSNs) in data collection in a wide range, long distance, and other complex environments, such as high networking cost, short network life cycle, and difficult data collection, a data collection strategy based on the unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) cluster collaborative networking is proposed. First, the node structure and deployment application of WSNs are analyzed, and the architecture of UAV collaborative data collection is designed. Second, the related models of communication energy consumption between WSNs' network and UAV cluster, UAV cluster task allocation, and path planning are established successively. Then, a simple but efficient task planning strategy considering UAV forward and return distances is proposed. Finally, for the problem of model solving, the solution strategy of the heuristic swarm intelligence algorithm is proposed. The simulation results verify that the strategy reduces the overall network energy consumption by 42.16% and the total range of UAV by 9.7% and realizes the relative minimization of WSNs energy consumption and UAV flight cost on the premise of ensuring the full coverage of WSNs' nodes.

AB This paper presents a cooperative vector field approach for synchronized path following of multiple autonomous surface vehicles (USVs) with limited communication resources. First, a cooperative vector field is proposed by introducing a path coordination design into a three-dimensional vector field. Based on the cooperative vector field, concise guidance laws of surge speed and angular rate are derived for synchronized path following. In order to reduce communication times among USVs, an event-triggered cooperative vector field is next proposed. Specifically, a predictor is devised to predict the current path variables by using the last transmitting ones, and an event-triggered mechanism is developed based on the predicted path variables. Then, a self-triggered cooperative vector field is developed to avoid continuous listening. A self-triggered mechanism is designed such that each USV predicts its next triggering time and broadcasts it to its neighbors at the current triggering time. The stability of the three cooperative vector fields is analyzed, and Zeno behavior is excluded. Finally, both simulation and experiment results are provided to illustrate the efficacy of the proposed continuous, event-triggered, and self-triggered cooperative vector fields for resource-aware synchronized path following.

AB As an emerging multi-submersible system, Human Occupied Vehicle (HOV) under a convoy of a set of Autonomous Underwater Vehicles (AUVs) is regarded as the future framework for underwater exploration. In this work, to improve the interoperability and communication efficiency of the multi-submersible formations, we treat the multi-submersible system as a paradigm of the underwater Internet of Vehicle (IoV) and show how to utilize the Software-Defined Networking (SDN) technique to optimize the system architecture. With the assistance of SDN, we consider the ocean current factors and propose an artificial flow potential field algorithm that combines the artificial potential field algorithm and the gradient descent algorithm, to plan the path for the multi-submersible system. In particular, to improve the safety and efficiency of path planning, we propose a dual leader-follower algorithm-based escort formation obstacle avoidance mechanism for dealing with all categories of obstacle avoidance situations. Simulation tests show that the proposed scheme performs better in data delivery among the multi-submersible system, at a lower energy cost. And it shows high stability and strong practicability in multi-submersible formation control and path planning, respectively.

AB For an autonomous vehicle, reliable situation understanding is a key component of safe navigation. An incorrect prediction of an upcoming situation means that erroneous information may be supplied to the decision-making process, leading to hazardous outcomes. It is therefore of great importance to estimate the driving areas that are reachable by other interacting road users, without introducing misleading information. This paper presents a means of handling the integrity of prediction information, given the imperfection of object prediction, via a Lane Grid Map, that is to say a spatial representation of the situation at a tactical level, based on the topological layer of a high-definition map. We demonstrate experimentally, using real data, how the spatial sampling step of the grid representation can be used to manage the integrity of prediction information. Moreover, addressing interactions during the prediction makes it possible to handle some particular situations safely. We show how some interactions can be utilized via the concept of neutralization. To quantify the integrity of the prediction, we propose the use of two metrics, namely False Negative Rate and Neutralized Time Interval. Experiments were carried out with three vehicles to evaluate the integrity of the prediction using these metrics.

AB Over the recent years, there have been tremendous advances in the development of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), that are now attracting increased interest for a number of commercial and military applications. However, usage of such autonomous vehicles over sensitive areas poses significant security and/or public safety threats. This article investigates a system that can counter such threats by utilizing a swarm of pursuer UAV agents that cooperate in tracking and jamming multiple rogue UAVs in an attempt to interfere with their operation. The proposed framework aims to select the best control actions for each UAV, in terms of joint mobility and jamming power, succeeding in optimally tracking and successfully jamming the rogue UAVs over time, while also ensuring that the power received by the pursuer UAVs remains below predefined interference levels. Additionally, the proposed framework minimizes the total energy consumption of the swarm of UAV agents (accounting for both jamming and propulsion energy consumption). The applicability and effectiveness of the proposed approach is validated through extensive simulation experiments for different pursuer-target scenarios, with UAVs utilizing both fixed- and rotary-wing technologies.

AB In this paper, a new optimization algorithm called Motion-Encoded Genetic Algorithm with Multiple Parents (MEGA-MPC) is developed to locate moving targets using multiple Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs). Bayesian theory is used to formulate the moving target tracking as an optimization problem where target detection probability defines the objective function as the probability of detecting the target. In the developed MEGA-MPC algorithm, a series of UAV motion paths encodes the search trajectory. In every iteration of the MEGA-MPC algorithm, UAV motion paths undergo evolution. The proposed approach for dynamic target search using multi-UAVs uses parallel computations to solve the optimization problem based on the MEGA-MPC algorithm where Each UAV can communicate with other UAVs if requested. The algorithm's performance is tested with various characteristics under six distinct scenarios using a different number of UAVs and targets. The statistical analysis of the results obtained using MEGA-MPC compared with other well-known metaheuristics shows that MEGA-MPC offers better solutions to find dynamic targets since it outperforms all the compared algorithms.

TI Modeling and verifying clustering properties in a vehicular ad hoc
   network protocol with Event-B
SO SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
LA English
DT Article
ID CHAIN-BRANCH-LEAF; SCHEME; DESIGN
AB Vehicular ad hoc network (VANET) routing protocols resort to clustering in order to optimize broadcast traffic flooding. Clustering schemes usually rely on rules which apply to each vehicle in order to reach a targeted organization in a VANET. Most of the literature works which evaluate clustering for VANET focus on performance analysis. However, with autonomous vehicles coming to roadways, more rigorous relationships will be required between clustering rules and the resulting organization, so as to anticipate road safety in a better way. We propose a formal description of the properties which are expected in a VANET, while considering the rules of a given clustering scheme. Using Event-B, we first present a description of the VANET, the vehicles movement and the traffic generated by both routing and application messages. Then, based on an Event-B model of a basic routing protocol of the literature, we describe how the specific rules of a clustering scheme can be modeled along with the properties expected in the resulting organization. Finally, we propose a validation process of the model. This paper aims at showing how our proposals have been applied to the Chain-Branch-Leaf scheme, although they can be adapted to any rule-based clustering scheme for VANET.

AB The underwater networks have severe security implications and are vulnerable to various types of attacks such as selective forwarding, wormhole, and sinkhole. Neighbor discovery, a fundamental requirement for routing is vulnerable to wormhole attack, which enables false neighbor acceptance, thereby degrading the routing performance. The proposed agent-based secured routing scheme enhances the quality of service by discovering the wormhole resilient secure neighbors and route the information through the secure path. This scheme uses 4 agencies, namely, security, routing, underwater gateway, and vehicle, which are embedded with static and mobile agents. (1) Agents in security agency of a node discover secured neighbors by using the direction of arrival estimation and authentication, (2) agents in routing agency of a node establish secured routes from source to surface gateway, (3) agents in Underwater Gateway Agency communicate with Autonomous Underwater Vehicles (AUVs) and underwater nodes for key distribution, and (4) vehicle traversing agency in AUV coordinates with Underwater Gateway Agency for changing AUVs traversal to cover the isolated network area. The proposed scheme depicts the improved performance compared to basic neighbor discovery and channel aware routing protocol in terms of failure detection, energy consumption, and overheads.

AB Featured Application Medium voltage networks that face voltage regulation issues due to high penetration of distributed generation.Abstract This paper makes use of machine learning as a tool for voltage regulation in distribution networks that contain electric vehicles and a large production from distributed generation. The methods of voltage regulation considered in this study are electronic on-load tap changers and line voltage regulators. The analyzed study-case represents a real-life feeder which operates at 10 kV. It has 9 photovoltaic systems with various peak installed powers, 2 electric vehicle charging stations, and 41 secondary substations, each with an equivalent load. Measurement data of loads and irradiation data of photovoltaic systems were collected hourly for two years. Those data are used as inputs in the feeder's model in DigSilent PowerFactory where Quasi-Dynamic simulations are run. That will provide the correct tap positions as outputs. These inputs and outputs will then serve to train a Deep Neural Network which later will be used to predict the correct tap positions on input data it has not seen before. Results show that ML in general and DNN specifically show usefulness and robustness in predicting correct tap positions with very small computational requirements.

AB An important step in automating agricultural field work is to automate the navigation and driving of the agricultural vehicles. We present a nonlinear model predictive control (NMPC)-based path tracking and obstacle avoidance approach for agricultural front-wheel-steered tractors. The prediction model in the NMPC is based on the kinematic model of an Ackermann vehicle and the actuators for speed and steering are modeled as first-order systems without time delay. Both the path tracking and the obstacle avoidance are based on the cost function formulation that penalizes the cross track error (xte) and closeness to the obstacles. Both simulation and real-life experiments were carried out to evaluate the capabilities of the controller. Multiple test cases were used to assess different aspects of the controller behavior. We show that the NMPC achieves a xte of less than 0.05 m on straight sections of the reference path, and is able to avoid simple obstacles, also when multiple obstacles need to be considered at the same time. We also show that the computational cost is feasible for real-time applications on the field, even with a long prediction horizon in the NMPC.

AB Steer-by-wire systems represent a key technology for highly automated and autonomous driving. In this context, robust steering control is a fundamental precondition for automated vehicle lateral control. However, there is a need for improvement due to degrees of freedom, signal delays, and nonlinear characteristics of the plant which are unconsidered in the design models for the design of current steering controls. To be able to design an extremely robust steering control, suitable optimal models of a steer-by-wire system are required. Therefore, this paper presents an innovative nonlinear detail model of a steer-by-wire system. The detail model represents all characteristics of a real steer-by-wire system. In the context of a dominance analysis of the detail model, all dominant characteristics of a steer-by-wire system, including parameter dependencies, are identified. Through model reduction, a reduced model of the steer-by-wire system is then developed that can be used for a subsequent robust control design. Furthermore, this paper compares the steer-by-wire system with a conventional electromechanical power steering and shows similarities as well as differences.

AB In this article a concept is presented for replacing the tractors that haul machinery during necessary operations on peat fields with centrally controlled unmanned ground vehicles (UGVs). The objective is to reduce operational costs in terms of human labour, fuel consumption and the associated CO2 emissions. A robotic system architecture for the example of milled peat extraction has been developed and assessed on the basis of comparative analysis. Depending on the area of the extraction surface, the number of UGVs and the method of extraction, the fuel consumption and labour requirement for one season were determined using a combination of data from production records compiled by peat companies and field measurements using the UGV under assessment. It is demonstrated that utilising currently available robotic technology for milled peat extraction by either the Haku method or the 'vacuum harvester' method can reduce production-related labour requirement by 34-43 % and fuel consumption by 21-26 % with a corresponding reduction of CO2 emissions. Future advances in UGV technology will increase the advantages of robotic technology by reducing the requirements for human intervention as well as by using green energy in fully electric UGVs.

AB Considering bandwidth-hungry and low latency requirement of vehicular communications applications, we propose a novel dynamic reinforcement learning-based slicing framework and optimization solutions for efficient resource provisioning in virtualized network for D2D-based vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) communication. The aim is to balance resource utilization and quality of service (QoS) satisfaction levels for multiple slices. The slicing framework is designed as a three-stage layered framework. In the first stage, we propose dynamic deep reinforcement learning-based virtual resource allocation scheme to allocate distinct resources to slices. In the second stage, we aggregate the D2D resource portion of the slice resource for D2D-based V2V communication. In the third stage, due to the computational complexity and signaling overhead of the physical resource allocation, we transform the problem into a convex optimization problem and solve with an alternating direction method of multipliers-based distributed algorithm. Performance results are provided in terms of resource utilization, QoS satisfaction and throughput to show the benefit of integrating resource slices dedicated to supporting interslice D2D-based V2V communication in vehicular network.

AB In recent years, unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) have been considered an ideal relay platform for enhancing the communication between ground agents, because they fly at high altitudes and are easy to deploy with strong adaptabilities. Their maneuvering allows them to adjust their location to optimize the performance of links, which brings out the relay UAV autonomous mobility control problem. This work addressed the problem in a novel scene with mobile agents and completely unknown wireless channel properties, using only online measured information of received signal strength (RSS) and agent positions. The problem is challenging because of the unknown and dynamic radio frequency (RF) environment cause by agents and UAV maneuvering. We present a framework for both end-to-end communication and multi-agent-inter communication applications, and focus on proposing: (1) least square estimation-based channel approximation with consideration of environment effects and, (2) gradient-based optimal relay position seeking. Simulation results show that considering the environmental effects on channel parameters is meaningful and beneficial in using UAV as relays for the communication of multiple ground agents, and validate that the proposed algorithms optimizes the network performance by controlling the heading of the UAV.

ID SYSTEM
AB For the carrier-based unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), one of the important problems is the design of an automatic carrier landing system (ACLS) that would enable autonomous landing of the UAVs on a moving aircraft carrier. However, the safe autolanding on a moving aircraft is a complex task, mainly because of the deck motion and airwake disturbances, and dimension limitation. In this paper, an innovative ACLS system for carrier-based UAVs is developed, which is composed of the flight deck motion prediction, reference glide slope generation and integrated guidance and control (IGC) modules. The particle filtering method is used to online predict the magnitudes and frequencies of the deck motion, which are used to correct the reference glide slope to achieve minimum dispersion around the ideal touchdown point. An optimal preview control (OPC) scheme is presented for the IGC subsystem design, which fuses the preview information of the reference glide slope, equality constraint of UAV dynamics and performance index function, and predicted information of the carrier deck motion. Simulation results of a nonlinear UAV model show the effectiveness of the ACLS system in carrier autolanding under the deck motion and airwake disturbances. (C) 2018 Elsevier Masson SAS.

AB This paper presents a completely autonomous solution to participate in the Indoor Challenge of the 2013 International Micro Air Vehicle Competition (IMAV 2013). Our proposal is a multi-robot system with no centralized coordination whose robotic agents share their position estimates. The capability of each agent to navigate avoiding collisions is a consequence of the resulting emergent behavior. Each agent consists of a ground station running an instance of the proposed architecture that communicates over WiFi with an AR Drone 2.0 quadrotor. Visual markers are employed to sense and map obstacles and to improve the pose estimation based on Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU) and ground optical flow data. Based on our architecture, each robotic agent can navigate avoiding obstacles and other members of the multi-robot system. The solution is demonstrated and the achieved navigation performance is evaluated by means of experimental flights. This work also analyzes the capabilities of the presented solution in simulated flights of the IMAV 2013 Indoor Challenge. The performance of the CVG UPM team was awarded with the First Prize in the Indoor Autonomy Challenge of the IMAV 2013 competition.
